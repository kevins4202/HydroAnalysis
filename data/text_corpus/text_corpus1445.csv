7225,this study aims at developing an inexact interval valued triangular fuzzy based multi attribute preference model ivtf mapm method for supporting the selection of remediation strategies of groundwater remediation the introduction of interval valued triangular fuzzy parameters into the attributes makes it possible for dealing with multiple uncertainties existing in many real world cases considering more possible values and expressing the decision making information more precisely a attribute system which consists of fifteen remediation alternatives with respect to ten attributes in each period were taken into consideration assessment of the technologies for groundwater remediation the pairwise comparisons between the alternatives were expressed by the valued preference model and the weights of the attributes were scored by interval analytic hierarchy process after the modeling formulation a chlorhydrocarbons contaminated groundwater management system was provided to demonstrate the applicability of the developed method final results showed that a14 a3 a9 and a1 were placed at the top ranking levels for 5 10 15 and 20 years of remediation respectively compared to the results conducted form fmapm and mapm it is indicated that the significant impact of multiple uncertainties existing in the system is specified keywords groundwater remediation multi attribute interval valued triangular fuzzy numbers health risk assessment chlorhydrocarbons contamination 1 introduction in recent decades intensive human activities have caused contamination to groundwater quality which has become a major environmental concern almasri and kaluarachchi 2004 he et al 2012 foppen 2002 kazakis and voudouris 2015 pena haro et al 2011 li et al 2017a lu et al 2017 the increasing contamination hinders sustainable groundwater development and posed significant risks to environmental quality and human health gurdak et al 2017 li et al 2015 islam et al 2016 yang et al 2010 therefore effective remediation techniques of contaminated aquifers and development of appropriate management systems are important for researchers li et al 2014 patrick et al 2014 soga et al 2004 thangjam and dibakar 2010 yadav et al 2016 due to the imprecise and vague information existed in the remediation processes guan and aral 2004 persson and destouni 2009 complexities of subsurface systems would lead to challenges in identifying a reasonable remediation strategy previously compared with optimization method ayvaz 2016 gaur et al 2011 he et al 2008 2009 mategaonkar and eldho 2012 mosmeri et al 2017 raei et al 2017 fan et al 2015 he et al 2009 li et al 2017b multi attribute preference model mapm is more suitable in identify desirable alternatives when discrete multiple conflicting criteria are encountered which has been applied to a broad range of resource management problems huang et al 2011 nazari et al 2012 fessi et al 2014 wang and chen 2017 ren et al 2016 however because of the inherent natural heterogeneity many imprecise information often stems from uncertain hydrogeological parameters e g intrinsic permeability soil porosity migration velocity nonaqueous phase liquid saturation and so on in groundwater management problems refsgaard et al 2012 there have been some mapm application integrated with fuzzy set to address the uncertainty information for instance promentilla et al 2008 proposed a fuzzy analytic network process for multi attribute evaluation of contaminated site remedial countermeasures wherein triangular fuzzy numbers and their degree of fuzziness are used in the semantic scale li et al 2010 a fuzzy set approach based on the questionnaire survey results to address the various uncertainty issues in remedial alternative assessment process polat et al 2015 develop an alternative remedial priority ranking system for contaminated sites in which vagueness in parameter values is considered yang et al 2012b developed a simulation based fuzzy multi attribute preference model sfmapm method for supporting the selection of remediation strategies for petroleum contaminated sites an et al 2016 developed a novel mcdm method with the logarithmic fuzzy preference programming for sustainability assessment of the technologies for groundwater remediation however the abovementioned method would be restricted if the uncertainties could not be addressed by traditional fuzzy sets in some actual decision making process many parameters can hardly be expressed as conventional fuzzy sets due to the existence of multiple uncertainties alizadeh et al 2017 kabir et al 2014 uddameri et al 2014 it is difficult to determine the precise values for lower and upper bounds of triangular fuzzy number if the parameters range is relatively easy to determine then defining the lower and upper bounds values as an interval is more appropriate for decision makers in response to this concern the interval valued triangular fuzzy ivtf set theory that is capable of standing out the maximum likelihood value considering more parameter information i e more possible values and expressing the decision making information more precisely is introduced karmakar and mujumdar 2006 vahdani et al 2010 asiain et al 2017 for example a health risk level is calculated as an interval valued triangular fuzzy number 1 047 10 4 1 176 10 4 1 561 10 4 1 906 10 4 1 976 10 4 which means that this attribute is an interval fuzzy set of about 1 561 10 4 the interval lower bound for 1 561 10 4 is between 1 047 10 4 and 1 176 10 4 and the interval upper bound is in a range of 1 906 10 4 and 1 976 10 4 for this type of information the traditional methods can neither reflect its multiple uncertainty feature nor entirely pass it to the resulting decisions there is a challenge that how to use an appropriate mapm method to deal with information which could reflect multiple uncertainty information effectively because traditional methods generally use their average or the most likely values as the modeling inputs it is necessary to development of a sophisticated mapm method in order to consider not only their mid value but also lower and upper bound values thus this study aims to develop an inexact interval valued triangular fuzzy based multi attributes preference model ivtf mapm method for assessment of technologies of groundwater remediation more parameter information i e more possible values implied in the interval of the parameter values are accommodated in the method compared with the traditional ones that only take one value for computation the concept of interval valued triangular fuzzy set will be introduced to represent multi uncertain information of carcinogenic health risk level and the information on attribute weights expressed in interval numbers after the modeling formulation a chlorhydrocarbons contaminated site will be provided for demonstrating its applicability and advantages of the ivtf mapm approach 2 methodology fig 1 shows the flowchart of the proposed ivtf mapm method for decision making the approach involves three steps evaluation criteria establishment model development and decision analysis firstly proceed site characterization to understand the site properties identify contamination plume and sources and determine modeling parameters i e pumping rate for each well total cost and interval valued triangular fuzzy carcinogenic risk level secondly conduct ivtf mapm model to rank various alternatives where the obtained parameters would serve as uncertain inputs for this evaluation thirdly in terms of the ranking orders obtained from running the ivtf mapm model identify and further analysis the most desirable remediation strategies under different periods in this study the sources of uncertainties really come from the hydrogeological parameters i e porosity and the associated predicted concentrations the detail regarding the ivtf mapm method is shown in the following sections 2 1 simulation model in this study a two dimensional finite difference model is used to simulate organic contaminants transport processes in groundwater due to the processes of advection dispersion and biodegradation the mass transport equations are solved to calculate the spatial variation of the contaminant concentration the model solves the transport equation to determine the fate and transport of the hydrocarbons and the electron acceptors reaction by products the general equations are as follows borden and bedient 1986 yang et al 2012a 1 b h t 1 r h x i bd ij h x j

domain and γ1 is the first boundary condition the parameters used in the hypothetical simulation system are given in table 1 the aquifer system of the site is phreatic aquifer which is below the unsaturated zone the boundary condition is assumed to be fixed head boundary the saturated thickness of aquifer is 10 feet the total depth of the soil layers is 3 048 m vertically the simulation domain was divided into two layers i e silty clay and gravel clay with each one being 1 524 m thick as shown in fig 2 horizontally each layer was discretized into 10 10 grid blocks with each one having dimensions of 30 480 and 30 480 m in this study the simulation model assumes homogeneous hydraulic conductivity across the entire area the hydraulic conductivity of the saturated zone is 9 140 10 5 m s the direction of the groundwater flow is from northwest to southeast since the most serious plume in groundwater was mainly detected in the saturated zone the design effort was merely based on the simulation results for this zone only the uncertainty in porosity was focused on because our previous site survey and simulation results showed that porosity has much higher impacts on the contaminant concentrations than other ones then the simulated concentration at each monitoring well was calculated under 50 random porosities which were generated in the range of 0 1750 and 0 2250 in this case the aquifer was assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic in terms of the previous site investigation results and porosity and the other parameters were fixed to a constant value in the whole domain during each simulation 2 2 interval valued fuzzy sets interval valued triangular fuzzy ivtf number that define lower and upper bounds of triangular fuzzy number as an interval can not only consider more parameter information i e more possible values but also express the decision making information more precisely for example excess lifetime cancer risk elcr is expressed in interval

when elcr a elcr a and elcr c elcr c elcr becomes a conventional triangular fuzzy numbers the binary operations between two ivtf numbers elcr 1 and elcr 2 are listed as follows 8 elcr 1 elcr 2 elcr 1

fuzzy modified mapm method the detailed operation process of the ivtf mapm approach which is used for investigating the impact of uncertainties and multi attributes performances on rankings can be summarized as follows step 1 let ac ac ij n m be a fuzzy decision matrix for the multi attributes preference model in which at1 ati atn are n possible groundwater remediation alternatives and ct1 ctj ctm are m attributes during t remediation period the performance of alternative ati with respect to attribute ctj is denoted as actij in order to select the most desirable remediation action the decision maker takes into account ten attributes which can be classified into the following three categories 1 dtpr is the daily total pumping rate of eight injection extraction well in the remediation system during t period m3 d 2 tc is the total cost for the groundwater remediation 103 over the full duration including well installation and operation costs i e the cost of extraction and injection dtpr and tc are related to the number of wells and they have the same preference trend during the calculation but the preference degree value for each alternative on dtpr or tc is different thus they have different contributions on positive outranking flow score negative outranking flow score and net flow that are related to the decision results i e ranking orders therefore dtpr and tc were regarded as two attributes 3 elcr is used to assess carcinogenic risk in eight monitoring wells which represents the amount of people who will have cancer when expose to cancer driven pollutants kentel and aral 2007 fan et al 2014 16 elcr sf cdi sf cw ir ef ed at bw where sf is a carcinogen slope factor i e 0 0057 kg day mg cdi is the chronic daily intake mg kg day cw is pollutant concentration in groundwater mg l ir is rate of ingestion i e 2 l day for adult ef is frequency of exposure i e 200 days year ed is duration of exposure i e 30 years for chlorohydrocarbon at is averaged exposure time i e 365 ed days bw is average body weight i e 53 1 kg step 2 normalise the decision matrix using the following equation the attributes divide into beneficial attributes larger the better type and non beneficial attributes small the better type in this study dtpr tc and elcr are non beneficial attributes i e lower values are desired the normalized values nactij denote the normalized decision matrix nac which represents the relative performance of the generated design alternatives in the following equation 17 nac tij 1 ac tij i 1 n 1 ac tij 18 ac tij ac a tij ac a tij

determine the relative importance of the attributes concerning the overall goal in a multi attributes problem i e weights w wt1 wtj wtm associated with c ct1 ctj ctm madani and lund 2011 sener and davraz 2013 rahmati et al 2016 based on a comparison scale of nine levels the elements in the same level are compared pairwise the consistency ratio of the pair wise comparison matrix need to be less than allowed consistency ratio value of 0 1 thus the weights can be consistent and used in the decision process w tj w tj w tj is defined as an interval with known lower w tj and upper bounds w tj but unknown distribution information step 4 determine the difference d actij acti j between the evaluations of actij and acti j on each attribute ctj and calculate preference function p actij acti j where these differences could be mapped to values between 0 and 1 0 for no preference and 1 for strict preference the greater this value the higher the preference of actij over acti j on ctj it can be obtained by using the six different types i e usual u shape v shape level linear and gaussian defined by brans and vincke by consultation sine preference function was suggested to be used 21 p ac tij

by aggregating all the attributes preference degrees p actij acti j using the weighted sum for two arbitrary alternatives this index shows the complete preference of an alternative ati to another one ati respecting all attributes 27 π a ti a ti j 1 m p ac tij ac ti j w tk p ac ti 1 ac ti 1 w t 1 p ac tij ac ti j w tj p ac ti 1 ac ti 1 w t 1 w t 1 p ac tij ac ti j w tj w tj 28 π a ti a ti j 1 m p

ϕ a ti ϕ a ti is the degree that measures how ati outranks all the other actions on all attributes the higher its value the better ati ϕ a ti is the degree that measures how ati is outranked by all the other actions on all attributes the lower its value the better ati 29 ϕ a ti i 1 n π a ti a ti i 1 n p a ti 1 a ti 1 w t 1 p ac ti j ac tij w tj i 1 n p a ti 1 a ti 1 w t 1 w t 1 p ac ti j ac tij

best to the worst can be obtained by ranking the values of ϕ a ti from the maximum to the minimum if ϕ a ti is greater than alternative ati is better than alternative ati ati has the preferential

ti max 1 max ϕ a ti ϕ a ti ϕ a ti ϕ a ti ϕ a ti ϕ a ti 0 0 33 rank a ti 1 n n 1 i 1 n pd ii n 2 1 thus the interval ϕ a ti can be ranked in descending order in accordance with the value the higher the value of rank a ti the better is the alternative thus the best alternative is the one having the highest rank a ti value 2 4 study site the developed model is applied to a 1 1 1 trichloroethylene 1 1 1 tca contaminated aquifer located in the eastern area of china it was observed that the chlorohydrocarbon has migrated into the groundwater and contaminated the soil inside and around the site although the concerned contaminants in groundwater flow were chlorohydrocarbon series i e 1 1 dichloroethane 1 1 dca chloroethane ca 1 1 dichloroethylene dce and chloroethylene vc the concentration of 1 1 dca approximately 50 mg l in groundwater was significantly higher than the guideline issued by environmental protection department for guidelines for technical guidelines for risk assessment of contaminated sites therefore only 1 1 dca was the only contaminant considered in this decision analysis during the groundwater remediation process to clean up the 1 1 dca contaminants a total of 2 injection 4 extraction wells and 8 monitoring wells were recommended to investigate the concentration of 1 1 dca series the design of the remediation wells was shown in fig 3 to investigate the effect of duration on remediation performance four different duration times i e 5 10 15 and 20 years representing short term short to medium term medium to long term and long term scenarios were considered in this study 3 results 3 1 result analysis the maximum pumping rate at extraction wells was determined as 1 699 10 4 m3 s and at injection wells is as 5 663 10 4 m3 s during the 5 and 10 year period for options of longer durations the pumping rates would be lower because of the natural attenuation process thus the maximum pumping rates at injection wells were decreased as 2 832 10 4 m3 s and at the extraction wells was the same when the pumping duration is 15 or 20 years fifteen remediation alternatives whose pumping rates within limits were generated randomly by using the monte carlo sampling technique were designed for the contaminated site under each remediation duration the contaminant concentrations were simulated under 50 different random porosities ranging from 0 1750 to 0 2250 for the contaminant concentration at each monitoring well the minimum the fifth the average the forty sixth and the maximum comprised the interval valued triangular fuzzy concentrations in terms of the order from small to large ten attributes i e dtpr tc and ivtf elcr at eight monitoring wells were used for illustrating the proposed ivtf mapm including both economic and environmental factors finally alternatives were ranked in terms of the ivtf mapm the alternative with the highest value is deemed the most desirable groundwater remediation strategy 3 1 1 5 year remediation the performance of groundwater remediation strategies on quantitative attributes under a duration time of 5 years is presented in table a 1 in the supplementary material the pairwise comparison matrix was formed by the decision making team and the attributes to be used in evaluation process were assigned interval weights by using interval ahp method as shown in table 2 the weight of elcr4 is estimated to be within an interval of 0 254 0 275 and higher than other evaluation attributes which is determined as the most important attributes in this groundwater remediation selection process fig 4 presents the lower and upper bounds of the performance for the best remediation strategy and the worst remediation strategy under different remediation periods as can be seen from fig 4 and table 3 a14 is the most preferred alternative followed closely by a9 while a4 is the least preferred according to performance on both quantitative and qualitative attributes as shown in fig 5 the optimal pumping rates at six wells are 0 612 0 917 0 408 0 306 0 306 and 0 510 m3 h respectively under 5 year remediation periods in this situation i2 has higher pumping rates than i1 and plays an important role in the injecting section e4 takes the largest pumping rate of the extracting section and plays the most significant role with full operation this means that most of the clean water would be injected into well i2 and most of the contaminated groundwater would be extracted from well e4 for the worst remediation strategy a4 the extracting rates of wells e1 and e4 are the assistant with a14 the pumping rate of i1 is treble as big as that for a14 the pumping rates of i2 is one third of that for a14 results from the case study indicated that the different pumping rates for each well that has varied contribution to groundwater remediation lead to different remediation results fig 6 presents the dtpr and tc for the most preferred alternative and the least preferred alternative according to performance on quantitative attributes under different remediation periods when the duration is 5 years both dtpr i e 73 397 m3 d and tc i e 54 175 103 for a14 are lower than that for a4 this means that when the duration is shorter an increased amount of contaminant should be extracted from the groundwater to assure that the concentrations are lower than the regulated standard thus a large daily total pumping rates and remediation cost are unavoidable to decrease the potential chance of health risk violation fig 7 presents the simulated elcr levels among the entire contaminated area for the most preferred alternative and the least preferred alternative after each year of remediation the risk level is higher in the center than the edge and gradually decreases toward the outer region for a14 the average elcr levels at wells m4 i e 3 141 10 4 is relatively higher than at other wells therefore when stringent elcr attributes were adopted the concentration around m4 need to be paid great attention the major and extremely significant difference between a14 and a4 is that the average elcr level at wells m5 for a14 is much less than that for a4 i e 1 576 10 5 versus 3 500 10 4 this indicates that injection extraction well locations have complicated comprehensive influence on contaminant degradation and health risk distribution 3 1 2 10 year remediation the input data i e performance of groundwater remediation strategies on ten quantitative attributes and weights of attributes are listed tables a 2 and 1 when the evaluation of remediation strategies is carried out elcr5 has the highest weight i e within the interval of 0 227 0 263 and is the most relevant remediation attributes on the contrary elcr8 has less importance than other attributes in the remediation alternatives evaluation as it is clearly seen from fig 4 and table 2 a3 has the highest value of φ showing that the degree of a3 dominating the other alternatives is remarkable thus a3 is listed as the number one option among all alternatives for granted when the remediation period is extended to 10 years well i1 have most significant contributions to the injection operation and the extraction rate at e2 is larger than that at the other 3 wells and thus these 2 wells have more significant contribution to the remediation practice fig 5 since the dtpr and tc for the most preferred alternative under 5 duration are less than that under 10 year duration fig 6 and elcr levels in each monitoring well could satisfy the environmental requirements thus the 5 year duration would be more desirable than the 10 year one due to the shorter remediation duration fig 7 3 1 3 15 year remediation the rankings are provided from best to worst among alternatives when the duration is 15 years table a 3 obviously the remediation strategy a9 is deemed the best option with a lower daily total pumping rates a lower remediation cost and a lower risk of environmental impact compared to the best actions under the short term and short to medium term durations i e 5 and 10 years the dtpr under 15 years of durations is reduced by up to 26 7 31 3 due to the process of natural attenuation fig 6 when the most desirable i e a9 and the least desirable alternatives i e a13 are taken after 15 years of remediation the dtpr and tc are the same i e 53 824 m3 d and 105 864 103 the average peak elcr level of 1 1 dca is approximately 2 250 10 4 for a9 and 3 561 10 4 for a13 it is indicated that the pumping rates at various remediation wells play a crucial role on contaminants removing efficiency 3 1 4 20 year remediation long remediation periods would generate the highest daily total pumping rates and operating cost table a 4 thus the weights of dtpr and tc increase within the interval 0 167 0 206 and 0 242 0 258 according to the requirements and preferences of the decision maker respectively the overall ratings of alternatives indicates a1 is identifies as the desired remediation option for the study site a5 is the most expensive alternative and it is deemed the worst option for the study site remediation compare with the dtpr during 5 and 10 year management they are decreased when the remediation period increases as 10 years or 15 years this is because nature attenuation of contaminants played an important role with long remediation periods the average elcr level at wells m2 m7 for a1 is between 3 27 10 5 and 2 075 10 4 and for a5 would reach up to 2 498 10 4 to 4 297 10 4 m5 is particularly sensitive to this remediation periods and should be monitored to avoid exceeding the set concentration in practice 3 2 comparisons 3 2 1 comparison of the four remediation periods in terms of ivtf mapm table 3 presents the ranking results of the actions under four remediation scenarios in terms of ivtf mapm according the ranking results it can be obtained that the groundwater remediation strategies in each period are quite different due to the varied attributes and weights the total preference ability of the alternative with the highest the value of rank a ti over the other actions is remarkable the alternative with the lowest the value of rank a ti means that this action has the lowest attractiveness than other alternatives overall as increasing the time of exposure and natural attenuation dtpr is already on a declining trend tc is on a good upward curve contaminant concentration around contamination source are not the highest with the operation of injection and extraction wells and degradation in groundwater health risks still higher and need be paid more attention during the whole remediation process from the results of the best remediation strategies and the worst remediation strategies it can been concluded that a lower pumping rate does not always mean a poor remediation effect such as a14 and a4 under a duration time of 5 years 3 2 2 comparison between ivtf mapm fmapm and mapm fuzzy elcr felcr were introduced into fuzzy multi attribute preference model fmapm where the minimum and maximum elcr under 50 different random porosities were considered as the lower and upper value of the support of felcr respectively and the average was the core of felcr the mean values for ten evaluation attributes were input into the traditional mapm models the rank orders of fifteen alternatives in each remediation that assessed by ivtf mapm fmapm and mapm methods are not completely equivalent for 5 10 15 and 20 years of remediation a14 a3 a9 and a1 are the best actions respectively in terms of ivtf mapm a14 a2 a3 and a1 in terms of fmapm table a 5 a9 a2 a3 and a1 in terms of mapm table a 6 expected for 20 durations the worst actions in other periods are totally the exact same for different methods it is possible that the simulation outputs vary significantly because different shapes of distributions e g interval valued triangular fuzzy value fuzzy value and certain number were used leading to different ranking results in the comparison interval valued triangular fuzzy set fuzzy set and deterministic data were input to ivtf mapm fmapm and traditional mapm respectively results showed that the ranking orders vary significantly with types of data inpdacuts despite the discrepancy in the ranking orders the strategy derived from ivtf mapm could be more tolerable by the decision maker because it was obtained based on increased data information ivtf which accommodates the hybrid of fuzzy sets and interval numbers therefore the robustness of eventual decision making results may be significantly less influenced than conventional algorithms wherein the uncertain problems are over simplified 3 3 weight and its influence table 2 presents the interval pairwise comparison matrix between every two attributes and interval weight for each attribute during four remediation periods overall the weight of dtpr and tc is keep increasing which means that this two attributes are relatively more important than others with the increasing the time of exposure and the natural attenuation because the peak health risk occur generally at downstream of contamination sources after a period of remediation the weight of elcr4 suffers the greatest decline generally the weights are the important attribute during the management process that would influence the ranking results the ranking results of the alternatives are various under the different weights of attributes in the actual decision making process the weights of attributes are closely related to the performance of different experts stakeholders thus the weights of evaluation attributes should be carefully selected in the decision making process 4 conclusions decision making on the most desirable technologies for groundwater remediation for the decision makers is based on economy feasibility and technology effectiveness the traditional fmapm methodology has been widely used to support these decisions whereas it present some limits such as difficulty in assessment uncertain parameters hardly be expressed as conventional fuzzy sets due to the existence of multiple uncertainties in this paper an improved version ivtf mapm methodology based on interval valued triangular fuzzy theory and mapm is presented in the case study fifteen technologies with respect to ten attributes under four remediation periods for groundwater remediation have been studied interval ahp for weights calculation and the determination of the priorities of the alternatives has been quantified at the end it was possible to determine a sequence of the different alternative scenarios and the best options the predicted remediation alternative with respect to different evaluation attributes and weights varies considerably under different durations scenarios for 5 10 15 and 20 years of remediation a14 a3 a9 and a1 are the best actions respectively in terms of ivtf mapm the interval weights for the decision making process have important factors that could influence the ranking results under uncertain environment well location is the predominant factor determining the contribution of wells to remediation effects for the most desirable alternatives the injecting rate at injection well i1 is higher than at well i2 during short remediation periods with the increasing time well i1 was the most important in injecting clean water though nature attenuation of contaminants plays a part in scenarios with long remediation periods the area between well m3 and m4 still has a relatively high risk assessment performance compared to the existing study efforts the proposed ivtf mapm approach has the potential to be extended to other regions with similar different conditions aquifer and contaminants however only the uncertainty of porosity were focused on in this study it is well known uncertainties mainly stem from temporal and spatial variations in hydrogeological parameters resulting from incomplete or inaccurate information thus in depth efforts could be further undertaken and more sophisticated methods that accommodate more information need to be developed advanced when high demands of decision makers are imposed under such circumstance the efficiency and robustness of the proposed mapm approach would be enhanced moreover more mapm methods could be developed for selecting discrete alternatives and identifying desirable alternatives when multiple conflicting attributes under uncertainty are encountered besides the pump and treat system could be extended to other remediation processes in many practical groundwater management problems

7225,this study aims at developing an inexact interval valued triangular fuzzy based multi attribute preference model ivtf mapm method for supporting the selection of remediation strategies of groundwater remediation the introduction of interval valued triangular fuzzy parameters into the attributes makes it possible for dealing with multiple uncertainties existing in many real world cases considering more possible values and expressing the decision making information more precisely a attribute system which consists of fifteen remediation alternatives with respect to ten attributes in each period were taken into consideration assessment of the technologies for groundwater remediation the pairwise comparisons between the alternatives were expressed by the valued preference model and the weights of the attributes were scored by interval analytic hierarchy process after the modeling formulation a chlorhydrocarbons contaminated groundwater management system was provided to demonstrate the applicability of the developed method final results showed that a14 a3 a9 and a1 were placed at the top ranking levels for 5 10 15 and 20 years of remediation respectively compared to the results conducted form fmapm and mapm it is indicated that the significant impact of multiple uncertainties existing in the system is specified keywords groundwater remediation multi attribute interval valued triangular fuzzy numbers health risk assessment chlorhydrocarbons contamination 1 introduction in recent decades intensive human activities have caused contamination to groundwater quality which has become a major environmental concern almasri and kaluarachchi 2004 he et al 2012 foppen 2002 kazakis and voudouris 2015 pena haro et al 2011 li et al 2017a lu et al 2017 the increasing contamination hinders sustainable groundwater development and posed significant risks to environmental quality and human health gurdak et al 2017 li et al 2015 islam et al 2016 yang et al 2010 therefore effective remediation techniques of contaminated aquifers and development of appropriate management systems are important for researchers li et al 2014 patrick et al 2014 soga et al 2004 thangjam and dibakar 2010 yadav et al 2016 due to the imprecise and vague information existed in the remediation processes guan and aral 2004 persson and destouni 2009 complexities of subsurface systems would lead to challenges in identifying a reasonable remediation strategy previously compared with optimization method ayvaz 2016 gaur et al 2011 he et al 2008 2009 mategaonkar and eldho 2012 mosmeri et al 2017 raei et al 2017 fan et al 2015 he et al 2009 li et al 2017b multi attribute preference model mapm is more suitable in identify desirable alternatives when discrete multiple conflicting criteria are encountered which has been applied to a broad range of resource management problems huang et al 2011 nazari et al 2012 fessi et al 2014 wang and chen 2017 ren et al 2016 however because of the inherent natural heterogeneity many imprecise information often stems from uncertain hydrogeological parameters e g intrinsic permeability soil porosity migration velocity nonaqueous phase liquid saturation and so on in groundwater management problems refsgaard et al 2012 there have been some mapm application integrated with fuzzy set to address the uncertainty information for instance promentilla et al 2008 proposed a fuzzy analytic network process for multi attribute evaluation of contaminated site remedial countermeasures wherein triangular fuzzy numbers and their degree of fuzziness are used in the semantic scale li et al 2010 a fuzzy set approach based on the questionnaire survey results to address the various uncertainty issues in remedial alternative assessment process polat et al 2015 develop an alternative remedial priority ranking system for contaminated sites in which vagueness in parameter values is considered yang et al 2012b developed a simulation based fuzzy multi attribute preference model sfmapm method for supporting the selection of remediation strategies for petroleum contaminated sites an et al 2016 developed a novel mcdm method with the logarithmic fuzzy preference programming for sustainability assessment of the technologies for groundwater remediation however the abovementioned method would be restricted if the uncertainties could not be addressed by traditional fuzzy sets in some actual decision making process many parameters can hardly be expressed as conventional fuzzy sets due to the existence of multiple uncertainties alizadeh et al 2017 kabir et al 2014 uddameri et al 2014 it is difficult to determine the precise values for lower and upper bounds of triangular fuzzy number if the parameters range is relatively easy to determine then defining the lower and upper bounds values as an interval is more appropriate for decision makers in response to this concern the interval valued triangular fuzzy ivtf set theory that is capable of standing out the maximum likelihood value considering more parameter information i e more possible values and expressing the decision making information more precisely is introduced karmakar and mujumdar 2006 vahdani et al 2010 asiain et al 2017 for example a health risk level is calculated as an interval valued triangular fuzzy number 1 047 10 4 1 176 10 4 1 561 10 4 1 906 10 4 1 976 10 4 which means that this attribute is an interval fuzzy set of about 1 561 10 4 the interval lower bound for 1 561 10 4 is between 1 047 10 4 and 1 176 10 4 and the interval upper bound is in a range of 1 906 10 4 and 1 976 10 4 for this type of information the traditional methods can neither reflect its multiple uncertainty feature nor entirely pass it to the resulting decisions there is a challenge that how to use an appropriate mapm method to deal with information which could reflect multiple uncertainty information effectively because traditional methods generally use their average or the most likely values as the modeling inputs it is necessary to development of a sophisticated mapm method in order to consider not only their mid value but also lower and upper bound values thus this study aims to develop an inexact interval valued triangular fuzzy based multi attributes preference model ivtf mapm method for assessment of technologies of groundwater remediation more parameter information i e more possible values implied in the interval of the parameter values are accommodated in the method compared with the traditional ones that only take one value for computation the concept of interval valued triangular fuzzy set will be introduced to represent multi uncertain information of carcinogenic health risk level and the information on attribute weights expressed in interval numbers after the modeling formulation a chlorhydrocarbons contaminated site will be provided for demonstrating its applicability and advantages of the ivtf mapm approach 2 methodology fig 1 shows the flowchart of the proposed ivtf mapm method for decision making the approach involves three steps evaluation criteria establishment model development and decision analysis firstly proceed site characterization to understand the site properties identify contamination plume and sources and determine modeling parameters i e pumping rate for each well total cost and interval valued triangular fuzzy carcinogenic risk level secondly conduct ivtf mapm model to rank various alternatives where the obtained parameters would serve as uncertain inputs for this evaluation thirdly in terms of the ranking orders obtained from running the ivtf mapm model identify and further analysis the most desirable remediation strategies under different periods in this study the sources of uncertainties really come from the hydrogeological parameters i e porosity and the associated predicted concentrations the detail regarding the ivtf mapm method is shown in the following sections 2 1 simulation model in this study a two dimensional finite difference model is used to simulate organic contaminants transport processes in groundwater due to the processes of advection dispersion and biodegradation the mass transport equations are solved to calculate the spatial variation of the contaminant concentration the model solves the transport equation to determine the fate and transport of the hydrocarbons and the electron acceptors reaction by products the general equations are as follows borden and bedient 1986 yang et al 2012a 1 b h t 1 r h x i bd ij h x j

domain and γ1 is the first boundary condition the parameters used in the hypothetical simulation system are given in table 1 the aquifer system of the site is phreatic aquifer which is below the unsaturated zone the boundary condition is assumed to be fixed head boundary the saturated thickness of aquifer is 10 feet the total depth of the soil layers is 3 048 m vertically the simulation domain was divided into two layers i e silty clay and gravel clay with each one being 1 524 m thick as shown in fig 2 horizontally each layer was discretized into 10 10 grid blocks with each one having dimensions of 30 480 and 30 480 m in this study the simulation model assumes homogeneous hydraulic conductivity across the entire area the hydraulic conductivity of the saturated zone is 9 140 10 5 m s the direction of the groundwater flow is from northwest to southeast since the most serious plume in groundwater was mainly detected in the saturated zone the design effort was merely based on the simulation results for this zone only the uncertainty in porosity was focused on because our previous site survey and simulation results showed that porosity has much higher impacts on the contaminant concentrations than other ones then the simulated concentration at each monitoring well was calculated under 50 random porosities which were generated in the range of 0 1750 and 0 2250 in this case the aquifer was assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic in terms of the previous site investigation results and porosity and the other parameters were fixed to a constant value in the whole domain during each simulation 2 2 interval valued fuzzy sets interval valued triangular fuzzy ivtf number that define lower and upper bounds of triangular fuzzy number as an interval can not only consider more parameter information i e more possible values but also express the decision making information more precisely for example excess lifetime cancer risk elcr is expressed in interval

fuzzy modified mapm method the detailed operation process of the ivtf mapm approach which is used for investigating the impact of uncertainties and multi attributes performances on rankings can be summarized as follows step 1 let ac ac ij n m be a fuzzy decision matrix for the multi attributes preference model in which at1 ati atn are n possible groundwater remediation alternatives and ct1 ctj ctm are m attributes during t remediation period the performance of alternative ati with respect to attribute ctj is denoted as actij in order to select the most desirable remediation action the decision maker takes into account ten attributes which can be classified into the following three categories 1 dtpr is the daily total pumping rate of eight injection extraction well in the remediation system during t period m3 d 2 tc is the total cost for the groundwater remediation 103 over the full duration including well installation and operation costs i e the cost of extraction and injection dtpr and tc are related to the number of wells and they have the same preference trend during the calculation but the preference degree value for each alternative on dtpr or tc is different thus they have different contributions on positive outranking flow score negative outranking flow score and net flow that are related to the decision results i e ranking orders therefore dtpr and tc were regarded as two attributes 3 elcr is used to assess carcinogenic risk in eight monitoring wells which represents the amount of people who will have cancer when expose to cancer driven pollutants kentel and aral 2007 fan et al 2014 16 elcr sf cdi sf cw ir ef ed at bw where sf is a carcinogen slope factor i e 0 0057 kg day mg cdi is the chronic daily intake mg kg day cw is pollutant concentration in groundwater mg l ir is rate of ingestion i e 2 l day for adult ef is frequency of exposure i e 200 days year ed is duration of exposure i e 30 years for chlorohydrocarbon at is averaged exposure time i e 365 ed days bw is average body weight i e 53 1 kg step 2 normalise the decision matrix using the following equation the attributes divide into beneficial attributes larger the better type and non beneficial attributes small the better type in this study dtpr tc and elcr are non beneficial attributes i e lower values are desired the normalized values nactij denote the normalized decision matrix nac which represents the relative performance of the generated design alternatives in the following equation 17 nac tij 1 ac tij i 1 n 1 ac tij 18 ac tij ac a tij ac a tij

determine the relative importance of the attributes concerning the overall goal in a multi attributes problem i e weights w wt1 wtj wtm associated with c ct1 ctj ctm madani and lund 2011 sener and davraz 2013 rahmati et al 2016 based on a comparison scale of nine levels the elements in the same level are compared pairwise the consistency ratio of the pair wise comparison matrix need to be less than allowed consistency ratio value of 0 1 thus the weights can be consistent and used in the decision process w tj w tj w tj is defined as an interval with known lower w tj and upper bounds w tj but unknown distribution information step 4 determine the difference d actij acti j between the evaluations of actij and acti j on each attribute ctj and calculate preference function p actij acti j where these differences could be mapped to values between 0 and 1 0 for no preference and 1 for strict preference the greater this value the higher the preference of actij over acti j on ctj it can be obtained by using the six different types i e usual u shape v shape level linear and gaussian defined by brans and vincke by consultation sine preference function was suggested to be used 21 p ac tij

by aggregating all the attributes preference degrees p actij acti j using the weighted sum for two arbitrary alternatives this index shows the complete preference of an alternative ati to another one

ϕ a ti ϕ a ti is the degree that measures how ati outranks all the other actions on all attributes the higher its value the better ati ϕ a ti is the degree that measures how ati is outranked by all the other actions on all attributes the lower its value the better ati 29 ϕ a ti i 1 n π a ti a ti i 1 n p a ti 1 a ti 1 w t 1 p ac ti j ac tij w tj i 1 n p a ti 1 a ti 1 w t 1 w t 1 p ac ti j ac tij

best to the worst can be obtained by ranking the values of ϕ a ti from the maximum to the minimum if ϕ a ti is greater than alternative ati is better than alternative ati ati has the preferential

value of rank a ti the better is the alternative thus the best alternative is the one having the highest rank a ti value 2 4 study site the developed model is applied to a 1 1 1 trichloroethylene 1 1 1 tca contaminated aquifer located in the eastern area of china it was observed that the chlorohydrocarbon has migrated into the groundwater and contaminated the soil inside and around the site although the concerned contaminants in groundwater flow were chlorohydrocarbon series i e 1 1 dichloroethane 1 1 dca chloroethane ca 1 1 dichloroethylene dce and chloroethylene vc the concentration of 1 1 dca approximately 50 mg l in groundwater was significantly higher than the guideline issued by environmental protection department for guidelines for technical guidelines for risk assessment of contaminated sites therefore only 1 1 dca was the only contaminant considered in this decision analysis during the groundwater remediation process to clean up the 1 1 dca contaminants a total of 2 injection 4 extraction wells and 8 monitoring wells were recommended to investigate the concentration of 1 1 dca series the design of the remediation wells was shown in fig 3 to investigate the effect of duration on remediation performance four different duration times i e 5 10 15 and 20 years representing short term short to medium term medium to long term and long term scenarios were considered in this study 3 results 3 1 result analysis the maximum pumping rate at extraction wells was determined as 1 699 10 4 m3 s and at injection wells is as 5 663 10 4 m3 s during the 5 and 10 year period for options of longer durations the pumping rates would be lower because of the natural attenuation process thus the maximum pumping rates at injection wells were decreased as 2 832 10 4 m3 s and at the extraction wells was the same when the pumping duration is 15 or 20 years fifteen remediation alternatives whose pumping rates within limits were generated randomly by using the monte carlo sampling technique were designed for the contaminated site under each remediation duration the contaminant concentrations were simulated under 50 different random porosities ranging from 0 1750 to 0 2250 for the contaminant concentration at each monitoring well the minimum the fifth the average the forty sixth and the maximum comprised the interval valued triangular fuzzy concentrations in terms of the order from small to large ten attributes i e dtpr tc and ivtf elcr at eight monitoring wells were used for illustrating the proposed ivtf mapm including both economic and environmental factors finally alternatives were ranked in terms of the ivtf mapm the alternative with the highest value is deemed the most desirable groundwater remediation strategy 3 1 1 5 year remediation the performance of groundwater remediation strategies on quantitative attributes under a duration time of 5 years is presented in table a 1 in the supplementary material the pairwise comparison matrix was formed by the decision making team and the attributes to be used in evaluation process were assigned interval weights by using interval ahp method as shown in table 2 the weight of elcr4 is estimated to be within an interval of 0 254 0 275 and higher than other evaluation attributes which is determined as the most important attributes in this groundwater remediation selection process fig 4 presents the lower and upper bounds of the performance for the best remediation strategy and the worst remediation strategy under different remediation periods as can be seen from fig 4 and table 3 a14 is the most preferred alternative followed closely by a9 while a4 is the least preferred according to performance on both quantitative and qualitative attributes as shown in fig 5 the optimal pumping rates at six wells are 0 612 0 917 0 408 0 306 0 306 and 0 510 m3 h respectively under 5 year remediation periods in this situation i2 has higher pumping rates than i1 and plays an important role in the injecting section e4 takes the largest pumping rate of the extracting section and plays the most significant role with full operation this means that most of the clean water would be injected into well i2 and most of the contaminated groundwater would be extracted from well e4 for the worst remediation strategy a4 the extracting rates of wells e1 and e4 are the assistant with a14 the pumping rate of i1 is treble as big as that for a14 the pumping rates of i2 is one third of that for a14 results from the case study indicated that the different pumping rates for each well that has varied contribution to groundwater remediation lead to different remediation results fig 6 presents the dtpr and tc for the most preferred alternative and the least preferred alternative according to performance on quantitative attributes under different remediation periods when the duration is 5 years both dtpr i e 73 397 m3 d and tc i e 54 175 103 for a14 are lower than that for a4 this means that when the duration is shorter an increased amount of contaminant should be extracted from the groundwater to assure that the concentrations are lower than the regulated standard thus a large daily total pumping rates and remediation cost are unavoidable to decrease the potential chance of health risk violation fig 7 presents the simulated elcr levels among the entire contaminated area for the most preferred alternative and the least preferred alternative after each year of remediation the risk level is higher in the center than the edge and gradually decreases toward the outer region for a14 the average elcr levels at wells m4 i e 3 141 10 4 is relatively higher than at other wells therefore when stringent elcr attributes were adopted the concentration around m4 need to be paid great attention the major and extremely significant difference between a14 and a4 is that the average elcr level at wells m5 for a14 is much less than that for a4 i e 1 576 10 5 versus 3 500 10 4 this indicates that injection extraction well locations have complicated comprehensive influence on contaminant degradation and health risk distribution 3 1 2 10 year remediation the input data i e performance of groundwater remediation strategies on ten quantitative attributes and weights of attributes are listed tables a 2 and 1 when the evaluation of remediation strategies is carried out elcr5 has the highest weight i e within the interval of 0 227 0 263 and is the most relevant remediation attributes on the contrary elcr8 has less importance than other attributes in the remediation alternatives evaluation as it is clearly seen from fig 4 and table 2 a3 has the highest value of φ showing that the degree of a3 dominating the other alternatives is remarkable thus a3 is listed as the number one option among all alternatives for granted when the remediation period is extended to 10 years well i1 have most significant contributions to the injection operation and the extraction rate at e2 is larger than that at the other 3 wells and thus these 2 wells have more significant contribution to the remediation practice fig 5 since the dtpr and tc for the most preferred alternative under 5 duration are less than that under 10 year duration fig 6 and elcr levels in each monitoring well could satisfy the environmental requirements thus the 5 year duration would be more desirable than the 10 year one due to the shorter remediation duration fig 7 3 1 3 15 year remediation the rankings are provided from best to worst among alternatives when the duration is 15 years table a 3 obviously the remediation strategy a9 is deemed the best option with a lower daily total pumping rates a lower remediation cost and a lower risk of environmental impact compared to the best actions under the short term and short to medium term durations i e 5 and 10 years the dtpr under 15 years of durations is reduced by up to 26 7 31 3 due to the process of natural attenuation fig 6 when the most desirable i e a9 and the least desirable alternatives i e a13 are taken after 15 years of remediation the dtpr and tc are the same i e 53 824 m3 d and 105 864 103 the average peak elcr level of 1 1 dca is approximately 2 250 10 4 for a9 and 3 561 10 4 for a13 it is indicated that the pumping rates at various remediation wells play a crucial role on contaminants removing efficiency 3 1 4 20 year remediation long remediation periods would generate the highest daily total pumping rates and operating cost table a 4 thus the weights of dtpr and tc increase within the interval 0 167 0 206 and 0 242 0 258 according to the requirements and preferences of the decision maker respectively the overall ratings of alternatives indicates a1 is identifies as the desired remediation option for the study site a5 is the most expensive alternative and it is deemed the worst option for the study site remediation compare with the dtpr during 5 and 10 year management they are decreased when the remediation period increases as 10 years or 15 years this is because nature attenuation of contaminants played an important role with long remediation periods the average elcr level at wells m2 m7 for a1 is between 3 27 10 5 and 2 075 10 4 and for a5 would reach up to 2 498 10 4 to 4 297 10 4 m5 is particularly sensitive to this remediation periods and should be monitored to avoid exceeding the set concentration in practice 3 2 comparisons 3 2 1 comparison of the four remediation periods in terms of ivtf mapm table 3 presents the ranking results of the actions under four remediation scenarios in terms of ivtf mapm according the ranking results it can be obtained that the groundwater remediation strategies in each period are quite different due to the varied attributes and weights the total preference ability of the alternative with the highest the value of rank a ti over the other actions is remarkable the alternative with the lowest the value of rank a ti means that this action has the lowest attractiveness than other alternatives overall as increasing the time of exposure and natural attenuation dtpr is already on a declining trend tc is on a good upward curve contaminant concentration around contamination source are not the highest with the operation of injection and extraction wells and degradation in groundwater health risks still higher and need be paid more attention during the whole remediation process from the results of the best remediation strategies and the worst remediation strategies it can been concluded that a lower pumping rate does not always mean a poor remediation effect such as a14 and a4 under a duration time of 5 years 3 2 2 comparison between ivtf mapm fmapm and mapm fuzzy elcr felcr were introduced into fuzzy multi attribute preference model fmapm where the minimum and maximum elcr under 50 different random porosities were considered as the lower and upper value of the support of felcr respectively and the average was the core of felcr the mean values for ten evaluation attributes were input into the traditional mapm models the rank orders of fifteen alternatives in each remediation that assessed by ivtf mapm fmapm and mapm methods are not completely equivalent for 5 10 15 and 20 years of remediation a14 a3 a9 and a1 are the best actions respectively in terms of ivtf mapm a14 a2 a3 and a1 in terms of fmapm table a 5 a9 a2 a3 and a1 in terms of mapm table a 6 expected for 20 durations the worst actions in other periods are totally the exact same for different methods it is possible that the simulation outputs vary significantly because different shapes of distributions e g interval valued triangular fuzzy value fuzzy value and certain number were used leading to different ranking results in the comparison interval valued triangular fuzzy set fuzzy set and deterministic data were input to ivtf mapm fmapm and traditional mapm respectively results showed that the ranking orders vary significantly with types of data inpdacuts despite the discrepancy in the ranking orders the strategy derived from ivtf mapm could be more tolerable by the decision maker because it was obtained based on increased data information ivtf which accommodates the hybrid of fuzzy sets and interval numbers therefore the robustness of eventual decision making results may be significantly less influenced than conventional algorithms wherein the uncertain problems are over simplified 3 3 weight and its influence table 2 presents the interval pairwise comparison matrix between every two attributes and interval weight for each attribute during four remediation periods overall the weight of dtpr and tc is keep increasing which means that this two attributes are relatively more important than others with the increasing the time of exposure and the natural attenuation because the peak health risk occur generally at downstream of contamination sources after a period of remediation the weight of elcr4 suffers the greatest decline generally the weights are the important attribute during the management process that would influence the ranking results the ranking results of the alternatives are various under the different weights of attributes in the actual decision making process the weights of attributes are closely related to the performance of different experts stakeholders thus the weights of evaluation attributes should be carefully selected in the decision making process 4 conclusions decision making on the most desirable technologies for groundwater remediation for the decision makers is based on economy feasibility and technology effectiveness the traditional fmapm methodology has been widely used to support these decisions whereas it present some limits such as difficulty in assessment uncertain parameters hardly be expressed as conventional fuzzy sets due to the existence of multiple uncertainties in this paper an improved version ivtf mapm methodology based on interval valued triangular fuzzy theory and mapm is presented in the case study fifteen technologies with respect to ten attributes under four remediation periods for groundwater remediation have been studied interval ahp for weights calculation and the determination of the priorities of the alternatives has been quantified at the end it was possible to determine a sequence of the different alternative scenarios and the best options the predicted remediation alternative with respect to different evaluation attributes and weights varies considerably under different durations scenarios for 5 10 15 and 20 years of remediation a14 a3 a9 and a1 are the best actions respectively in terms of ivtf mapm the interval weights for the decision making process have important factors that could influence the ranking results under uncertain environment well location is the predominant factor determining the contribution of wells to remediation effects for the most desirable alternatives the injecting rate at injection well i1 is higher than at well i2 during short remediation periods with the increasing time well i1 was the most important in injecting clean water though nature attenuation of contaminants plays a part in scenarios with long remediation periods the area between well m3 and m4 still has a relatively high risk assessment performance compared to the existing study efforts the proposed ivtf mapm approach has the potential to be extended to other regions with similar different conditions aquifer and contaminants however only the uncertainty of porosity were focused on in this study it is well known uncertainties mainly stem from temporal and spatial variations in hydrogeological parameters resulting from incomplete or inaccurate information thus in depth efforts could be further undertaken and more sophisticated methods that accommodate more information need to be developed advanced when high demands of decision makers are imposed under such circumstance the efficiency and robustness of the proposed mapm approach would be enhanced moreover more mapm methods could be developed for selecting discrete alternatives and identifying desirable alternatives when multiple conflicting attributes under uncertainty are encountered besides the pump and treat system could be extended to other remediation processes in many practical groundwater management problems

7226,anthropogenic warming may change precipitation patterns impacting infrastructure performance and reliability future precipitation statistics generated using general circulation models gcm are however often biased and not easily applied to problems such as runoff estimation stochastic weather generation is hence used as an alternative to gcms in hydrology and hydraulic modelling this paper explores the dependence of fine temporal precipitation characteristics on air pressure and air temperature using historic observations the goal is to develop based on the key causes of precipitation a climatological basis for a stochastic precipitation generator for non stationary precipitation under climate change conditions the analysis focuses on precipitation in the urban northeast united states and utilizes pooled observations from meteorological stations in new york city philadelphia and boston over 60 years a negative correlation between hourly probability of precipitation pop and air pressure is observed when the historical records are discretized using air pressure change events pce decreasing pressure change events depces had a higher pop and a higher precipitation depth pd than increasing pressure change events inpces temperature was more strongly associated with pd during depces than inpces this association was more pronounced during high magnitude pces and extreme

and change is largely caused by modifications to the global energy and water cycles to improve our ability to adapt to precipitation changes under global warming trenberth et al 2003 research is necessary to characterize the relationship between precipitation and temperature trenberth 1998 trenberth et al 2003 allan and soden 2007 neiman et al 2008 lenderink and van meijgaard 2010 this relationship is complex as it varies over space and time although general circulation models gcms can generally investigate coarser temporal scales e g annual or decadal in larger geographic areas e g northeast us global more uncertainties are observed at smaller temporal and spatial scales since local climate is also influenced by local geography land cover and related circulation patterns mitchell et al 1999 räisänen 2001 zveryaev and allan 2005 sorteberg and kvamstø 2006 researchers have tried to link these two factors using physical and atmospheric explanations for example trenberth et al 2003 suggested that through convection the moisture required for precipitation is drawn from an area of atmosphere that is about four times the rainy area a 7 increase in air moisture holding per degree of warming at the local level has been used to imply a similar rate of global precipitation change based on the clausius clapeyron relation trenberth and shea 2005 sun et al 2007 other studies investigate this relationship at different time scales from monthly trenberth and shea 2005 king et al 2014 to daily sun et al 2007 westra et al 2013 and sub daily lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 2010 still others explore this relationship based on differences in precipitation patterns looking at means allen and ingram 2002 trenberth 2011 extremes groisman et al 2005 meehl et al 2005 shaw et al 2011 meehl et al 2012 kunkel et al 2013 and events of varying durations panthou et al 2014 wasko et al 2015b for example madden and williams 1978 found a frequent negative correlation between precipitation and summer air temperature at time scales ranging from inter annual to multi decadal in the contiguous united states and europe zhao and khalil 1993 confirmed a similar negative correlation in the summer after exploring monthly data of the contiguous united states from 1905 to 1984 however on days with mean daily temperatures in excess of 12 c lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 found that the probability of one hour precipitation extremes in de bilt netherlands increased much faster than the clausius clapeyron relation suggests extending this finding to larger european simulations in general projections from gcms are used to interpret the relationship between precipitation and temperature at coarser temporal scales e g annual or decadal under climate change scenarios when considering larger geographic areas e g northeast us global yet precipitation datasets at fine time scales e g hourly or sub hourly are required to study the potential impacts of climate change on water resource management urban hydrology and agriculture for example one of the two primary causes of runoff is hortonian excess precipitation whereby runoff is generated instantaneously whenever the intensity of precipitation exceeds the infiltration capacity of the land surface to assess whether precipitation will be more intense under climate change and possibly increase runoff generation precipitation sequences downscaled from gcm projections are needed at fine temporal scales despite the dynamic methods used by regional climate models rcms stochastic precipitation generators based on downscaled gcm projections have been developed as an alternative fowler et al 2007 wilks 2010 and used extensively for flood risk management haberlandt et al 2008 sizing reliable rainwater harvesting systems basinger et al 2010 and other water resource management tasks shamir et al 2015 stochastic precipitation generators create long continuous markovian sequences of precipitation through a variety of methods wilks and wilby 1999 one technique for sequence generation uses samples from parameterized statistical distributions of wet day rain volume stern and coe 1984 wilks 1998 arrival and cell conditions intensity and duration rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 1988 wasko et al 2015a wasko and sharma 2017 and event characteristics heneker et al 2001 another relies on non parametrically sampling historical observations lall et al 1996 lall and sharma 1996 sharma and lall 1999 basinger et al 2010 with a moving window to preserve seasonality rajagopalan et al 1996 the quality of downscaled gcm precipitation datasets is contingent upon accurate temperature predictions and a strategy for minimizing prediction bias johnson and sharma 2009 johnson and sharma 2012 researchers found that pressure and temperature have the most agreement across the gcms johnson and sharma 2009 while precipitation has the least consensus kendon et al 2008 johnson and sharma 2009 a better understanding of the relationship between precipitation and temperature is necessary to increase confidence in precipitation projections derived from other gcm projections such as monthly temperature this paper explores how fine temporal scale e g hourly precipitation patterns are related to coarser temporal scale e g average monthly temperature the physical causes of precipitation in a free atmosphere system are discussed first next an investigation into the relationship of air pressure and precipitation is explored both at hourly time steps and on an event basis this analysis is then extended to examine how event based precipitation characteristics are impacted by average monthly temperature amt the results are used to discuss the potential development of a new stochastic precipitation generator that produces synthetic hourly precipitation time series by non parametrically resampling historical observations informed by gcm projections of amt among other variables 2 mechanisms of precipitation one of the key causes of precipitation is the condensation of air that ascends as it moves laterally over irregular terrain orographic lifting or is physically displaced by atmospheric phenomena e g via frontal lifting bjerknes and kristiania 1922 condensed moisture then falls to the ground as precipitation after drops coalesce enough to overcome the forces of drag ahrens et al 2012 in a free atmosphere the primary cause of condensation is the displacement of air masses bjerknes and kristiania 1922 the earliest researcher describing precipitation generated from the frontal movement of air masses was bjerknes and kristiania 1923 who studied atmospheric circulation patterns there are three main categories of frontal precipitation bjerknes and kristiania 1922 bjerknes and kristiania 1923 1 a cold front forms when cold dry stable air masses lift and replace relatively unstable warm moist air masses previously found near the land surface typically the cold air moves from the northwest to southeast direction in the northern hemisphere the cold air forces its way under the warm air which is then convected upward where it cools condenses and coalesces often causing short duration high intensity precipitation 2 by contrast a warm front is formed by the advance of a warm moist air mass and the simultaneous slow retreat of cold dry air most commonly warm air moves from the southeast to the northwest in the northern hemisphere since warm air has a lower density it rolls up and over the cold air and can cause light to moderate precipitation over a large geographic area 3 occludal fronts occur when cold and warm fronts collide causing a cyclone with low pressure in the joint area occludal fronts typically move to the northeast and cause synoptic because both warm and cold fronts are present precipitation over large land areas fig 1 graphically illustrates the three types of fronts ahrens et al 2012 summarized general relationships between precipitation temperature and pressure for each of the three types of fronts table 1 note that the trends in temperature changes are not consistent for all front types especially for the occludal front which makes it difficult to develop a direct relationship between temperature and precipitation however when air is lifted by any of the three different frontal mechanisms air pressure at the ground surface is consistently reduced hughes and mayes 2014 this phenomenon is well documented at the synoptic scale as a result of frontal precipitation urbana champaign 2010 at the local or meso scale hoxit et al 1976a b found that surface pressure dropped due to the formation of convective clouds triggering showery storms the magnitude of the pressure drop is associated with the type of air mass movement at the synoptic scale or with the extent of the surface heating imbalance at the meso scale suggesting that in both cases pressure changes may provide a potential physical link between precipitation and seasonal variable frontal movements related to amt and atmosphere stability 3 data and methods 3 1 data the analysis focuses on the northeastern coastal united states a region extending from philadelphia to boston and characterized by plains with no high mountains in this region other than the general surface heating mechanism for local summer storms the vertical movement of air masses is typically associated with frontal precipitation rather than orographic lifting studies describing the relationship between precipitation and temperature lenderink and van meijgaard 2010 shaw et al 2011 panthou et al 2014 wasko and sharma 2017 use data from many locations to prove the geographical representative of their statistics however the physical mechanism of precipitation formation in this study area has been observed in many other locations around the world hoxit et al 1976a b knupp and cotton 1985 neiman et al 2008 adams selin and johnson 2010 ahrens 2012 dawn and mandal 2014 houze et al 2015 the data used in this study includes hourly observations of temperature sea level air pressure and precipitation from the international airports in new york city philadelphia and boston from 1948 to 2011 since the topography and climate across the region are known to be similar data from the three cities spanning over a distance of 480 km are pooled for this analysis more frequent extreme precipitation in the future has been projected for this region by other researchers hayhoe et al 2008 demaria et al 2016 usgcrp 2017 the pooling increases the number of data points that can be used in the analysis especially for the extremes because 1 04 of all time steps in the historical data contains some gaps i e missing data cumulative period with no detailed information the time interval of observation is longer than one hour for several decades etc an interpolation method is developed to fill in the missing data points for gaps less than 24 h a moving average method with a window width of a single day is used to smooth out gaps of less than six hours 1 03 for gaps between six hours and 24 h 0 01 a 2nd harmonic function is fitted to the values of the dry days all gaps are treated as dry with a length of one week adjustable centered on the day of interest and adjusted to match the values of the gap s end points then using this adjusted harmonic function the gaps were filled with values that mimic the general change pattern for the neighboring days and which connect smoothly to the observed data fig 2 illustrates a sample of such a case this method is applied on both temperature and air pressure where longer gaps 24 h were evident data was eliminated from the analysis 3 2 methods because the movement of air masses is typically associated with pressure changes the first step in the analysis was to investigate the pressure changes associated with precipitation for the purposes of this paper both pressure change and precipitation were investigated on an event basis precipitation events were defined by an inter event dry period intedp based on restrepo posada and eagleson 1982 intedp follows an exponential distribution for which the mean equals the standard deviation or coefficient of variation cv of unity however the historic intedp is affected by extreme events which dramatically affect calculations of the cv in fig 3 the cv for each city is calculated and plotted based on intedp quantile thresholds of 95 98 99 99 5 and 100 an intedp beyond each threshold is not included in the calculations based on the results the cv is sensitive to the extreme events in the distribution tail e g the 100 results are far from 99 5 results especially for the short intedps to avoid the influence of these low frequency events e g 0 5 for 99 5 quantile threshold this paper uses 99 5 as the quantile threshold to determine the minimum intedp which is four hours for all cities fig 3 a pressure change event pce is defined using de seasonalized air pressure de seasonalized air pressure is the change in air pressure over a 24 h period as shown in the following equation p t p t p t 24 where p t is the actual air pressure on hour t p t is the de seasonalized air pressure on hour t two different types of pces are possible as shown conceptually in fig 4 the horizontal axis represents time while vertical axis represents the change in air pressure over 24 h i e the de seasonalized air pressure series the shaded areas above the horizontal axis are defined as an increasing pressure change events inpces because the air pressure increases over time the shaded areas below the horizontal axis are defined as decreasing pressure change events depces because air pressure decreases with time the local maxima and minima in the figure indicate the greatest positive and negative 24 h changes in pressure respectively as shown in fig 4 each pce increasing or decreasing is bracketed by time points of stable pressure e g no change over 24 h using the data in this study inpces correspond to event pressure changes epc from 0 to 1100 hpa depce epcs range from 1200 to 0 hpa epc is defined as the cumulative air pressure change within a pce the sample sizes of pces for bos nyc and phl were respectively 11 564 7147 and 8511 based on the meteorology finding described in table 1 precipitation is hypothesized to occur more frequently during depces next the relationships between historical hourly precipitation and air pressure were explored an exploratory analysis was performed to determine whether air pressure is related to precipitation across the study area hourly probabilities of precipitation pops over the full air pressure range for a year and each month were explored graphically then the association between precipitation occurrence and pressure change was qualitatively investigated on an event basis historical observations were specifically inspected for coincidences of depces and precipitation an epc histogram of both rainy and non rainy pces was plotted to explore whether precipitation is more frequently triggered during depces the association between precipitation and epc was then further analyzed and quantified in terms of pce precipitation depth pd and pce pop with both computed from the total number of rainy pces for the association between precipitation and pce to be applicable under climate change conditions it is hypothesized that atmosphere stability pce pop and pce pd must be dependents of amt to test this theory the frequency of pces is graphically inspected to interpret the stability of atmospheric system under different amt conditions by importing amt information the seasonality corresponding pd and pop of different pce types is explored to bridge precipitation and amt heatmaps and contours of pce pop were overlaid with amt for different half years jan june and july dec different pce pd percentiles were also investigated against amt under different epc magnitudes and seasons 4 results and discussion fig 5 displays pop associated with different air pressures for laguardia international airport nyc at an hourly time scale pop in this chart refers to the probability of any form of precipitation at the top of the chart is the pop versus hourly air pressure for the full data set below pop is broken down by month the figure indicates that pop is negatively correlated to the hourly air pressure irrespective of month however during july august and september this trend is less pronounced than during other months this trend is likely because 1 the air system is relatively stable in summer with less variability in air pressure and 2 summertime convection storms are often highly localized and may not pass over the climate station even it is in the tributary area of the storm s convection the same trends and phenomena were also found in boston and philadelphia figures not shown fig 6 shows a sample sequence of alternating pces shaded area and the associated hyetographs bars and 24 h smoothed temperature line this graph illustrates that precipitation is generally associated with the depces which supports the trends illustrated in table 1 i e that frontal precipitation is successive to pressure fall histograms describing all pooled pces and all rain triggering pces are shown in fig 7 the rain triggering pces are defined as those pces whose durations overlap with the beginning of a precipitation event the histogram of the full sample of all pces is similar to a normal distribution with a mean near zero the distribution of rain triggering pces is however skewed to the left and is discontinuous at the vertical axis in the negative range the left skewness is consistent with the meteorological interpretation that as air masses are vertically lifted negative changes in pressure are associated with precipitation events the discontinuity in the distribution could indicate the presence of two different types of fronts cold fronts lift warm air rapidly generating precipitation over relatively small geographic areas very soon after the pressure drops because pop in the negative region of fig 7 is higher it may be that these events correspond to cold front storms alternatively the smaller pop under positive epc may correspond to warm front storms since warm front storms usually affect a large region ahead of the front for this reason precipitation correlated with inpce has a lower pop the pop and pd associated with epcs are depicted graphically in fig 8 a local fit line dashed using loess method cleveland et al 1992 is used to highlight the correlation between pop and epc note the density plot in the lower chart reflects only the distribution of the rainy pces as all dry pces are all laying atop the x axis pd 0 mm two distinct pces are divided by epc 0 hpa as the absolute value of an epc increases the pop of depces increases from 15 to 100 within 0 300 hpa while inpce pop increases only from 15 to about 40 within 0 820 hpa given that the sample size of intensive inpces is limited n 79 when epc 820 hpa less confidence is associated with the pop beyond 820 hpa falling pressure appears to be a better indicator of precipitation than increasing pressure the highest pce occurrence occurs at epc values of approximately 250 hpa and pd of 20 mm these ranges are consistent with the histogram shown in fig 7 similar to pop the trend of pd versus epc can also be divided by pce types for depces the pd increases along with the epc magnitude while for inpces epc magnitude reduces pd physically inpce appears in a stable atmosphere which does not benefit air mass lifting and so lacks the moisture supply necessary to intensify the precipitation process as depce does bjerknes and kristiania 1923 reported that the average lifetime of an air circulation system was 5 5 days a period that was similar in duration to the average 5 7 days of precipitation events reported in 1909 by defant 1921 it suggests that occurrence of air circulation and its corresponding air pressure change could be treated as an indicator of atmosphere stability especially for moderate and intensive events since precipitation is formed due to atmospheric instability it is important to evaluate the impact of temperature on the atmospheric system the monthly frequency of moderate and intensive pces absolute value of epc 90 hpa is plotted in two half years against amt in fig 9 with a local regression line an obvious negative relationship when amt 0 c can be seen for both half years atmospheric systems are more stable when the weather gets cold amt 0 c this illustrates that the atmospheric system stability indicated by monthly frequency of moderate and intensive pces is a function of amt one of the gcm outputs it should be noted that even though the occurrence becomes low individually pce in high temperature is generally more intensive than low temperature to further investigate the impact of amt on pce and its associated precipitation characteristics figs 10 and 10 present the pd and pop for two halves of the year indexed by amt the relationship between pd and amt is contoured by frequency in fig 10 for both inpces and depces two seasonal systems centroids winter and summer are visible for both pce types the summer system is concentrated around 8 mm for depces and 6 mm for inpces both centroids near 22 c the difference of pd between depce and inpce in summer is not pronounced since precipitation tends to be localized in the relatively stable atmospheric system as implied by the narrow variance of air pressure however the opposite is true for winter system the winter system is centered around 17 5 mm for depces and 2 5 mm for inpces both centroids near 2 2 c this indicates that depce has a larger geographical scale effect on winter storms the magnitude of this difference fades out as the amt grows from winter to summer the change in pd between winter and summer is 3 5 mm for inpces and 8 5 for depces these differences are largely due to the seasonality of precipitation formation with large scale frontal mechanisms dominating in winter and local air convection dominating in summer fig 11 illustrates the pop of both pce types under different amt conditions the pop of depces is generally higher than of inpces which is coincided with figs 7 and 8 for depces during both halves of a year pop is roughly level oscillating between 55 and 65 with some small differences in the tail regions e g high and low end of amt range the small pop during low temperatures in the second half of the year jul dec is not reliable due to a limited sample size n 9 for both inpces and depces however during high temperatures the pop decreases about 10 this could be another impact of meso scale summer convection storms which generally have a tributary area much larger than the area of precipitation hoxit et al 1976a b given that the data in the study is only from three airports it is very likely these areas contribute to convections forming storms elsewhere for inpces during both year halves the pop indicated is approximately 25 at the lowest temperatures and 35 at the highest between jan and jun pop gradually rises to 35 between 4 c and 10 c while during jul and dec the increase in pop is delayed until the temperature increases from 20 c to 26 c this observation suggests that the precipitation pressure dynamics in the fall and spring differ somewhat from one another although both have a similar temperature range 6 c the pd of spring and fall are difficult to differentiate in fig 10 since their amts overlap similar pop values are shown in fig 11 for depces though the temperatures at which pop increases for inpces are slightly different the increase in pop could be caused by warm front frequency under different amts since warm air masses generally move to the north in spring it is reasonable to expect stronger warm front storms in spring than in the fall this analysis suggests that high pop in this geographical region is associated both with low absolute pressure and with depces it also indicates that pce could serve as a potential link between amt and pop this relationship is plotted in fig 12 in terms of pop and pce against amt with break points in the middle of a year pop ranges from 0 tan to 100 light blue generally pop is higher in depces for the entire year as indicated by the contours of the local regression pop for depces is highest when epc is near 800 hpa regardless of the time of year between july and december pop increases as temperatures decrease for inpces epc magnitude is positively correlated to pop though this correlation is more pronounced for depces as a further investigation we explored pd quantiles against epc and amt in different seasons fig 13 three pd percentiles 50 75 and 95 are included the relationships represented by the local regression lines are colored by season vertically similar to the results presented in fig 8 pd percentiles increases as the epc drops especially in depce regions this generally holds for all pd percentiles and seasons horizontally pd seems to vary greatly depending on the amt with an amplified magnitude on high percentile categories 75 and 95 quantiles for intensive 500 hpa 2000 hpa and non intensive 0 hpa 500 hpa inpces the all season dash lines reflect the overall relationship between pd and amt since seasonality is not significant when amt is lower than 10 c pd stays small at temperatures above 10 c non intensive inpce pd starts to increase slightly with amt in the pd percentiles of 95 this increase is amplified in intensive inpces for all pd quantiles as shown in fig 13 but delayed to 22 c which almost exclusively represents summertime events it should be noted that this amplification could be caused by the limited sample size n 40 for 23 c 26 c at the corresponding amt range and thus may not be reliable for depce seasonality is more pronounced in high pd percentiles 75 and 95 and under intensive epc conditions when combined with the density graph from fig 8 non intensive 500 hpa 0 hpa depces occur more frequently than other epc categories and thus are more important in the investigation of how pd responds to pces and amt although not all pronounced non intensive depces generate more precipitation when amt is higher obvious for pd in the 95th percentile this trend for non intensive depces is stronger than for non intensive inpce in a similar amt range the trends for all seasons have a dropping tail for high amts which could be due to shrinking sample sizes it could also imply that extreme events 95 are more influenced by temperature and will likely be more affected by climate change than regular events a finding that is supported by other researchers allen and ingram 2002 trenberth et al 2003 allan and soden 2008 giorgi et al 2011 since pd is negatively associated with epc intensive 2000 hpa 500 hpa depces contain many extreme events seasonality is also more differentiable for intensive depces a monotonic positive trend between pd and amt can be observed in fall in winter pd increases when the amt is less than 0 c and decreases for warmer temperatures in spring pd except in the 95 percentile does not obviously change until amt is 10 c summer shows a general monotonic decrease in pd as amt increases this is consistent with shaw et al 2011 s findings in the ne usa suggesting that extreme precipitation events show a decrease in pd after 25 c during the summer the relationship between pd and amt is important in the context of downscaling precipitation based on gcm temperature projections the motivation for this study amt could generally indicate the moisture holding capacity and associated non extreme pd trend of the cc relationship however at finer temporal scale or for a specific precipitation event precipitation should be more physically related to hourly temperature panthou et al 2014 peleg et al 2018 moreover pressure change as a driver of precipitation investigated in this study could impact on pd more directly than temperature and is worth to further explored the impacts of both amt and epc on precipitation characteristics pop pd and percentiles in figs 12 and 13 quantify the precipitation change with climate ban et al 2015 suggest future climate may not be represented by the statistics derived from present using cc related results in this study it might be true for the trends of precipitation characteristics in the extreme situation e g an amt or an epc not seen in the historical data or a local scale summer convection system only shown in the point source data in terms of pressure changes but not precipitation however the analysis in this study is not statistical based although the intensity of different precipitation types may vary due to divergent thermodynamic conditions across different areal seasonal and climate conditions panthou et al 2014 peleg et al 2018 pressure change as a physical requirement of precipitation formation described in this study is independent of global warming thus qualitatively the dependences between epc pd and amt will be generally held meanwhile the analysis results for observed climate may have lower confidence under climate change especially for local convection events because a the sample size of such events is underestimated in the historical data collected by point sources such as climate stations in this study b the trajectory and effective area of precipitation events could change in future climate peleg et al 2018 5 conclusion we investigated the possibility of associating hourly precipitation pressure data with amt data as a preliminary analysis for generating a non stationary non parametric stochastic precipitation generator conditioning gcm monthly temperature output specifically the results of this analysis answer the following two questions 1 how pd and pop change with epc during different types of pce and 2 how the pd and pop of specific pces respond to amt precipitation is formed by the cooling of moist air typically due to vertical lifting physically this lifting results in reduced sea level air pressure prior to precipitation events this research reveals that both pop and pd are highly correlated to pces it provides a more physically reliable strategy by importing pressure change for stochastic precipitation generation either parameterized statistical type or non parametric resampling type to model precipitation the dependence of precipitation characteristics pop pd and percentiles on amt and epc figs 12 and 13 could also enable stochastic precipitation generations to incorporate more reliable gcm amt projections in generating non stationary situations for this reason we propose a stochastic precipitation generator for generating pce sequences conditionally using the corresponding precipitation as an output since the relationship between pce and precipitation is derived from the physical precipitation formation mechanism this kind of stochastic precipitation generator represents a much stronger and more reliable conceptual basis on which to build a model as compared to those models barely relying on statistical assumptions moreover because pce is more strongly related to precipitation formation than coarser temporal scale temperature e g monthly it could be a reliable method for downscaling precipitation from gcm amt projections which are currently more trustworthy than gcm precipitation projections such a stochastic precipitation generator could be built by sampling pce associated hourly precipitation series from historical observations and by adjusting for gcm predicted monthly temperatures specifically by employing non parametric method lall rajagopalan et al 1996 lall and sharma 1996 rajagopalan and lall 1999 amt projections from gcms would be used as a reference to determine a pool of candidate pces under similar amts i e a range of 6 c within which pop seasonal changes occur as shown in fig 11 similar to the moving window method rajagopalan et al 1996 a secondary paper specifically describing such a non stationary non parametric stochastic precipitation generator will be published in all this paper suggests a means of generating long continuous synthetic precipitation series from scaled down gcm amt projections these series could then be used for a variety of climate change model applications such as hydrologic and

7226,anthropogenic warming may change precipitation patterns impacting infrastructure performance and reliability future precipitation statistics generated using general circulation models gcm are however often biased and not easily applied to problems such as runoff estimation stochastic weather generation is hence used as an alternative to gcms in hydrology and hydraulic modelling this paper

and change is largely caused by modifications to the global energy and water cycles to improve our ability to adapt to precipitation changes under global warming trenberth et al 2003 research is necessary to characterize the relationship between precipitation and temperature trenberth 1998 trenberth et al 2003 allan and soden 2007 neiman et al 2008 lenderink and van meijgaard 2010 this relationship is complex as it varies over space and time although general circulation models gcms can generally investigate coarser temporal scales e g annual or decadal in larger geographic areas e g northeast us global more uncertainties are observed at smaller temporal and spatial scales since local climate is also influenced by local geography land cover and related circulation patterns mitchell et al 1999 räisänen 2001 zveryaev and allan 2005 sorteberg and kvamstø 2006 researchers have tried to link these two factors using physical and atmospheric explanations for example trenberth et al 2003 suggested that through convection the moisture required for precipitation is drawn from an area of atmosphere that is about four times the rainy area a 7 increase in air moisture holding per degree of warming at the local level has been used to imply a similar rate of global precipitation change based on the clausius clapeyron relation trenberth and shea 2005 sun et al 2007 other studies investigate this relationship at different time scales from monthly trenberth and shea 2005 king et al 2014 to daily sun et al 2007 westra et al 2013 and sub daily lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 2010 still others explore this relationship based on differences in precipitation patterns looking at means allen and ingram 2002 trenberth 2011 extremes groisman et al 2005 meehl et al 2005 shaw et al 2011 meehl et al 2012 kunkel et al 2013 and events of varying durations panthou et al 2014 wasko et al 2015b for example madden and williams 1978 found a frequent negative correlation between precipitation and summer air temperature at time scales ranging from inter annual to multi decadal in the contiguous united states and europe zhao and khalil 1993 confirmed a similar negative correlation in the summer after exploring monthly data of the contiguous united states from 1905 to 1984 however on days with mean daily temperatures in excess of 12 c lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 found that the probability of one hour precipitation extremes in de bilt netherlands increased much faster than the clausius clapeyron relation suggests extending this finding to larger european simulations in general projections from gcms are used to interpret the relationship between precipitation and temperature at coarser temporal scales e g annual or decadal under climate change scenarios when considering larger geographic areas e g northeast us global yet precipitation datasets at fine time scales e g hourly or sub hourly are required to study the potential impacts of climate change on water resource management urban hydrology and agriculture for example one of the two primary causes of runoff is hortonian excess precipitation whereby runoff is generated instantaneously whenever the intensity of precipitation exceeds the infiltration capacity of the land surface to assess whether precipitation will be more intense under climate change and possibly increase runoff generation precipitation sequences downscaled from gcm projections are needed at fine temporal scales despite the dynamic methods used by regional climate models rcms stochastic precipitation generators based on downscaled gcm projections have been developed as an alternative fowler et al 2007 wilks 2010 and used extensively for flood risk management haberlandt et al 2008 sizing reliable rainwater harvesting systems basinger et al 2010 and other water resource management tasks shamir et al 2015 stochastic precipitation generators create long continuous markovian sequences of precipitation through a variety of methods wilks and wilby 1999 one technique for sequence generation uses samples from parameterized statistical distributions of wet day rain volume stern and coe 1984 wilks 1998 arrival and cell conditions intensity and duration rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 1988 wasko et al 2015a wasko and sharma 2017 and event characteristics heneker et al 2001 another relies on non parametrically sampling historical observations lall et al 1996 lall and sharma 1996 sharma and lall 1999 basinger et al 2010 with a moving window to preserve seasonality rajagopalan et al 1996 the quality of downscaled gcm precipitation datasets is contingent upon accurate temperature predictions and a strategy for minimizing prediction bias johnson and sharma 2009 johnson and sharma 2012 researchers found that pressure and temperature have the most agreement across the gcms johnson and sharma 2009 while precipitation has the least consensus kendon et al 2008 johnson and sharma 2009 a better understanding of the relationship between precipitation and temperature is necessary to increase confidence in precipitation projections derived from other gcm projections such as monthly temperature this paper explores how fine temporal scale e g hourly precipitation patterns are related to coarser temporal scale e g average monthly temperature the physical causes of precipitation in a free atmosphere system are discussed first next an investigation into the relationship of air pressure and precipitation is explored both at hourly time steps and on an event basis this analysis is then extended to examine how event based precipitation characteristics are impacted by average monthly temperature amt the results are used to discuss the potential development of a new stochastic precipitation generator that produces synthetic hourly precipitation time series by non parametrically resampling historical observations informed by gcm projections of amt among other variables 2 mechanisms of precipitation one of the key causes of precipitation is the condensation of air that ascends as it moves laterally over irregular terrain orographic lifting or is physically displaced by atmospheric phenomena e g via frontal lifting bjerknes and kristiania 1922 condensed moisture then falls to the ground as precipitation after drops coalesce enough to overcome the forces of drag ahrens et al 2012 in a free atmosphere the primary cause of condensation is the displacement of air masses bjerknes and kristiania 1922 the earliest researcher describing precipitation generated from the frontal movement of air masses was bjerknes and kristiania 1923 who studied atmospheric circulation patterns there are three main categories of frontal precipitation bjerknes and kristiania 1922 bjerknes and kristiania 1923 1 a cold front forms when cold dry stable air masses lift and replace relatively unstable warm moist air masses previously found near the land surface typically the cold air moves from the northwest to southeast direction in the northern hemisphere the cold air forces its way under the warm air which is then convected upward where it cools condenses and coalesces often causing short duration high intensity precipitation 2 by contrast a warm front is formed by the advance of a warm moist air mass and the simultaneous slow retreat of cold dry air most commonly warm air moves from the southeast to the northwest in the northern hemisphere since warm air has a lower density it rolls up and over the cold air and can cause light to moderate precipitation over a large geographic area 3 occludal fronts occur when cold and warm fronts collide causing a cyclone with low pressure in the joint area occludal fronts typically move to the northeast and cause synoptic because both warm and cold fronts are present precipitation over large land areas fig 1 graphically illustrates the three types of fronts ahrens et al 2012 summarized general relationships between precipitation temperature and pressure for each of the three types of fronts table 1 note that the trends in temperature changes are not consistent for all front types especially for the occludal front which makes it difficult to develop a direct relationship between temperature and precipitation however when air is lifted by any of the three different frontal mechanisms air pressure at the ground surface is consistently reduced hughes and mayes 2014 this phenomenon is well documented at the synoptic scale as a result of frontal precipitation urbana champaign 2010 at the local or meso scale hoxit et al 1976a b found that surface pressure dropped due to the formation of convective clouds triggering showery storms the magnitude of the pressure drop is associated with the type of air mass movement at the synoptic scale or with the extent of the surface heating imbalance at the meso scale suggesting that in both cases pressure changes may provide a potential physical link between precipitation and seasonal variable frontal movements related to amt and atmosphere stability 3 data and methods 3 1 data the analysis focuses on the northeastern coastal united states a region extending from philadelphia to boston and characterized by plains with no high mountains in this region other than the general surface heating mechanism for local summer storms the vertical movement of air masses is typically associated with frontal precipitation rather than orographic lifting studies describing the relationship between precipitation and temperature lenderink and van meijgaard 2010 shaw et al 2011 panthou et al 2014 wasko and sharma 2017 use data from many locations to prove the geographical representative of their statistics however the physical mechanism of precipitation formation in this study area has been observed in many other locations around the world hoxit et al 1976a b knupp and cotton 1985 neiman et al 2008 adams selin and johnson 2010 ahrens 2012 dawn and mandal 2014 houze et al 2015 the data used in this study includes hourly observations of temperature sea level air pressure and precipitation from the international airports in new york city philadelphia and boston from 1948 to 2011 since the topography and climate across the region are known to be similar data from the three cities spanning over a distance of 480 km are pooled for this analysis more frequent extreme precipitation in the future has been projected for this region by other researchers hayhoe et al 2008 demaria et al 2016 usgcrp 2017 the pooling increases the number of data points that can be used in the analysis especially for the extremes because 1 04 of all time steps in the historical data contains some gaps i e missing data cumulative period with no detailed information the time interval of observation is longer than one hour for several decades etc an interpolation method is developed to fill in the missing data points for gaps less than 24 h a moving average method with a window width of a single day is used to smooth out gaps of less than six hours 1 03 for gaps between six hours and 24 h 0 01 a 2nd harmonic function is fitted to the values of the dry days all gaps are treated as dry with a length of one week adjustable centered on the day of interest and adjusted to match the values of the gap s end points then using this adjusted harmonic function the gaps were filled with values that mimic the general change pattern for the neighboring days and which connect smoothly to the observed data fig 2 illustrates a sample of such a case this method is applied on both temperature and air pressure where longer gaps 24 h were evident data was eliminated from the analysis 3 2 methods because the movement of air masses is typically associated with pressure changes the first step in the analysis was to investigate the pressure changes associated with precipitation for the purposes of this paper both pressure change and precipitation were investigated on an event basis precipitation events were defined by an inter event dry period intedp based on restrepo posada and eagleson 1982 intedp follows an exponential distribution for which the mean equals the standard deviation or coefficient of variation cv of unity however the historic intedp is affected by extreme events which dramatically affect calculations of the cv in fig 3 the cv for each city is calculated and plotted based on intedp quantile thresholds of 95 98 99 99 5 and 100 an intedp beyond each threshold is not included in the calculations based on the results the cv is sensitive to the extreme events in the distribution tail e g the 100 results are far from 99 5 results especially for the short intedps to avoid the influence of these low frequency events e g 0 5 for 99 5 quantile threshold this paper uses 99 5 as the quantile threshold to determine the minimum intedp which is four hours for all cities fig 3 a pressure change event pce is defined using de seasonalized air pressure de seasonalized air pressure is the change in air pressure over a 24 h period as shown in the following equation p t p t p t 24 where p t is the actual air pressure on hour t p t is the de seasonalized air pressure on hour t two different types of pces are possible as shown conceptually in fig 4 the horizontal axis represents time while vertical axis represents the change in air pressure over 24 h i e the de seasonalized air pressure series the shaded areas above the horizontal axis are defined as an increasing pressure change events inpces because the air pressure increases over time the shaded areas below the horizontal axis are defined as decreasing pressure change events depces because air pressure decreases with time the local maxima and minima in the figure indicate the greatest positive and negative 24 h changes in pressure respectively as shown in fig 4 each pce increasing or decreasing is bracketed by time points of stable pressure e g no change over 24 h using the data in this study inpces correspond to event pressure changes epc from 0 to 1100 hpa depce epcs range from 1200 to 0 hpa epc is defined as the cumulative air pressure change within a pce the sample sizes of pces for bos nyc and phl were respectively 11 564 7147 and 8511 based on the meteorology finding described in table 1 precipitation is hypothesized to occur more frequently during depces next the relationships between historical hourly precipitation and air pressure were explored an exploratory analysis was performed to determine whether air pressure is related to precipitation across the study area hourly probabilities of precipitation pops over the full air pressure range for a year and each month were explored graphically then the association between precipitation occurrence and pressure change was qualitatively investigated on an event basis historical observations were specifically inspected for coincidences of depces and precipitation an epc histogram of both rainy and non rainy pces was plotted to explore whether precipitation is more frequently triggered during depces the association between precipitation and epc was then further analyzed and quantified in terms of pce precipitation depth pd and pce pop with both computed from the total number of rainy pces for the association between precipitation and pce to be applicable under climate change conditions it is hypothesized that atmosphere stability pce pop and pce pd must be dependents of amt to test this theory the frequency of pces is graphically inspected to interpret the stability of atmospheric system under different amt conditions by importing amt information the seasonality corresponding pd and pop of different pce types is explored to bridge precipitation and amt heatmaps and contours of pce pop were overlaid with amt for different half years jan june and july dec different pce pd percentiles were also investigated against amt under different epc magnitudes and seasons 4 results and discussion fig 5 displays pop associated with different air pressures for laguardia international airport nyc at an hourly time scale pop in this chart refers to the probability of any form of precipitation at the top of the chart is the pop versus hourly air pressure for the full data set below pop is broken down by month the figure indicates that pop is negatively correlated to the hourly air pressure irrespective of month however during july august and september this trend is less pronounced than during other months this trend is likely because 1 the air system is relatively stable in summer with less variability in air pressure and 2 summertime convection storms are often highly localized and may not pass over the climate station even it is in the tributary area of the storm s convection the same trends and phenomena were also found in boston and philadelphia figures not shown fig 6 shows a sample sequence of alternating pces shaded area and the associated hyetographs bars and 24 h smoothed temperature line this graph illustrates that precipitation is generally associated with the depces which supports the trends illustrated in table 1 i e that frontal precipitation is successive to pressure fall histograms describing all pooled pces and all rain triggering pces are shown in fig 7 the rain triggering pces are defined as those pces whose durations overlap with the beginning of a precipitation event the histogram of the full sample of all pces is similar to a normal distribution with a mean near zero the distribution of rain triggering pces is however skewed to the left and is discontinuous at the vertical axis in the negative range the left skewness is consistent with the meteorological interpretation that as air masses are vertically lifted negative changes in pressure are associated with precipitation events the discontinuity in the distribution could indicate the presence of two different types of fronts cold fronts lift warm air rapidly generating precipitation over relatively small geographic areas very soon after the pressure drops because pop in the negative region of fig 7 is higher it may be that these events correspond to cold front storms alternatively the smaller pop under positive epc may correspond to warm front storms since warm front storms usually affect a large region ahead of the front for this reason precipitation correlated with inpce has a lower pop the pop and pd associated with epcs are depicted graphically in fig 8 a local fit line dashed using loess method cleveland et al 1992 is used to highlight the correlation between pop and epc note the density plot in the lower chart reflects only the distribution of the rainy pces as all dry pces are all laying atop the x axis pd 0 mm two distinct pces are divided by epc 0 hpa as the absolute value of an epc increases the pop of depces increases from 15 to 100 within 0 300 hpa while inpce pop increases only from 15 to about 40 within 0 820 hpa given that the sample size of intensive inpces is limited n 79 when epc 820 hpa less confidence is associated with the pop beyond 820 hpa falling pressure appears to be a better indicator of precipitation than increasing pressure the highest pce occurrence occurs at epc values of approximately 250 hpa and pd of 20 mm these ranges are consistent with the histogram shown in fig 7 similar to pop the trend of pd versus epc can also be divided by pce types for depces the pd increases along with the epc magnitude while for inpces epc magnitude reduces pd physically inpce appears in a stable atmosphere which does not benefit air mass lifting and so lacks the moisture supply necessary to intensify the precipitation process as depce does bjerknes and kristiania 1923 reported that the average lifetime of an air circulation system was 5 5 days a period that was similar in duration to the average 5 7 days of precipitation events reported in 1909 by defant 1921 it suggests that occurrence of air circulation and its corresponding air pressure change could be treated as an indicator of atmosphere stability especially for moderate and intensive events since precipitation is formed due to atmospheric instability it is important to evaluate the impact of temperature on the atmospheric system the monthly frequency of moderate and intensive pces absolute value of epc 90 hpa is plotted in two half years against amt in fig 9 with a local regression line an obvious negative relationship when amt 0 c can be seen for both half years atmospheric systems are more stable when the weather gets cold amt 0 c this illustrates that the atmospheric system stability indicated by monthly frequency of moderate and intensive pces is a function of amt one of the gcm outputs it should be noted that even though the occurrence becomes low individually pce in high temperature is generally more intensive than low temperature to further investigate the impact of amt on pce and its associated precipitation characteristics figs 10 and 10 present the pd and pop for two halves of the year indexed by amt the relationship between pd and amt is contoured by frequency in fig 10 for both inpces and depces two seasonal systems centroids winter and summer are visible for both pce types the summer system is concentrated around 8 mm for depces and 6 mm for inpces both centroids near 22 c the difference of pd between depce and inpce in summer is not pronounced since precipitation tends to be localized in the relatively stable atmospheric system as implied by the narrow variance of air pressure however the opposite is true for winter system the winter system is centered around 17 5 mm for depces and 2 5 mm for inpces both centroids near 2 2 c this indicates that depce has a larger geographical scale effect on winter storms the magnitude of this difference fades out as the amt grows from winter to summer the change in pd between winter and summer is 3 5 mm for inpces and 8 5 for depces these differences are largely due to the seasonality of precipitation formation with large scale frontal mechanisms dominating in winter and local air convection dominating in summer fig 11 illustrates the pop of both pce types under different amt conditions the pop of depces is generally higher than of inpces which is coincided with figs 7 and 8 for depces during both halves of a year pop is roughly level oscillating between 55 and 65 with some small differences in the tail regions e g high and low end of amt range the small pop during low temperatures in the second half of the year jul dec is not reliable due to a limited sample size n 9 for both inpces and depces however during high temperatures the pop decreases about 10 this could be another impact of meso scale summer convection storms which generally have a tributary area much larger than the area of precipitation hoxit et al 1976a b given that the data in the study is only from three airports it is very likely these areas contribute to convections forming storms elsewhere for inpces during both year halves the pop indicated is approximately 25 at the lowest temperatures and 35 at the highest between jan and jun pop gradually rises to 35 between 4 c and 10 c while during jul and dec the increase in pop is delayed until the temperature increases from 20 c to 26 c this observation suggests that the precipitation pressure dynamics in the fall and spring differ somewhat from one another although both have a similar temperature range 6 c the pd of spring and fall are difficult to differentiate in fig 10 since their amts overlap similar pop values are shown in fig 11 for depces though the temperatures at which pop increases for inpces are slightly different the increase in pop could be caused by warm front frequency under different amts since warm air masses generally move to the north in spring it is reasonable to expect stronger warm front storms in spring than in the fall this analysis suggests that high pop in this geographical region is associated both with low absolute pressure and with depces it also indicates that pce could serve as a potential link between amt and pop this relationship is plotted in fig 12 in terms of pop and pce against amt with break points in the middle of a year pop ranges from 0 tan to 100 light blue generally pop is higher in depces for the entire year as indicated by the contours of the local regression pop for depces is highest when epc is near 800 hpa regardless of the time of year between july and december pop increases as temperatures decrease for inpces epc magnitude is positively correlated to pop though this correlation is more pronounced for depces as a further investigation we explored pd quantiles against epc and amt in different seasons fig 13 three pd percentiles 50 75 and 95 are included the relationships represented by the local regression lines are colored by season vertically similar to the results presented in fig 8 pd percentiles increases as the epc drops especially in depce regions this generally holds for all pd percentiles and seasons horizontally pd seems to vary greatly depending on the amt with an amplified magnitude on high percentile categories 75 and 95 quantiles for intensive 500 hpa 2000 hpa and non intensive 0 hpa 500 hpa inpces the all season dash lines reflect the overall relationship between pd and amt since seasonality is not significant when amt is lower than 10 c pd stays small at temperatures above 10 c non intensive inpce pd starts to increase slightly with amt in the pd percentiles of 95 this increase is amplified in intensive inpces for all pd quantiles as shown in fig 13 but delayed to 22 c which almost exclusively represents summertime events it should be noted that this amplification could be caused by the limited sample size n 40 for 23 c 26 c at the corresponding amt range and thus may not be reliable for depce seasonality is more pronounced in high pd percentiles 75 and 95 and under intensive epc conditions when combined with the density graph from fig 8 non intensive 500 hpa 0 hpa depces occur more frequently than other epc categories and thus are more important in the investigation of how pd responds to pces and amt although not all pronounced non intensive depces generate more precipitation when amt is higher obvious for pd in the 95th percentile this trend for non intensive depces is stronger than for non intensive inpce in a similar amt range the trends for all seasons have a dropping tail for high amts which could be due to shrinking sample sizes it could also imply that extreme events 95 are more influenced by temperature and will likely be more affected by climate change than regular events a finding that is supported by other researchers allen and ingram 2002 trenberth et al 2003 allan and soden 2008 giorgi et al 2011 since pd is negatively associated with epc intensive 2000 hpa 500 hpa depces contain many extreme events seasonality is also more differentiable for intensive depces a monotonic positive trend between pd and amt can be observed in fall in winter pd increases when the amt is less than 0 c and decreases for warmer temperatures in spring pd except in the 95 percentile does not obviously change until amt is 10 c summer shows a general monotonic decrease in pd as amt increases this is consistent with shaw et al 2011 s findings in the ne usa suggesting that extreme precipitation events show a decrease in pd after 25 c during the summer the relationship between pd and amt is important in the context of downscaling precipitation based on gcm temperature projections the motivation for this study amt could generally indicate the moisture holding capacity and associated non extreme pd trend of the cc relationship however at finer temporal scale or for a specific precipitation event precipitation should be more physically related to hourly temperature panthou et al 2014 peleg et al 2018 moreover pressure change as a driver of precipitation investigated in this study could impact on pd more directly than temperature and is worth to further explored the impacts of both amt and epc on precipitation characteristics pop pd and percentiles in figs 12 and 13 quantify the precipitation change with climate ban et al 2015 suggest future climate may not be represented by the statistics derived from present using cc related results in this study it might be true for the trends of precipitation characteristics in the extreme situation e g an amt or an epc not seen in the historical data or a local scale summer convection system only shown in the point source data in terms of pressure changes but not precipitation however the analysis in this study is not statistical based although the intensity of different precipitation types may vary due to divergent thermodynamic conditions across different areal seasonal and climate conditions panthou et al 2014 peleg et al 2018 pressure change as a physical requirement of precipitation formation described in this study is independent of global warming thus qualitatively the dependences between epc pd and amt will be generally held meanwhile the analysis results for observed climate may have lower confidence under climate change especially for local convection events because a the sample size of such events is underestimated in the historical data collected by point sources such as climate stations in this study b the trajectory and effective area of precipitation events could change in future climate peleg et al 2018 5 conclusion we investigated the possibility of associating hourly precipitation pressure data with amt data as a preliminary analysis for generating a non stationary non parametric stochastic precipitation generator conditioning gcm monthly temperature output specifically the results of this analysis answer the following two questions 1 how pd and pop change with epc during different types of pce and 2 how the pd and pop of specific pces respond to amt precipitation is formed by the cooling of moist air typically due to vertical lifting physically this lifting results in reduced sea level air pressure prior to precipitation events this research reveals that both pop and pd are highly correlated to pces it provides a more physically reliable strategy by importing pressure change for stochastic precipitation generation either parameterized statistical type or non parametric resampling type to model precipitation the dependence of precipitation characteristics pop pd and percentiles on amt and epc figs 12 and 13 could also enable stochastic precipitation generations to incorporate more reliable gcm amt projections in generating non stationary situations for this reason we propose a stochastic precipitation generator for generating pce sequences conditionally using the corresponding precipitation as an output since the relationship between pce and precipitation is derived from the physical precipitation formation mechanism this kind of stochastic precipitation generator represents a much stronger and more reliable conceptual basis on which to build a model as compared to those models barely relying on statistical assumptions moreover because pce is more strongly related to precipitation formation than coarser temporal scale temperature e g monthly it could be a reliable method for downscaling precipitation from gcm amt projections which are currently more trustworthy than gcm precipitation projections such a stochastic precipitation generator could be built by sampling pce associated hourly precipitation series from historical observations and by adjusting for gcm predicted monthly temperatures specifically by employing non parametric method lall rajagopalan et al 1996 lall and sharma 1996 rajagopalan and lall 1999 amt projections from gcms would be used as a reference to determine a pool of candidate pces under similar amts i e a range of 6 c within which pop seasonal changes occur as shown in fig 11 similar to the moving window method rajagopalan et al 1996 a secondary paper specifically describing such a non stationary non parametric stochastic precipitation generator will be published in all this paper suggests a means of generating long continuous synthetic precipitation series from scaled down gcm amt projections these series could then be used for a variety of climate change model applications such as hydrologic and

7227,the implementation of source water protection programs is relatively recent in canada and the united states although protecting water at the watershed scale has been a focus of many of these programs few indigenous communities located within these watersheds are involved in the process the purpose of this scoping review was to examine and map the extent range and nature of the published peer reviewed literature on the adoption implementation and outcomes of source water protection programs involving indigenous populations in canada and the united states this review followed a systematic process to identify and evaluate the literature searches were conducted in three aggregator databases web of science proquest and greenfile two independent reviewers conducted a systematic two stage screening process using inclusion and exclusion criteria in the software distillersr articles that met inclusion criteria were analyzed using thematic qualitative and descriptive quantitative methods the findings indicate that a there is a lack of peer reviewed studies focusing on the ecological outcomes of source water protection programs that are inclusive of indigenous populations in canada and the united states b the depth to which the literature describes indigenous involvement in source water protection programs is minimal and c indigenous involvement in source water protection programs is generally not reported as substantial this review provides several recommendations to improve both the peer reviewed literature on the topic and source water protection programs there is a need to improve reporting in the literature on quantitative program results the nature of indigenous involvement in source water protection programs and indigenous inclusive inter jurisdictional success stories it is also recommended that source water protection programs recognize indigenous peoples as more than stakeholders groups and that future studies pull from innovations in other fields to address complex problems and provide new insights to the field of source water protection the methodology presented in this paper provides a template for researchers in engineering and environmental fields such as hydrology to identify and review published literature in a systematic transparent and rigorous manner keywords scoping review source water protection watershed planning indigenous native american first nations inuit 1 background protecting drinking water at its source has become a priority for many communities across canada and the united states of america conservation ontario 2013 lea et al 2010 in the united states source water protection swp came to the forefront of public attention in 1969 when the cuyahoga river in cleveland caught on fire as a result of heavy industrial pollution swichtenberg 2003 this incident lead to the establishment of the safe drinking water act in 1974 which was amended in 1996 to require states to carry out source water assessment and protection programs lea et al 2010 in canada swp has only come to the forefront of public attention since the early 2000s when the drinking water supply for the town of walkerton ontario was contaminated with escherichia coli o157 h7 and campylobacter jejuni killing seven people and leaving more than 2300 people seriously ill o connor 2002 this incident sparked the development of the clean water act for the province of ontario legislation that promotes a multi barrier approach to drinking water protection further incidents across the country brought swp into the public eye in the 2000s including a judicial inquiry into the contaminated drinking water supply in north battleford saskatchewan in 2001 laing 2002 and increased media attention on drinking water contamination in many indigenous communities across the country lam et al 2017 although approaches to swp differ between canada and the united states and between states and provinces swp generally includes the following stages forming a swp committee that may consist of a variety of stakeholders characterizing source waters and establishing protection areas identifying potential threats to drinking water sources assessing the risk associated with each threat establishing and implementing plans to address threats and public education and outreach conservation ontario 2013 lea et al 2010 1 1 inclusion of indigenous communities in swp while swp programs are commonly based on a watershed scale or involve watershed partnerships that aim to include a variety of stakeholders indigenous communities residing in the watershed are not often involved in these endeavors collins et al 2017 for example 27 of the 133 first nations in ontario canada fall within a designated source protection area and can request to have their water treatment system included in the provincial swp process however only three first nations have opted into the provincial swp framework due a variety of logistical political jurisdictional and economic issues lavalley 2006 mascarenhas 2012 afn 2012 collins et al 2017 for instance current swp processes are not often conducive to the inclusion of first nations in part since the communities were not adequately consulted during the development of swp processes first nations have voiced concerns over their lack of inclusion and importantly the critical lack of cultural recognition in these processes lavalley 2006 mascarenhas 2012 indeed across canada first nations have called for new swp processes that recognize their sovereignty and water rights lavalley 2006 afn 2012 in the united states the safe drinking water act sdwa mandates states to assess each public drinking water source for susceptibility to contamination according to guidelines provided by the environmental protection agency epa and states and communities are encouraged to develop protection plans based on these assessments owen et al 2008 epa 1999 some states have aimed to involve the public in their plans including native american populations but a lack of choice control and ownership over the planning process has impeded the participation of these groups owen et al 2008 protecting indigenous source waters is important because drinking water quality remains a critical issue in many indigenous communities across canada and the united states collins et al 2017 epa 2014 as of december 31 2017 126 first nations across canada were on a drinking water advisory which includes boil water do not consume and do not use advisories health canada 2017 in the united states thousands of tribal homes lack access to clean drinking water and sanitation epa 2014 federal governments have focused on addressing these drinking water crises primarily by providing funding for drinking water treatment collins et al 2017 epa 2014 however the use of a multi barrier approach to drinking water protection that includes multiple lines of defense from source to treatment to tap has been identified as critical o connor 2002 and is the prevailing approach for protecting non indigenous public water supplies in canada and the united states o connor 2002 owen et al 2008 epa 1999 for indigenous communities in canada and the united states drinking water protection measures tend to be focused on end of pipe treatment measures collins et al 2017 which are often inadequate for example the canadian national assessment of first nations water and wastewater systems reported 38 of first nation homes were without piped water neegan burnside 2011 indigenous communities should be entitled to the same level of multi barrier protection as non indigenous groups particularly as many indigenous communities are often in a constant state of crisis management that increases the risk of water treatment failure collins et al 2017 sudden loss of human resources unpredicted necessary expenditures infrastructure failures these crises are common and make proactive swp all the more critical for indigenous communities collins et al 2017 the u s environmental protection agency epa promised to work with native american tribes to improve drinking water conditions on reservations in their 2014 2018 strategic plan epa 2014 and the federal government of canada made a lofty commitment to eradicate all long term drinking water advisories on first nations reserves by 2021 health canada 2017 including new water systems that were added after the january 2018 announcement by jane philpott indigenous services minister that nearly 250 more first nation drinking water systems areeligible for federal funding inac 2018 source water protection will be crucial to achieving these federal goals 1 2 purpose and objectives despite the jurisdictional political and economic difficulties associated with indigenous swp peer reviewed literature on the topic is sparse the purpose of this scoping review was to examine and map the extent range and nature of the published peer reviewed literature on the adoption implementation and outcomes of source water protection programs involving indigenous populations in canada and the united states the objectives were to 1 carry out a systematic search of the published literature on adopted source water protection programs in canada and the united states that include indigenous populations 2 examine the range characteristics degree of inclusion of indigenous populations implementation and outcomes of these programs as reported in the literature 3 identify reported limitations and challenges of these programs as described in the literature and 4 identify reporting gaps in the literature this scoping review also aimed to demonstrate the usefulness of this systematic transparent and rigorous approach to literature reviewing for informing policy research and practice in the fields of water resources and environmental engineering 2 methods 2 1 scoping reviews a rigorous approach systematic reviews as defined by the cochrane collaboration higgins and green 2008 and scoping reviews are gaining in popularity across many fields as authors look to replace the traditional narrative literature review with more rigorous transparent and replicable methods for synthesizing research pham et al 2014 pae 2015 while narrative reviews can be evidence based they often lack objective and systematic study selection and analysis criteria leading authors to draw potentially biased interpretations and conclusions pae 2015 originating in the field of medicine systematic and scoping reviews provide rigor to the process of literature review by using explicit systematic methods to identify select and evaluate relevant research and to gather and examine data from included studies moher et al 2009 pae 2015 pham et al 2014 systematic and scoping reviews are similar in many ways both include clearly stated objectives eligibility criteria for included studies and a systematic reproducible search of the literature however the two methods differ in several ways such as the scope of the research question i e must be specific for systematic reviews but can be broad and open ended for scoping reviews and the assessment of included studies e g quantitative analysis is required for systematic reviews but not for scoping reviews both methods while used for different purposes are more rigorous and repeatable when compared with narrative reviews the differences and similarities between narrative systematic and scoping reviews are described in more detail in table 1 in this study a scoping review approach was selected because it is a thorough transparent method to identify synthesize and analyze all relevant literature on a topic that a has not been widely reviewed and b is heterogeneous and discussed in literature with a range of study designs mays et al 2001 a systematic method that allows for heterogeneity of study design and focus is well suited to the fields of hydrology and water resources engineering and to the topic of swp programs there are few narrative literature reviews on the topic of swp programs e g minnes 2015 and there are no systematic or scoping reviews summarizing what has been reported in the literature on the nature stage of implementation and outcomes of source water protection programs the systematic review methodology has grown in popularity in the fields of ecology and conservation pullin 2006 hillebrand and gurevitch 2016 shepard et al 2011 filoso et al 2017 cetas 2017 and has been used to examine power dynamics in water governance brisbois and de loë 2015 however to the authors knowledge the scoping review method has been rarely if not ever previously used in the fields water resources engineering or environmental engineering the methodology for this scoping review followed the framework defined by arksey and o malley 2005 supplemented with recommendations from colquhoun et al 2014 and pham et al 2014 this review followed the first five stages of the arksey and o malley 2005 framework 1 identifying the research question 2 identifying relevant studies 3 study selection 4 charting the data and 5 collating summarizing and reporting the results the expertise of a university of guelph research and scholarship librarian was sought to assist with the searching process including search strategy development database selection and troubleshooting a detailed scoping review protocol which was specified a priori is available from the primary author upon request 2 2 research questions this scoping review was directed by the following research questions 1 to what degree are indigenous communities involved in swp programs in canada and the united states that are published in peer reviewed literature 2 what is known from the peer reviewed literature about the nature stage of implementation and outcomes of source water protection programs that involve indigenous communities in canada and the united states 3 what are the limitations and challenges of source water protection programs that are inclusive of indigenous populations as described in the literature and 4 what are the reporting gaps in the literature about source water protection programs that are inclusive of indigenous populations 2 3 data sources and search strategy the search was implemented on november 23 2016 in the two electronic aggregator databases web of science 1900 present thomson reuters 2016 and proquest 1817 present proquest 2016 with select databases and the electronic database greenfile date range not reported by greenfile ebscohost 2016 these databases were selected to amalgamate a comprehensive selection of studies that may stem from the fields of environmental engineering environmental science environmental policy and water resources the search string consisted of terms that described the research question and remained the same for all three databases table 2 quotations are included around search terms consisting of more than one word the boolean operator or is used to indicate any one of the search terms listed must be present in the article and indicates any ending of the word is considered part of the search term e g initiat includes initiate initiating initiated etc proquest web of science and greenfile databases index abstracts in english meaning that search terms in other languages e g french and spanish are not required to search for articles in these languages search terms were specified to apply to all fields title abstract etc 2 4 citation management citations were imported into the reference manager mendeley desktop version 1 17 3 the mendeley support team 2011 and then imported into the web based application distillersr evidence partners ottawa canada where duplicate citations were removed the software distillersr is a platform that allows users to organize manage and track the various components and processes of systematic and scoping literature reviews including text screening data extraction and reporting evidence partners 2018 2 5 eligibility criteria the review team consisted of five people with a broad range of content and methodological expertise that includes water resources and environmental engineering swp and systematic and scoping review methodologies following the recommendations made by levac et al 2010 the review team met to decide on inclusion and exclusion criteria at the beginning of the review process when developing eligibility criteria the arksey and o malley 2005 framework suggests scoping reviewers use the categories of population intervention and study type this review modified arksey and o malley 2005 framework to include outcomes as well moher et al 2009 this review considered the population to be indigenous communities the intervention to be source water protection programs and the outcomes to include both ecological results measurable improvements in ecological indicators including water quality and other physical and biological indicators of ecosystem health carr et al 2012 and social results of water protection programs all study types were considered for inclusion in this scoping review 2 5 1 population studies were eligible for inclusion if they mentioned the past current or future involvement of an indigenous population in a drinking water protection program programs with any degree of involvement of indigenous populations i e from the mention of indigenous populations to fully indigenous led programs were considered for inclusion in order to 1 capture the largest range of studies that mention indigenous populations and 2 develop an understanding of the degree of inclusion of indigenous populations in the governance structures of these programs reported in the literature 2 5 2 intervention in terms of intervention studies were eligible for inclusion if they described programs in canada or the united states that aim to protect drinking water sources conservation efforts to protect non drinking water sources were excluded to reduce the heterogeneity of the results these programs are likely to vary considerably in purpose and structure from drinking water protection programs drinking water sources derived from groundwater or surface water in any type of geologic media e g fractured rock sand and gravel in canada and the united states including hawaii were eligible for inclusion in order to capture the broad trends in swp program type studies were eligible for inclusion if the source water protection programs were 1 aimed at protecting both the quality and or quantity of drinking water sources and were 2 based on watershed regional or any other scale source water protection programs at any stage of implementation were eligible in order to identify trends in reported swp implementation stage 2 5 3 outcome studies were eligible for inclusion whether or not they reported outcomes of a swp program although no exclusion criteria were specified for the outcome category it was helpful to define this category a priori outcomes of interest included changes in drinking water quality or quantity ecological indicators swp plan completion or implementation integration of water activities into programming adjusted polluter behaviors inter jurisdictional collaboration economic benefits and other outcomes 2 5 4 study type peer reviewed primary research and literature reviews were specified as criteria for study type no other study design was specified to capture the breadth of studies on the topic publications were not excluded based on date aside from the date limitations of the databases due to translation capacity limitations studies in languages other than english french and spanish were excluded 2 6 literature relevance screening this study followed a two stage screening process the first stage consisted of screening the title and abstract of each article using distillersr software a title and abstract screening form was developed based on the inclusion criteria fig 1 the title and abstract screening form was pre tested with 20 citations by two independent reviewers to assess the degree of agreement between reviewers as per pham et al 2014 according to dohoo et al 2012 a cohen s kappa value of 0 8 represents a high level of reviewer agreement subsequently two reviewers used the pre tested form to independently screen the title and abstracts of each citation levac et al 2010 following the format suggested by pham et al 2014 journal and author names were not made anonymous to reviewers articles that were classified as relevant or unsure in the title and abstract screening proceeded into the second stage of the screening process which consisted of two independent reviewers screening the full text of articles using distillersr software full texts were screened with a form created prior to the review based on inclusion criteria fig 2 the form was pre tested by two reviewers on ten articles resulting in a need to make minor adjustments prior to the secondary screening process when an article could not be obtained through the author s authors institution the authors and or journals were contacted via email and the article was requested through the rapid access to collections by electronic requesting racer interlibrary loan service following recommendations made by levac et al 2010 the review team met at the beginning middle and final stages of the title and abstract screening phase to address uncertainties and challenges and to refine the search strategy if needed 2 7 data summary and synthesis one reviewer extracted data from the included articles using a set of questions in distillersr software fig 2 the specific categories of the extracted data included the general characteristics of included studies e g year location document type study foci source water protection program design e g program name type of water source being protected process steps stage of implementation governance characteristics of source water protection programs e g whether the plan was mandated by a governing body program leaders program partners and stakeholders indigenous involvement and outcomes of interest e g reported program metrics frequency of metric measurement ecological and social outcomes of the program data were compiled in microsoft excel where the data were summarized and synthesized through the calculation of frequencies and percentages 3 results 3 1 search and selection of studies the search resulted in 1545 potentially relevant records after duplicate removal 1399 unique citations remained abstract and title screening eliminated a substantial number of articles resulting in 413 potentially relevant citations the full texts of these articles were procured and screened resulting in 30 articles that met the inclusion criteria and were included in the scoping review fig 2 the cohen s kappa value for the title and abstract screening was 0 93 and the cohen s kappa value for full length article screening was 0 87 indicating high levels of agreement dohoo et al 2012 many citations were eliminated during the title and abstract screening phase because the search terms corresponded with other topics or study designs for example the search term water protection elicited a number of studies focused on conservation e g mawdsley et al 2009 johnson 2010 mawdsley 2011 moore 2013 and changes in fish populations e g burkhardt holm et al 2005 bellucci et al 2011 hanno et al 2011 as opposed to the protection of drinking water supplies the search term native resulted in several ecological studies involving native flora and fauna species e g peterson 2000 falasco and bona 2013 puettmann et al 2016 other studies described technologies or methods that could be used for water protection in the future but did not discuss an existing swp program e g badv and deriszadeh 2005 beaujean et al 2014 autixier et al 2014 many studies were eliminated based on location for example several studies were located in finland and other european countries e g frisk and bilaletdin 2001 ollikainen et al 2008 rankinen et al 2006 3 2 most articles focused on water quality improvement table 3 describes the general characteristics of the studies included in this review all included studies were peer reviewed journal articles published between 1995 and 2016 with many 40 12 30 published since 2010 forty one drinking water protection programs are reported in the included studies these programs were initiated between 1980 and 2015 fig 3 the majority of programs were located in canada within canadian programs most were located in ontario the major foci of the included studies are depicted in fig 4 with most studies examining water quality or the importance of uniting jurisdictions while some topics have been investigated over the course of decades e g water quality funding and uniting jurisdictions others have only recently been examined in particular topics pertaining to the consideration of indigenous culture and sovereignty and communities capacity have only been examined in recent years 3 3 most swp programs in the stage of initiation many studies broadly defined their programs as watershed 2 30 6 7 or source water protection 14 30 46 7 programs only a small number of programs were defined by the particular source water they protect i e groundwater 3 30 10 or surface water 6 30 20 protection programs table 4 describes the characteristics of source water protection programs reported in the included studies in terms of program stage at the time of study publication very few studies report that swp programs are in the midst of certain stages of implementation such as resource characterization contaminant studies risk assessment and monitoring fig 5 3 4 little indigenous involvement in swp governance the majority of studies 17 30 56 7 reported that the swp programs described were mandated by a governing body such as a federal provincial or state government six of thirty 20 studies indicated that the programs were not mandated by a governing body and seven studies 23 3 did not mention whether or not the programs were mandated many studies reported that water protection programs were operated by the state or province 14 30 46 7 interestingly eight studies 26 7 described swp programs that were operated by an indigenous group watershed groups 7 30 23 3 and federal government departments e g the epa 7 30 23 3 were also reported as bodies that operate the swp programs see table 5 the reported degree of involvement of indigenous populations in the governance of the swp programs varied widely across the included studies many studies indicated that indigenous groups were engaged as stakeholders in a similar manner that a citizen group might be engaged in a program 13 30 43 3 some studies indicated that opportunities existed for indigenous populations to participate in the program but did not report that participation was taking place 3 30 10 other studies reported that swp programs planned to engage indigenous populations in the future 6 30 20 and nearly a quarter of studies mentioned the inclusion of indigenous groups but did not specify how they were engaged 7 30 23 3 few studies indicated that indigenous groups played a substantial role in the governance of swp programs for instance two studies reported that indigenous groups were engaged as partners 6 7 two studies indicated indigenous groups were engaged as partners with substantial influence on the process 6 7 and three studies described swp programs that were operated by and for indigenous populations 10 3 5 few reported improvements in water quality or quantity the majority of studies were focused on non technical outcomes such as inter jurisdictional collaborations 10 30 33 3 swp plan completion or implementation 5 30 16 7 legislation that supports swp 3 30 10 economic outcomes 2 30 6 7 and changes in polluter behaviour 5 30 16 7 however nearly a quarter of studies focused on improvements in water quality 7 30 23 3 only a few studies identified water quantity 3 30 10 and ecological outcomes 3 30 10 as outcomes of interest the degree to which these outcomes of interest were measured and reported in the included studies is summarized in table 6 3 6 challenges and limitations of swp programs inter jurisdictional partnerships most studies described challenges and or limitations of the swp programs 24 30 80 half of the included studies reported inter jurisdictional partnerships were a challenge for the swp programs 15 30 50 while inter jurisdictional collaboration was cited as a priority for many programs in practice such partnerships were often described as difficult to achieve prominent inter jurisdictional issues included gaps in water protection responsibilities fragmented implementation actions at local levels power imbalances competing interests and difficulties integrating information from different sources engaging indigenous communities and non indigenous stakeholders in the swp process was also cited as a challenge in several studies 7 30 23 3 and 7 30 23 3 respectively reported issues ranged from low attendance at public meetings to difficulties with consensus building and the infringement of indigenous rights knowledge integration i e the integration of indigenous and technical knowledge or the harmonization of indigenous and western governance approaches to swp was only cited as a limitation in two studies 6 7 five studies 16 7 reported a lack of time and or human resources as a major limitation to swp and ten studies 33 3 cited a lack of funding as a considerable challenge to swp programs only a few studies cited a lack of technical data e g up to date watershed information and groundwater usage data as a challenge 4 30 13 3 policy and governance issues were also identified as a limiting factor to the success of swp programs in many articles 10 30 33 3 both the fragmentation and outright lack of swp policies legal mechanisms and regulations were reported to result in lower levels of water protection some studies reported that issues of scale have limited the success of swp programs 5 30 16 7 broad policies that lacked the flexibility to reflect local contexts and narrow policies that only aimed to protect specific areas e g the reserve versus the watershed scale were both identified as problematic only three studies 10 reported that the implementation of swp plans was a challenge and two studies 6 7 reported that a lack of environmental metrics demonstrating the effectiveness of swp implementation was a limitation of existing swp programs 4 discussion 4 1 overview of included studies two themes emerged from the results of this scoping review first the results demonstrate that there is a lack of technical peer reviewed studies of swp programs that are inclusive of indigenous populations in canada and the united states few studies focus on the scientific aspects of swp programs vieux et al 1998 goulding and hu 2009 and in particular there is a poor level of reporting on the ecological outcomes of the swp programs for example it is surprising that only one study reported water quality improvements were observed as a result of a swp program gray et al 2001 given that water quality in particular was the most frequently cited focus of the programs this may be attributed to the lack of studies describing programs that have actually been implemented most included studies describe programs in the early stages of development such as initiation bourne and blette 1998 brady 1996 cook 2016 cook 1997 mcculley 2002 patrick 2011 sanders 2013 scharfenaker 2002 shrubsole 2004 walters et al 2012 however few studies mention the measurement of ecological metrics at all either as a future goal of the program or as a limitation brady 1996 kellogg 1997 mcculley 2002 it is and will continue to be difficult to assess the effectiveness of swp programs without the measurement of environmental metrics brady 1996 the results of this review also indicate that overall both a the depth in which the literature describes indigenous involvement in swp programs is lacking and b the quality of indigenous involvement in the programs is fairly poor studies describe program challenges and goals in regards to indigenous involvement but few provide solutions for example several studies indicate that engaging indigenous communities has proven difficult armitage et al 2015 longboat 2013 owen et al 2008 robins 2007 shrubsole 2004 walters et al 2012 white et al 2012 yet few studies discuss the integration of western and indigenous knowledge and governance approaches indigenous governments have called for swp processes that are inclusive of indigenous peoples indigenous knowledge and indigenous governance principles in each stage of the swp process from conceptualization to implementation lavalley 2006 afn 2012 indigenous inclusion in swp is a critical component of providing indigenous communities with clean drinking water particularly since federal strategies focused on water and wastewater treatment upgrades have not addressed poor drinking water quality in many indigenous communities collins et al 2017 swp studies published more recently have increasingly touched on important indigenous issues such as indigenous culture and sovereignty longboat 2013 white et al 2012 capacity building hill et al 2008 walters et al 2012 and bridging knowledge systems armitage et al 2015 longboat 2013 simpson et al 2015 however this is an area that requires further study 4 2 recommendations based on the results of this scoping review there are few peer reviewed studies on swp programs that are inclusive of indigenous populations in canada and the united states and given the drinking water challenges indigenous communities face it is recommended that more peer reviewed studies be published on the topic in particular this scoping review has demonstrated that there is need for studies that focus on the scientific aspects of programs contaminant studies resource characterization risk assessment monitoring and that report on programs in later stages such as post implementation there is a need for studies that examine the effectiveness of different styles of programs in terms of water quality or quantity improvements and other important ecological outcomes brady 1996 an increase in evaluation studies on the topic would allow reviews of the literature to synthesize data across studies assess the progress of swp programs and make effective recommendations there is also a need for studies to explicitly examine the impacts of swp programs on non technical outcomes such as swp education and awareness polluter behaviour and other outcomes this scoping review has also demonstrated that there is a need for better reporting in the literature on the nature of indigenous involvement in swp programs and how well the program designs are working for indigenous communities what benefits are indigenous communities gaining from the programs what impacts do the programs have on water quality or quantity in indigenous communities and shared watersheds what approaches and technologies have or have not worked what needs improvement in terms of indigenous involvement in swp programs there is a need for approaches that recognize indigenous peoples as partners lavalley 2006 afn 2012 for existing swp policies and programs there is a need to create flexibility in policy and program structure to engage indigenous groups more appropriately walters et al 2012 opening dialogue to re examine areas deemed problematic by indigenous communities e g infringements of indigenous rights providing funding and training for indigenous personnel and providing longer decision making timeframes for overburdened communities may be required among other options collins et al 2017 mcclaren 2003 there may be opportunities to take cues from successful programs that have been formed on partnerships between indigenous governments and other governing bodies and organizations such as in the northwest territories armitage et al 2015 robins 2007 there may also be opportunities to take the lead from swp programs that are inclusive of indigenous populations but were outside of the scope of this review such as programs in new zealand or australia for example jackson 2013 there is a need for research that identifies indigenous inclusive inter jurisdictional water protection success stories from which swp practitioners can build or refine their programs lastly several of the swp program limitations identified in the included studies are common to a wide variety of inter jurisdictional policies and programs nowlan and bakker 2007 halbe et al 2013 meadows 2008 these challenges include issues of scale armitage et al 2015 brady 1996 walters et al 2012 white et al 2012 the engagement of stakeholders bourne et al 1995 gray et al 2001 gullick 2003 patrick 2011 robins 2007 shrubsole 2004 simpson et al 2015 the integration of information longboat 2013 and policy and governance bourne et al 1995 gray et al 2001 hill et al 2008 kellogg 1997 krantzberg 2008 mcculley 2002 patrick 2011 plummer et al 2011 robins 2007 it is here that there are opportunities for swp researchers and practitioners to look outside the box and pull from innovations in other fields such as post normal science and systems engineering funtowicz and ravetz 1993 meadows 2008 marshall and farahbakhsh 2013 studies examining the structure and dynamics of swp policies and programs from new perspectives have the potential to provide new insights to the complex field of swp 4 3 strengths and limitations of this scoping review this review provides a rigorous systematic and transparent examination of the range extent and nature of swp programs in canada and the united states that are inclusive of indigenous communities it followed a protocol that was reviewed by a research team with knowledge of the content and the scoping review methodology the application of this rigorous scoping review methodology is new in the fields of water resources and environmental engineering and has not been employed to map the literature on swp this study provides readers with a template to conduct scoping reviews which are rapidly growing in popularity across a number of fields pham et al 2014 and slow to emerge but needed in hydrology and engineering it also provides new insights on peer reviewed swp literature gaps swp program limitations and provides direction to inform research policy and practice while the review included studies published in english spanish and french there may have been other relevant peer reviewed studies published in languages that were not included in this review the use of search terms in english only may have also limited the number of french and spanish studies that were included however non english articles are indexed in english in all databases used to conduct this review limiting the search to swp programs in canada and the united states may also have eliminated relevant studies additionally the interpretation of included studies was subject to reviewer bias however all articles were screened independently by two reviewers while the search for this review included the use of a consistent search algorithm in three multidisciplinary databases time constraints prevented the inclusion of a gray literature search the gray literature may contain more information on swp programs in later stages of development such as post implementation e g in reports from governments and environmental organizations aandc 2014 burt 2014 khan 2015 rcac 2017 5 conclusions this scoping review mapped the extent range and nature of the published peer reviewed literature on the adoption implementation and outcomes of source water protection programs in canada and the united states that are inclusive of indigenous communities a rigorous systematic transparent and replicable two stage screening process with inclusion and exclusion criteria was used to identify relevant studies the methodology presented in this paper provides a template for researchers in environmental fields such as hydrology to identify and review published literature in a systematic transparent and rigorous manner this review identified the need for peer reviewed studies to focus on the technical aspects of source water protection programs that are inclusive of indigenous populations and that describe the involvement of indigenous communities in more detail in terms of source water protection programs the quality of indigenous involvement in source water protection programs is not substantial and there is a need to create flexibility in policy and program structure to engage indigenous groups more appropriately there are opportunities for source water protection researchers and practitioners alike to transfer existing findings and experiences from other fields with innovations in inter jurisdictional partnerships to move forward as nations around the world work towards the development of environmental policies that are inclusive of indigenous populations it is important that existing programs with their strengths and limitations be represented in the peer reviewed literature it is the hope that this scoping review provides evidence to inform the development and improvement of source water protection policies programs and research that are more inclusive of indigenous voices acknowledgements the authors would

7227,the implementation of source water protection programs is relatively recent in canada and the united states although protecting water at the watershed scale has been a focus of many of these programs few indigenous communities located within these watersheds are involved in the process the purpose of this scoping review was to examine and map the extent range and nature of the published peer reviewed literature on the adoption implementation and outcomes of source water protection programs involving indigenous populations in canada and the united states this review followed a systematic process to identify and evaluate the literature searches were conducted in three aggregator databases web of science proquest and greenfile two independent reviewers conducted a systematic two stage screening process using inclusion and exclusion criteria in the software distillersr articles that met inclusion criteria were analyzed using thematic qualitative and descriptive quantitative methods the findings indicate that a there is a lack of peer reviewed studies focusing on the ecological outcomes of source water protection programs that are inclusive of indigenous populations in canada and the united states b the depth to which the literature describes indigenous involvement in source water protection programs is minimal and c indigenous involvement in source water protection programs is generally not reported as substantial this review provides several recommendations to improve both the peer reviewed literature on the topic and source water protection programs there is a need to improve reporting in the literature on quantitative program results the nature of indigenous involvement in source water protection programs and indigenous inclusive inter jurisdictional success stories it is also recommended that source water protection programs recognize indigenous peoples as more than stakeholders groups and that future studies pull from innovations in other fields to address complex problems and provide new insights to the field of source water protection the methodology presented in this paper provides a template for researchers in engineering and environmental fields such as hydrology to identify and review published literature in a systematic transparent and rigorous manner keywords scoping review source water protection watershed planning indigenous native american first nations inuit 1 background protecting drinking water at its source has become a priority for many communities across canada and the united states of america conservation ontario 2013 lea et al 2010 in the united states source water protection swp came to the forefront of public attention in 1969 when the cuyahoga river in cleveland caught on fire as a result of heavy industrial pollution swichtenberg 2003 this incident lead to the establishment of the safe drinking water act in 1974 which was amended in 1996 to require states to carry out source water assessment and protection programs lea et al 2010 in canada swp has only come to the forefront of public attention since the early 2000s when the drinking water supply for the town of walkerton ontario was contaminated with escherichia coli o157 h7 and campylobacter jejuni killing seven people and leaving more than 2300 people seriously ill o connor 2002 this incident sparked the development of the clean water act for the province of ontario legislation that promotes a multi barrier approach to drinking water protection further incidents across the country brought swp into the public eye in the 2000s including a judicial inquiry into the contaminated drinking water supply in north battleford saskatchewan in 2001 laing 2002 and increased media attention on drinking water contamination in many indigenous communities across the country lam et al 2017 although approaches to swp differ between canada and the united states and between states and provinces swp generally includes the following stages forming a swp committee that may consist of a variety of stakeholders characterizing source waters and establishing protection areas identifying potential threats to drinking water sources assessing the risk associated with each threat establishing and implementing plans to address threats and public education and outreach conservation ontario 2013 lea et al 2010 1 1 inclusion of indigenous communities in swp while swp programs are commonly based on a watershed scale or involve watershed partnerships that aim to include a variety of stakeholders indigenous communities residing in the watershed are not often involved in these endeavors collins et al 2017 for example 27 of the 133 first nations in ontario canada fall within a designated source protection area and can request to have their water treatment system included in the provincial swp process however only three first nations have opted into the provincial swp framework due a variety of logistical political jurisdictional and economic issues lavalley 2006 mascarenhas 2012 afn 2012 collins et al 2017 for instance current swp processes are not often conducive to the inclusion of first nations in part since the communities were not adequately consulted during the development of swp processes first nations have voiced concerns over their lack of inclusion and importantly the critical lack of cultural recognition in these processes lavalley 2006 mascarenhas 2012 indeed across canada first nations have called for new swp processes that recognize their sovereignty and water rights lavalley 2006 afn 2012 in the united states the safe drinking water act sdwa mandates states to assess each public drinking water source for susceptibility to contamination according to guidelines provided by the environmental protection agency epa and states and communities are encouraged to develop protection plans based on these assessments owen et al 2008 epa 1999 some states have aimed to involve the public in their plans including native american populations but a lack of choice control and ownership over the planning process has impeded the participation of these groups owen et al 2008 protecting indigenous source waters is important because drinking water quality remains a critical issue in many indigenous communities across canada and the united states collins et al 2017 epa 2014 as of december 31 2017 126 first nations across canada were on a drinking water advisory which includes boil water do not consume and do not use advisories health canada 2017 in the united states thousands of tribal homes lack access to clean drinking water and sanitation epa 2014 federal governments have focused on addressing these drinking water crises primarily by providing funding for drinking water treatment collins et al 2017 epa 2014 however the use of a multi barrier approach to drinking water protection that includes multiple lines of defense from source to treatment to tap has been identified as critical o connor 2002 and is the prevailing approach for protecting non indigenous public water supplies in canada and the united states o connor 2002 owen et al 2008 epa 1999 for indigenous communities in canada and the united states drinking water protection measures tend to be focused on end of pipe treatment measures collins et al 2017 which are often inadequate for example the canadian national assessment of first nations water and wastewater systems reported 38 of first nation homes were without piped water neegan burnside 2011 indigenous communities should be entitled to the same level of multi barrier protection as non indigenous groups particularly as many indigenous communities are often in a constant state of crisis management that increases the risk of water treatment failure collins et al 2017 sudden loss of human resources unpredicted necessary expenditures infrastructure failures these crises are common and make proactive swp all the more critical for indigenous communities collins et al 2017 the u s environmental protection agency epa promised to work with native american tribes to improve drinking water conditions on reservations in their 2014 2018 strategic plan epa 2014 and the federal government of canada made a lofty commitment to eradicate all long term drinking water advisories on first nations reserves by 2021 health canada 2017 including new water systems that were added after the january 2018 announcement by jane philpott indigenous services minister that nearly 250 more first nation drinking water systems areeligible for federal funding inac 2018 source water protection will be crucial to achieving these federal goals 1 2 purpose and objectives despite the jurisdictional political and economic difficulties associated with indigenous swp peer reviewed literature on the topic is sparse the purpose of this scoping review was to examine and map the extent range and nature of the published peer reviewed literature on the adoption implementation and outcomes of source water protection programs involving indigenous populations in canada and the united states the objectives were to 1 carry out a systematic search of the published literature on adopted source water protection programs in canada and the united states that include indigenous populations 2 examine the range characteristics degree of inclusion of indigenous populations implementation and outcomes of these programs as reported in the literature 3 identify reported limitations and challenges of these programs as described in the literature and 4 identify reporting gaps in the literature this scoping review also aimed to demonstrate the usefulness of this systematic transparent and rigorous approach to literature reviewing for informing policy research and practice in the fields of water resources and environmental engineering 2 methods 2 1 scoping reviews a rigorous approach systematic reviews as defined by the cochrane collaboration higgins and green 2008 and scoping reviews are gaining in popularity across many fields as authors look to replace the traditional narrative literature review with more rigorous transparent and replicable methods for synthesizing research pham et al 2014 pae 2015 while narrative reviews can be evidence based they often lack objective and systematic study selection and analysis criteria leading authors to draw potentially biased interpretations and conclusions pae 2015 originating in the field of medicine systematic and scoping reviews provide rigor to the process of literature review by using explicit systematic methods to identify select and evaluate relevant research and to gather and examine data from included studies moher et al 2009 pae 2015 pham et al 2014 systematic and scoping reviews are similar in many ways both include clearly stated objectives eligibility criteria for included studies and a systematic reproducible search of the literature however the two methods differ in several ways such as the scope of the research question i e must be specific for systematic reviews but can be broad and open ended for scoping reviews and the assessment of included studies e g quantitative analysis is required for systematic reviews but not for scoping reviews both methods while used for different purposes are more rigorous and repeatable when compared with narrative reviews the differences and similarities between narrative systematic and scoping reviews are described in more detail in table 1 in this study a scoping review approach was selected because it is a thorough transparent method to identify synthesize and analyze all relevant literature on a topic that a has not been widely reviewed and b is heterogeneous and discussed in literature with a range of study designs mays et al 2001 a systematic method that allows for heterogeneity of study design and focus is well suited to the fields of hydrology and water resources engineering and to the topic of swp programs there are few narrative literature reviews on the topic of swp programs e g minnes 2015 and there are no systematic or scoping reviews summarizing what has been reported in the literature on the nature stage of implementation and outcomes of source water protection programs the systematic review methodology has grown in popularity in the fields of ecology and conservation pullin 2006 hillebrand and gurevitch 2016 shepard et al 2011 filoso et al 2017 cetas 2017 and has been used to examine power dynamics in water governance brisbois and de loë 2015 however to the authors knowledge the scoping review method has been rarely if not ever previously used in the fields water resources engineering or environmental engineering the methodology for this scoping review followed the framework defined by arksey and o malley 2005 supplemented with recommendations from colquhoun et al 2014 and pham et al 2014 this review followed the first five stages of the arksey and o malley 2005 framework 1 identifying the research question 2 identifying relevant studies 3 study selection 4 charting the data and 5 collating summarizing and reporting the results the expertise of a university of guelph research and scholarship librarian was sought to assist with the searching process including search strategy development database selection and troubleshooting a detailed scoping review protocol which was specified a priori is available from the primary author upon request 2 2 research questions this scoping review was directed by the following research questions 1 to what degree are indigenous communities involved in swp programs in canada and the united states that are published in peer reviewed literature 2 what is known from the peer reviewed literature about the nature stage of implementation and outcomes of source water protection programs that involve indigenous communities in canada and the united states 3 what are the limitations and challenges of source water protection programs that are inclusive of indigenous populations as described in the literature and 4 what are the reporting gaps in the literature about source water protection programs that are inclusive of indigenous populations 2 3 data sources and search strategy the search was implemented on november 23 2016 in the two electronic aggregator databases web of science 1900 present thomson reuters 2016 and proquest 1817 present proquest 2016 with select databases and the electronic database greenfile date range not reported by greenfile ebscohost 2016 these databases were selected to amalgamate a comprehensive selection of studies that may stem from the fields of environmental engineering environmental science environmental policy and water resources the search string consisted of terms that described the research question and remained the same for all three databases table 2 quotations are included around search terms consisting of more than one word the boolean operator or is used to indicate any one of the search terms listed must be present in the article and indicates any ending of the word is considered part of the search term e g initiat includes initiate initiating initiated etc proquest web of science and greenfile databases index abstracts in english meaning that search terms in other languages e g french and spanish are not required to search for articles in these languages search terms were specified to apply to all fields title abstract etc 2 4 citation management citations were imported into the reference manager mendeley desktop version 1 17 3 the mendeley support team 2011 and then imported into the web based application distillersr evidence partners ottawa canada where duplicate citations were removed the software distillersr is a platform that allows users to organize manage and track the various components and processes of systematic and scoping literature reviews including text screening data extraction and reporting evidence partners 2018 2 5 eligibility criteria the review team consisted of five people with a broad range of content and methodological expertise that includes water resources and environmental engineering swp and systematic and scoping review methodologies following the recommendations made by levac et al 2010 the review team met to decide on inclusion and exclusion criteria at the beginning of the review process when developing eligibility criteria the arksey and o malley 2005 framework suggests scoping reviewers use the categories of population intervention and study type this review modified arksey and o malley 2005 framework to include outcomes as well moher et al 2009 this review considered the population to be indigenous communities the intervention to be source water protection programs and the outcomes to include both ecological results measurable improvements in ecological indicators including water quality and other physical and biological indicators of ecosystem health carr et al 2012 and social results of water protection programs all study types were considered for inclusion in this scoping review 2 5 1 population studies were eligible for inclusion if they mentioned the past current or future involvement of an indigenous population in a drinking water protection program programs with any degree of involvement of indigenous populations i e from the mention of indigenous populations to fully indigenous led programs were considered for inclusion in order to 1 capture the largest range of studies that mention indigenous populations and 2 develop an understanding of the degree of inclusion of indigenous populations in the governance structures of these programs reported in the literature 2 5 2 intervention in terms of intervention studies were eligible for inclusion if they described programs in canada or the united states that aim to protect drinking water sources conservation efforts to protect non drinking water sources were excluded to reduce the heterogeneity of the results these programs are likely to vary considerably in purpose and structure from drinking water protection programs drinking water sources derived from groundwater or surface water in any type of geologic media e g fractured rock sand and gravel in canada and the united states including hawaii were eligible for inclusion in order to capture the broad trends in swp program type studies were eligible for inclusion if the source water protection programs were 1 aimed at protecting both the quality and or quantity of drinking water sources and were 2 based on watershed regional or any other scale source water protection programs at any stage of implementation were eligible in order to identify trends in reported swp implementation stage 2 5 3 outcome studies were eligible for inclusion whether or not they reported outcomes of a swp program although no exclusion criteria were specified for the outcome category it was helpful to define this category a priori outcomes of interest included changes in drinking water quality or quantity ecological indicators swp plan completion or implementation integration of water activities into programming adjusted polluter behaviors inter jurisdictional collaboration economic benefits and other outcomes 2 5 4 study type peer reviewed primary research and literature reviews were specified as criteria for study type no other study design was specified to capture the breadth of studies on the topic publications were not excluded based on date aside from the date limitations of the databases due to translation capacity limitations studies in languages other than english french and spanish were excluded 2 6 literature relevance screening this study followed a two stage screening process the first stage consisted of screening the title and abstract of each article using distillersr software a title and abstract screening form was developed based on the inclusion criteria fig 1 the title and abstract screening form was pre tested with 20 citations by two independent reviewers to assess the degree of agreement between reviewers as per pham et al 2014 according to dohoo et al 2012 a cohen s kappa value of 0 8 represents a high level of reviewer agreement subsequently two reviewers used the pre tested form to independently screen the title and abstracts of each citation levac et al 2010 following the format suggested by pham et al 2014 journal and author names were not made anonymous to reviewers articles that were classified as relevant or unsure in the title and abstract screening proceeded into the second stage of the screening process which consisted of two independent reviewers screening the full text of articles using distillersr software full texts were screened with a form created prior to the review based on inclusion criteria fig 2 the form was pre tested by two reviewers on ten articles resulting in a need to make minor adjustments prior to the secondary screening process when an article could not be obtained through the author s authors institution the authors and or journals were contacted via email and the article was requested through the rapid access to collections by electronic requesting racer interlibrary loan service following recommendations made by levac et al 2010 the review team met at the beginning middle and final stages of the title and abstract screening phase to address uncertainties and challenges and to refine the search strategy if needed 2 7 data summary and synthesis one reviewer extracted data from the included articles using a set of questions in distillersr software fig 2 the specific categories of the extracted data included the general characteristics of included studies e g year location document type study foci source water protection program design e g program name type of water source being protected process steps stage of implementation governance characteristics of source water protection programs e g whether the plan was mandated by a governing body program leaders program partners and stakeholders indigenous involvement and outcomes of interest e g reported program metrics frequency of metric measurement ecological and social outcomes of the program data were compiled in microsoft excel where the data were summarized and synthesized through the calculation of frequencies and percentages 3 results 3 1 search and selection of studies the search resulted in 1545 potentially relevant records after duplicate removal 1399 unique citations remained abstract and title screening eliminated a substantial number of articles resulting in 413 potentially relevant citations the full texts of these articles were procured and screened resulting in 30 articles that met the inclusion criteria and were included in the scoping review fig 2 the cohen s kappa value for the title and abstract screening was 0 93 and the cohen s kappa value for full length article screening was 0 87 indicating high levels of agreement dohoo et al 2012 many citations were eliminated during the title and abstract screening phase because the search terms corresponded with other topics or study designs for example the search term water protection elicited a number of studies focused on conservation e g mawdsley et al 2009 johnson 2010 mawdsley 2011 moore 2013 and changes in fish populations e g burkhardt holm et al 2005 bellucci et al 2011 hanno et al 2011 as opposed to the protection of drinking water supplies the search term native resulted in several ecological studies involving native flora and fauna species e g peterson 2000 falasco and bona 2013 puettmann et al 2016 other studies described technologies or methods that could be used for water protection in the future but did not discuss an existing swp program e g badv and deriszadeh 2005 beaujean et al 2014 autixier et al 2014 many studies were eliminated based on location for example several studies were located in finland and other european countries e g frisk and bilaletdin 2001 ollikainen et al 2008 rankinen et al 2006 3 2 most articles focused on water quality improvement table 3 describes the general characteristics of the studies included in this review all included studies were peer reviewed journal articles published between 1995 and 2016 with many 40 12 30 published since 2010 forty one drinking water protection programs are reported in the included studies these programs were initiated between 1980 and 2015 fig 3 the majority of programs were located in canada within canadian programs most were located in ontario the major foci of the included studies are depicted in fig 4 with most studies examining water quality or the importance of uniting jurisdictions while some topics have been investigated over the course of decades e g water quality funding and uniting jurisdictions others have only recently been examined in particular topics pertaining to the consideration of indigenous culture and sovereignty and communities capacity have only been examined in recent years 3 3 most swp programs in the stage of initiation many studies broadly defined their programs as watershed 2 30 6 7 or source water protection 14 30 46 7 programs only a small number of programs were defined by the particular source water they protect i e groundwater 3 30 10 or surface water 6 30 20 protection programs table 4 describes the characteristics of source water protection programs reported in the included studies in terms of program stage at the time of study publication very few studies report that swp programs are in the midst of certain stages of implementation such as resource characterization contaminant studies risk assessment and monitoring fig 5 3 4 little indigenous involvement in swp governance the majority of studies 17 30 56 7 reported that the swp programs described were mandated by a governing body such as a federal provincial or state government six of thirty 20 studies indicated that the programs were not mandated by a governing body and seven studies 23 3 did not mention whether or not the programs were mandated many studies reported that water protection programs were operated by the state or province 14 30 46 7 interestingly eight studies 26 7 described swp programs that were operated by an indigenous group watershed groups 7 30 23 3 and federal government departments e g the epa 7 30 23 3 were also reported as bodies that operate the swp programs see table 5 the reported degree of involvement of indigenous populations in the governance of the swp programs varied widely across the included studies many studies indicated that indigenous groups were engaged as stakeholders in a similar manner that a citizen group might be engaged in a program 13 30 43 3 some studies indicated that opportunities existed for indigenous populations to participate in the program but did not report that participation was taking place 3 30 10 other studies reported that swp programs planned to engage indigenous populations in the future 6 30 20 and nearly a quarter of studies mentioned the inclusion of indigenous groups but did not specify how they were engaged 7 30 23 3 few studies indicated that indigenous groups played a substantial role in the governance of swp programs for instance two studies reported that indigenous groups were engaged as partners 6 7 two studies indicated indigenous groups were engaged as partners with substantial influence on the process 6 7 and three studies described swp programs that were operated by and for indigenous populations 10 3 5 few reported improvements in water quality or quantity the majority of studies were focused on non technical outcomes such as inter jurisdictional collaborations 10 30 33 3 swp plan completion or implementation 5 30 16 7 legislation that supports swp 3 30 10 economic outcomes 2 30 6 7 and changes in polluter behaviour 5 30 16 7 however nearly a quarter of studies focused on improvements in water quality 7 30 23 3 only a few studies identified water quantity 3 30 10 and ecological outcomes 3 30 10 as outcomes of interest the degree to which these outcomes of interest were measured and reported in the included studies is summarized in table 6 3 6 challenges and limitations of swp programs inter jurisdictional partnerships most studies described challenges and or limitations of the swp programs 24 30 80 half of the included studies reported inter jurisdictional partnerships were a challenge for the swp programs 15 30 50 while inter jurisdictional collaboration was cited as a priority for many programs in practice such partnerships were often described as difficult to achieve prominent inter jurisdictional issues included gaps in water protection responsibilities fragmented implementation actions at local levels power imbalances competing interests and difficulties integrating information from different sources engaging indigenous communities and non indigenous stakeholders in the swp process was also cited as a challenge in several studies 7 30 23 3 and 7 30 23 3 respectively reported issues ranged from low attendance at public meetings to difficulties with consensus building and the infringement of indigenous rights knowledge integration i e the integration of indigenous and technical knowledge or the harmonization of indigenous and western governance approaches to swp was only cited as a limitation in two studies 6 7 five studies 16 7 reported a lack of time and or human resources as a major limitation to swp and ten studies 33 3 cited a lack of funding as a considerable challenge to swp programs only a few studies cited a lack of technical data e g up to date watershed information and groundwater usage data as a challenge 4 30 13 3 policy and governance issues were also identified as a limiting factor to the success of swp programs in many articles 10 30 33 3 both the fragmentation and outright lack of swp policies legal mechanisms and regulations were reported to result in lower levels of water protection some studies reported that issues of scale have limited the success of swp programs 5 30 16 7 broad policies that lacked the flexibility to reflect local contexts and narrow policies that only aimed to protect specific areas e g the reserve versus the watershed scale were both identified as problematic only three studies 10 reported that the implementation of swp plans was a challenge and two studies 6 7 reported that a lack of environmental metrics demonstrating the effectiveness of swp implementation was a limitation of existing swp programs 4 discussion 4 1 overview of included studies two themes emerged from the results of this scoping review first the results demonstrate that there is a lack of technical peer reviewed studies of swp programs that are inclusive of indigenous populations in canada and the united states few studies focus on the scientific aspects of swp programs vieux et al 1998 goulding and hu 2009 and in particular there is a poor level of reporting on the ecological outcomes of the swp programs for example it is surprising that only one study reported water quality improvements were observed as a result of a swp program gray et al 2001 given that water quality in particular was the most frequently cited focus of the programs this may be attributed to the lack of studies describing programs that have actually been implemented most included studies describe programs in the early stages of development such as initiation bourne and blette 1998 brady 1996 cook 2016 cook 1997 mcculley 2002 patrick 2011 sanders 2013 scharfenaker 2002 shrubsole 2004 walters et al 2012 however few studies mention the measurement of ecological metrics at all either as a future goal of the program or as a limitation brady 1996 kellogg 1997 mcculley 2002 it is and will continue to be difficult to assess the effectiveness of swp programs without the measurement of environmental metrics brady 1996 the results of this review also indicate that overall both a the depth in which the literature describes indigenous involvement in swp programs is lacking and b the quality of indigenous involvement in the programs is fairly poor studies describe program challenges and goals in regards to indigenous involvement but few provide solutions for example several studies indicate that engaging indigenous communities has proven difficult armitage et al 2015 longboat 2013 owen et al 2008 robins 2007 shrubsole 2004 walters et al 2012 white et al 2012 yet few studies discuss the integration of western and indigenous knowledge and governance approaches indigenous governments have called for swp processes that are inclusive of indigenous peoples indigenous knowledge and indigenous governance principles in each stage of the swp process from conceptualization to implementation lavalley 2006 afn 2012 indigenous inclusion in swp is a critical component of providing indigenous communities with clean drinking water particularly since federal strategies focused on water and wastewater treatment upgrades have not addressed poor drinking water quality in many indigenous communities collins et al 2017 swp studies published more recently have increasingly touched on important indigenous issues such as indigenous culture and sovereignty longboat 2013 white et al 2012 capacity building hill et al 2008 walters et al 2012 and bridging knowledge systems armitage et al 2015 longboat 2013 simpson et al 2015 however this is an area that requires further study 4 2 recommendations based on the results of this scoping review there are few peer reviewed studies on swp programs that are inclusive of indigenous populations in canada and the united states and given the drinking water challenges indigenous communities face it is recommended that more peer reviewed studies be published on the topic in particular this scoping review has demonstrated that there is need for studies that focus on the scientific aspects of programs contaminant studies resource characterization risk assessment monitoring and that report on programs in later stages such as post implementation there is a need for studies that examine the effectiveness of different styles of programs in terms of water quality or quantity improvements and other important ecological outcomes brady 1996 an increase in evaluation studies on the topic would allow reviews of the literature to synthesize data across studies assess the progress of swp programs and make effective recommendations there is also a need for studies to explicitly examine the impacts of swp programs on non technical outcomes such as swp education and awareness polluter behaviour and other outcomes this scoping review has also demonstrated that there is a need for better reporting in the literature on the nature of indigenous involvement in swp programs and how well the program designs are working for indigenous communities what benefits are indigenous communities gaining from the programs what impacts do the programs have on water quality or quantity in indigenous communities and shared watersheds what approaches and technologies have or have not worked what needs improvement in terms of indigenous involvement in swp programs there is a need for approaches that recognize indigenous peoples as partners lavalley 2006 afn 2012 for existing swp policies and programs there is a need to create flexibility in policy and program structure to engage indigenous groups more appropriately walters et al 2012 opening dialogue to re examine areas deemed problematic by indigenous communities e g infringements of indigenous rights providing funding and training for indigenous personnel and providing longer decision making timeframes for overburdened communities may be required among other options collins et al 2017 mcclaren 2003 there may be opportunities to take cues from successful programs that have been formed on partnerships between indigenous governments and other governing bodies and organizations such as in the northwest territories armitage et al 2015 robins 2007 there may also be opportunities to take the lead from swp programs that are inclusive of indigenous populations but were outside of the scope of this review such as programs in new zealand or australia for example jackson 2013 there is a need for research that identifies indigenous inclusive inter jurisdictional water protection success stories from which swp practitioners can build or refine their programs lastly several of the swp program limitations identified in the included studies are common to a wide variety of inter jurisdictional policies and programs nowlan and bakker 2007 halbe et al 2013 meadows 2008 these challenges include issues of scale armitage et al 2015 brady 1996 walters et al 2012 white et al 2012 the engagement of stakeholders bourne et al 1995 gray et al 2001 gullick 2003 patrick 2011 robins 2007 shrubsole 2004 simpson et al 2015 the integration of information longboat 2013 and policy and governance bourne et al 1995 gray et al 2001 hill et al 2008 kellogg 1997 krantzberg 2008 mcculley 2002 patrick 2011 plummer et al 2011 robins 2007 it is here that there are opportunities for swp researchers and practitioners to look outside the box and pull from innovations in other fields such as post normal science and systems engineering funtowicz and ravetz 1993 meadows 2008 marshall and farahbakhsh 2013 studies examining the structure and dynamics of swp policies and programs from new perspectives have the potential to provide new insights to the complex field of swp 4 3 strengths and limitations of this scoping review this review provides a rigorous systematic and transparent examination of the range extent and nature of swp programs in canada and the united states that are inclusive of indigenous communities it followed a protocol that was reviewed by a research team with knowledge of the content and the scoping review methodology the application of this rigorous scoping review methodology is new in the fields of water resources and environmental engineering and has not been employed to map the literature on swp this study provides readers with a template to conduct scoping reviews which are rapidly growing in popularity across a number of fields pham et al 2014 and slow to emerge but needed in hydrology and engineering it also provides new insights on peer reviewed swp literature gaps swp program limitations and provides direction to inform research policy and practice while the review included studies published in english spanish and french there may have been other relevant peer reviewed studies published in languages that were not included in this review the use of search terms in english only may have also limited the number of french and spanish studies that were included however non english articles are indexed in english in all databases used to conduct this review limiting the search to swp programs in canada and the united states may also have eliminated relevant studies additionally the interpretation of included studies was subject to reviewer bias however all articles were screened independently by two reviewers while the search for this review included the use of a consistent search algorithm in three multidisciplinary databases time constraints prevented the inclusion of a gray literature search the gray literature may contain more information on swp programs in later stages of development such as post implementation e g in reports from governments and environmental organizations aandc 2014 burt 2014 khan 2015 rcac 2017 5 conclusions this scoping review mapped the extent range and nature of the published peer reviewed literature on the adoption implementation and outcomes of source water protection programs in canada and the united states that are inclusive of indigenous communities a rigorous systematic transparent and replicable two stage screening process with inclusion and exclusion criteria was used to identify relevant studies the methodology presented in this paper provides a template for researchers in environmental fields such as hydrology to identify and review published literature in a systematic transparent and rigorous manner this review identified the need for peer reviewed studies to focus on the technical aspects of source water protection programs that are inclusive of indigenous populations and that describe the involvement of indigenous communities in more detail in terms of source water protection programs the quality of indigenous involvement in source water protection programs is not substantial and there is a need to create flexibility in policy and program structure to engage indigenous groups more appropriately there are opportunities for source water protection researchers and practitioners alike to transfer existing findings and experiences from other fields with innovations in inter jurisdictional partnerships to move forward as nations around the world work towards the development of environmental policies that are inclusive of indigenous populations it is important that existing programs with their strengths and limitations be represented in the peer reviewed literature it is the hope that this scoping review provides evidence to inform the development and improvement of source water protection policies programs and research that are more inclusive of indigenous voices acknowledgements the authors would

7228,land use and land cover lulc changes intrinsically lead to various hydrological impacts especially on the outflow rate of the watersheds this research investigated lulc changes and its effect on outlet runoff by detecting lulc changes location and severity via an inverse method for the little river watershed usa for this purpose the clark s conceptual rainfall runoff model was applied to the delineated sub watersheds of the basin to generate different outflows by altering the storage coefficient sc of the model for each sub watershed as the representative of lulc then the relation between sc values and outflow time series was simulated by artificial intelligence ai based models of artificial neural network and least square support vector machine in this way in order to ignore redundant information and reduce the dimension of input vector wavelet entropy we values of the outflow sub series were computed and used as the inputs of the ai model to compute scs of the sub watersheds as the outputs the trained multi output ai model as an inverse method could be then used to predict the sc values as representative of lulc of the sub watersheds using the observed time series of runoff at the outlet the obtained results showed that the proposed inverse method could reliably detect not only the location but also the severity of lulc changes by prediction of sc values in the coming future years for validation of the method a comparison was also performed between the obtained results and recorded changes via normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and land use classification extracted from landsat images the comparison approved the ability of the proposed method for lulc change detection in a way that deforestation and cropland increasing of the sub watersheds from 1990 to 2013 were aligned with the sc reduction e g 26 decrease of sc for downstream sub watershed versus 53 decrease and 21 increase of forest and crop lands respectively keywords watershed land use change clark s conceptual rainfall runoff model artificial intelligence wavelet entropy normalized difference vegetation index little river watershed 1 introduction land use and land cover lulc change of a watershed is a major challenge in hydro environmental studies to extent of which is affected by numerous factors inside and outside the watershed unsuitable practices of lulc such as deforestation uncontrolled and unnecessary pasturing agriculture development and urban expansion are deteriorating watershed conditions at different temporal and spatial scales agaton et al 2016 lulc changes in watersheds could have undeniable effects on the quantity and quality of water as well as the ecosystem of the basin which in turn can impact the human life detection of lulc changes at different spatio temporal scales is a complicated task affected by different anthropogenic and natural factors various studies have been conducted regarding the watershed change analysis through different methods mostly using satellite imaginary remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis tools e g see oñate valdivieso and bosque sendra 2010 persendt and gomez 2016 welde and gebremariam 2017 diamantini et al 2018 haque and basak 2017 and choudhary et al 2017 detected the lulc changes of watersheds via distributed models and ndvi one of the main hydrological responses of a watershed to such lulc changes can be seen in the outlet flow e g see nie et al 2011 saeidifarzad et al 2014 niraula et al 2015 nourani and saeidifarzad 2016 although the utilization of satellite data as a forward problem is a commonly used method for lulc change detection this method may include some deficiencies such as the blurbification of images due to cloudy weather cost time consuming procedure of the rs productions or from the temporal point of view sometimes it is possible that the satellite images are not available in this condition inverse solution of the problem can be considered as an alternative generally the scientific procedures to investigate physical systems can be divided into the following three types tarantola 2005 i parameterization of the system detection of a minimal group of model factors whose values fully describe the system from a given point of view ii forward problem discovery of the physical laws allowing us for given values of the model parameters to make predictions on the outcomes of measurements on some observable parameters iii inverse problem use of the real outcomes of some measurements of the observable parameters to infer the actual values related to the model parameters the inverse problem is subjected to determine the unknown model parameters using the experiential state data the inverse technique is one of the key methods at different fields such as structural damage detection e g see fang et al 2005 wang et al 2017 physics e g see meng et al 2015 davin et al 2017 hydrogeology e g see zhou et al 2014 hydraulic and hydrology e g see kretzschmar et al 2014 bhattacharjya 2011 presented a simple spreadsheet cell oriented methodology for solving a groundwater flow inverse problem pan and wood 2013 developed a methodology to invert the routing process i e to derive the spatially distributed runoff from streamflow by inverting a linear routing model using fixed interval kretzschmar et al 2014 combined a continuous time transfer function model with regularized derivative estimates obtained using a recursive method for estimation of catchment sub hourly rainfall from the measured streamflows in some hydrological studies the parameters of a model that converts the rainfall to runoff are assumed to be constant over time but in practice these parameters may be altered due to lulc changes over time in other words there is a need for a method to analyze the input output relationship of rainfall runoff r r and to identify physical changes within the watershed by solving an inverse problem and without conducting direct observations in this study a novel method is introduced to determine the location and severity of lulc changes in the little river watershed lrw to the best of our knowledge there is not any inverse method using the distributed semi distributed or black box models for lulc change detection in this regard artificial intelligence ai based methods of artificial neural network ann and least square support vector machine lssvm are used to extract the relationship between lulc changes and outflows of the watershed firstly r r modeling is performed via hydrologic engineering center hydrologic modeling system hec hms using clark s conceptual model and extracted geomorphologic information for the lrw as a linear reservoir then by altering storage coefficient sc values of sub watersheds in the clark model sc is considered as a lumped parameter that represents lulc of each sub watershed such presumption that considers a lumped parameter as representative of the lulc of the hydrologic units of the watershed has been proposed in some other studies e g bronstert 2005 dwarakish and ganasri 2015 si et al 2017 different outflow time series are generated in the next step the relationship between generated outflows time series and related scs is created by the multi output ai models to estimate the severity and location of lulc variations represented by sc values to prevent imposing a large amount of information whole outflow time series wavelet entropy we values of each time series are computed and imposed into the ai models instead of whole outflow time series finally the trained model can be used to detect the lulc changes of the lrw for the future years therefore by this proposed inverse method lulc changes will be detectable just by analyzing runoff time series in the coming years for the validation purpose the obtained results are also compared with the recorded changes via ndvi and land use classification extracted from the landsat images because sc and ndvi values do not have same order and dimension in the validation step the validation rate of each with regard to the base year is computed and compared with together 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data set the experimental lrw is a 334 km2 watershed located in the gulf atlantic coastal plain area inside the suwannee basin in south central georgia fig 1 the area has low topographic relief and its characterization is performed through wide smooth alluvial floodplains river terraces and mildly sloping uplands this is a humid region with low gradient drainage networks and wide poorly defined channel systems with dense dendritic streams and heavily vegetated flood plains and riparian areas a primary shallow water resistant layer forces infiltration of water to flow laterally causing many leaks and the characteristically dense drainage network the watershed is as same as other hybrid use agricultural watersheds of the central coastal plain the characterization of middle coastal plain is performed through producing the crop on moderately to well drained upland soils and riparian forests and wetlands on poorly and very poorly drained soils along streams all base flow is between 60 and 70 because of shallow groundwater flow rainfall is randomly distributed during the year with the maximum rainfall taking place from january until march and from june until august most pastureland is applied for cow calf operations the forested regions are in upland pine forest both natural regeneration and pine plantation and riparian forest natural regeneration which is mainly wetland table 1 summarizes the geomorphological characteristics of the lrw the used r r time series for the 1990 1995 2003 2010 and 2013 were obtained from ftp www tiftonars org databases lrew where in the base year 1990 r r data used for calibration of hec hms and generation of different outflow time series for training ai models fig 2 and by the data of the rest years 1995 2003 2010 and 2013 the trained models were used to simulate scs of the sub watersheds for the validation purpose also mann kendall test see parveen and sreekesh 2018 for details of this test showed that the trend of rainfall and temperature and consequently evapotranspiration in the study period was less than 2 in the lrw and therefore it was considered that the changes in scs over time is mostly related to the lulc changes but if there would be a significant trend in climatological parameters instantaneous unit hydrograph iuh models may be used it should be noted that although other minor physical factors involved in r r process may also impact the sc values their annual mean values in a long term horizon are almost constant over the basin and consequently it is a logic assumption that the rate of lulc changes will have a direct relationship with a variation of sc parameter furthermore as shown in fig 1 the delineation of lrw and extraction of sub watersheds were performed in order to estimate the severity and location of lulc changes in each sub watershed by the proposed method in this way the lrw was divided into 8 sub watersheds via gis tools using the 30 meter cell size digital elevation model dem of watershed available at http earthexplorer usgs gov it is worth noting that the watershed may be further divided into more sub watersheds for making more accurate modeling for the validation purpose the land sat images for the considered years were also used to compute the change of ndvi and comparison with the changes of scs obtained by the proposed inverse method the satellite images of the study region were obtained via https earthexplorer usgs gov and preprocessed in order to achieve the objectives of the tm5 and landsat 8 images chang and bai 2018 2 2 proposed methodology in this research gis framework hec hms ai models i e ann and lssvm we measure and rs productions were used to investigate and detect lulc changes of sub watersheds via proposed inverse method the flowchart of the proposed methodology is shown by fig 3 at first step geomorphologic features of sub watersheds were extracted in gis and then the r r modeling was conducted by hec hms based on conceptual clark model then using the observed runoff time series an optimization procedure was performed to calibrate the sub watersheds sc parameters in hec hms in the subsequent step using monte carlo method garrote et al 2009 different runoff time series were produced by altering the calibrated sc values of the sub watersheds the generated time series were decomposed into sub series by wavelet transform wt and the entropy e of each sub series was computed to be imposed into the ann and lssvm models to find the relationship between outlet runoff and the sc values of the sub watersheds in this way instead of entering whole runoff time series qt with duration of 365 days for each years just l 1 values of we for the decomposed time series at level l an approximation sub series qa and l detailed sub series qd1 qdl are obtained via wt were fed to the ai models as the runoff time series agent to avoid interruption of network training fig 4 the obtained relationship by ann and lssvm models was then used to predict the conceptual parameters of sub watersheds i e sc of the conceptual clark model for the future years finally the outcomes of the ann and lssvm models were compared with those from ndvi data for validation of lulc change in each sub watershed in the following sub sections the components of the proposed method are explained separately 2 3 hec hms model hec hms model was developed by hydrologic engineering center hec of us army corps of engineers as a new version for hec 1 which is commonly used for hydrologic simulations usace 2013 to implement hec hms model four modules of meteorology basin model time series data and control specifications should be defined next step is to execute flood hydrographs and rainfall hyetographs in meteorological module while simulation time period and time step are needed for control specifications in this study soil conversation service curve number scs cn clark and muskingum methods were adopted for estimating hydrologic losses rainfall transforming to runoff and flow routing in reaches respectively while a sub watershed element conceptually represents infiltration surface runoff and subsurface processes interacting together the actual surface runoff calculations are performed by a transform method contained within the sub watershed the clark unit hydrograph used in this study is a synthetic unit hydrograph method that the resulting translation hydrograph is routed through a linear reservoir to account for storage attenuation effects across the sub watershed in this method the time of concentration tc defines the maximum travel time in the sub watershed it is used in the development of the translation hydrograph in addition the sc is used in the linear reservoir that accounts for storage effects the clark unit hydrograph was recognized as the most suitable method for this study while it considers storage attenuation effects across the sub watershed that can incorporate lulc changes via sc parameter the tc and sc are the main parameters of the clark s model which were identified using optimization technique in this study where sc and tc can be related by straub et al 2000 1 cs sc sc tc in this study since the cs divided by the sum of tc and sc is reasonably constant over the lrw eq 1 by calibration of sc and tc in hec hms for base year of 1990 after prediction of sc parameters in coming years tc parameter will be available via eq 1 for each sub watershed two parameters of muskingum routing method are xm and km of sub watersheds that can be predicted using cross section data as chow et al 1988 2 km l 3600 cr 3 xm 1 2 1 q b s cr l where q is discharge cms cr is flood wave speed m s l refers to length of channel m b presents top width of flood area m and s refers slope of bed m m usace 2013 km xm tc and sc parameters of the sub watersheds should be calibrated by the optimization module of hec hms model via daily r r data for the base year of 1990 2 4 wavelet entropy we in order to establish the relationship between the outflow from the watershed and the rate of change in the parameters of conceptual clark model and consequently the severity of lulc change we values of outflow time series were computed and imposed into the ai models to avoid importing the whole outflow time series that would interrupt network training in this way the outflow time series q were decomposed by wt at level l into l 1 sub series one approximation sub series qa which denotes to overall trend and l detailed sub series qda qd2 qdl each representing a specific scale and periodicity of the time series and then the entropy of each sub series was computed and used as input of the ai models consequently instead of entering the entire time series for example 365 for daily time series of a year for the decomposed time series at level l here l 5 just l 1 values of we were imposed into the ai models as the representative of whole time series for this purpose time series are decomposed at a desired level through wt then shannon entropy of the associated energies is computed at each level m m 1 2 l 1 as nourani et al 2015 4 we m u 1 u ρ u ln ρ u where the ρ is the pdf probability density function of the normalized wavelet energies of sub series at level m and u is total bin number of the pdf for detail about the effect of bin number on we see nourani et al 2015 shannon entropy has been considered as a measure of the degree of uncertainty tranquility and redundancy the entropy of a signal will be high when it includes more random values with more irregularity thus the we can be considered to measure the degree of order disorder of a signal giving sufficient data about the underlying dynamical procedure related to the signal rosso and mairal 2002 the superiority of shanon entropy with regard to other measures such as variance has been reported by several studies e g ebrahimi et al 1999 since unlike variance which measures concentration only around the mean entropy measures diffuseness of the pdf irrespective of the location of concentration therefore we used in this study as representative of whole time series can consider both seasonality by wt and irregularity by entropy of the process 2 5 multi output ai models in this research two multi output ai models of ann and lssvm with different attitudes were applied for creating relationship between watershed s runoff and lulc changes where ann is a very commonly used ai models in water resources engineering and lssvm could recently get more attention of the hydrologists the neural network used in this research was a three layer feed forward perceptron input layer hidden layer and output layer trained by the back propagation algorithm the lssvm model is a soft margin type that is generalized to nonlinear mode and is usable at different fields of water engineering nourani et al 2017 to speed up training ai models the inputs and outputs data were normalized before using in the training step 2 5 1 multi output ann mann a typical multi input multi output mimo three layer feed forward neural network mann contains m input nodes l hidden nodes and n output nodes let the input hidden output and target output vectors be denoted by x h o and t respectively w 1 ij is the weight between the hidden node i and the output node j and w 2 ij is the weight between the input node i and the hidden layer j 5 x m 1 bpnn o n 1 or x v o v v 1 2 v where v is the number of the training pattern i e training inputs and their corresponding training outputs see hines 1997 for more details 2 5 2 multi output lssvm mlssvm mlssvm is extended form of lssvm the main characteristics and the procedure for lssvm and mlssvm are similar suykens and vandewalle 1999 when mlssvm is used for multi output regression given a set of training data points as xi yi i 1 n where xi rm is the input data yi rl is the output and n is the size of training data set a constrained optimization problem needs to be solved utilizing training the lssvm by employing kernel functions the most widely used kernel function is radial basis function rbf k x y exp x y 2 2 σ 2 where σ 2 is the kernel parameter it should be noted that inputs and outputs of the mlssvm are same as the mann in this study see suykens and vandewalle 1999 for more details 2 6 remote sensing rs clarification of lulc changes is a process that allows observing and recognizing the differentiation of phenomena and patterns of the earth over the time one of the key steps in the procedure of detecting changes is to select appropriate data for the desired time interval the high quality of satellite imagery and lack of cloud cover in the data are important in preparing land cover maps tommervik et al 2003 the processed red band 3 and nir band 4 images are applied for calculating ndvi value for the study region as rouse et al 1974 6 ndvi p nir p red p nir p red the mean ndvi value indicates the mean of ndvis in all pixels of land cover image of the watershed it should be noted that the negative amounts of the pixels water bodies reduce the mean values of ndvi as these negative values exist in all images they would affect all images during the whole study period and as a result the mean values would be comparable the classification of images was done by the supervised classification in envi software at this stage the images were classified after corrections i e image preparation geometric correction radiometric correction and atmospheric correction as well as entering experimental points using the maximum similarity method chang and bai 2018 land use map and classification of the lrw are presented in figs 5 and 6 respectively that show classification in five major groups of water wetland urban pasture crop and forest furthermore ndvi maps of the lrw derived from classification procedure of the satellite images are shown in fig 7 for years of 1990 and 2013 that ndvi values vary between 0 5 and 0 88 2 7 evaluation of model precision the determination coefficient dc and root mean square error rmse as two different criteria were employed for evaluating the performance of ai models the dc and rmse can be used for indicating differences between predictions and recorded values legates and mccabe 1999 revealed that hydro environmental models could be sufficiently assessed by these criteria as eqs 7 and 8 7 dc 1 i 1 t sc hec hms i sc com i 2 i 1 t sc hec hms i sc hec hms 2 8 rmse i 1 t sc hec hms i sc com i 2 t where t sc hec hms i sc com i and sc hec hms are number of data sc calibrated by hec hms sc computed by ai model and mean of sc parameters of hec hms respectively 3 results and discussion the results of the proposed inverse method to detect the watershed lulc changes using hybrid conceptual r r and ai models are presented in the following sub section thereafter the obtained results of the proposed inverse method are compared with the satellite images 3 1 results of the proposed inverse method in this study the proposed inverse method contains three main steps in the first step the r r process of lrw is modeled by hec hms utilizing r r data of base year 1990 geomorphological parameters extracted by gis tools in the second step different runoff time series are generated via hec hms of the lrw by variation of sub watersheds sc parameter using monte carlo method and then we values of each time series are computed in the third step a relation is created between sc and we of generated runoff time series via ai models where this relation we sc is employed then for detection the sub watersheds sc in coming years the results of all stages are presented in the following sub sections 3 1 1 results of hec hms calibration r r of the lrw was modeled in hec hms according to the delineated sub watersheds for base year of 1990 fig 1 the area of the lrw was mapped in hec hms according to the skeletal structure of the sub watersheds then necessary information was prepared for the hec hms in the base year of 1990 according to the section 2 3 conceptual clark model was used for transforming of rainfall to runoff in hec hms slope and area of the sub watersheds were obtained by gis tools based on the hydrologic soil groups the cn values were calculated using an unsupervised classification followed by a supervised classification of 1990 tm 5 image and constant value method was considered as the base flow chow et al 1988 these values were validated using field check activities reasonable results were obtained from the classification where it was compared with the obtained cn of lrw by slack and welch 1980 i e a qualitative comparison was performed so that for sub watershed including more urbanized region higher values of cn were obtained for both years of 1990 and 1980 as per the natural resources conservation service cn tables and other relevant data cn values of the lrw sub watersheds are presented in table 1 furthermore muskingum flow routing parameters tc and sc of the sub watersheds were calibrated by the optimization module of hec hms model using daily r r data of base year tables 1 where 21 events were used for optimization step 15 events for training and 6 events for validation the generated outflow from calibrated hec hms and observed outflow are shown in fig 8 for the base year 1990 after optimization of hec hms parameters befitting of sub watersheds sc can be discussed according to the geomorphological and land cover factors table 1 figs 5 and 6 as an instance sub watershed b has the highest value of sc compared to the other sub watersheds due to its large area sub watershed o includes more forested area and less crop and pastureland cover compared to the sub watershed n so it could be allocated high sc value but because of higher channel slope of sub watershed o both of these sub watersheds got almost similar scs table 1 also sub watershed k despite of its higher channel slope with regard to the sub watershed i has higher sc due to its large area and forest density 3 1 2 computation of we values after r r modeling of the lrw by hec hms for base year of 1990 the impact of lulc changes on the response of the lrw could be investigated by the proposed inverse method but most of the inverse problems are ill posed and they cannot be solved unless certain assumptions and reducing the number of unknown parameters are considered zhou et al 2014 so the main assumption of this research as mentioned in section 2 1 was that the magnitude of lulc changes only impacts the sc parameter of each sub watershed as a lumped parameter and consequently tc eq 1 and other parameters like muskingum parameters were kept fixed with changes in sc values for the sub watersheds with different combinations different outflow runoffs for lrw were obtained via the calibrated hec hms so that multiple sc quantities and combinations were obtained based on the generation of random numbers after r r modeling of the lrw by hec hms and generating various types of runoff time series with duration of 365 days by changing the sc values of sub watersheds it was possible to establish an interspecific relationship between the values of sc hence lulc changes and different outlet runoff time series whereas sc runoff relationship should be able to provide a meaningful connection between lulc changes and outlet runoff this relationship needs to have specific characteristics such as accuracy simplicity applicability and ability to generalize for future the simulation of the relationship between sc runoff values was carried out through mimo ai models of mann and mlssvm in order to create such relationship the generated outflow runoff time series of the basin were used as inputs and the sc values of the sub watersheds were considered as the outputs of the ai models however a problem in terms of both modeling and hydrology appears in the input data of the model in terms of modeling the input layer of the model includes several outflow time series with duration of 365 days which could lead to disruption of model training from a hydrologic perspective the generated runoff time series have extremities in different days of the year in which the extreme points in specific months of 1990 maybe not be in the same days in the coming years e g 2013 this hydrologic problem prevents the generalization of the model created from 1990 to years to come to solve both of the hydrological and modeling problems of the input layer we was used to represent not only the entire time series by only a few numbers but also to solve the problem of extremism generated per day solving this problem could enable the model to be extended for many years to come to increase the accuracy and efficiency of the model and before calculating the entropy of the outlet runoff its periodic properties were extracted using wt so to handle such seasonal features of the runoff time series of the lrw wt was attached to the model for improving the sc runoff simulation appropriate mother wavelet mw selection has produced a challenge in hybrid wavelet ai modeling since the type of the utilized mw can affect the modeling outcomes the essence of wt is to determine the similarity between the analyzed time series and used wavelet prototype and because of the coif2 mw structure which is nearly like the runoff signal compared to other mws like db2 and db5 it could capture the signal s traits well and was selected as mw for decomposition of runoff time series in this study nourani and andalib 2015 additionally the appropriate decomposition level in wavelet ai models is generally acquired through sensitivity analysis see nourani and parhizkar 2013 for more details whereas runoff of the lrw has considered with duration of 365 days the decomposition level 5 containing 5 details as 21 day mode d1 first sub series with high frequency 22 day mode d2 second sub series 23 day mode d3 third sub series nearly weekly 24 day mode d4 4th sub series 25 day mode d5 5th sub series nearly monthly and one approximate signal was considered as suitable level for the decomposition of the runoff time series of the lrw therefore the dependency of seasonal and scale of the procedure could be controlled through the model for each sub watershed different sc values were generated via monte carlo method with normal distribution i e 12 sc values for the smallest watershed and 20 sc values for the largest one with considering calibrated sc values for 1990 as mean of distribution and different standard deviations for each watershed because the larger sub watershed the more heterogeneous lulc and consequently a higher degree of uncertainly which should be represented by a diverse number of sc values see table 2 and fig 9 thereafter different combinations of the generated sc values were set in hec hms for producing about 500 runoff time series however it is argued that if instead of the entire time series in the ai model we values of time series are used would the variation of the sc values affect the we of the outflow runoff of the basin area moreover if so what is the extent of this impact to answer these questions and investigate the unique impact of each sub watershed on the we of the outflow runoff the sc values of all sub watersheds were kept constant in its original value except one then the sc value of that sub watershed was changed the corresponding runoff time series was obtained from the hec hms and this procedure was repeated for all sub watersheds then the we values of time series were computed the obtained results certified when the value of sc changes in the sub watershed m the entropy values of all sub series except one d5 as the lowest frequency are almost kept constant in addition in sub watershed o the entropy value is changed only for the d1 sub series for the largest sub watershed b all entropy values are also altered therefore it could be concluded that in sub watersheds far from the outlet of the lrw the entropy of the sub series with low frequency components and for the sub watersheds near to the outlet of the lrw the entropy of the sub series with high frequency components are markedly changed with alternation of the sc values furthermore it should be noted that sc changes showed very insignificant effect on 26 day and 27 day modes so this reconfirms befitting of l 5 as the optimum level for decomposition of the generated runoff time series 3 1 3 results of ai modeling whereas the ai models cannot extrapolate necessarily at least the boundary of the problem domain should be covered by the training patterns therefore 500 random sc samples were generated for different sub watersheds as outputs and related wes of outflow time series of hec hms were considered as inputs of the ai models then we sc relationship was modeled by two different ai models of mann and mlssvm where 375 samples 75 of 500 samples were used for training of the ai models and the rest 25 of 500 samples for validation purpose the results of we sc modeling by both of ai models approved the existence of robust depending between inputs outputs dc validation 0 97 the comparison of mlssvm and mann performance can help the admissibility of we sc relation after creation of we sc relation it was used for detection of sub watersheds sc values in upcoming years table 3 shows expansion of we sc relation for the 1990 1995 2003 2010 and 2013 years utilizing mann and mlssvm models mlssvm and mann led to a bit different performance where in large area sub watersheds mllssvm showed better performance compared to mann due to its ability in classification of distinct information factors e g in small sub watersheds like m k and i urban land has low effect in lulc change so the number of effective lulc factors reduces from five to four see fig 6 and table 3 furthermore for the base year of 1990 mann model showed that we sc has a robust relation compared to the e sc due to covering the seasonality feature of r r process table 3 according to the evaluation criterion of dc sc detection in coming years reveals acceptable outcomes compared to the calibrated hec hms in those years see table 3 and fig 10 as it is seen in fig 11 according to the results of mlssvm model also mann sc is not changed linearly from 1990 to 2013 it shows increasing of sc from 1990 to 2003 and reduction of sc from 2003 to 2013 but overall sc shows a decreasing trend from 1990 to 2013 furthermore each sub watershed had its unique behavior lulc change for instance sc of sub watershed f increased 21 from 1990 to 2003 and decreased 23 from 2003 to 2013 but in sub watershed b sc is increased 7 from 1990 to 2003 and then is decreased 22 from 2003 to 2013 finally sc values of sub watersheds f and b decreased about 7 and 17 from 1990 to 2013 respectively the reasons of such behaviors are discussed in the following sub section 3 2 validation of inverse method by landsat images land use classification and ndvi classification map of the lrw were derived from the satellite images as it is seen in land use map and classification figs 5 and 6 in the north of the lrw which has high elevation above mean sea level compared to the outlet of the lrw total forest cover has more density and crop and pasture have a poor cover where by coming to the south proportion of the lulc is changed and the density of the crop and pasture lands is increased rather but in 2013 it is obvious that lulc type is changed perceptibly where this change is done from pecan and forest to crop and pasture lands with different areas in all sub watersheds which deforestation of the lrw to the crop and pasture is due to population increasing i e the south of usa is an important region from economical agricultural and social points of view but its quickly rising population adds water demand and environmental stress to its degraded ecosystem also ndvi classification maps of landsat tm5 image for the lrw in 1990 and landsat 8 for 2013 show that crop and pasture land are increased as mentioned in section 2 1 for cow calf operations and forest region is decreased fig 7 altogether with respect to the lulc changes of the lrw from 1990 to 2013 it is expected to have some changes in response of the lrw i e outlet runoff to this end a reliable identification of hydrologic reaction to soil physical characteristics such as saturated hydraulic conductivity bulk density and moisture retention will elucidate the outlet runoff value of sub watersheds these characteristics can impact sub watersheds hydrology by influencing pathways and transformation rates of rainfall to runoff networks in general infiltration rate and rainfall absorption of soils from highest to lowest are forested pasture cropland and urban where forested soils indicated significantly smaller bulk masses and greater infiltration rates and water holding capacities compared to cropland and pasture soils so due to deforestation of the lrw from 1990 to 2013 fig 6 and changing of water holding ability of the soil it is expected to see reduction of sc values of sub watersheds fig 12 shows correlation coefficient between lulc changes of the lrw versus sc changes from 1990 to 2013 for 8 sub watersheds as it is seen the reduction of sc values shows high correlation coefficient with the deforestation pasture and cropland increasing therefore it could be concluded that ai models are able to detect the severity and location of lulc changes by analyzing outlet runoff for coming years the inverse method shows 16 decrease of sc for sub watershed k versus respectively 35 decrease and 25 increase of forest and crop lands shown in land use classification map fig 6 also the method shows 26 decrease of sc for sub watershed o versus respectively 53 decrease and 21 increase of forest and crop lands fig 6 therefore it is confirmed that the assumption about representation of lulc changes by the sc changes is not far from reality since the lulc changes and scs variations both show similar trend for the sub watersheds according to this as it is seen in figs 11 and 12 because of sc increasing from 1990 to 2003 it is clear that forest density of the lrw was increased but after 2003 the forest density was replaced with deforestation i e crop and pastureland up to 2013 beside the interpretations between sc and deforestation it is necessary to find the local change of forest to other lulc and its effect on sc according to the results of table 4 as it is seen in table 4 sub watersheds n and b have same percentage of sc decreasing but with different deforestation percentages whereas in sub watershed n urbanization and pasture got 14 and 3 lulc changes respectively but for sub watershed b urbanization and pasture were allocated 7 and 14 of changes respectively so despite of more deforestation percentage of sub watershed b with regard to sub watershed n they have same percentage of sc decreasing due to low infiltration capacity of urban land with regard to pastureland furthermore sub watersheds f and i have similar percentage of deforestation and it is expected to have same percentage of sc decreasing but despite of this sub watershed i showed more percentage of sc decreasing than sub watershed f because most of the deforestation of sub watershed i led to cropland and as it is known cropland has lower infiltration rate and rainfall absorption with regard to pastureland in addition highest percentage of the deforestation and urbanization in sub watershed o made fig 5 it to have higher percentage of sc change with regard to the other sub watersheds 4 concluding remarks in this paper an inverse method was proposed for the lulc change detection of the lrw in georgia usa using proposed inverse method and considering only the observed outlet runoff time series of the watershed the severity and location of lulc changes could be detected with lower cost compared to the forward methods in the first step of the modeling the lrw was delineated into some sub watersheds in order to monitor the severity and location of lulc changes in each sub watershed thereafter the r r of the lrw was simulated in hec hms for the base year of 1990 utilizing conceptual clark model the change of sc parameter of the clark model for each sub watershed was assumed as the sub watershed lulc change and watershed was assumed as linear reservoir so by generation of random sc values for the sub watersheds via monte carlo method different outflow runoffs were obtained for the lrw via the calibrated hec hms then we of generated runoffs were computed to avoid presenting redundant information in creation of ai based runoff sc relationship the mathematical relation between we of runoff time series and sc values of the sub watersheds was then modeled by robust ai models of mann and mlssvm by extracted relation of we sc in 1990 sc values of sub watershed were predicted for 1995 2003 2010 and 2013 according to the evaluation criterion sc detection in coming years 2003 2010 and 2013 revealed acceptable outcomes compared to the calibrated hec hms in these years by the proposed method for the validation of sc detection in 2013 by ai models land use classification and ndvi of lrw were extracted for both years of 1990 and 2013 the deforestation and cropland increasing from 1990 to 2013 with different severities and in different locations of the lrw authenticated the true sc change detection by the proposed inverse method furthermore sc values of the sub watersheds in 3 middle years between 1990 and 2013 i e 1995 2003 and 2010 were detected where after investigation of their sc parameters it was deduced that the forest land had covered most of the lrw up to 2003 but after 2003 it started to deforestation whereas the south sub watersheds had high density of deforestation compared to the northern sub watersheds it should be noted that the application of the clark r r method here does not limit the capability of the proposed

7228,land use and land cover lulc changes intrinsically lead to various hydrological impacts especially on the outflow rate of the watersheds this research investigated lulc changes and its effect on outlet runoff by detecting lulc changes location and severity via an inverse method for the little river watershed usa for this purpose the clark s conceptual rainfall runoff model was applied to the delineated sub watersheds of the basin to generate different outflows by altering the storage coefficient sc of the model for each sub watershed as the representative of lulc then the relation between sc values and outflow time series was simulated by artificial intelligence ai based models of artificial neural network and least square support vector machine in this way in order to ignore redundant information and reduce the dimension of input vector wavelet entropy we values of the outflow sub series were computed and used as the inputs of the ai model to compute scs of the sub watersheds as the outputs the trained multi output ai model as an inverse method could be then used to predict the sc values as representative of lulc of the sub watersheds using the observed time series of runoff at the outlet the obtained results showed that the proposed inverse method could reliably detect not only the location but also the severity of lulc changes by prediction of sc values in the coming future years for validation of the method a comparison was also performed between the obtained results and recorded changes via normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and land use classification extracted from landsat images the comparison approved the ability of the proposed method for lulc change detection in a way that deforestation and cropland increasing of the sub watersheds from 1990 to 2013 were aligned with the sc reduction e g 26 decrease of sc for downstream sub watershed versus 53 decrease and 21 increase of forest and crop lands respectively keywords watershed land use change clark s conceptual rainfall runoff model artificial intelligence wavelet entropy normalized difference vegetation index little river watershed 1 introduction land use and land cover lulc change of a watershed is a major challenge in hydro environmental studies to extent of which is affected by numerous factors inside and outside the watershed unsuitable practices of lulc such as deforestation uncontrolled and unnecessary pasturing agriculture development and urban expansion are deteriorating watershed conditions at different temporal and spatial scales agaton et al 2016 lulc changes in watersheds could have undeniable effects on the quantity and quality of water as well as the ecosystem of the basin which in turn can impact the human life detection of lulc changes at different spatio temporal scales is a complicated task affected by different anthropogenic and natural factors various studies have been conducted regarding the watershed change analysis through different methods mostly using satellite imaginary remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis tools e g see oñate valdivieso and bosque sendra 2010 persendt and gomez 2016 welde and gebremariam 2017 diamantini et al 2018 haque and basak 2017 and choudhary et al 2017 detected the lulc changes of watersheds via distributed models and ndvi one of the main hydrological responses of a watershed to such lulc changes can be seen in the outlet flow e g see nie et al 2011 saeidifarzad et al 2014 niraula et al 2015 nourani and saeidifarzad 2016 although the utilization of satellite data as a forward problem is a commonly used method for lulc change detection this method may include some deficiencies such as the blurbification of images due to cloudy weather cost time consuming procedure of the rs productions or from the temporal point of view sometimes it is possible that the satellite images are not available in this condition inverse solution of the problem can be considered as an alternative generally the scientific procedures to investigate physical systems can be divided into the following three types tarantola 2005 i parameterization of the system detection of a minimal group of model factors whose values fully describe the system from a given point of view ii forward problem discovery of the physical laws allowing us for given values of the model parameters to make predictions on the outcomes of measurements on some observable parameters iii inverse problem use of the real outcomes of some measurements of the observable parameters to infer the actual values related to the model parameters the inverse problem is subjected to determine the unknown model parameters using the experiential state data the inverse technique is one of the key methods at different fields such as structural damage detection e g see fang et al 2005 wang et al 2017 physics e g see meng et al 2015 davin et al 2017 hydrogeology e g see zhou et al 2014 hydraulic and hydrology e g see kretzschmar et al 2014 bhattacharjya 2011 presented a simple spreadsheet cell oriented methodology for solving a groundwater flow inverse problem pan and wood 2013 developed a methodology to invert the routing process i e to derive the spatially distributed runoff from streamflow by inverting a linear routing model using fixed interval kretzschmar et al 2014 combined a continuous time transfer function model with regularized derivative estimates obtained using a recursive method for estimation of catchment sub hourly rainfall from the measured streamflows in some hydrological studies the parameters of a model that converts the rainfall to runoff are assumed to be constant over time but in practice these parameters may be altered due to lulc changes over time in other words there is a need for a method to analyze the input output relationship of rainfall runoff r r and to identify physical changes within the watershed by solving an inverse problem and without conducting direct observations in this study a novel method is introduced to determine the location and severity of lulc changes in the little river watershed lrw to the best of our knowledge there is not any inverse method using the distributed semi distributed or black box models for lulc change detection in this regard artificial intelligence ai based methods of artificial neural network ann and least square support vector machine lssvm are used to extract the relationship between lulc changes and outflows of the watershed firstly r r modeling is performed via hydrologic engineering center hydrologic modeling system hec hms using clark s conceptual model and extracted geomorphologic information for the lrw as a linear reservoir then by altering storage coefficient sc values of sub watersheds in the clark model sc is considered as a lumped parameter that represents lulc of each sub watershed such presumption that considers a lumped parameter as representative of the lulc of the hydrologic units of the watershed has been proposed in some other studies e g bronstert 2005 dwarakish and ganasri 2015 si et al 2017 different outflow time series are generated in the next step the relationship between generated outflows time series and related scs is created by the multi output ai models to estimate the severity and location of lulc variations represented by sc values to prevent imposing a large amount of information whole outflow time series wavelet entropy we values of each time series are computed and imposed into the ai models instead of whole outflow time series finally the trained model can be used to detect the lulc changes of the lrw for the future years therefore by this proposed inverse method lulc changes will be detectable just by analyzing runoff time series in the coming years for the validation purpose the obtained results are also compared with the recorded changes via ndvi and land use classification extracted from the landsat images because sc and ndvi values do not have same order and dimension in the validation step the validation rate of each with regard to the base year is computed and compared with together 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data set the experimental lrw is a 334 km2 watershed located in the gulf atlantic coastal plain area inside the suwannee basin in south central georgia fig 1 the area has low topographic relief and its characterization is performed through wide smooth alluvial floodplains river terraces and mildly sloping uplands this is a humid region with low gradient drainage networks and wide poorly defined channel systems with dense dendritic streams and heavily vegetated flood plains and riparian areas a primary shallow water resistant layer forces infiltration of water to flow laterally causing many leaks and the characteristically dense drainage network the watershed is as same as other hybrid use agricultural watersheds of the central coastal plain the characterization of middle coastal plain is performed through producing the crop on moderately to well drained upland soils and riparian forests and wetlands on poorly and very poorly drained soils along streams all base flow is between 60 and 70 because of shallow groundwater flow rainfall is randomly distributed during the year with the maximum rainfall taking place from january until march and from june until august most pastureland is applied for cow calf operations the forested regions are in upland pine forest both natural regeneration and pine plantation and riparian forest natural regeneration which is mainly wetland table 1 summarizes the geomorphological characteristics of the lrw the used r r time series for the 1990 1995 2003 2010 and 2013 were obtained from ftp www tiftonars org databases lrew where in the base year 1990 r r data used for calibration of hec hms and generation of different outflow time series for training ai models fig 2 and by the data of the rest years 1995 2003 2010 and 2013 the trained models were used to simulate scs of the sub watersheds for the validation purpose also mann kendall test see parveen and sreekesh 2018 for details of this test showed that the trend of rainfall and temperature and consequently evapotranspiration in the study period was less than 2 in the lrw and therefore it was considered that the changes in scs over time is mostly related to the lulc changes but if there would be a significant trend in climatological parameters instantaneous unit hydrograph iuh models may be used it should be noted that although other minor physical factors involved in r r process may also impact the sc values their annual mean values in a long term horizon are almost constant over the basin and consequently it is a logic assumption that the rate of lulc changes will have a direct relationship with a variation of sc parameter furthermore as shown in fig 1 the delineation of lrw and extraction of sub watersheds were performed in order to estimate the severity and location of lulc changes in each sub watershed by the proposed method in this way the lrw was divided into 8 sub watersheds via gis tools using the 30 meter cell size digital elevation model dem of watershed available at http earthexplorer usgs gov it is worth noting that the watershed may be further divided into more sub watersheds for making more accurate modeling for the validation purpose the land sat images for the considered years were also used to compute the change of ndvi and comparison with the changes of scs obtained by the proposed inverse method the satellite images of the study region were obtained via https earthexplorer usgs gov and preprocessed in order to achieve the objectives of the tm5 and landsat 8 images chang and bai 2018 2 2 proposed methodology in this research gis framework hec hms ai models i e ann and lssvm we measure and rs productions were used to investigate and detect lulc changes of sub watersheds via proposed inverse method the flowchart of the proposed methodology is shown by fig 3 at first step geomorphologic features of sub watersheds were extracted in gis and then the r r modeling was conducted by hec hms based on conceptual clark model then using the observed runoff time series an optimization procedure was performed to calibrate the sub watersheds sc parameters in hec hms in the subsequent step using monte carlo method garrote et al 2009 different runoff time series were produced by altering the calibrated sc values of the sub watersheds the generated time series were decomposed into sub series by wavelet transform wt and the entropy e of each sub series was computed to be imposed into the ann and lssvm models to find the relationship between outlet runoff and the sc values of the sub watersheds in this way instead of entering whole runoff time series qt with duration of 365 days for each years just l 1 values of we for the decomposed time series at level l an approximation sub series qa and l detailed sub series qd1 qdl are obtained via wt were fed to the ai models as the runoff time series agent to avoid interruption of network training fig 4 the obtained relationship by ann and lssvm models was then used to predict the conceptual parameters of sub watersheds i e sc of the conceptual clark model for the future years finally the outcomes of the ann and lssvm models were compared with those from ndvi data for validation of lulc change in each sub watershed in the following sub sections the components of the proposed method are explained separately 2 3 hec hms model hec hms model was developed by hydrologic engineering center hec of us army corps of engineers as a new version for hec 1 which is commonly used for hydrologic simulations usace 2013 to implement hec hms model four modules of meteorology basin model time series data and control specifications should be defined next step is to execute flood hydrographs and rainfall hyetographs in meteorological module while simulation time period and time step are needed for control specifications in this study soil conversation service curve number scs cn clark and muskingum methods were adopted for estimating hydrologic losses rainfall transforming to runoff and flow routing in reaches respectively while a sub watershed element conceptually represents infiltration surface runoff and subsurface processes interacting together the actual surface runoff calculations are performed by a transform method contained within the sub watershed the clark unit hydrograph used in this study is a synthetic unit hydrograph method that the resulting translation hydrograph is routed through a linear reservoir to account for storage attenuation effects across the sub watershed in this method the time of concentration tc defines the maximum travel time in the sub watershed it is used in the development of the translation hydrograph in addition the sc is used in the linear reservoir that accounts for storage effects the clark unit hydrograph was recognized as the most suitable method for this study while it considers storage attenuation effects across the sub watershed that can incorporate lulc changes via sc parameter the tc and sc are the main parameters of the clark s model which were identified using optimization technique in this study where sc and tc can be related by straub et al 2000 1 cs sc sc tc in this study since the cs divided by the sum of tc and sc is reasonably constant over the lrw eq 1 by calibration of sc and tc in hec hms for base year of 1990 after prediction of sc parameters in coming years tc parameter will be available via eq 1 for each sub watershed two parameters of muskingum routing method are xm and km of sub watersheds that can be predicted using cross section data as chow et al 1988 2 km l 3600 cr 3 xm 1 2 1 q b s cr l where q is discharge cms cr is flood wave speed m s l refers to length of channel m b presents top width of flood area m and s refers slope of bed m m usace 2013 km xm tc and sc parameters of the sub watersheds should be calibrated by the optimization module of hec hms model via daily r r data for the base year of 1990 2 4 wavelet entropy we in order to establish the relationship between the outflow from the watershed and the rate of change in the parameters of conceptual clark model and consequently the severity of lulc change we values of outflow time series were computed and imposed into the ai models to avoid importing the whole outflow time series that would interrupt network training in this way the outflow time series q were decomposed by wt at level l into l 1 sub series one approximation sub series qa which denotes to overall trend and l detailed sub series qda qd2 qdl each representing a specific scale and periodicity of the time series and then the entropy of each sub series was computed and used as input of the ai models consequently instead of entering the entire time series for example 365 for daily time series of a year for the decomposed time series at level l here l 5 just l 1 values of we were imposed into the ai models as the representative of whole time series for this purpose time series are decomposed at a desired level through wt then shannon entropy of the associated energies is computed at each level m m 1 2 l 1 as nourani et al 2015 4 we m u 1 u ρ u ln ρ u where the ρ is the pdf probability density function of the normalized wavelet energies of sub series at level m and u is total bin number of the pdf for detail about the effect of bin number on we see nourani et al 2015 shannon entropy has been considered as a measure of the degree of uncertainty tranquility and redundancy the entropy of a signal will be high when it includes more random values with more irregularity thus the we can be considered to measure the degree of order disorder of a signal giving sufficient data about the underlying dynamical procedure related to the signal rosso and mairal 2002 the superiority of shanon entropy with regard to other measures such as variance has been reported by several studies e g ebrahimi et al 1999 since unlike variance which measures concentration only around the mean entropy measures diffuseness of the pdf irrespective of the location of concentration therefore we used in this study as representative of whole time series can consider both seasonality by wt and irregularity by entropy of the process 2 5 multi output ai models in this research two multi output ai models of ann and lssvm with different attitudes were applied for creating relationship between watershed s runoff and lulc changes where ann is a very commonly used ai models in water resources engineering and lssvm could recently get more attention of the hydrologists the neural network used in this research was a three layer feed forward perceptron input layer hidden layer and output layer trained by the back propagation algorithm the lssvm model is a soft margin type that is generalized to nonlinear mode and is usable at different fields of water engineering nourani et al 2017 to speed up training ai models the inputs and outputs data were normalized before using in the training step 2 5 1 multi output ann mann a typical multi input multi output mimo three layer feed forward neural network mann contains m input nodes l hidden nodes and n output nodes let the input hidden output and target output vectors be denoted by x h o and t respectively w 1 ij is the weight between the hidden node i and the output node j and w 2 ij is the weight between the input node i and the hidden layer j 5 x m 1 bpnn o n 1 or x v o v v 1 2 v where v is the number of the training pattern i e training inputs and their corresponding training outputs see hines 1997 for more details 2 5 2 multi output lssvm mlssvm mlssvm is extended form of lssvm the main characteristics and the procedure for lssvm and mlssvm are similar suykens and vandewalle 1999 when mlssvm is used for multi output regression given a set of training data points as xi yi i 1 n where xi rm is the input data yi rl is the output and n is the size of training data set a constrained optimization problem needs to be solved utilizing training the lssvm by employing kernel functions the most widely used kernel function is radial basis function rbf k x y exp x y 2 2 σ 2 where σ 2 is the kernel parameter it should be noted that inputs and outputs of the mlssvm are same as the mann in this study see suykens and vandewalle 1999 for more details 2 6 remote sensing rs clarification of lulc changes is a process that allows observing and recognizing the differentiation of phenomena and patterns of the earth over the time one of the key steps in the procedure of detecting changes is to select appropriate data for the desired time interval the high quality of satellite imagery and lack of cloud cover in the data are important in preparing land cover maps tommervik et al 2003 the processed red band 3 and nir band 4 images are applied for calculating ndvi value for the study region as rouse et al 1974 6 ndvi p nir p red p nir p red the mean ndvi value indicates the mean of ndvis in all pixels of land cover image of the watershed it should be noted that the negative amounts of the pixels water bodies reduce the mean values of ndvi as these negative values exist in all images they would affect all images during the whole study period and as a result the mean values would be comparable the classification of images was done by the supervised classification in envi software at this stage the images were classified after corrections i e image preparation geometric correction radiometric correction and atmospheric correction as well as entering experimental points using the maximum similarity method chang and bai 2018 land use map and classification of the lrw are presented in figs 5 and 6 respectively that show classification in five major groups of water wetland urban pasture crop and forest furthermore ndvi maps of the lrw derived from classification procedure of the satellite images are shown in fig 7 for years of 1990 and 2013 that ndvi values vary between 0 5 and 0 88 2 7 evaluation of model precision the determination coefficient dc and root mean square error rmse as two different criteria were employed for evaluating the performance of ai models the dc and rmse can be used for indicating differences between predictions and recorded values legates and mccabe 1999 revealed that hydro environmental models could be sufficiently assessed by these criteria as eqs 7 and 8 7 dc 1 i 1 t sc hec hms i sc com i 2 i 1 t sc hec hms i sc hec hms 2 8 rmse i 1 t sc hec hms i sc com i 2 t where t sc hec hms i sc com i and sc hec hms are number of data sc calibrated by hec hms sc computed by ai model and mean of sc parameters of hec hms respectively 3 results and discussion the results of the proposed inverse method to detect the watershed lulc changes using hybrid conceptual r r and ai models are presented in the following sub section thereafter the obtained results of the proposed inverse method are compared with the satellite images 3 1 results of the proposed inverse method in this study the proposed inverse method contains three main steps in the first step the r r process of lrw is modeled by hec hms utilizing r r data of base year 1990 geomorphological parameters extracted by gis tools in the second step different runoff time series are generated via hec hms of the lrw by variation of sub watersheds sc parameter using monte carlo method and then we values of each time series are computed in the third step a relation is created between sc and we of generated runoff time series via ai models where this relation we sc is employed then for detection the sub watersheds sc in coming years the results of all stages are presented in the following sub sections 3 1 1 results of hec hms calibration r r of the lrw was modeled in hec hms according to the delineated sub watersheds for base year of 1990 fig 1 the area of the lrw was mapped in hec hms according to the skeletal structure of the sub watersheds then necessary information was prepared for the hec hms in the base year of 1990 according to the section 2 3 conceptual clark model was used for transforming of rainfall to runoff in hec hms slope and area of the sub watersheds were obtained by gis tools based on the hydrologic soil groups the cn values were calculated using an unsupervised classification followed by a supervised classification of 1990 tm 5 image and constant value method was considered as the base flow chow et al 1988 these values were validated using field check activities reasonable results were obtained from the classification where it was compared with the obtained cn of lrw by slack and welch 1980 i e a qualitative comparison was performed so that for sub watershed including more urbanized region higher values of cn were obtained for both years of 1990 and 1980 as per the natural resources conservation service cn tables and other relevant data cn values of the lrw sub watersheds are presented in table 1 furthermore muskingum flow routing parameters tc and sc of the sub watersheds were calibrated by the optimization module of hec hms model using daily r r data of base year tables 1 where 21 events were used for optimization step 15 events for training and 6 events for validation the generated outflow from calibrated hec hms and observed outflow are shown in fig 8 for the base year 1990 after optimization of hec hms parameters befitting of sub watersheds sc can be discussed according to the geomorphological and land cover factors table 1 figs 5 and 6 as an instance sub watershed b has the highest value of sc compared to the other sub watersheds due to its large area sub watershed o includes more forested area and less crop and pastureland cover compared to the sub watershed n so it could be allocated high sc value but because of higher channel slope of sub watershed o both of these sub watersheds got almost similar scs table 1 also sub watershed k despite of its higher channel slope with regard to the sub watershed i has higher sc due to its large area and forest density 3 1 2 computation of we values after r r modeling of the lrw by hec hms for base year of 1990 the impact of lulc changes on the response of the lrw could be investigated by the proposed inverse method but most of the inverse problems are ill posed and they cannot be solved unless certain assumptions and reducing the number of unknown parameters are considered zhou et al 2014 so the main assumption of this research as mentioned in section 2 1 was that the magnitude of lulc changes only impacts the sc parameter of each sub watershed as a lumped parameter and consequently tc eq 1 and other parameters like muskingum parameters were kept fixed with changes in sc values for the sub watersheds with different combinations different outflow runoffs for lrw were obtained via the calibrated hec hms so that multiple sc quantities and combinations were obtained based on the generation of random numbers after r r modeling of the lrw by hec hms and generating various types of runoff time series with duration of 365 days by changing the sc values of sub watersheds it was possible to establish an interspecific relationship between the values of sc hence lulc changes and different outlet runoff time series whereas sc runoff relationship should be able to provide a meaningful connection between lulc changes and outlet runoff this relationship needs to have specific characteristics such as accuracy simplicity applicability and ability to generalize for future the simulation of the relationship between sc runoff values was carried out through mimo ai models of mann and mlssvm in order to create such relationship the generated outflow runoff time series of the basin were used as inputs and the sc values of the sub watersheds were considered as the outputs of the ai models however a problem in terms of both modeling and hydrology appears in the input data of the model in terms of modeling the input layer of the model includes several outflow time series with duration of 365 days which could lead to disruption of model training from a hydrologic perspective the generated runoff time series have extremities in different days of the year in which the extreme points in specific months of 1990 maybe not be in the same days in the coming years e g 2013 this hydrologic problem prevents the generalization of the model created from 1990 to years to come to solve both of the hydrological and modeling problems of the input layer we was used to represent not only the entire time series by only a few numbers but also to solve the problem of extremism generated per day solving this problem could enable the model to be extended for many years to come to increase the accuracy and efficiency of the model and before calculating the entropy of the outlet runoff its periodic properties were extracted using wt so to handle such seasonal features of the runoff time series of the lrw wt was attached to the model for improving the sc runoff simulation appropriate mother wavelet mw selection has produced a challenge in hybrid wavelet ai modeling since the type of the utilized mw can affect the modeling outcomes the essence of wt is to determine the similarity between the analyzed time series and used wavelet prototype and because of the coif2 mw structure which is nearly like the runoff signal compared to other mws like db2 and db5 it could capture the signal s traits well and was selected as mw for decomposition of runoff time series in this study nourani and andalib 2015 additionally the appropriate decomposition level in wavelet ai models is generally acquired through sensitivity analysis see nourani and parhizkar 2013 for more details whereas runoff of the lrw has considered with duration of 365 days the decomposition level 5 containing 5 details as 21 day mode d1 first sub series with high frequency 22 day mode d2 second sub series 23 day mode d3 third sub series nearly weekly 24 day mode d4 4th sub series 25 day mode d5 5th sub series nearly monthly and one approximate signal was considered as suitable level for the decomposition of the runoff time series of the lrw therefore the dependency of seasonal and scale of the procedure could be controlled through the model for each sub watershed different sc values were generated via monte carlo method with normal distribution i e 12 sc values for the smallest watershed and 20 sc values for the largest one with considering calibrated sc values for 1990 as mean of distribution and different standard deviations for each watershed because the larger sub watershed the more heterogeneous lulc and consequently a higher degree of uncertainly which should be represented by a diverse number of sc values see table 2 and fig 9 thereafter different combinations of the generated sc values were set in hec hms for producing about 500 runoff time series however it is argued that if instead of the entire time series in the ai model we values of time series are used would the variation of the sc values affect the we of the outflow runoff of the basin area moreover if so what is the extent of this impact to answer these questions and investigate the unique impact of each sub watershed on the we of the outflow runoff the sc values of all sub watersheds were kept constant in its original value except one then the sc value of that sub watershed was changed the corresponding runoff time series was obtained from the hec hms and this procedure was repeated for all sub watersheds then the we values of time series were computed the obtained results certified when the value of sc changes in the sub watershed m the entropy values of all sub series except one d5 as the lowest frequency are almost kept constant in addition in sub watershed o the entropy value is changed only for the d1 sub series for the largest sub watershed b all entropy values are also altered therefore it could be concluded that in sub watersheds far from the outlet of the lrw the entropy of the sub series with low frequency components and for the sub watersheds near to the outlet of the lrw the entropy of the sub series with high frequency components are markedly changed with alternation of the sc values furthermore it should be noted that sc changes showed very insignificant effect on 26 day and 27 day modes so this reconfirms befitting of l 5 as the optimum level for decomposition of the generated runoff time series 3 1 3 results of ai modeling whereas the ai models cannot extrapolate necessarily at least the boundary of the problem domain should be covered by the training patterns therefore 500 random sc samples were generated for different sub watersheds as outputs and related wes of outflow time series of hec hms were considered as inputs of the ai models then we sc relationship was modeled by two different ai models of mann and mlssvm where 375 samples 75 of 500 samples were used for training of the ai models and the rest 25 of 500 samples for validation purpose the results of we sc modeling by both of ai models approved the existence of robust depending between inputs outputs dc validation 0 97 the comparison of mlssvm and mann performance can help the admissibility of we sc relation after creation of we sc relation it was used for detection of sub watersheds sc values in upcoming years table 3 shows expansion of we sc relation for the 1990 1995 2003 2010 and 2013 years utilizing mann and mlssvm models mlssvm and mann led to a bit different performance where in large area sub watersheds mllssvm showed better performance compared to mann due to its ability in classification of distinct information factors e g in small sub watersheds like m k and i urban land has low effect in lulc change so the number of effective lulc factors reduces from five to four see fig 6 and table 3 furthermore for the base year of 1990 mann model showed that we sc has a robust relation compared to the e sc due to covering the seasonality feature of r r process table 3 according to the evaluation criterion of dc sc detection in coming years reveals acceptable outcomes compared to the calibrated hec hms in those years see table 3 and fig 10 as it is seen in fig 11 according to the results of mlssvm model also mann sc is not changed linearly from 1990 to 2013 it shows increasing of sc from 1990 to 2003 and reduction of sc from 2003 to 2013 but overall sc shows a decreasing trend from 1990 to 2013 furthermore each sub watershed had its unique behavior lulc change for instance sc of sub watershed f increased 21 from 1990 to 2003 and decreased 23 from 2003 to 2013 but in sub watershed b sc is increased 7 from 1990 to 2003 and then is decreased 22 from 2003 to 2013 finally sc values of sub watersheds f and b decreased about 7 and 17 from 1990 to 2013 respectively the reasons of such behaviors are discussed in the following sub section 3 2 validation of inverse method by landsat images land use classification and ndvi classification map of the lrw were derived from the satellite images as it is seen in land use map and classification figs 5 and 6 in the north of the lrw which has high elevation above mean sea level compared to the outlet of the lrw total forest cover has more density and crop and pasture have a poor cover where by coming to the south proportion of the lulc is changed and the density of the crop and pasture lands is increased rather but in 2013 it is obvious that lulc type is changed perceptibly where this change is done from pecan and forest to crop and pasture lands with different areas in all sub watersheds which deforestation of the lrw to the crop and pasture is due to population increasing i e the south of usa is an important region from economical agricultural and social points of view but its quickly rising population adds water demand and environmental stress to its degraded ecosystem also ndvi classification maps of landsat tm5 image for the lrw in 1990 and landsat 8 for 2013 show that crop and pasture land are increased as mentioned in section 2 1 for cow calf operations and forest region is decreased fig 7 altogether with respect to the lulc changes of the lrw from 1990 to 2013 it is expected to have some changes in response of the lrw i e outlet runoff to this end a reliable identification of hydrologic reaction to soil physical characteristics such as saturated hydraulic conductivity bulk density and moisture retention will elucidate the outlet runoff value of sub watersheds these characteristics can impact sub watersheds hydrology by influencing pathways and transformation rates of rainfall to runoff networks in general infiltration rate and rainfall absorption of soils from highest to lowest are forested pasture cropland and urban where forested soils indicated significantly smaller bulk masses and greater infiltration rates and water holding capacities compared to cropland and pasture soils so due to deforestation of the lrw from 1990 to 2013 fig 6 and changing of water holding ability of the soil it is expected to see reduction of sc values of sub watersheds fig 12 shows correlation coefficient between lulc changes of the lrw versus sc changes from 1990 to 2013 for 8 sub watersheds as it is seen the reduction of sc values shows high correlation coefficient with the deforestation pasture and cropland increasing therefore it could be concluded that ai models are able to detect the severity and location of lulc changes by analyzing outlet runoff for coming years the inverse method shows 16 decrease of sc for sub watershed k versus respectively 35 decrease and 25 increase of forest and crop lands shown in land use classification map fig 6 also the method shows 26 decrease of sc for sub watershed o versus respectively 53 decrease and 21 increase of forest and crop lands fig 6 therefore it is confirmed that the assumption about representation of lulc changes by the sc changes is not far from reality since the lulc changes and scs variations both show similar trend for the sub watersheds according to this as it is seen in figs 11 and 12 because of sc increasing from 1990 to 2003 it is clear that forest density of the lrw was increased but after 2003 the forest density was replaced with deforestation i e crop and pastureland up to 2013 beside the interpretations between sc and deforestation it is necessary to find the local change of forest to other lulc and its effect on sc according to the results of table 4 as it is seen in table 4 sub watersheds n and b have same percentage of sc decreasing but with different deforestation percentages whereas in sub watershed n urbanization and pasture got 14 and 3 lulc changes respectively but for sub watershed b urbanization and pasture were allocated 7 and 14 of changes respectively so despite of more deforestation percentage of sub watershed b with regard to sub watershed n they have same percentage of sc decreasing due to low infiltration capacity of urban land with regard to pastureland furthermore sub watersheds f and i have similar percentage of deforestation and it is expected to have same percentage of sc decreasing but despite of this sub watershed i showed more percentage of sc decreasing than sub watershed f because most of the deforestation of sub watershed i led to cropland and as it is known cropland has lower infiltration rate and rainfall absorption with regard to pastureland in addition highest percentage of the deforestation and urbanization in sub watershed o made fig 5 it to have higher percentage of sc change with regard to the other sub watersheds 4 concluding remarks in this paper an inverse method was proposed for the lulc change detection of the lrw in georgia usa using proposed inverse method and considering only the observed outlet runoff time series of the watershed the severity and location of lulc changes could be detected with lower cost compared to the forward methods in the first step of the modeling the lrw was delineated into some sub watersheds in order to monitor the severity and location of lulc changes in each sub watershed thereafter the r r of the lrw was simulated in hec hms for the base year of 1990 utilizing conceptual clark model the change of sc parameter of the clark model for each sub watershed was assumed as the sub watershed lulc change and watershed was assumed as linear reservoir so by generation of random sc values for the sub watersheds via monte carlo method different outflow runoffs were obtained for the lrw via the calibrated hec hms then we of generated runoffs were computed to avoid presenting redundant information in creation of ai based runoff sc relationship the mathematical relation between we of runoff time series and sc values of the sub watersheds was then modeled by robust ai models of mann and mlssvm by extracted relation of we sc in 1990 sc values of sub watershed were predicted for 1995 2003 2010 and 2013 according to the evaluation criterion sc detection in coming years 2003 2010 and 2013 revealed acceptable outcomes compared to the calibrated hec hms in these years by the proposed method for the validation of sc detection in 2013 by ai models land use classification and ndvi of lrw were extracted for both years of 1990 and 2013 the deforestation and cropland increasing from 1990 to 2013 with different severities and in different locations of the lrw authenticated the true sc change detection by the proposed inverse method furthermore sc values of the sub watersheds in 3 middle years between 1990 and 2013 i e 1995 2003 and 2010 were detected where after investigation of their sc parameters it was deduced that the forest land had covered most of the lrw up to 2003 but after 2003 it started to deforestation whereas the south sub watersheds had high density of deforestation compared to the northern sub watersheds it should be noted that the application of the clark r r method here does not limit the capability of the proposed

7229,mechanical thermal dispersion has often been neglected or underestimated in the simulation of heat transport in porous media e g by using zero or the default value in simulators or by using the scaling law for solute dispersivity as a thermal dispersivity value however large amounts of water usually injected in groundwater heat pump gwhp systems may increase the groundwater flow velocity much faster than natural flow and thus change the importance of mechanical dispersion in heat transport in this study to investigate the effects of water injection on the flow field thermal dispersion coefficient and associated heat transport process a laboratory experiment using two different heat sources as tracers was performed at various background flow velocities re 0 52 the analysis results from analytical and numerical models indicate that injected water increases both flow velocities and thermal dispersion coefficients especially near the injection well and thus makes the effect of mechanical dispersion on heat transport very important even at low background flow velocity this result was also found in the field based modeling results but the radius of hydraulic and thermal effects was larger in particular thermal dispersivity on a field scale is known to increase depending on the scale of measurement and the degree of aquifer heterogeneity therefore to ensure the efficiency and sustainability in field applications such as gwhp systems it is necessary to evaluate site specific thermal dispersivity through field experiments keywords heat tracer test thermal dispersion coefficient groundwater heat pump gwhp forced groundwater flow water injection flow velocity 1 introduction the ground source heat pump gshp system is a space heating and cooling system that uses ground or groundwater as a heat source in the winter and a heat sink in the summer because the temperature a few meters below the ground surface remains relatively constant throughout the year as it has a higher efficiency than conventional heating and cooling systems it can contribute to reducing co2 emissions and saving energy costs michopoulos et al 2007 ozlu et al 2012 park et al 2013 such benefits as well as governmental supports have promoted the use of the gshp system in south korea lee 2009 kwon et al 2012 in general gshp systems are classified into closed loop and open loop systems the groundwater heat pump gwhp system is an open loop gshp system that draws groundwater from one well with relatively stable temperatures throughout the year exchanges heat energy with the water and discharges it through another well for large size heating and cooling plants the gwhp systems are more economical and require a smaller installation area compared to closed loop gshp systems however due to direct use of groundwater their efficiency has a complex dependence on hydrogeological and thermal properties of the aquifer which makes it difficult to design an efficient and stable gwhp system nam and ooka 2010 casasso and sethi 2015 park et al 2015a 2015b although a few studies have recently been conducted to investigate the factors that significantly affect the performance of gwhp systems to design efficient systems most of them have focused on groundwater flow conditions e g flow direction and velocity and well placement nam and ooka 2010 lo russo et al 2011 gao et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 moreover unlike the solute dispersivity estimated by a solute tracer test the thermal dispersivity has often been neglected or underestimated in applications by using solute dispersivity values or default values of numerical models without any field based evaluation however some studies performed in the field of shallow depth geothermal applications have reported the influence of thermal dispersion on the relevant heat transport process for example sauty et al 1982 analyzed the experiments on aquifer thermal energy storage ates with mathematical models and found that the thermal dispersion plays an important role in estimating the energy recovery ratio their findings were also observed in the numerical studies on ates experiments dwyer and eckstein 1987 xue et al 1990 lo russo and civita 2009 and park et al 2015a reported in their research on gwhp systems that the evolution of a thermal plume from the injection well towards the pumping well which may degrade system performance can depend considerably on thermal properties especially thermal dispersivity most recently alcaraz et al 2016 used a gis based methodology to estimate shallow geothermal resources at a regional scale analysis results for the geothermal potential and the associated environmental impacts indicate that considering dispersion effects is significant for obtaining reliable results therefore investigation of the importance of the thermal dispersion on heat transport is needed for the last few decades laboratory experiments have been conducted to investigate thermal dispersion behavior in porous media under natural groundwater flow conditions green et al 1964 levec and carbonell 1985 metzger et al 2004 rau et al 2012a 2014 the experimental results indicated that the thermal dispersion increases with flow velocities but there was a controversy over the relationship between them one group of researchers suggested a linear relationship yagi et al 1960 de marsily 1986 anderson 2005 vandenbohede et al 2009 while others proposed various nonlinear forms to describe the relationship green et al 1964 metzger et al 2004 lu et al 2009 rau et al 2012a green et al 1964 first suggested a power law relationship which was verified later by metzger et al 2004 with the same coefficients and by lu et al 2009 with different coefficients such disagreements were clarified by rau et al 2012a who showed that the thermal dispersion can be described by a square law and the importance within natural groundwater flow velocities re 2 5 on the field scale thermal dispersion is known to occur due to the heterogeneity of aquifer properties sauty et al 1982 de marsily 1986 ferguson 2007 hidalgo et al 2009 this can be the reason why the macroscopic thermal dispersivity has a wide range of values in the literature see stauffer et al 2013 sauty et al 1982 inferred from the experimental results that the macrodispersivity increases with the travel distance and stabilizes after reaching a certain scale of heterogeneity their findings correspond with the recent studies on the scaling behavior of macrodispersivity indicating that the macrodispersivity increases with travel distance to their asymptotic values chang and yeh 2012 zech et al 2015 therefore the thermal dispersivity on the field scale can be higher by several orders of magnitude than on the laboratory scale in addition to the heterogeneity of aquifer properties pumping and injection in field applications can further increase the magnitude of thermal dispersion because the gwhp system generally utilizes large volume of groundwater as a heat source or heat sink it can greatly disturb the natural flow field under such conditions the influence of the thermal dispersion on the relevant transport processes can be increased however most studies on thermal dispersion have focused on the natural groundwater flow conditions green et al 1964 levec and carbonell 1985 metzger et al 2004 rau et al 2012a 2014 in a few studies water injection at different temperatures was conducted however there was too high a contrast in temperature to neglect the change in density and viscosity of water see kim et al 2005 saeid et al 2014 in this study we designed a laboratory experimental system to investigate the thermal dispersion behavior in forced flow by water injection heat tracer tests using two different heat sources were performed with various background flow conditions first of all tracer tests using a resistor as a heat source were conducted with without background flow and analyzed by analytical models to evaluate the thermal properties of a saturated porous medium then using injected water as a heat source tracer tests were performed under the same flow conditions as the resistor test and analyzed by a numerical model to examine the effect of injected water on the flow fields thermal dispersion coefficients and relevant heat transport processes this paper also analyzes the impacts of injection on a macroscale through a field based model and discusses their meanings in field applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experiments 2 1 1 overall design of the experimental system the experimental system was designed to carry out heat tracer tests in a saturated porous medium with without artificial water injection the core of the experimental device consists of a rectangular sand tank made of acrylic glass the external dimension of the sand tank is 1 3 m 0 6 m 0 8 m l w h and the thickness of the wall is 1 5 cm the size was determined by simulating laboratory scale experiments through a numerical model to roughly estimate thermal plume propagation the tank is supported by a manually assembled aluminum frame enclosing the tank there are three divided chambers in the tank a 1 m long chamber in the middle filled with coarse sand and two 0 12 m long chambers on both sides which are used as constant hydraulic head tanks containing different levels of water these chambers are partitioned by 1 5 cm thick acrylic glass plates with a large number of holes so that water in the higher constant head tank can flow through the sand and create a uniform flow toward the lower head tank a fine wire mesh is attached to the plates inside the middle chamber to prevent sand particles from entering the constant head tanks through the small holes an acrylic pipe with an inner diameter of 14 mm and a length of 0 7 m served as an injection well at a height of 0 29 0 31 m a slot was drilled through a 0 02 m long section of the pipe to simulate a partially screened well and to spread the injected water radially from the injection point the screen section of the well was then wrapped with nylon mesh to avoid possible infiltration of sand grains and clogging issues as shown in fig 1 the well pipe is located 0 35 m apart from the higher constant head tank on the centerline of the middle chamber the sand tank is equipped with a temperature measurement system both inside and outside in addition water inlet outlet tanks supply water to the constant head tanks and control the water levels and a thermostatic water barrel linked to a peristaltic pump controls the warm water injection fig 1 these devices together make up the complete laboratory experimental system a detailed description is included in the following sections 2 1 2 heat sources and sensor equipment there are two types of heat sources one is a small resistor acting as a point heat source and the other is warm water passing through the well screen disturbing the background flow field a small wire wound resistor 7 mm in diameter resistance of 47 ω and power rating of 5 w was wrapped with teflon tape for waterproofing and mounted on the acrylic tube at a height of 30 cm the laboratory dc power supply ac input 220 v dc output 0 30 v applied a constant voltage to the resistor so that the resistor could act as a continuous heat source in a heat tracer test under forced flow conditions warm water in the thermostatic barrel was transferred by pvc tubing installed on a peristaltic pump gilson injected at a height of 30 cm into the injection well screen the heat flow rate qh from the injected water was determined using qh w qw ml s ρwcw j ml 1 k 1 δt k prior to the heat tracer test a pretest was performed to determine the injection rate qw and temperature increment δt in the peristaltic pump the pumping injection rate depends on the rpm of the pump when the rpm of the pump is low the pumping injection become discontinuous we changed the rpm of the pump and examined if pumping is continuous and then we chose three rpms 12 18 and 24 for the injection tests the temperature difference between the injected water and the background water was determined to be maintained within 5 c to prevent free convection see ma and zheng 2010 leaf et al 2012 ma et al 2012 rau et al 2012a the temperature was measured by a resistance temperature detector rtd that ensures better stability and accuracy than thermocouples and thermistors a thin film type platinum rtd pt100 hayashi denko japan was selected in this experiment because of its highly linear response to temperature change and stability as well as its small size in this study a three wire rtd was used to detect temperature change because it can compensate for errors caused by lead wire resistance an rtd element was connected to extension lead wires in a protective sheath of 3 2 mm in diameter and 2 cm in length so that it could be supplied with electrical current from the device outside the tank among a total of 32 rtd sensors 28 sensors were evenly distributed inside the porous medium while the others were installed outside to measure the temperature of ambient air water in the thermostat and the inlet water one to three rtd sensors were mounted on one acrylic tube with a diameter of 8 mm a total of 21 tubes with one to three sensors were arranged around and away from the injection well to ensure that sensors detected the thermal plume spreading from the heat source at the fixed locations fig 1 the lead wires in the rtds were assembled on top to connect the sensors to data acquisition daq hardware outside the tank the rtd sensor network was connected to signal conditioning and analog digital switching modules ni 9217 national instruments mounted on an eight slot chassis ni compact daq 9178 the chassis controls timing synchronization and data transfer between the modules and an external computer connected to the chassis via a usb the daq system comprises the daq hardware chassis and modules and software consisting of a hardware driver ni daqmx and a programming environment labview 2009 2 1 3 experimental preparation before the middle chamber was filled with sand joomoonjin silica sand grain size analysis was performed using a set of sieves to identify the mean diameter and the uniformity of the porous medium the mean grain size of the sand was 1 28 mm which is within the range of coarse sand but smaller than that used in previous experiments see metzger et al 2004 rau et al 2012a the uniformity value u was 1 36 which is generally considered as very well sorted laboratory xrd and xrf analyses of sand samples were conducted to determine their chemistry and the results indicated a quartz content of 75 7 and a sio2 content of 84 6 respectively the porosity of the material was derived by measuring the dry sand volume and the bulk volume the average porosity value of repeated measurements was 0 34 and cross checked by measuring the moisture contents in the experimental setup see table 1 in addition constant head permeability tests were repeated to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of the porous medium the average hydraulic conductivity value was estimated to be 0 234 cm s the hydraulic conductivity was also calculated from the darcy velocity or specific discharge and hydraulic gradient measured in a sand tank experiment see table 1 before the middle chamber was filled with sand the top of the well and acrylic tubes were strapped in place to minimize the possibility of movement during the experimental setup the resistor and injection point as a heat source were located at a height of 30 cm see fig 1 rtd sensors were distributed horizontally in the xy plane around the heat source the chamber was packed with coarse sand taking care not to trap air inside the porous medium a soil moisture sensor buried at 45 cm above the bottom measured water contents and cross checked the porosity see table 1 after the sand was packed rtd sensors were connected to daq hardware and labview software was programmed to sample and log temperature every 0 1 s 2 1 4 laboratory scale heat tracer tests as shown in fig 1 two different heat sources were installed at a height of 30 cm and 35 40 cm apart from the higher constant head tank first heat tracer tests using a resistor were performed without background flow to estimate the thermal conductivity and the volumetric heat capacity of the saturated porous medium a constant power of 4 712 w was applied to the resistor for all the tests and the changes in temperature were measured at 28 rtds inside the middle chamber then heat tracer tests using a resistor with various background flow were conducted to estimate the thermal dispersion coefficients of the medium under natural flow conditions background flow rates were changed by controlling the water level of the lower constant head tank up to 40 38 m d with 10 different background flow velocities were applied to the heat tracer tests to investigate the effect of water injection warm water as a heat tracer was injected through the well screen into the porous medium the injection rates were adjusted by the rotation rates of the peristaltic pump three rotation rates 12 18 and 24 rpm were selected for the tests and the corresponding injection rates were about 32 48 and 65 ml min respectively to ensure the same background flow velocities as the heat tracer tests using a resistor the injection tests were performed right after the background temperature in the porous medium had recovered from the disturbance by the resistor tests although the temperature increments of injected water δt were not consistent in all the injection tests due to the sensitivity of the thermostat all the increments were maintained within 3 c to prevent the density effect from taking place 2 2 estimation of thermal parameters 2 2 1 analytical model for the resistor tests the resistor tests were analyzed by analytical models which can be derived from the following differential heat transport equation hte considering both convective and conductive transport de marsily 1986 rau et al 2012a 1 d t 2 t v t t t t where t k is the temperature of the porous medium dt m2 s the thermal dispersion coefficient and vt m s the thermal front velocity the thermal dispersion coefficient consists of the thermal diffusion and mechanical thermal dispersion terms and can be generally described as 2 d t λ ρ c β v t m where λ w m 1 k 1 represents the bulk thermal conductivity ρc j m 3 k 1 the bulk volumetric heat capacity β the thermal dispersivity and m the coefficient to express the relationship between the thermal dispersion coefficient and the flow velocity there was a controversy on whether the relationship is linear m 1 or not m 1 most recently rau et al 2012a found that the relationship can be approximated by a square law m 2 within natural groundwater flow velocities re 2 5 as follows 3 d t λ ρ c β v t 2 the differential hte in eq 1 has been solved for an infinite three dimensional porous medium with a uniform flow in one direction by carslaw and jaeger 1959 the initial condition t x y z t 0 t 0 for x y z and the boundary conditions q 0 0 0 t 0 j and lim x y z q x y z t 0 were taken into account while assuming q w is the source strength of a continuous point heat source moving from x y z 0 in the x direction the consequential analytical solution is described in a modified form as 4 t x y z t t 0 q 8 π d t t ρ cr exp xv t 2 d l t exp rv t 2 d l t erfc r v t t 2 d l t t exp rv t 2 d l t erfc r v t t 2 d l t t 5 r x 2 d l t d t t y 2 z 2 where d l t and d t t are the longitudinal thermal dispersion coefficient assumed to occur in the x direction and the transverse thermal dispersion coefficient assumed to occur on a plane at right angles respectively carslaw and jaeger 1959 rau et al 2012a this analytical solution is also known as the moving continuous point source mcps model which was used to analyze the resistor tests performed with various background flows in the case of the resistor tests without background flow the hte in eq 1 can be reduced to the following equation because heat is transferred only by conduction 6 d t 2 t t t this equation has also been solved by carslaw and jaeger 1959 for an infinite three dimensional aquitard with a continuous heat source q w at the origin of the coordinate system x y z 0 the following solution is the modified form by stauffer et al 2013 7 t x y z t t 0 q 4 π λ r erfc r 4 d t t where r x 2 y 2 z 2 m and dt is the bulk thermal diffusivity m2 s because there is no flow this analytical solution is called the continuous point source cps model which was used to interpret the resistor tests without flow the details on the analysis procedure will be explained in section 2 2 3 2 2 2 numerical model for the injection tests the experiments using injected water as a tracer were analyzed by a numerical model in this study feflow was used to investigate the thermal plume propagation in the saturated porous medium it is based upon a finite element method and can deal with solute and heat transport as well as groundwater flow in porous media essentially the numerical code is governed by the conservation laws of mass momentum and energy for solid and liquid phases see diersch 2005 the dispersion model used in feflow is a linear model which can be expressed as follows bear 1972 de marsily 1986 rau et al 2012a 8 d t λ ρ c β ρ w c w ρ c q a 3 d finite element grid was constructed for a 3 d model domain with the same dimensions of 1 0 m 0 6 m 0 6 m l w h as the laboratory experiments the entire model domain was discretized into square elements δx δy 0 004 m except the zones around an injection point and observation points where the mesh spacing was refined δx δy 0 002 m fig 2 the initial time step was set to be 10 9 d with a maximum time step of 10 4 d fig 2 shows the location of the heat source and observation points and boundary conditions applied to the numerical model the initial water level was assumed to be 0 6 m all over the model domain the constant head boundary conditions reflecting the observed water level were set on both sides of the model domain and the spatial distribution of the hydraulic head was calculated by performing steady state simulations the corresponding hydraulic gradient values had a range from 0 005 to 0 081 based on the experimental conditions the initial temperature of the model was set to the background temperature measured before the warm water injection in the left side of the domain where the background water flows in the temperature of the background water was used as a constant boundary condition to represent the injection of warm water the average injection rates of 32 65 ml min depending on the rotational rate of the peristaltic pump and the temperature observed at the injection well were set to the injection point as boundary conditions then transient simulations were performed to validate the designed model by comparing the modeling results with the observed temperature data the model input parameters such as the hydrogeological and thermal properties of the porous medium are listed in table 1 in most of the laboratory scale experiments on thermal dispersion only heat was injected into the porous medium while in the field scale experiments injected water with different temperatures has been used as a tracer such difference in the type of heat source can also be found between closed loop and open loop geothermal systems in this context numerical simulations using the validated model were conducted for 48 cases with different heat source type background flow velocities and injection rates see table 3 the case simulation aims to compare the heat transport under the forced flow conditions with that under the natural flow conditions and to investigate the effect of injection on the flow field thermal dispersion coefficient and relevant heat transport processes 2 2 3 parameter estimation as explained in the previous sections heat tracer tests using a resistor were analyzed by analytical models while heat tracer tests with warm water injection were interpreted with a numerical model the thermal breakthrough curves from the models were fitted to the observed data by changing the parameters of interest thermal properties and background flow velocities were determined from the best fit between the observations and the model results which minimizes the root mean square error rmse 9 rmse i 1 n m i s i 2 n 1 2 where mi and si represent the measured and simulated values respectively to compare the quality of fit among different experimental conditions the normalized root mean square error nrmse was defined as follows 10 nrmse rmse t max t min where t max and t min are the maximum and minimum temperatures in each thermal breakthrough curve respectively fig 3 shows an example of the analysis procedure performed in matlab code as shown in fig 3 the rmse values were calculated by changing variables within the established reference range and parameters satisfying the least rmse were determined in each step this process was repeated in the reduced range including the determined parameters until the estimated values are almost constant less than 0 1 change first the heat tracer tests using a resistor without background flow were analyzed by the cps model eq 7 and the thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of the saturated sand were derived from the analysis results the thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of solids were estimated by the following relationships woodside and messmer 1961 buntebarth and schopper 1998 schärli and rybach 2001 11 ρ c n ρ w c w 1 n ρ s c s 12 λ λ w n λ s 1 n where n is the porosity of the medium and the subscripts w and s indicate water and solid respectively rtd sensors were mounted on the acrylic tubes and the bottom of each tube was fixed at the predetermined location however the upper part of the tubes cannot be perfectly fixed because of sand packing and the rtd lead lines although we tried to avoid unwanted dislocation of sensors dislocation was found to occur in the course of sand packing and organizing lines in the locations of the injection well and resistor rtd sensors cannot be placed at the exact position due to the tubing of the peristaltic pump and resistor in addition rtd sensors tubing and resistor have volume for these reasons we included the location of sensors as a parameter in the fitting procedure like the previous study rau et al 2012a and repeatedly performed the resistor tests without flow in the case of the resistor experiments performed under various background flow conditions the mcps model in eq 4 was used to derive the parameters such as thermal dispersion coefficients and thermal front velocities based on eq 2 the regression method was applied to analyze the relationships between the dispersion coefficients and the thermal front velocities estimated with the mcps model the statistical models were evaluated by r 2 f and t statistics from the analysis results longitudinal and transverse dispersivity values which are the coefficients of the velocity term in eq 2 were determined in this study two dimensionless numbers were used to quantify the flow and transport regimes the thermal peclet number pet characterizing the relative contribution of convective and conductive heat transport is given by de marsily 1986 anderson 2005 rau et al 2014 13 pe t ρ w c w ql λ where l is a characteristic length m that is usually replaced with the mean grain size d 50 of the porous medium the reynolds number re representing the ratio of inertia force to viscous force is defined as de marsily 1986 14 re ρ w qd μ where ρw is fluid density kg m3 d mean grain size d 50 or effective grain size d 10 m and μ fluid viscosity kg m 1 s 1 in this study the mean grain size was used to calculate the dimensionless numbers 3 results 3 1 analytical modeling for heat tracer tests with a resistor heat tracer tests using a resistor as a heat source were performed first under a no flow condition to estimate the thermal properties of the porous medium fig 4 displays the temperature breakthrough curves observed at center and off center locations cross symbol and the cps model results solid line as explained in section 2 2 3 curve fitting was repeatedly performed by reducing the range of variables until the estimated values were almost constant as shown in fig 4 the model results agree well with the observed breakthrough curves from the best fit between observations and the model the thermal conductivity and the volumetric heat capacity of the saturated sand and the corrected locations were determined see table 2 the thermal properties of solids were derived from the relationships in eqs 11 and 12 and the thermal conductivity and the volumetric heat capacity of solids were estimated to be on average 3 567 w m 1 k 1 and 2 085 106 j m 3 k 1 respectively such high values of thermal properties can be explained by the high quartz content of 75 7 and are within the acceptable range when compared with the reference values in table 2 heat tracer tests using a resistor were also performed with various background flow velocities to estimate the thermal dispersion coefficients and the thermal front velocities fig 5 shows two examples of the observed breakthrough curves and the best fitted mcps models for three observation points r 0 0538 0 0876 and 0 1113 m at darcy velocities of 1 94 m d and 21 35 m d although a deviation at the beginning of the plateau was found in fig 5b which has high nrmse values the analytical models successfully reproduced the observed temperatures in terms of r 2 0 9932 for all the experiments fig 6 illustrates the relationship between the thermal dispersion coefficients and thermal front velocities estimated from the best fitted models although the heat tracer tests in this study were performed in the conduction dominant regime pet 0 78 it was observed that both longitudinal and transverse thermal dispersion coefficients increase with the flow velocities to quantify their relations and to derive thermal dispersivity values a simple linear regression analysis was conducted the linear regression equations estimated by the least square method showed an increasing trend with r 2 values of 0 7981 in longitudinal and 0 2535 in transverse directions see black solid lines in fig 6 f and t statistics for the regression models indicated that the models and their coefficients are meaningful at the significance level of 0 001 longitudinal and 0 005 transverse from the analysis results longitudinal and transverse thermal dispersivities were estimated to be 1 232 10 3 and 5 782 10 4 m respectively however scatter was also found in the relationships between the thermal dispersion coefficients and the thermal front velocities this will be discussed in section 4 1 3 2 numerical modeling for heat tracer tests with injected water injection tests were conducted to investigate the influence of water injection on the flow field thermal dispersion coefficients and relevant heat transport processes fig 7 shows the temperature breakthrough curves for the observed data red circle and the developed model yellow square and their relative errors at r 10 135 cm with a darcy velocity of 7 57 m d although a deviation was observed especially at the beginning and near the plateau of the breakthrough curves the developed model was found to match well with the observations r 2 0 9946 the numerical model used in this study feflow cannot simulate the heat transport processes without dispersion effect therefore we also performed the numerical simulations with thermal dispersivity values that are small enough to be neglected β 10 2 and β 10 4 and compared their results the solid and dashed lines in fig 7 show the simulation results when neglecting the thermal dispersivity values although the dispersivity values estimated in this study are very small β l 1 232 10 3 m and β t 5 782 10 4 m it was found that the rmse values of the simulations not considering dispersivity are twice that of the simulation considering dispersivity fig 8 shows the temperature time series for two different heat source types of injected water and heat flux observed at three points r 5 10 and 30 cm with darcy velocities of 9 71 and 58 24 m d as shown in fig 8 the results can vary greatly depending on the heat source type even if the same amount of heat is injected in particular when the background flow velocity is slow and the injection rate is large there is a great deal of difference in the temperature breakthrough curves see fig 8a fig 9 indicates the forced flow field due to warm water injection at various flow velocities and injection rates it was observed that a dramatic increase in flow velocities occurs especially near the injection well fig 9a when the results were expressed by the thermal peclet number the regions close to the injection point were found to stay within the transition zone 0 5 pet 2 5 or convection dominant regime regardless of background flow velocities fig 9b the thermal dispersion coefficients were calculated from eq 8 using the estimated properties of the porous medium and the modeled flow velocities fig 10 shows the effect of water injection on the thermal dispersion coefficients as a ratio to the background value at various background flow velocities 9 71 58 24 m d with an injection rate of 0 1 m3 d the results indicated that the thermal dispersion coefficients also increase greatly around the injection point up to 2 89 times longitudinally and up to 1 93 times transversally even in the linear dispersion model used in this study an additional modeling was performed to investigate the effect of thermal dispersivity on thermal plume propagation under the forced flow field by injected water fig 11 shows the temperature breakthrough curves for different dispersivity values β 0 01 1 10 and 100 observed at two observation points r 10 and 30 cm with a background flow velocity of 9 71 m d and an injection rate of 0 1 m3 d the result indicated that thermal dispersivity has a great influence on both breakthrough time and peak temperature of the thermal plume 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between thermal dispersion coefficients and flow velocities although heat tracer tests in this study were performed within the conduction dominant regime pet 1 it was observed that thermal dispersion coefficients increase with flow velocities fig 6 however there was also scattering in their relations as found in the previous studies especially for low flow velocities yagi et al 1960 kunii and smith 1961 yuan et al 1991 rau et al 2012a there can be several reasons as yuan et al 1991 explained about the results of kunii and smith 1961 the dominant part of the thermal dispersion coefficient is the effective thermal diffusivity first term in eq 2 when pet is very low in such a case the contribution of the fluid flow to the coefficient is very small in addition flow can be nonuniform even if the small scale experiments were performed with relatively homogeneous sand u 1 36 as rau et al 2012b mentioned in their experiments and this can be supported by the thermal front velocities estimated from heat tracer tests differences in the estimated thermal conductivities and volumetric heat capacities can be another reason for the scatter when the relations were analyzed by observation points a more distinct trend was observed even in the transverse dispersion coefficients with very high r 2 values over 0 9 fig 6 it is noteworthy that the longitudinal dispersion coefficient reduces the difference due to the thermal properties and converges at a high flow velocity while the transverse dispersion coefficient maintains a deviation such a difference may cause the transverse thermal dispersion coefficient to have more scatter and low r 2 values at a low flow velocity as observed in the previous study rau et al 2012a as shown in fig 6 the longitudinal and transverse thermal dispersivity values estimated by the linear regression method present thermal dispersivity ratios β l β t of 1 48 2 13 cf 3 70 in rau et al 2012a and 3 00 in saeid et al 2014 it is noted that these ratios are different from the value of 10 used in commercial software packages or commonly assumed for heat transport smith and chapman 1983 molson et al 1992 hopmans et al 2002 su et al 2004 lo russo and civita 2009 lo russo et al 2011 park et al 2015a 2015b alcaraz et al 2016 piga et al 2017 the difference in the dispersivity ratio can affect the thermal plume propagation and this will be covered in section 4 2 4 2 impacts of injected water on flow and heat transport because groundwater flow velocity is relatively slow and thermal diffusion occurs much faster than solute diffusion by two orders of magnitude the effective thermal diffusivity containing the mechanical dispersion term as a constant has been used in applications such as closed loop geothermal systems however the results can vary greatly depending on the heat source type especially when the background flow is slow and the injection rate is high see fig 8 it is noted that these conditions are common in field applications such as gwhp systems as shown in figs 9 and 10 injected water increases both flow velocities and thermal dispersion coefficients especially near the injection well and thus makes the effect of mechanical dispersion on heat transport very important even at low background flow velocity fig 11 although heat tracer tests in this study were performed within the conduction dominant regime pet 1 it was observed that the regions around the injection well stay in the different thermal regimes of the transition zone 0 5 pet 2 5 or convection dominant regime see fig 9b this suggests that the relationship between the thermal dispersion coefficient and thermal front velocity should be described by a square law in eq 3 rau et al 2012a or a power law in eq 2 green et al 1964 metzger et al 2004 lu et al 2009 however most commercial software packages including feflow are based on the linear dispersion model in eq 8 and this can lead to errors in the analysis of thermal behavior in high velocity fields around the injection well the thermal dispersivities in this study were estimated to have very small values β l 1 232 10 3 m and β t 5 782 10 4 m because relatively homogeneous sand u 1 36 was used in the experiments thermal dispersivities on the field scale however are much larger and have a wide range of values depending on the degree of heterogeneity see stauffer et al 2013 in field applications such as gwhp systems large amounts of pumping and injection can further increase the magnitude of thermal dispersion for these reasons the impacts of injection on the field scale were investigated using the field based model in park et al 2015a at a regional groundwater flow velocity of 3 64 m d with various injection rates of 50 200 m3 d the modeling results confirmed that the effect of injected water on flow and heat transport observed in the laboratory scale experiments can also be found on the field scale fig 12 it is noteworthy that the radius of hydraulic and thermal effects has greatly increased from tens of centimeters on the laboratory scale to tens of meters on the field scale as mentioned in section 4 1 the difference in the thermal dispersivity ratio can affect the heat transport processes and therefore the field scale simulations were performed for 30 days to investigate the effect of the dispersivity ratio by adjusting the transverse dispersivity value as can be seen in fig 12 the thermal dispersivity ratio has a significant effect on both plume length and width this differs from a recent study on the thermal risk assessment of gwhps where the authors used the fixed dispersivity ratio of 10 and showed that the thermal dispersivity has a significant effect on plume length but a negligible impact on plume width piga et al 2017 in particular the results are significant because the transverse thermal dispersivity has been rarely estimated although field experiments were carried out the mechanical dispersion term has often been neglected or underestimated because thermal diffusion occurs much faster than solute diffusion and groundwater flow velocity is relatively slow injected water however greatly increases the flow velocity and makes the region around the injection point into a different thermal regime fig 9b where the thermal dispersivity can be significant regardless of a background flow velocity figs 11 and 12 moreover sauty et al 1982 inferred from the field experiments that the macroscopic thermal dispersivity can vary greatly depending on the distance traveled by the thermal plume and the degree of aquifer heterogeneity which is consistent with recent findings on the scaling behavior of macrodispersivity chang and yeh 2012 zech et al 2015 this can be the reason for the wide range of dispersivity values reported in the literature stauffer et al 2013 therefore field based assessment of thermal dispersivity is required to ensure sustainability in applications such as the gwhp system without underestimating or overestimating the associated thermal effects 5 conclusions in this study laboratory scale heat tracer tests using two different heat sources were performed at various background flow velocities re 0 52 to investigate the effects of injected water on the flow field dispersion coefficient and associated transport processes the resistor experiments were analyzed by a curve fitting procedure and the analytical models were confirmed to be successful in reproducing the observed temperature data r 2 0 9932 for all the tests from the analysis results thermal front velocity and the three thermal properties of thermal conductivity volumetric heat capacity and thermal dispersion coefficient were estimated although the experiments in this study were performed at a low background flow velocity pet 1 the thermal dispersion coefficients were observed to increase with the flow velocities however scatter was also found in their relationship and this might be explained by the thermal regime and nonuniform flow in addition the regression analysis result conducted by observation points indicates that spatial differences in thermal properties can be another reason for scattering in the case of injection tests the numerical model was used to analyze the experimental results and case simulations using the validated model were performed at different heat source types background flow velocities and injection rates the mechanical dispersion term has often been neglected or underestimated due to the fast thermal diffusion and relatively slow groundwater flow however the simulation results indicate that there can be a great deal of difference in the temperature breakthrough curves depending on the heat source type injected water increases both flow velocities and thermal dispersion coefficients especially near the injection well and thus makes the mechanical dispersion significant even at low flow velocity although heat tracer tests in this study were conducted within the conduction dominant regime pet 1 it was found that the regions around the injection well stay in the different thermal regimes of the transition zone 0 5 pet 2 5 or convection dominant regime this suggests that the relationships between thermal dispersion coefficient and thermal front velocity should be described by a square law rau et al 2012a or a power law green et al 1964 metzger et al 2004 lu et al 2009 however most commercial software packages are based on a linear dispersion model which can result in errors in the analysis of the heat transport processes at a high velocity field near an injection well field based modeling results have shown that the effect of injected water on flow and heat transport observed in laboratory scale experiments can also be found in field scale applications it is notable that the radius of hydraulic and thermal effects has increased significantly from tens of centimeters on the laboratory scale to tens of meters on the field scale the difference in the thermal dispersivity ratio found in the experimental results was also investigated in the field scale simulations the results show that the thermal dispersivity ratio affects the dimension of the thermal plume this is very important because the transverse thermal dispersivity has been hardly estimated even when the field experiments were performed in field applications the mechanical thermal dispersion has often been neglected or underestimated by using zero or the default value in the simulators or by using the scaling law for solute dispersivity as a thermal dispersivity value the experimental and numerical results in this study indicate that mechanical thermal dispersion can be significant even at low background flow velocity in particular thermal dispersivity on a macroscale is known to increase depending on the scale of measurement and the degree of aquifer heterogeneity sauty et al 1982 chang and yeh 2012 a recent study on the scaling behavior suggests based on extensive experimental field results that the macrodispersivity for a solute does not follow a unique scaling law but is site specific zech et al 2015 therefore to ensure the efficiency and sustainability in field applications such as gwhp systems it is necessary to evaluate site specific thermal dispersivity through field experiments acknowledgments this work

7229,mechanical thermal dispersion has often been neglected or underestimated in the simulation of heat transport in porous media e g by using zero or the default value in simulators or by using the scaling law for solute dispersivity as a thermal dispersivity value however large amounts of water usually injected in groundwater heat pump gwhp systems may increase the groundwater flow velocity much faster than natural flow and thus change the importance of mechanical dispersion in heat transport in this study to investigate the effects of water injection on the flow field thermal dispersion coefficient and associated heat transport process a laboratory experiment using two different heat sources as tracers was performed at various background flow velocities re 0 52 the analysis results from analytical and numerical models indicate that injected water increases both flow velocities and thermal dispersion coefficients especially near the injection well and thus makes the effect of mechanical dispersion on heat transport very important even at low background flow velocity this result was also found in the field based modeling results but the radius of hydraulic and thermal effects was larger in particular thermal dispersivity on a field scale is known to increase depending on the scale of measurement and the degree of aquifer heterogeneity therefore to ensure the efficiency and sustainability in field applications such as gwhp systems it is necessary to evaluate site specific thermal dispersivity through field experiments keywords heat tracer test thermal dispersion coefficient groundwater heat pump gwhp forced groundwater flow water injection flow velocity 1 introduction the ground source heat pump gshp system is a space heating and cooling system that uses ground or groundwater as a heat source in the winter and a heat sink in the summer because the temperature a few meters below the ground surface remains relatively constant throughout the year as it has a higher efficiency than conventional heating and cooling systems it can contribute to reducing co2 emissions and saving energy costs michopoulos et al 2007 ozlu et al 2012 park et al 2013 such benefits as well as governmental supports have promoted the use of the gshp system in south korea lee 2009 kwon et al 2012 in general gshp systems are classified into closed loop and open loop systems the groundwater heat pump gwhp system is an open loop gshp system that draws groundwater from one well with relatively stable temperatures throughout the year exchanges heat energy with the water and discharges it through another well for large size heating and cooling plants the gwhp systems are more economical and require a smaller installation area compared to closed loop gshp systems however due to direct use of groundwater their efficiency has a complex dependence on hydrogeological and thermal properties of the aquifer which makes it difficult to design an efficient and stable gwhp system nam and ooka 2010 casasso and sethi 2015 park et al 2015a 2015b although a few studies have recently been conducted to investigate the factors that significantly affect the performance of gwhp systems to design efficient systems most of them have focused on groundwater flow conditions e g flow direction and velocity and well placement nam and ooka 2010 lo russo et al 2011 gao et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 moreover unlike the solute dispersivity estimated by a solute tracer test the thermal dispersivity has often been neglected or underestimated in applications by using solute dispersivity values or default values of numerical models without any field based evaluation however some studies performed in the field of shallow depth geothermal applications have reported the influence of thermal dispersion on the relevant heat transport process for example sauty et al 1982 analyzed the experiments on aquifer thermal energy storage ates with mathematical models and found that the thermal dispersion plays an important role in estimating the energy recovery ratio their findings were also observed in the numerical studies on ates experiments dwyer and eckstein 1987 xue et al 1990 lo russo and civita 2009 and park et al 2015a reported in their research on gwhp systems that the evolution of a thermal plume from the injection well towards the pumping well which may degrade system performance can depend considerably on thermal properties especially thermal dispersivity most recently alcaraz et al 2016 used a gis based methodology to estimate shallow geothermal resources at a regional scale analysis results for the geothermal potential and the associated environmental impacts indicate that considering dispersion effects is significant for obtaining reliable results therefore investigation of the importance of the thermal dispersion on heat transport is needed for the last few decades laboratory experiments have been conducted to investigate thermal dispersion behavior in porous media under natural groundwater flow conditions green et al 1964 levec and carbonell 1985 metzger et al 2004 rau et al 2012a 2014 the experimental results indicated that the thermal dispersion increases with flow velocities but there was a controversy over the relationship between them one group of researchers suggested a linear relationship yagi et al 1960 de marsily 1986 anderson 2005 vandenbohede et al 2009 while others proposed various nonlinear forms to describe the relationship green et al 1964 metzger et al 2004 lu et al 2009 rau et al 2012a green et al 1964 first suggested a power law relationship which was verified later by metzger et al 2004 with the same coefficients and by lu et al 2009 with different coefficients such disagreements were clarified by rau et al 2012a who showed that the thermal dispersion can be described by a square law and the importance within natural groundwater flow velocities re 2 5 on the field scale thermal dispersion is known to occur due to the heterogeneity of aquifer properties sauty et al 1982 de marsily 1986 ferguson 2007 hidalgo et al 2009 this can be the reason why the macroscopic thermal dispersivity has a wide range of values in the literature see stauffer et al 2013 sauty et al 1982 inferred from the experimental results that the macrodispersivity increases with the travel distance and stabilizes after reaching a certain scale of heterogeneity their findings correspond with the recent studies on the scaling behavior of macrodispersivity indicating that the macrodispersivity increases with travel distance to their asymptotic values chang and yeh 2012 zech et al 2015 therefore the thermal dispersivity on the field scale can be higher by several orders of magnitude than on the laboratory scale in addition to the heterogeneity of aquifer properties pumping and injection in field applications can further increase the magnitude of thermal dispersion because the gwhp system generally utilizes large volume of groundwater as a heat source or heat sink it can greatly disturb the natural flow field under such conditions the influence of the thermal dispersion on the relevant transport processes can be increased however most studies on thermal dispersion have focused on the natural groundwater flow conditions green et al 1964 levec and carbonell 1985 metzger et al 2004 rau et al 2012a 2014 in a few studies water injection at different temperatures was conducted however there was too high a contrast in temperature to neglect the change in density and viscosity of water see kim et al 2005 saeid et al 2014 in this study we designed a laboratory experimental system to investigate the thermal dispersion behavior in forced flow by water injection heat tracer tests using two different heat sources were performed with various background flow conditions first of all tracer tests using a resistor as a heat source were conducted with without background flow and analyzed by analytical models to evaluate the thermal properties of a saturated porous medium then using injected water as a heat source tracer tests were performed under the same flow conditions as the resistor test and analyzed by a numerical model to examine the effect of injected water on the flow fields thermal dispersion coefficients and relevant heat transport processes this paper also analyzes the impacts of injection on a macroscale through a field based model and discusses their meanings in field applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experiments 2 1 1 overall design of the experimental system the experimental system was designed to carry out heat tracer tests in a saturated porous medium with without artificial water injection the core of the experimental device consists of a rectangular sand tank made of acrylic glass the external dimension of the sand tank is 1 3 m 0 6 m 0 8 m l w h and the thickness of the wall is 1 5 cm the size was determined by simulating laboratory scale experiments through a numerical model to roughly estimate thermal plume propagation the tank is supported by a manually assembled aluminum frame enclosing the tank there are three divided chambers in the tank a 1 m long chamber in the middle filled with coarse sand and two 0 12 m long chambers on both sides which are used as constant hydraulic head tanks containing different levels of water these chambers are partitioned by 1 5 cm thick acrylic glass plates with a large number of holes so that water in the higher constant head tank can flow through the sand and create a uniform flow toward the lower head tank a fine wire mesh is attached to the plates inside the middle chamber to prevent sand particles from entering the constant head tanks through the small holes an acrylic pipe with an inner diameter of 14 mm and a length of 0 7 m served as an injection well at a height of 0 29 0 31 m a slot was drilled through a 0 02 m long section of the pipe to simulate a partially screened well and to spread the injected water radially from the injection point the screen section of the well was then wrapped with nylon mesh to avoid possible infiltration of sand grains and clogging issues as shown in fig 1 the well pipe is located 0 35 m apart from the higher constant head tank on the centerline of the middle chamber the sand tank is equipped with a temperature measurement system both inside and outside in addition water inlet outlet tanks supply water to the constant head tanks and control the water levels and a thermostatic water barrel linked to a peristaltic pump controls the warm water injection fig 1 these devices together make up the complete laboratory experimental system a detailed description is included in the following sections 2 1 2 heat sources and sensor equipment there are two types of heat sources one is a small resistor acting as a point heat source and the other is warm water passing through the well screen disturbing the background flow field a small wire wound resistor 7 mm in diameter resistance of 47 ω and power rating of 5 w was wrapped with teflon tape for waterproofing and mounted on the acrylic tube at a height of 30 cm the laboratory dc power supply ac input 220 v dc output 0 30 v applied a constant voltage to the resistor so that the resistor could act as a continuous heat source in a heat tracer test under forced flow conditions warm water in the thermostatic barrel was transferred by pvc tubing installed on a peristaltic pump gilson injected at a height of 30 cm into the injection well screen the heat flow rate qh from the injected water was determined using qh w qw ml s ρwcw j ml 1 k 1 δt k prior to the heat tracer test a pretest was performed to determine the injection rate qw and temperature increment δt in the peristaltic pump the pumping injection rate depends on the rpm of the pump when the rpm of the pump is low the pumping injection become discontinuous we changed the rpm of the pump and examined if pumping is continuous and then we chose three rpms 12 18 and 24 for the injection tests the temperature difference between the injected water and the background water was determined to be maintained within 5 c to prevent free convection see ma and zheng 2010 leaf et al 2012 ma et al 2012 rau et al 2012a the temperature was measured by a resistance temperature detector rtd that ensures better stability and accuracy than thermocouples and thermistors a thin film type platinum rtd pt100 hayashi denko japan was selected in this experiment because of its highly linear response to temperature change and stability as well as its small size in this study a three wire rtd was used to detect temperature change because it can compensate for errors caused by lead wire resistance an rtd element was connected to extension lead wires in a protective sheath of 3 2 mm in diameter and 2 cm in length so that it could be supplied with electrical current from the device outside the tank among a total of 32 rtd sensors 28 sensors were evenly distributed inside the porous medium while the others were installed outside to measure the temperature of ambient air water in the thermostat and the inlet water one to three rtd sensors were mounted on one acrylic tube with a diameter of 8 mm a total of 21 tubes with one to three sensors were arranged around and away from the injection well to ensure that sensors detected the thermal plume spreading from the heat source at the fixed locations fig 1 the lead wires in the rtds were assembled on top to connect the sensors to data acquisition daq hardware outside the tank the rtd sensor network was connected to signal conditioning and analog digital switching modules ni 9217 national instruments mounted on an eight slot chassis ni compact daq 9178 the chassis controls timing synchronization and data transfer between the modules and an external computer connected to the chassis via a usb the daq system comprises the daq hardware chassis and modules and software consisting of a hardware driver ni daqmx and a programming environment labview 2009 2 1 3 experimental preparation before the middle chamber was filled with sand joomoonjin silica sand grain size analysis was performed using a set of sieves to identify the mean diameter and the uniformity of the porous medium the mean grain size of the sand was 1 28 mm which is within the range of coarse sand but smaller than that used in previous experiments see metzger et al 2004 rau et al 2012a the uniformity value u was 1 36 which is generally considered as very well sorted laboratory xrd and xrf analyses of sand samples were conducted to determine their chemistry and the results indicated a quartz content of 75 7 and a sio2 content of 84 6 respectively the porosity of the material was derived by measuring the dry sand volume and the bulk volume the average porosity value of repeated measurements was 0 34 and cross checked by measuring the moisture contents in the experimental setup see table 1 in addition constant head permeability tests were repeated to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of the porous medium the average hydraulic conductivity value was estimated to be 0 234 cm s the hydraulic conductivity was also calculated from the darcy velocity or specific discharge and hydraulic gradient measured in a sand tank experiment see table 1 before the middle chamber was filled with sand the top of the well and acrylic tubes were strapped in place to minimize the possibility of movement during the experimental setup the resistor and injection point as a heat source were located at a height of 30 cm see fig 1 rtd sensors were distributed horizontally in the xy plane around the heat source the chamber was packed with coarse sand taking care not to trap air inside the porous medium a soil moisture sensor buried at 45 cm above the bottom measured water contents and cross checked the porosity see table 1 after the sand was packed rtd sensors were connected to daq hardware and labview software was programmed to sample and log temperature every 0 1 s 2 1 4 laboratory scale heat tracer tests as shown in fig 1 two different heat sources were installed at a height of 30 cm and 35 40 cm apart from the higher constant head tank first heat tracer tests using a resistor were performed without background flow to estimate the thermal conductivity and the volumetric heat capacity of the saturated porous medium a constant power of 4 712 w was applied to the resistor for all the tests and the changes in temperature were measured at 28 rtds inside the middle chamber then heat tracer tests using a resistor with various background flow were conducted to estimate the thermal dispersion coefficients of the medium under natural flow conditions background flow rates were changed by controlling the water level of the lower constant head tank up to 40 38 m d with 10 different background flow velocities were applied to the heat tracer tests to investigate the effect of water injection warm water as a heat tracer was injected through the well screen into the porous medium the injection rates were adjusted by the rotation rates of the peristaltic pump three rotation rates 12 18 and 24 rpm were selected for the tests and the corresponding injection rates were about 32 48 and 65 ml min respectively to ensure the same background flow velocities as the heat tracer tests using a resistor the injection tests were performed right after the background temperature in the porous medium had recovered from the disturbance by the resistor tests although the temperature increments of injected water δt were not consistent in all the injection tests due to the sensitivity of the thermostat all the increments were maintained within 3 c to prevent the density effect from taking place 2 2 estimation of thermal parameters 2 2 1 analytical model for the resistor tests the resistor tests were analyzed by analytical models which can be derived from the following differential heat transport equation hte considering both convective and conductive transport de marsily 1986 rau et al 2012a 1 d t 2 t v t t t t where t k is the temperature of the porous medium dt m2 s the thermal dispersion coefficient and vt m s the thermal front velocity the thermal dispersion coefficient consists of the thermal diffusion and mechanical thermal dispersion terms and can be generally described as 2 d t λ ρ c β v t m where λ w m 1 k 1 represents the bulk thermal conductivity ρc j m 3 k 1 the bulk volumetric heat capacity β the thermal dispersivity and m the coefficient to express the relationship between the thermal dispersion coefficient and the flow velocity there was a controversy on whether the relationship is linear m 1 or not m 1 most recently rau et al 2012a found that the relationship can be approximated by a square law m 2 within natural groundwater flow velocities re 2 5 as follows 3 d t λ ρ c β v t 2 the differential hte in eq 1 has been solved for an infinite three dimensional porous medium with a uniform flow in one direction by carslaw and jaeger 1959 the initial condition t x y z t 0 t 0 for x y z and the boundary conditions q 0 0 0 t 0 j and lim x y z q x y z t 0 were taken into account while assuming q w is the source strength of a continuous point heat source moving from x y z 0 in the x direction the consequential analytical solution is described in a modified form as 4 t x y z t t 0 q 8 π d t t ρ cr exp xv t 2 d l t exp rv t 2 d l t erfc r v t t 2 d l t t exp rv t 2 d l t erfc r v t t 2 d l t t 5 r x 2 d l t d t t y 2 z 2 where d l t and d t t are the longitudinal thermal dispersion coefficient assumed to occur in the x direction and the transverse thermal dispersion coefficient assumed to occur on a plane at right angles respectively carslaw and jaeger 1959 rau et al 2012a this analytical solution is also known as the moving continuous point source mcps model which was used to analyze the resistor tests performed with various background flows in the case of the resistor tests without background flow the hte in eq 1 can be reduced to the following equation because heat is transferred only by conduction 6 d t 2 t t t this equation has also been solved by carslaw and jaeger 1959 for an infinite three dimensional aquitard with a continuous heat source q w at the origin of the coordinate system x y z 0 the following solution is the modified form by stauffer et al 2013 7 t x y z t t 0 q 4 π λ r erfc r 4 d t t where r x 2 y 2 z 2 m and dt is the bulk thermal diffusivity m2 s because there is no flow this analytical solution is called the continuous point source cps model which was used to interpret the resistor tests without flow the details on the analysis procedure will be explained in section 2 2 3 2 2 2 numerical model for the injection tests the experiments using injected water as a tracer were analyzed by a numerical model in this study feflow was used to investigate the thermal plume propagation in the saturated porous medium it is based upon a finite element method and can deal with solute and heat transport as well as groundwater flow in porous media essentially the numerical code is governed by the conservation laws of mass momentum and energy for solid and liquid phases see diersch 2005 the dispersion model used in feflow is a linear model which can be expressed as follows bear 1972 de marsily 1986 rau et al 2012a 8 d t λ ρ c β ρ w c w ρ c q a 3 d finite element grid was constructed for a 3 d model domain with the same dimensions of 1 0 m 0 6 m 0 6 m l w h as the laboratory experiments the entire model domain was discretized into square elements δx δy 0 004 m except the zones around an injection point and observation points where the mesh spacing was refined δx δy 0 002 m fig 2 the initial time step was set to be 10 9 d with a maximum time step of 10 4 d fig 2 shows the location of the heat source and observation points and boundary conditions applied to the numerical model the initial water level was assumed to be 0 6 m all over the model domain the constant head boundary conditions reflecting the observed water level were set on both sides of the model domain and the spatial distribution of the hydraulic head was calculated by performing steady state simulations the corresponding hydraulic gradient values had a range from 0 005 to 0 081 based on the experimental conditions the initial temperature of the model was set to the background temperature measured before the warm water injection in the left side of the domain where the background water flows in the temperature of the background water was used as a constant boundary condition to represent the injection of warm water the average injection rates of 32 65 ml min depending on the rotational rate of the peristaltic pump and the temperature observed at the injection well were set to the injection point as boundary conditions then transient simulations were performed to validate the designed model by comparing the modeling results with the observed temperature data the model input parameters such as the hydrogeological and thermal properties of the porous medium are listed in table 1 in most of the laboratory scale experiments on thermal dispersion only heat was injected into the porous medium while in the field scale experiments injected water with different temperatures has been used as a tracer such difference in the type of heat source can also be found between closed loop and open loop geothermal systems in this context numerical simulations using the validated model were conducted for 48 cases with different heat source type background flow velocities and injection rates see table 3 the case simulation aims to compare the heat transport under the forced flow conditions with that under the natural flow conditions and to investigate the effect of injection on the flow field thermal dispersion coefficient and relevant heat transport processes 2 2 3 parameter estimation as explained in the previous sections heat tracer tests using a resistor were analyzed by analytical models while heat tracer tests with warm water injection were interpreted with a numerical model the thermal breakthrough curves from the models were fitted to the observed data by changing the parameters of interest thermal properties and background flow velocities were determined from the best fit between the observations and the model results which minimizes the root mean square error rmse 9 rmse i 1 n m i s i 2 n 1 2 where mi and si represent the measured and simulated values respectively to compare the quality of fit among different experimental conditions the normalized root mean square error nrmse was defined as follows 10 nrmse rmse t max t min where t max and t min are the maximum and minimum temperatures in each thermal breakthrough curve respectively fig 3 shows an example of the analysis procedure performed in matlab code as shown in fig 3 the rmse values were calculated by changing variables within the established reference range and parameters satisfying the least rmse were determined in each step this process was repeated in the reduced range including the determined parameters until the estimated values are almost constant less than 0 1 change first the heat tracer tests using a resistor without background flow were analyzed by the cps model eq 7 and the thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of the saturated sand were derived from the analysis results the thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of solids were estimated by the following relationships woodside and messmer 1961 buntebarth and schopper 1998 schärli and rybach 2001 11 ρ c n ρ w c w 1 n ρ s c s 12 λ λ w n λ s 1 n where n is the porosity of the medium and the subscripts w and s indicate water and solid respectively rtd sensors were mounted on the acrylic tubes and the bottom of each tube was fixed at the predetermined location however the upper part of the tubes cannot be perfectly fixed because of sand packing and the rtd lead lines although we tried to avoid unwanted dislocation of sensors dislocation was found to occur in the course of sand packing and organizing lines in the locations of the injection well and resistor rtd sensors cannot be placed at the exact position due to the tubing of the peristaltic pump and resistor in addition rtd sensors tubing and resistor have volume for these reasons we included the location of sensors as a parameter in the fitting procedure like the previous study rau et al 2012a and repeatedly performed the resistor tests without flow in the case of the resistor experiments performed under various background flow conditions the mcps model in eq 4 was used to derive the parameters such as thermal dispersion coefficients and thermal front velocities based on eq 2 the regression method was applied to analyze the relationships between the dispersion coefficients and the thermal front velocities estimated with the mcps model the statistical models were evaluated by r 2 f and t statistics from the analysis results longitudinal and transverse dispersivity values which are the coefficients of the velocity term in eq 2 were determined in this study two dimensionless numbers were used to quantify the flow and transport regimes the thermal peclet number pet characterizing the relative contribution of convective and conductive heat transport is given by de marsily 1986 anderson 2005 rau et al 2014 13 pe t ρ w c w ql λ where l is a characteristic length m that is usually replaced with the mean grain size d 50 of the porous medium the reynolds number re representing the ratio of inertia force to viscous force is defined as de marsily 1986 14 re ρ w qd μ where ρw is fluid density kg m3 d mean grain size d 50 or effective grain size d 10 m and μ fluid viscosity kg m 1 s 1 in this study the mean grain size was used to calculate the dimensionless numbers 3 results 3 1 analytical modeling for heat tracer tests with a resistor heat tracer tests using a resistor as a heat source were performed first under a no flow condition to estimate the thermal properties of the porous medium fig 4 displays the temperature breakthrough curves observed at center and off center locations cross symbol and the cps model results solid line as explained in section 2 2 3 curve fitting was repeatedly performed by reducing the range of variables until the estimated values were almost constant as shown in fig 4 the model results agree well with the observed breakthrough curves from the best fit between observations and the model the thermal conductivity and the volumetric heat capacity of the saturated sand and the corrected locations were determined see table 2 the thermal properties of solids were derived from the relationships in eqs 11 and 12 and the thermal conductivity and the volumetric heat capacity of solids were estimated to be on average 3 567 w m 1 k 1 and 2 085 106 j m 3 k 1 respectively such high values of thermal properties can be explained by the high quartz content of 75 7 and are within the acceptable range when compared with the reference values in table 2 heat tracer tests using a resistor were also performed with various background flow velocities to estimate the thermal dispersion coefficients and the thermal front velocities fig 5 shows two examples of the observed breakthrough curves and the best fitted mcps models for three observation points r 0 0538 0 0876 and 0 1113 m at darcy velocities of 1 94 m d and 21 35 m d although a deviation at the beginning of the plateau was found in fig 5b which has high nrmse values the analytical models successfully reproduced the observed temperatures in terms of r 2 0 9932 for all the experiments fig 6 illustrates the relationship between the thermal dispersion coefficients and thermal front velocities estimated from the best fitted models although the heat tracer tests in this study were performed in the conduction dominant regime pet 0 78 it was observed that both longitudinal and transverse thermal dispersion coefficients increase with the flow velocities to quantify their relations and to derive thermal dispersivity values a simple linear regression analysis was conducted the linear regression equations estimated by the least square method showed an increasing trend with r 2 values of 0 7981 in longitudinal and 0 2535 in transverse directions see black solid lines in fig 6 f and t statistics for the regression models indicated that the models and their coefficients are meaningful at the significance level of 0 001 longitudinal and 0 005 transverse from the analysis results longitudinal and transverse thermal dispersivities were estimated to be 1 232 10 3 and 5 782 10 4 m respectively however scatter was also found in the relationships between the thermal dispersion coefficients and the thermal front velocities this will be discussed in section 4 1 3 2 numerical modeling for heat tracer tests with injected water injection tests were conducted to investigate the influence of water injection on the flow field thermal dispersion coefficients and relevant heat transport processes fig 7 shows the temperature breakthrough curves for the observed data red circle and the developed model yellow square and their relative errors at r 10 135 cm with a darcy velocity of 7 57 m d although a deviation was observed especially at the beginning and near the plateau of the breakthrough curves the developed model was found to match well with the observations r 2 0 9946 the numerical model used in this study feflow cannot simulate the heat transport processes without dispersion effect therefore we also performed the numerical simulations with thermal dispersivity values that are small enough to be neglected β 10 2 and β 10 4 and compared their results the solid and dashed lines in fig 7 show the simulation results when neglecting the thermal dispersivity values although the dispersivity values estimated in this study are very small β l 1 232 10 3 m and β t 5 782 10 4 m it was found that the rmse values of the simulations not considering dispersivity are twice that of the simulation considering dispersivity fig 8 shows the temperature time series for two different heat source types of injected water and heat flux observed at three points r 5 10 and 30 cm with darcy velocities of 9 71 and 58 24 m d as shown in fig 8 the results can vary greatly depending on the heat source type even if the same amount of heat is injected in particular when the background flow velocity is slow and the injection rate is large there is a great deal of difference in the temperature breakthrough curves see fig 8a fig 9 indicates the forced flow field due to warm water injection at various flow velocities and injection rates it was observed that a dramatic increase in flow velocities occurs especially near the injection well fig 9a when the results were expressed by the thermal peclet number the regions close to the injection point were found to stay within the transition zone 0 5 pet 2 5 or convection dominant regime regardless of background flow velocities fig 9b the thermal dispersion coefficients were calculated from eq 8 using the estimated properties of the porous medium and the modeled flow velocities fig 10 shows the effect of water injection on the thermal dispersion coefficients as a ratio to the background value at various background flow velocities 9 71 58 24 m d with an injection rate of 0 1 m3 d the results indicated that the thermal dispersion coefficients also increase greatly around the injection point up to 2 89 times longitudinally and up to 1 93 times transversally even in the linear dispersion model used in this study an additional modeling was performed to investigate the effect of thermal dispersivity on thermal plume propagation under the forced flow field by injected water fig 11 shows the temperature breakthrough curves for different dispersivity values β 0 01 1 10 and 100 observed at two observation points r 10 and 30 cm with a background flow velocity of 9 71 m d and an injection rate of 0 1 m3 d the result indicated that thermal dispersivity has a great influence on both breakthrough time and peak temperature of the thermal plume 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between thermal dispersion coefficients and flow velocities although heat tracer tests in this study were performed within the conduction dominant regime pet 1 it was observed that thermal dispersion coefficients increase with flow velocities fig 6 however there was also scattering in their relations as found in the previous studies especially for low flow velocities yagi et al 1960 kunii and smith 1961 yuan et al 1991 rau et al 2012a there can be several reasons as yuan et al 1991 explained about the results of kunii and smith 1961 the dominant part of the thermal dispersion coefficient is the effective thermal diffusivity first term in eq 2 when pet is very low in such a case the contribution of the fluid flow to the coefficient is very small in addition flow can be nonuniform even if the small scale experiments were performed with relatively homogeneous sand u 1 36 as rau et al 2012b mentioned in their experiments and this can be supported by the thermal front velocities estimated from heat tracer tests differences in the estimated thermal conductivities and volumetric heat capacities can be another reason for the scatter when the relations were analyzed by observation points a more distinct trend was observed even in the transverse dispersion coefficients with very high r 2 values over 0 9 fig 6 it is noteworthy that the longitudinal dispersion coefficient reduces the difference due to the thermal properties and converges at a high flow velocity while the transverse dispersion coefficient maintains a deviation such a difference may cause the transverse thermal dispersion coefficient to have more scatter and low r 2 values at a low flow velocity as observed in the previous study rau et al 2012a as shown in fig 6 the longitudinal and transverse thermal dispersivity values estimated by the linear regression method present thermal dispersivity ratios β l β t of 1 48 2 13 cf 3 70 in rau et al 2012a and 3 00 in saeid et al 2014 it is noted that these ratios are different from the value of 10 used in commercial software packages or commonly assumed for heat transport smith and chapman 1983 molson et al 1992 hopmans et al 2002 su et al 2004 lo russo and civita 2009 lo russo et al 2011 park et al 2015a 2015b alcaraz et al 2016 piga et al 2017 the difference in the dispersivity ratio can affect the thermal plume propagation and this will be covered in section 4 2 4 2 impacts of injected water on flow and heat transport because groundwater flow velocity is relatively slow and thermal diffusion occurs much faster than solute diffusion by two orders of magnitude the effective thermal diffusivity containing the mechanical dispersion term as a constant has been used in applications such as closed loop geothermal systems however the results can vary greatly depending on the heat source type especially when the background flow is slow and the injection rate is high see fig 8 it is noted that these conditions are common in field applications such as gwhp systems as shown in figs 9 and 10 injected water increases both flow velocities and thermal dispersion coefficients especially near the injection well and thus makes the effect of mechanical dispersion on heat transport very important even at low background flow velocity fig 11 although heat tracer tests in this study were performed within the conduction dominant regime pet 1 it was observed that the regions around the injection well stay in the different thermal regimes of the transition zone 0 5 pet 2 5 or convection dominant regime see fig 9b this suggests that the relationship between the thermal dispersion coefficient and thermal front velocity should be described by a square law in eq 3 rau et al 2012a or a power law in eq 2 green et al 1964 metzger et al 2004 lu et al 2009 however most commercial software packages including feflow are based on the linear dispersion model in eq 8 and this can lead to errors in the analysis of thermal behavior in high velocity fields around the injection well the thermal dispersivities in this study were estimated to have very small values β l 1 232 10 3 m and β t 5 782 10 4 m because relatively homogeneous sand u 1 36 was used in the experiments thermal dispersivities on the field scale however are much larger and have a wide range of values depending on the degree of heterogeneity see stauffer et al 2013 in field applications such as gwhp systems large amounts of pumping and injection can further increase the magnitude of thermal dispersion for these reasons the impacts of injection on the field scale were investigated using the field based model in park et al 2015a at a regional groundwater flow velocity of 3 64 m d with various injection rates of 50 200 m3 d the modeling results confirmed that the effect of injected water on flow and heat transport observed in the laboratory scale experiments can also be found on the field scale fig 12 it is noteworthy that the radius of hydraulic and thermal effects has greatly increased from tens of centimeters on the laboratory scale to tens of meters on the field scale as mentioned in section 4 1 the difference in the thermal dispersivity ratio can affect the heat transport processes and therefore the field scale simulations were performed for 30 days to investigate the effect of the dispersivity ratio by adjusting the transverse dispersivity value as can be seen in fig 12 the thermal dispersivity ratio has a significant effect on both plume length and width this differs from a recent study on the thermal risk assessment of gwhps where the authors used the fixed dispersivity ratio of 10 and showed that the thermal dispersivity has a significant effect on plume length but a negligible impact on plume width piga et al 2017 in particular the results are significant because the transverse thermal dispersivity has been rarely estimated although field experiments were carried out the mechanical dispersion term has often been neglected or underestimated because thermal diffusion occurs much faster than solute diffusion and groundwater flow velocity is relatively slow injected water however greatly increases the flow velocity and makes the region around the injection point into a different thermal regime fig 9b where the thermal dispersivity can be significant regardless of a background flow velocity figs 11 and 12 moreover sauty et al 1982 inferred from the field experiments that the macroscopic thermal dispersivity can vary greatly depending on the distance traveled by the thermal plume and the degree of aquifer heterogeneity which is consistent with recent findings on the scaling behavior of macrodispersivity chang and yeh 2012 zech et al 2015 this can be the reason for the wide range of dispersivity values reported in the literature stauffer et al 2013 therefore field based assessment of thermal dispersivity is required to ensure sustainability in applications such as the gwhp system without underestimating or overestimating the associated thermal effects 5 conclusions in this study laboratory scale heat tracer tests using two different heat sources were performed at various background flow velocities re 0 52 to investigate the effects of injected water on the flow field dispersion coefficient and associated transport processes the resistor experiments were analyzed by a curve fitting procedure and the analytical models were confirmed to be successful in reproducing the observed temperature data r 2 0 9932 for all the tests from the analysis results thermal front velocity and the three thermal properties of thermal conductivity volumetric heat capacity and thermal dispersion coefficient were estimated although the experiments in this study were performed at a low background flow velocity pet 1 the thermal dispersion coefficients were observed to increase with the flow velocities however scatter was also found in their relationship and this might be explained by the thermal regime and nonuniform flow in addition the regression analysis result conducted by observation points indicates that spatial differences in thermal properties can be another reason for scattering in the case of injection tests the numerical model was used to analyze the experimental results and case simulations using the validated model were performed at different heat source types background flow velocities and injection rates the mechanical dispersion term has often been neglected or underestimated due to the fast thermal diffusion and relatively slow groundwater flow however the simulation results indicate that there can be a great deal of difference in the temperature breakthrough curves depending on the heat source type injected water increases both flow velocities and thermal dispersion coefficients especially near the injection well and thus makes the mechanical dispersion significant even at low flow velocity although heat tracer tests in this study were conducted within the conduction dominant regime pet 1 it was found that the regions around the injection well stay in the different thermal regimes of the transition zone 0 5 pet 2 5 or convection dominant regime this suggests that the relationships between thermal dispersion coefficient and thermal front velocity should be described by a square law rau et al 2012a or a power law green et al 1964 metzger et al 2004 lu et al 2009 however most commercial software packages are based on a linear dispersion model which can result in errors in the analysis of the heat transport processes at a high velocity field near an injection well field based modeling results have shown that the effect of injected water on flow and heat transport observed in laboratory scale experiments can also be found in field scale applications it is notable that the radius of hydraulic and thermal effects has increased significantly from tens of centimeters on the laboratory scale to tens of meters on the field scale the difference in the thermal dispersivity ratio found in the experimental results was also investigated in the field scale simulations the results show that the thermal dispersivity ratio affects the dimension of the thermal plume this is very important because the transverse thermal dispersivity has been hardly estimated even when the field experiments were performed in field applications the mechanical thermal dispersion has often been neglected or underestimated by using zero or the default value in the simulators or by using the scaling law for solute dispersivity as a thermal dispersivity value the experimental and numerical results in this study indicate that mechanical thermal dispersion can be significant even at low background flow velocity in particular thermal dispersivity on a macroscale is known to increase depending on the scale of measurement and the degree of aquifer heterogeneity sauty et al 1982 chang and yeh 2012 a recent study on the scaling behavior suggests based on extensive experimental field results that the macrodispersivity for a solute does not follow a unique scaling law but is site specific zech et al 2015 therefore to ensure the efficiency and sustainability in field applications such as gwhp systems it is necessary to evaluate site specific thermal dispersivity through field experiments acknowledgments this work
