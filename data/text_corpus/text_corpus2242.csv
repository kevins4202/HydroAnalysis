11210,the predominantly agricultural coastal watershed located in tropical subtropical island has served as a pathway for nonpoint source nps pollution loading into the downstream coastal ecosystems the present study aims to assess watershed hydrology and water quality by applying a watershed model to long term high resolution monitoring data and to evaluate the reduction of nonpoint source pollution by implementing best management practices bmps in a small agricultural watershed located in southwestern japan the soil water and assessment tool swat was coupled to a groundwater model modflow and applied to simulate stream flow sediment and nutrients discharges the results revealed that the model successfully predicted hourly stream flow sediment and nutrients concentrations in the study watershed and that the model could be further used to evaluate bmp scenarios this is the first attempt to quantify the impacts of multiple agricultural mitigation measures on long term water quality for sediment nitrate and phosphate at an hourly resolution from the model results the land cover conversion and mulching scenarios achieved a significant reduction in sediment followed by the cover crop alternative tillage and filter strip scenarios moreover conversion of all summer sugarcane to pasture farmland and fertilizer control scenarios gave the superior reduction in nitrate load while other scenarios were minimally effective on the other hand most of the scenarios significantly achieved the reduction of phosphate load the results further indicated that the bmps recommended in this study are appropriately combined scenarios which achieved the significant reduction in all nps loads although this study revealed some effective mitigation measures to improve the water quality in the study watershed actual implementation of correct ones may be practically challenging unless other environmental and economic risks e g the increase of other pollutants and reduction in agricultural productivity are also taken into considerations keywords swat modflow stream flow nonpoint source pollution bmp 1 introduction in subtropical tropical regions agricultural activities have caused high levels of nonpoint source nps pollution brought by large amounts of rainfall and typhoon occurrences the increased nps may frequently affect the water quality of streams and the downstream coastal marine ecosystem due to excessive sedimentation and its associated pollutants the nutrients exported from the agricultural watershed due to excessive utilization of fertilizer have induced the transformation of water quality status from oligotrophic to eutrophic conditions and other major environmental problems in many coastal ecosystems cloern 2001 moreover anthropogenic development has caused excessive terrestrial runoff sedimentation and nutrients which further severely affected coral reefs by decreasing coral cover altering the coral community and transforming the ecosystem from coral dominated to algae dominated fabricius 2004 therefore understanding and quantifying the nps dynamics and their controlling factors are critical and important for controlling and implementing appropriate mitigation measures to minimize or completely eliminate the impact of the nps loads on the downstream environment heathwaite et al 2005 the todoroki river watershed in ishigaki island japan an intensively agricultural watershed significantly affects the downstream environmental ecosystem mainly fringing coral reefs it has predominantly served as a pathway for sediment and other associated pollutants loading into the reef during rainy seasons bringing high flood amplitudes and typhoon occurrences that overlap with the planting seasons omija et al 1998 mitsumoto et al 2000 blanco et al 2010 the coral reef located downstream of the watershed has been deteriorated through various land based and global scale environmental stresses including sedimentation red soil runoff and nutrients discharge from the todoroki river omija et al 1998 mitsumoto et al 2000 hasegawa 2011 inoue et al 2014 yamazaki et al 2015 to reduce the nps loads in the agricultural watershed agricultural conservation practices often called best management practices bmps have been widely proposed as effective mitigation measures by recent studies bosch et al 2013 geng et al 2015 ramos et al 2015 maharjan et al 2016 motsinger et al 2016 taylor et al 2016 her et al 2017 the bmps commonly implemented include alternative tillage filter strips mulching fertilizer control split fertilization crop cover conversion of the main crop to pasture farmland and so forth since the cost of the field experiments used to evaluate the effectiveness of these bmps is generally very high in terms of experimental installation and maintenance watershed models can be applied to represent the bmp and estimate their impacts arabi et al 2008 waidler et al 2011 the soil and water assessment tool swat a basin scale physically based continuous simulation model is promising and has been widely used to understand the water quantity and water quality issues in a wide range of watershed scales and environmental conditions arnold et al 1994 gassman et al 2007 neitsch et al 2009 although the swat model has been widely and successfully applied to simulate hydrology and water quality most of those applications have been at annual monthly or daily temporal resolutions however in small scale watersheds instantaneous hydrological responses often produce multiple flow events within a day therefore the time resolution of simulation should be as high as possible to properly capture the hydrological and transport processes during these short duration floods in this sense a model with sub daily configuration is preferable for accurately assessing hydrology and water quality in the study watershed in addition in a groundwater dominant watershed groundwater processes play a very important role in regulating dissolved nutrients in the stream networks however swat alone may not be adequate to simulate the flow and nutrient transport processes underground bain et al 2012 therefore an application of the swat modflow model a fully coupled combination of the swat and modflow models bailey et al 2016 can be applied to realistically represent groundwater surface water interactions in the study watershed where groundwater is predominant due to the highly permeable ryukyu limestone aquifer blanco et al 2010 the specific objectives of this study are i to evaluate capability of a coupled swat modflow model to predict rapid flushing events in a small agricultural watershed by calibrating and validating with continuous long term high resolution stream flow sediment and periodically measured nutrient observations ii to assess and understand groundwater surface water interactions in the study watershed and iii to assess the impact of various bmp implementations upon water quality sediment no3 and po4 3 in an intensively agricultural watershed 2 materials and methods 2 1 general characteristics of the study area todoroki is a small approximately 12 4 km2 watershed located in the southeastern part of ishigaki island 24 23 n latitude 124 14 e longitude 430 km southwest of the main okinawa island japan fig 1 located in the subtropical region the annual mean temperature humidity and precipitation in the study area are 24 3 c 78 and about 2000 mm respectively the weather conditions are characterized by different seasons north east monsoon in october march and high magnitude rainfall in may june followed by typhoon occurrences in august october moreover the wind direction is dominantly southerly in summer and northerly in winter the topographical condition in the watershed is characterized by a range of slopes and elevations varying from 0 to 17 and from 0 m to 149 m respectively ryukyu limestone in the southern area and gravel conglomerate in the northern area are the dominant geological formations in the watershed followed by metamorphic rock in the northern mountainous area alluvial formations in the middle area and a small portion of dune sand near the coastline the watershed is devoted to intensive agriculture such as sugarcane pasture pineapple rice and tobacco which are planted on the clay loam red soil the dominant land cover is sugarcane and sugarcane plantations are always active in summer along with some tillage activities prior to planting pastures are also prominent in the watershed and are harvested four to five times every year with intensive agricultural activities the terrestrial discharge from the todoroki watershed is a potential agent in the deterioration of its downstream reef ecosystem 2 2 monitoring and sources of data a set of instruments consisting of continuous recording rain gauges water level loggers and turbidity sensors were used to record rainfall stream flow and turbidity respectively fig 1 rainfall was continuously measured by four hobo rain gauge data loggers onset computer corp usa water stages were recorded every 15 min using the hobo water level data logger onset computer corp usa under the todoroki bridge gauging station in fig 1 near the mouth of the todoroki river which is not influenced by tidal fluctuations corrected water level data were obtained by performing atmospheric pressure compensation the final water level data were then transformed into river discharge q m3 s 1 using a calibrated rating curve which is expressed by the equation q 0 0007l 2 0 1065l 0 3957 where l is the water level in cm this equation was derived via periodic flow and water level measurements conducted by the okinawa prefectural government 1994 turbidity formazin turbidity units ftu has also been continuously measured using the compact clw range 0 1618 ftu and infinity clw range 0 1242 ftu sensors jfe advantech co ltd for the periods of 2011 2012 and 2012 2015 respectively the suspended sediment concentration ssc and turbidity data measured by sensors over a range of hydrological conditions were used to produce a calibrated rating curve which expressed by ssc mg l 1 1 216 turbidity ftu sith et al 2017 during the study period 66 water samples were obtained manually by bucket or by automatic sampling methods automatic water sampling was conducted using a teledyne isco 6712 with 24 one liter bottles installed beneath the todoroki bridge gauging station fig 1 the water samples were directly filtered in the site through a whatman filter gf f 0 7 μm the filters were brought to laboratory and dried at 105 c for 2 h and were kept in desiccator for cooling at the same time other water samples were also collected for the analysis of dissolved nutrient concentrations namely nitrate no3 and phosphate po4 3 the samples for the nutrients were immediately filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate dismic filters advantec japan into duplicate 10 ml acrylic tubes and were kept frozen at 20 c until analysis nitrate no3 and phosphate po4 3 concentrations were determined calorimetrically using the quaatro

continuous spatially distributed hydrological basin scale model swat is designed to simulate water sediment nutrient chemical and bacterial transport in gauged and ungauged watersheds with consideration of interactions among weather conditions soil properties stream channel characteristics vegetation and crop growth and land management practices and to calculate pollutant loads from various nonpoint and point sources arnold et al 1994 the swat model divided the watershed into sub watersheds which were then subdivided into hydrological response units hrus consisting of homogeneous land use soil and slope characteristics the swat system is linked to a geographical information system gis to integrate various spatial environmental data such as land use soil map and digital elevation model dem in addition a new coupled model the so called swat modflow has fully coupled swat with the groundwater flow model modflow to accurately simulate and improve the groundwater component bailey et al 2016 the theory and details of the hydrological and transport processes of the model are available online in swat documentation http swatmodel tamu edu 2 4 model setup the swat model basically requires the dem land use soil meteorological data and crop cultivation management information as its inputs which are shown in fig 2 and summarized in table 1 the major crop cultivation management information including the planting schedule fertilizer application and tillage are summarized in table 2 in this study the arcswat2012 interface embedded within the gis arcgis 10 2 2 was used to compile the input files dem 10 m x 10 m was used to delineate the sub basins and river networks to obtain the accurate location of river networks the river burn in option in swat was used to generate arcs based on river network data national land agency okinawa prefecture a total of 11 sub watersheds were delineated using a threshold area of 25 ha and 436 hrus were generated based on the threshold levels 0 0 0 of land use soil and slope classifications the green ampt infiltration method was used for rainfall runoff estimation green and ampt 1911 while the penman monteith method was applied to estimating potential evapotranspiration pet monteith 1965 channel routing was computed using a variable storage coefficient method williams 1969 with sub daily configuration swat simulates sub daily erosion by incorporating splash erosion model based on eurosem model overland flow erosion model based on answers model and channel flow erosion model based on bagnold s model yang s model and brownlie model jeong et al 2011 in this study the yang s model was selected for channel flow erosion the swat model was further fully coupled with modflow using swatmod prep the interface for preparing swat modflow simulations bailey et al 2017 the interface allows users to set up a finite difference grid for a groundwater model based on modflow ntw which is directly linked with the hrus and sub basins of the swat model the groundwater model was discretized into finite different grids with a size of 30 30 m the groundwater aquifer was set to one layer with the thickness of 30 m the geological map with published ranges of parameters hydraulic conductivity specific storage specific yield and porosity was used as the groundwater model inputs 2 5 model calibration and validation in this study auto and manual calibration were performed interactively the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm built into the soil and water assessment tool calibration and uncertainty procedure swat cup 2012 abbaspour 2014 was used to calibrate the swat model against observed hourly stream flow and water quality with several repetitions of 500 simulations sufi 2 is an efficient algorithm using stochastic approach to evaluate the swat model performance and uncertainty during calibration and validation of the model abbaspour et al 2007 yang et al 2008 initially the ranges of targeted parameters for calibration are defined by physically meaningful values table s1 s2 and s3 in the supplementary materials those parameter values are then allowed to change by replacement addition and relative change to the initial values based on different hrus in sufi 2 uncertainty in parameters expressed as the ranges uniform distributions accounts for all sources of uncertainties such as uncertainty in driving variables e g rainfall conceptual model parameters and measured data the model outputs for each parameter iteration are then analyzed to quantify the model output uncertainty defined by 95 prediction uncertainty or 95ppu which is calculated within the 2 5 and 97 5 cumulative distribution of the model output results a five year warm up period 2006 2010 was run to establish proper initial conditions for the swat model which was calibrated from 2011 to 2013 and validated from 2014 to 2015 for both stream flow and water quality in terms of sediment no3 and po4 3 concentrations on hourly basis at the watershed outlet gauging station fig 1 the calibrated and validated swat model was then coupled with the modflow model and another calibration was manually performed for swat modflow by graphically re comparing the simulated and observed values of stream flow and water quality moreover at the same time the coupled model was also calibrated by comparing the simulated and observed groundwater head in a monitoring well k3 fig 1 during the period from 2014 to 2015 2 6 model evaluation the performance of the model for simulating stream flow and water quality is generally evaluated graphically using the coefficient of determination r2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as quantitative statistical tools tolson and shoemaker 2007 the coefficient of determination gives the proportion of the variance in measured data explained by the model r2 ranging from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating less error variance values of r2 normally greater than 0 5 are considered to be acceptable santhi et al 2001 van liew and garbrecht 2003 the nse is a normalized statistic that compares the variance of observations with the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the observed data variance nash and sutchliffe 1970 nse ranges from negative infinity to 1 with 1 indicating perfect agreement between simulated and observed values the model is considered to be perfect when nse is greater than 0 75 satisfactory when nse is between 0 36 and 0 75 and unsatisfactory when nse is lower than 0 36 nash and sutchliffe 1970 krause et al 2005 r2 and nse are computed by the following equations n s e 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 and r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 where o i and s i are the observed and simulated values respectively n is the total number of paired values and o and s are the mean observed and simulated values respectively 2 7 implementation of best management practices the bmp scenarios were only implemented for sugarcane farmland as this is the major crop in the study watershed the considered bmps are alternative tillage s1 and s2 fertilizer control s3 land cover conversions s4 to s13 filter strip s14 and s15 mulching s16 and s17 cover crop s18 to s21 and combined scenarios s22 and s23 table 3 most of the bmps were represented in the swat model by modifying parameters related to the mechanisms of the practices arabi et al 2008 waidler et al 2011 the reduced tillage s1 involves the reduction of soil mixing efficiency as compared with conventional tillage scenario whereas conservation tillage s2 involves the less aggressive mixing of soils the description of each tillage technique including mixing depth and mixing efficiency considered in the swat model is presented in table 4 the fertilizer control s3 scenario was implemented by considering the standard fertilizer utilities recommended by okinawa prefecture 2014 the schedule and amount of fertilizer application are shown in table 5 land cover conversion scenarios were also implemented by converting current summer sugarcane to other kinds of farmland the scenario s4 was simulated by turning summer sugarcane 2 farmland approximately 60 of the total summer sugarcane farmland areas into spring sugarcane which is planted immediately after harvesting the scenario s5 was applied by introducing the fertilizer control for spring sugarcane in scenario s4 the scenarios s6 and s7 involve the conversion of all summer sugarcane to spring sugarcane with and without fertilizer control respectively on the other hand scenarios s8 s9 s10 and s11 were applied by just introducing the spring perennial sugarcane ratooning instead of spring sugarcane in scenarios s4 s5 s6 and s7 respectively the plantation of spring perennial sugarcane is the same to that of spring sugarcane without tillage activities the cultivation management of both spring and spring perennial sugarcane including the planting schedule fertilizer application tillage and harvesting are presented in table 5 in addition the scenarios s12 and s13 were also introduced by updating summer sugarcane 2 and all summer sugarcane farmland to pasture farmland respectively the filter strip scenarios s14 and s15 were simulated by installing a vegetative filter strip of 1 m and 3 m width at sugarcane hrus the scenarios s16 and s17 involve the application of partially and fully mulching on sugarcane farmland respectively both mulching scenarios were simulated by manipulating crop cover and management factor usle c with the coefficient of 0 2 and 0 1 for partially mulching and fully mulching respectively those coefficients were adapted from previous studies in the same region higa et al 1994 hanashiro et al 1996 and mitsumoto et al 1996 moreover the curve number value for sugarcane was reduced by 2 units from the calibrated value to represent the residue management practices arabi et al 2008 the scenarios s18 s19 s20 and s21 involve the introduction of sweet clover oats cowpeas and sunflower cover crops respectively and were formulated by assuming the cover crops were planted after summer sugarcane harvesting and killed a week before the next plantation finally the combination of fertilizer control and mulching scenarios which were considered to be the most effective in reducing pollutant loads were modeled together under scenarios s22 and s23 the different types of conservation practices were selected and adapted from the department of agriculture and fisheries okinawa prefecture the load reductions were considered as the efficiencies of bmps which were represented as the percentage changes from the baseline scenario efficiency 100 baseline load bmps load baseline load 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation 3 1 1 stream flow simulation table s1 in the supplementary materials lists the 17 parameters for swat model calibration of stream flow in the todoroki watershed the initial range of these parameters was set as the default values extracted from swat documents the swat cup program with the sufi 2 algorithm was applied to calibrate the model against observed hourly stream flow with several iterations of 500 simulations fig 3 graphically illustrates the observed and simulated stream flow at the gauging station the results revealed that the model successfully predicted the hourly stream flow in the study watershed by indicating good agreement between observed and simulated values for the calibration period 2011 2013 fig 3a the nse and r2 values were 0 63 and 0 71 respectively moreover the calibrated model still performed satisfactorily for validation during a period 2014 2015 with goodness of fit statistics nse 0 62 and r2 0 73 fig 3b in this study simulated groundwater head above mean sea level was also compared with the observed values at a k3 monitoring well located at the upper part of the watershed fig 3c the simulated and observed groundwater head over two years 2014 2015 also showed similar patterns with acceptable statistical criteria nse 0 48 r2 0 58 the parameters for modflow model calibration are shown in table s2 in the supplementary materials for the entire period of simulation 2011 2015 the model predicted the mean annual water balance in the study watershed the total mean annual precipitation mainly comprises the evapotranspiration et process 25 26 surface runoff 26 53 and recharge to the aquifer 48 21 fig 4 shows the seasonal patterns of rainfall surface runoff total groundwater discharge from the aquifer into the stream networks and evapotranspiration the monthly surface runoff follows the patterns of monthly rainfall with the high fractions occurring in may august september and october during the beginning of rainy season and typhoon occurrences it is interesting to observe that the highest et fractions occurred during the summer months april september when the temperature was relatively high and the lowest fractions could be observed during winter december january february however moderate et was found in autumn october november and spring february march when the temperature was relatively moderate moreover monthly groundwater discharge was negatively correlated with evapotranspiration the low groundwater discharge could be observed in summer months when et was relatively high conversely groundwater discharge was relatively high in winter months when the et was relatively low this could be explained by the fact that during summer months with high temperature large amounts of rainfall were evaporated reducing infiltration rates and further affecting groundwater discharge however in winter months low temperatures could cause low evapotranspiration allowing large amounts of rainfall to infiltrate into the watershed aquifer and inducing high groundwater discharge into the stream networks nevertheless in some months may and august the watershed always experienced flash flood events such that surface runoff was the predominant process with high fractions compared to those of evapotranspiration and groundwater discharge in the study watershed 3 1 2 water quality simulation simulation of the ssc in the todoroki watershed was calibrated for a period 2011 2013 and validated during 2014 2015 based on hourly time steps the calibration was carried out using both the swat cup program with several iterations of 500 simulations and manual calibration interactively the calibrated parameters used for sediment calibration are shown in table s3 in the supplementary materials the reasonable agreement could be observed for both calibration and validation fig 5 with hourly time steps nse 0 47 and r2 0 58 were observed during calibration while validation also indicated satisfactory statistical performance with nse 0 51 r2 0 56 for the simulations of no3 and po4 3 concentrations 42 measurements 2011 2013 and 24 measurements 2014 2015 were used for calibration and validation respectively the observed no3 and po4 3 concentrations were both found to be consistent with simulated values in the study watershed the graphical comparison for nitrate and phosphate showed that the temporal patterns and magnitude of simulated values followed those of observed values with reasonable agreement fig 6 shows a comparison of the observed and simulated no3 concentrations during the calibration 2011 2013 and validation 2014 2015 periods with nse 0 38 r2 0 61 and nse 0 42 r2 0 51 respectively the trends of no3 concentration was higher in 2012 and 2014 as compared with those in 2011 2012 and 2015 on the other hand fig 7 indicates that the swat model could also simulate the po4 3 concentration with goodness of fit statistics of nse 0 42 r2 0 52 and nse 0 29 r2 0 46 for calibration and validation respectively the parameters used for nutrients calibration are presented in table s3 in the supplementary materials 3 1 3 spatial distribution of the groundwater surface water interaction the simulated groundwater hydraulic head m at the end of the simulation 2011 2015 is shown in fig 8 a the spatial hydraulic head followed the topographical conditions in the study watershed the high heads could be observed at the upper part and low heads were found from the center part to the watershed outlet indicating that the groundwater flows from the upper part toward watershed outlet adjacent to the coastline the mean annual groundwater recharge estimated by swat is shown in fig 8b signifying that high groundwater recharge could be observed in areas of the upper part particularly forested ones however the low to moderate recharge rates were found in urban and agricultural areas with high slopes which possibly allowed large amounts of rainfall to flow overland rather than infiltrate into the aquifer fig 8c shows the mean annual nitrate leaching computed by the swat model in the study watershed the amount of annual nitrate leaching strongly depends on the annual amount of fertilizer applied to soil layers on agricultural lands in the study watershed the main sources of nitrate input are from sugarcane and pasture farmlands in which relatively high amounts of fertilizer were applied nitrate leaching from sugarcane farmland was relatively high compared to that from pasture farmland located in the southern part of the watershed this can be explained by the relatively high fertilizer input for the sugarcane farmland as compared to that for pasture farmland umezawa et al 2002 estimated the annual total nitrogen inputs from sugarcane farmland to be almost 20 times higher than nitrogen inputs from pasture farmland per hectare in the study watershed the spatial distribution of groundwater discharge into the stream network is indicated in fig 8d demonstrating that a low groundwater discharge rate could be observed at the upper part of the watershed where the stream bed elevations are considered to be slightly lower than the groundwater head elevation however the high groundwater discharge could be observed at the lower center part of the watershed in which the hydraulic gradient is strongly positive due to high groundwater head at the upper part the spatial distribution of no3 moving from the watershed aquifer into the stream networks obviously followed the spatial distribution of groundwater discharge fig 8e moreover the simulated spatial distribution of no3 is exactly consistent with observations conducted by blanco et al 2010 indicating groundwater is a major source of no3 in the river streams 3 1 4 scenario analysis for best management practices bmps the annual reduction efficiencies of sediment no3 and po4 3 loads obtained by bmp scenario analysis for the period 2011 2015 are presented by boxplots as shown in fig 9 the most efficient bmp scenario for sediment load reduction was the conversion of all sugarcane farmland to pasture s13 with the mean removal efficiency of 86 1 followed by the conversion of all summer sugarcane to spring perennial sugarcane s10 75 the mulching scenarios were also effective for reducing the sediment load with mean removal efficiencies of 62 5 and 70 5 for partially mulching s16 and fully mulching s17 respectively the other remaining land cover conversion scenarios s4 to s9 moderately reduced sediment load with the mean removal efficiencies ranging from 33 3 to 44 1 moreover the mean removal efficiencies from four cover crop scenarios s18 to s21 were found to be relatively low ranging from 17 4 to 26 1 however alternative tillage scenarios s1 and s2 and filter strip scenarios s14 and 15 were not very effective for sediment load reduction in the study watershed with the mean removal efficiencies of less than 20 the scenario s3 and s13 achieved large reduction in the amount of nitrate no3 load with the mean removal efficiencies of 53 5 and 39 respectively followed by scenarios s12 25 4 cover crop scenarios 15 2 18 8 s11 16 9 and s7 14 9 the other scenarios including alternative tillage land cover conversions without fertilizer control and filter strip were not effective in no3 load reduction on the other hand most of bmp scenarios were effective in phosphate po4 3 load reduction in the study watershed the conversion of summer sugarcane to spring perennial sugarcane s10 and s11 were the most effective for po4 3 load reduction with the mean removal efficiency of approximately 65 however other land cover conversion scenarios achieved the moderate reduction of po4 3 load varying from 13 1 to 59 8 both partially and fully mulching scenarios reduced po4 3 load by 35 4 and 41 8 respectively whereas the removal efficiencies for cover crop and alternative tillage scenarios ranged from 10 4 to 21 1 in addition the combined scenarios were very effective for reducing po4 3 load with the removal efficiencies of 50 9 and 55 6 while implementing partially s16 and fully mulching s17 together with fertilizer control s3 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 model performance the swat model either underestimated or overestimated for extreme flood events even though it successfully simulated the stream flow with acceptable limits in the study watershed moreover significant fluctuation of the hydrological conditions characterized by episodic events caused the difficulties for the stream flow calibration in the study watershed in addition it is important to note that with the hourly temporal resolution of continuous long term data too many break points of observed values were compared with those of simulated values possibly resulting in difficulties in stream flow calibration as well the fully coupled model swat modflow could successfully simulate belowground components by giving good performance when comparing the simulated and observed groundwater head in a monitoring well located in upper part of the watershed during the period 2014 2015 fig 3 the groundwater head gradually decreased from mid 2014 until early 2015 due to the absence of intensive flood events however it highly fluctuated in 2015 when plenty of moderate to high flooding events occurred confirming that groundwater in the study watershed is characterized as episodic and highly dynamic responses to rainfall events nearly half 48 1 of rainfall are recharged to the aquifer and return to stream networks as lateral flow the high amount of groundwater discharge was indicated by the setup of the high permeability of the subsurface structure which was predominated by ryukyu limestone moreover the groundwater boundary was setup as no flow or water divide following the watershed boundary bailey et al 2016 therefore the groundwater recharge into the watershed aquifer simulated by swat was not likely moving out of the watershed aquifer but discharging into stream networks instead the swat model with sub daily configuration could reasonably predict the sediment concentration in the study watershed however only a few studies have used sediment concentration instead of sediment load or yield for calibration and validation because it is difficult to have good matches between the observed and simulated values oeurng et al 2011 qiu and wang 2013 on the other hand with a new sub daily algorithm which incorporates more realistic components including splash erosion based on the kinetic energy delivered by raindrops and overland flow erosion using a physically based equation the swat model performed as well as or better than the swat with daily structure jeong et al 2011 although the sub daily algorithm is likely able to sophisticatedly predict sub daily erosion in a small watershed swat is still not able to consider the overland deposited sediment generated from previous flood events and allows all soil eroded by overland flow to reach the river directly the swat model could reasonably simulate no3 concentration for the period of validation and po4 3 concentration for the period of calibration the poor statistical indicator with nse 0 40 might be caused by many large irregular gaps between each observation due to the limited number of observed data resulting in poorly capturing the water quality fluctuation in addition the contribution from groundwater in the study site might also significantly influence in regulating the water quality in the streams however in this study the groundwater simulation was not calibrated against the water quality possibly resulting in incapability to correctly predict the water quality of groundwater seepage into the streams which eventually impacts on the water quality at the outlet of the watershed the simulated no3 concentration was generally drastically decreased during rainfall events with a gradual increase in river discharge this adverse relationship indicated the strong discharge input from surface runoff causing dilution effects other researchers also reported that the relatively low no3 concentration was always observed during intensive flood rainfall due to the dilution effect of surface runoff in an intensive agricultural watershed stutter et al 2008 and kato et al 2009 after rainfall events the no3 concentration slightly increased because the contribution from groundwater become dominant over surface runoff in controlling no3 concentration umezawa et al 2002 indicated that the no3 concentration from groundwater is higher than those from rain water and river water in the same study watershed the long term trend of simulated no3 concentration also showed seasonal variability which followed the seasonal patterns of rainfall and the schedule of fertilizer application fig 6 during the months of intensive rainfall events from august to october overlapping with the planting of summer sugarcane the no3 concentration presented high values larger than 3 mg l 1 this could be explained by the fact that with adequate rainfall a large amount of nitrate in the top soil were leached via groundwater recharge and returned to the stream networks resulting in increasing the nitrate concentration level moreover it is noted that the simulated no3 concentration trend also showed inter annual patterns due to different fractions of summer sugarcanes summer sugarcane 1 and 2 planted in the study watershed in this study summer sugarcane 1 which had a smaller fraction about 40 of the total sugarcane farmland was planted in 2011 while plantation of summer sugarcane 2 which had a higher fraction about 60 of the total sugarcane farmland began in 2012 therefore during months of intensive rainfall events the simulated trends of no3 concentration were relatively higher in 2012 and 2014 as compared with those in 2011 2013 and 2015 fig 6 in the study watershed the simulated trend of po4 3 concentration did not show any seasonal patterns however the po4 3 concentration likely followed the fluctuation of hydrological conditions blanco et al 2010 indicated that po4 3 generally exhibited elevated concentration during rainfall events particularly low to moderate rainfall 4 2 impact of bmps on sediment nitrate and phosphate loads the satisfactory performance of the model with sub daily configuration suggested that the model can be applied to assess the impacts of bmps in the study watershed the alternative tillage scenarios s1 and s2 were slightly effective for reducing sediment and po4 3 loads and did not have any significant impact upon the soluble nitrate no3 load this can be explained by the fact that undisturbed soil by reduced and conservation tillage can reduce splash erosion by rainfall hence the decreasing in sediment load the reduction of the soil disturbance could leave more soluble nutrients on top soil which can be further easily transported by overland flow her et al 2017 the successful implementation of alternative tillage scenarios for the increase of the sediment nitrogen and phosphorus losses within watershed scale studies has been reported previously chung et al 2002 ulén et al 2010 francesconi et al 2014 motsinger et al 2016 taylor et al 2016 however in other study sites the alternative tillage scenarios including no tillage and conservation tillage did not significantly reduce the total nitrogen and phosphorus loads lam et al 2011 bosch et al 2013 taylor et al 2016 her et al 2017 therefore it is obvious that the effectiveness of those scenarios depends upon the watershed characteristics and hydrological conditions the conversion of summer sugarcane to either spring or spring perennial sugarcane farmland scenarios s4 to s11 were effective in reduction of sediment and po4 3 loads but did not show any significant influence on no3 load except for the ones with fertilizer control s7 and s11 based on the plantation schedule of sugarcane table 2 the conversion of summer sugarcane to either spring or spring perennial sugarcane reduced the bare soil cover after summer sugarcane harvesting for approximately 5 months march to july resulting in the decrease of sediment load in the study watershed moreover the conversion from summer to spring perennial sugarcane scenarios s8 to s11 eliminated the tillage activities which were the main factor controlling of the soil erosion in addition po4 3 load were also significantly reduced by 13 1 to 66 5 for scenarios s4 to s11 whereas there were not notable changes of no3 load from the baseline scenario this can be explained by a large amount of fertilizer application for both spring and spring perennial sugarcane as compared with that of summer sugarcane based on the cultivation management the same amount of fertilizer was applied two times per year for summer sugarcane while three times per year for either spring or spring perennial sugarcane table 2 even though changing the types of sugarcane may notably influence the sediment no3 and po4 3 loads it may also economically impact the local farmers living in the study watershed both directly and indirectly by changing the crop yield verma 2002 confirmed that perennial crops produce relatively low crop yields as compared with main crops due to soil conditions such as compaction and low fertility moreover unlike summer sugarcane planted in august both spring and perennial sugarcane which are planted in spring march may be severely damaged by typhoons occurring in august to september resulting in the decrease of crop yields based on the interviews with livestock farmers the number of cattle has been increased due to the high demand of fattening calves from local people and for exporting to other areas in japan this condition might cause a possible shift from sugarcane to pasture farmland in this study the conversion of summer sugarcane to pasture farmland scenarios s12 and s13 largely reduced sediment no3 and po4 3 loads by 61 and 86 1 25 4 and 53 5 and 37 7 and 51 5 respectively this is obvious that the rapid growth of pasture without any tillage activities significantly minimizes the severe soil erosion however the amount of fertilizer application for pasture was relatively small as compared with that for sugarcane resulting in low nutrients exported from the study watershed implementation of the filter strip scenarios s14 and s15 increased the sediment losses 7 5 and 18 9 and phosphate losses 27 6 and 38 2 but did not significantly affect the nitrate losses 0 9 and 2 4 respectively this finding is consistent with other previous studies which reported that implementation of filter strip scenario does not achieve a significant reduction in nitrogen load particularly in soluble form taylor et al 2016 jang et al 2017 and her et al 2017 however the effectiveness of filter strip depends upon the local conditions such as slope the size of the filter strips and the scope of the areas where they are implemented the mulching scenario is commonly and effectively applied for reducing the sediment and associated particulate nutrients by minimizing splash and overland flow erosion in mulching scenarios s16 and s17 the crop cover and management factors were introduced together with the reduction in the runoff to realistically represent mulching according to the finding of this investigation the mulching scenario in this study achieved a relatively high amount of reduction in pollution loads as compared with other previous relevant studies in which mulching was modeled by only introducing the runoff reduction the sediment and po4 3 loads were significantly reduced by 62 5 and 70 5 and 35 4 and 41 8 while the no3 load was slightly decreased by only 0 9 and 1 1 for partially and fully mulching respectively the fact that little reduction occurred in the no3 load can be explained that the surface runoff reduction caused increasing infiltration capacity thereby no3 was quickly leached from the top soil to the aquifer and further transported by groundwater flow into the streams the cover crops were very effective at reducing the sediment no3 and po4 3 loads in the study watershed the scenarios s18 to s21 archived the reduction of sediment no3 and po4 3 loads ranging from 17 4 to 26 1 15 2 to 18 8 and 14 2 to 21 1 respectively the planting of a cover crop provided a leaf canopy to protect against soil erosion by reducing the rainfall detachment force moreover during the growing stage the cover crop can increase the uptake of the remaining nutrients in the soil from previous main crops the assessment of combined scenarios is to figure out the most effective mitigation option for reducing all pollutant loads in this study the fertilizer control scenario s3 which was a very effective scenario for soluble nutrient reduction was combined with mulching scenarios s16 and s17 which achieved large reduction of sediment the scenarios s22 and s23 could reduce sediment no3 and po4 3 loads by 62 5 40 1 and 50 9 and 70 5 40 4 and 55 6 respectively the effectiveness of the multiple combined scenarios is almost equal to the sum of their individual effectiveness in reducing of sediment no3 and po4 3 loads this finding is consistent with other studies through a wide range of watershed scales and conditions bosch et al 2013 taylor et al 2016 jang et al 2017 4 3 impact of bmps on sediment nitrate and phosphate concentrations although some bmps were very effective at reduction of sediment no3 and po4 3 loads it is needed to assess their effectiveness to achieve the statutory target for water quality status within the study watershed the percent exceedance curve which indicates the percentage of time that sediment no3 and po4 3 concentrations are exceeded a particular level were developed on hourly basis during the whole simulation period 2011 2015 for each bmp scenario fig 10 in this study only sediment concentration has the reference of reduction target in which the sediment concentration is higher than 200 mg l 1 is considered to be harmful to downstream coral reef ecosystem okinawa prefectural government ordinance in 1995 however there is no such reference for nutrient reduction so percent exceedance curve for no3 and po4 3 can be used to assess which bmp is potential in reducing the concentration level in the study watershed fig 10a indicates the percent exceedance curve for sediment concentration under scenarios s0 s1 s2 s4 s6 s8 s10 s12 s13 s14 s15 s16 s17 and s20 except for fertilizer control scenario s3 and the scenarios combined with fertilizer control under baseline scenario s0 the sediment concentration exceeded the reduction target 200 mg l 1 with approximately 0 93 of the time which was reduced to 0 054 while implementing scenario s13 conversion of all summer sugarcane to pasture moreover the conversion of summer sugarcane to spring perennial sugarcane scenarios s8 and s10 were also significantly effective for sediment reduction with the percent of time exceeded of 0 21 and 0 13 respectively the mulching scenarios s16 and s17 significantly achieved the reduction of time exceeded percentage by 0 44 and 0 26 as compared to the baseline scenario s0 the conversion of summer sugarcane to spring sugarcane s4 and s6 slightly reduced the amount of time that the sediment concentration exceeded 200 mg l 1 by 0 77 and 0 69 respectively however the alternative tillage s1 and s2 filter strip s14 and s15 and cover crop scenarios s18 s21 had very limited effect on the percent exceedance curve 0 88 and 0 87 0 83 and 0 81 and 0 78 0 86 respectively fig 10b shows the percent of time exceeded for hourly nitrate no3 concentration during the whole simulation period the fertilizer control s3 and mulching with fertilizer control s22 and s23 scenarios were found to be the most effective in minimizing the no3 concentration level followed by the conversion of summer sugarcane to pasture s12 and s13 and cover crop scenarios s18 s21 the conversion of all summer sugarcane to either spring s6 and s7 or spring perennial sugarcane scenarios s10 and s11 induced significantly elevated no3 concentration as compared with baseline scenario s0 although they were found to have slightly influence on no3 load this can be explained by the reduction in runoff which caused the decreasing in load but the increasing in concentration in addition the remaining scenarios s1 s2 s4 s5 s8 s9 and s14 s17 had very limited influence on no3 concentration level in the study watershed the percent exceedance curve of po4 3 concentration is illustrated in fig 10c the most effective scenarios for minimizing of po4 3 concentration level were conversion of summer sugarcane 2 to spring perennial sugarcane without and with fertilizer control scenarios s8 and s9 followed by conversion of all summer sugarcane to spring perennial sugarcane s10 and s11 combined mulching with fertilizer control s22 and s23 mulching s16 and s17 conversion of summer sugarcane to pasture farmland s12 and s13 filter strip s14 and s15 conversion summer sugarcane 2 to spring sugarcane s4 and s5 cover crop s18 s21 fertilizer control s3 and alternative tillage scenarios s1 and s2 however conversion of all summer sugarcane to spring sugarcane s6 and s7 were not effective but slightly increased the po4 3 concentration level in the study watershed due to the larger amount of fertilizer application under s6 and s7 as compared with that under baseline scenario s0 5 conclusions this study investigated the applicability of a coupled swat modflow model to simulate hydrology and water quality and to evaluate the bmps in a small agricultural watershed in a subtropical island the model effectively predicted continuous long term and high resolution stream flow and water quality with acceptable statistical criteria even though there were some discrepancies between the simulated and observed values during calibration and validation the coupling model also effectively simulated the groundwater head in the study watershed with good statistical criteria this study also confirms that groundwater in the study watershed is characterized as episodic and highly dynamic responses to rainfall events and nearly half 48 1 of rainfall are recharged to the aquifer and return to stream networks as lateral flow the satisfactory model was further applied to evaluate the effectiveness of bmp scenarios in reducing sediment no3 and po4 3 loads in this study varieties of bmps were introduced by realistically modifying parameters relevant to the mechanism of each bmp in the swat model moreover this is the first study to quantify the impacts of bmps on the long term and high resolution water quality for sediment and nutrients from the model results the land cover conversion scenario performed very well at reducing sediment load with the efficiency ranging from 18 8 to 86 1 the mulching scenario also significantly achieved the reduction of sediment load by 62 5 and 70 5 for partially and fully mulching respectively the cover crop alternative tillage and filter strip scenarios moderately reduced the sediment load with the efficiencies varying from 7 5 to 26 1 however these scenarios could be given to the reduction in agricultural productivity as a result of changing the planting method moreover the farmers need to expense for installation and maintenance of the bmps the conversion of all summer sugarcane to pasture and fertilizer control scenarios gave the superior reduction in nitrate no3 load by 53 5 and 39 0 respectively while the efficiencies of other remaining scenarios were found to be less than 20 the increase of pasture farmland however is resulted from an increase in the number of cattle which may possibly trigger the point source pollutions leading to the increase of not only nutrients but also bacteria if there is not a proper management of the cattle moreover a decrease of fertilizer may also result in loss of crop yield most of the scenarios achieved the significant reduction of phosphate po4 3 load the conversion of summer sugarcane to spring perennial sugarcane and pasture scenarios were the most effective in po4 3 load reduction with efficiencies 37 7 66 1 and followed by mulching scenarios 35 4 41 8 the results further suggested that the bmps recommended in the study are appropriately combined scenarios which achieved a significant reduction in all nps loads the pollutant loads sediment no3 and po4 3 were reduced by 62 5 40 1 and 50 9 and 70 5 40 4 and 55 6 respectively while implementing partially and fully mulching together with fertilizer control however the fertilizer control should be studied in detail by not only decreasing amount of fertilizer but also the splitting of fertilizer with appropriate amount and timing and their effects on crop yield even though the effective bmps were revealed in this study to make actual implementation happen it is strongly depending on the farmers whether they are willing to accept all the consequences such as the loss of crop yield and the expenses for bmp installation therefore the local government should promote those effective bmps and encourage local farmers to implement those bmps by assuring that the installation and maintenance of bmps can be subsidized or the loss of crop yield can be financially compensated acknowledgements this research was financially supported by the environment research and

11210,the predominantly agricultural coastal watershed located in tropical subtropical island has served as a pathway for nonpoint source nps pollution loading into the downstream coastal ecosystems the present study aims to assess watershed hydrology and water quality by applying a watershed model to long term high resolution monitoring data and to evaluate the reduction of nonpoint source pollution by implementing best management practices bmps in a small agricultural watershed located in southwestern japan the soil water and assessment tool swat was coupled to a groundwater model modflow and applied to simulate stream flow sediment and nutrients discharges the results revealed that the model successfully predicted hourly stream flow sediment and nutrients concentrations in the study watershed and that the model could be further used to evaluate bmp scenarios this is the first attempt to quantify the impacts of multiple agricultural mitigation measures on long term water quality for sediment nitrate and phosphate at an hourly resolution from the model results the land cover conversion and mulching scenarios achieved a significant reduction in sediment followed by the cover crop alternative tillage and filter strip scenarios moreover conversion of all summer sugarcane to pasture farmland and fertilizer control scenarios gave the superior reduction in nitrate load while other scenarios were minimally effective on the other hand most of the scenarios significantly achieved the reduction of phosphate load the results further indicated that the bmps recommended in this study are appropriately combined scenarios which achieved the significant reduction in all nps loads although this study revealed some effective mitigation measures to improve the water quality in the study watershed actual implementation of correct ones may be practically challenging unless other environmental and economic risks e g the increase of other pollutants and reduction in agricultural productivity are also taken into considerations keywords swat modflow stream flow nonpoint source pollution bmp 1 introduction in subtropical tropical regions agricultural activities have caused high levels of nonpoint source nps pollution brought by large amounts of rainfall and typhoon occurrences the increased nps may frequently affect the water quality of streams and the downstream coastal marine ecosystem due to excessive sedimentation and its associated pollutants the nutrients exported from the agricultural watershed due to excessive utilization of fertilizer have induced the transformation of water quality status from oligotrophic to eutrophic conditions and other major environmental problems in many coastal ecosystems cloern 2001 moreover anthropogenic development has caused excessive terrestrial runoff sedimentation and nutrients which further severely affected coral reefs by decreasing coral cover altering the coral community and transforming the ecosystem from coral dominated to algae dominated fabricius 2004 therefore understanding and quantifying the nps dynamics and their controlling factors are critical and important for controlling and implementing appropriate mitigation measures to minimize or completely eliminate the impact of the nps loads on the downstream environment heathwaite et al 2005 the todoroki river watershed in ishigaki island japan an intensively agricultural watershed significantly affects the downstream environmental ecosystem mainly fringing coral reefs it has predominantly served as a pathway for sediment and other associated pollutants loading into the reef during rainy seasons bringing high flood amplitudes and typhoon occurrences that overlap with the planting seasons omija et al 1998 mitsumoto et al 2000 blanco et al 2010 the coral reef located downstream of the watershed has been deteriorated through various land based and global scale environmental stresses including sedimentation red soil runoff and nutrients discharge from the todoroki river omija et al 1998 mitsumoto et al 2000 hasegawa 2011 inoue et al 2014 yamazaki et al 2015 to reduce the nps loads in the agricultural watershed agricultural conservation practices often called best management practices bmps have been widely proposed as effective mitigation measures by recent studies bosch et al 2013 geng et al 2015 ramos et al 2015 maharjan et al 2016 motsinger et al 2016 taylor et al 2016 her et al 2017 the bmps commonly implemented include alternative tillage filter strips mulching fertilizer control split fertilization crop cover conversion of the main crop to pasture farmland and so forth since the cost of the field experiments used to evaluate the effectiveness of these bmps is generally very high in terms of experimental installation and maintenance watershed models can be applied to represent the bmp and estimate their impacts arabi et al 2008 waidler et al 2011 the soil and water assessment tool swat a basin scale physically based continuous simulation model is promising and has been widely used to understand the water quantity and water quality issues in a wide range of watershed scales and environmental conditions arnold et al 1994 gassman et al 2007 neitsch et al 2009 although the swat model has been widely and successfully applied to simulate hydrology and water quality most of those applications have been at annual monthly or daily temporal resolutions however in small scale watersheds instantaneous hydrological responses often produce multiple flow events within a day therefore the time resolution of simulation should be as high as possible to properly capture the hydrological and transport processes during these short duration floods in this sense a model with sub daily configuration is preferable for accurately assessing hydrology and water quality in the study watershed in addition in a groundwater dominant watershed groundwater processes play a very important role in regulating dissolved nutrients in the stream networks however swat alone may not be adequate to simulate the flow and nutrient transport processes underground bain et al 2012 therefore an application of the swat modflow model a fully coupled combination of the swat and modflow models bailey et al 2016 can be applied to realistically represent groundwater surface water interactions in the study watershed where groundwater is predominant due to the highly permeable ryukyu limestone aquifer blanco et al 2010 the specific objectives of this study are i to evaluate capability of a coupled swat modflow model to predict rapid flushing events in a small agricultural watershed by calibrating and validating with continuous long term high resolution stream flow sediment and periodically measured nutrient observations ii to assess and understand groundwater surface water interactions in the study watershed and iii to assess the impact of various bmp implementations upon water quality sediment no3 and po4 3 in an intensively agricultural watershed 2 materials and methods 2 1 general characteristics of the study area todoroki is a small approximately 12 4 km2 watershed located in the southeastern part of ishigaki island 24 23 n latitude 124 14 e longitude 430 km southwest of the main okinawa island japan fig 1 located in the subtropical region the annual mean temperature humidity and precipitation in the study area are 24 3 c 78 and about 2000 mm respectively the weather conditions are characterized by different seasons north east monsoon in october march and high magnitude rainfall in may june followed by typhoon occurrences in august october moreover the wind direction is dominantly southerly in summer and northerly in winter the topographical condition in the watershed is characterized by a range of slopes and elevations varying from 0 to 17 and from 0 m to 149 m respectively ryukyu limestone in the southern area and gravel conglomerate in the northern area are the dominant geological formations in the watershed followed by metamorphic rock in the northern mountainous area alluvial formations in the middle area and a small portion of dune sand near the coastline the watershed is devoted to intensive agriculture such as sugarcane pasture pineapple rice and tobacco which are planted on the clay loam red soil the dominant land cover is sugarcane and sugarcane plantations are always active in summer along with some tillage activities prior to planting pastures are also prominent in the watershed and are harvested four to five times every year with intensive agricultural activities the terrestrial discharge from the todoroki watershed is a potential agent in the deterioration of its downstream reef ecosystem 2 2 monitoring and sources of data a set of instruments consisting of continuous recording rain gauges water level loggers and turbidity sensors were used to record rainfall stream flow and turbidity respectively fig 1 rainfall was continuously measured by four hobo rain gauge data loggers onset computer corp usa water stages were recorded every 15 min using the hobo water level data logger onset computer corp usa under the todoroki bridge gauging station in fig 1 near the mouth of the todoroki river which is not influenced by tidal fluctuations corrected water level data were obtained by performing atmospheric pressure compensation the final water level data were then transformed into river discharge q m3 s 1 using a calibrated rating curve which is expressed by the equation q 0 0007l 2 0 1065l 0 3957 where l is the water level in cm this equation was derived via periodic flow and water level measurements conducted by the okinawa prefectural government 1994 turbidity formazin turbidity units ftu has also been continuously measured using the compact clw range 0 1618 ftu and infinity clw range 0 1242 ftu sensors jfe advantech co ltd for the periods of 2011 2012 and 2012 2015 respectively the suspended sediment concentration ssc and turbidity data measured by sensors over a range of hydrological conditions were used to produce a calibrated rating curve which expressed by ssc mg l 1 1 216 turbidity ftu sith et al 2017 during the study period 66 water samples were obtained manually by bucket or by automatic sampling methods automatic water sampling was conducted using a teledyne isco 6712 with 24 one liter bottles installed beneath the todoroki bridge gauging station fig 1 the water samples were directly filtered in the site through a whatman filter gf f 0 7 μm the filters were brought to laboratory and dried at 105 c for 2 h and were kept in desiccator for cooling at the same time other water samples were also collected for the analysis of dissolved nutrient concentrations namely nitrate no3 and phosphate po4 3 the samples for the nutrients were immediately filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate dismic filters advantec japan into duplicate 10 ml acrylic tubes and were kept frozen at 20 c until analysis nitrate no3 and phosphate po4 3 concentrations were determined calorimetrically using the quaatro

continuous spatially distributed hydrological basin scale model swat is designed to simulate water sediment nutrient chemical and bacterial transport in gauged and ungauged watersheds with consideration of interactions among weather conditions soil properties stream channel characteristics vegetation and crop growth and land management practices and to calculate pollutant loads from various nonpoint and point sources arnold et al 1994 the swat model divided the watershed into sub watersheds which were then subdivided into hydrological response units hrus consisting of homogeneous land use soil and slope characteristics the swat system is linked to a geographical information system gis to integrate various spatial environmental data such as land use soil map and digital elevation model dem in addition a new coupled model the so called swat modflow has fully coupled swat with the groundwater flow model modflow to accurately simulate and improve the groundwater component bailey et al 2016 the theory and details of the hydrological and transport processes of the model are available online in swat documentation http swatmodel tamu edu 2 4 model setup the swat model basically requires the dem land use soil meteorological data and crop cultivation management information as its inputs which are shown in fig 2 and summarized in table 1 the major crop cultivation management information including the planting schedule fertilizer application and tillage are summarized in table 2 in this study the arcswat2012 interface embedded within the gis arcgis 10 2 2 was used to compile the input files dem 10 m x 10 m was used to delineate the sub basins and river networks to obtain the accurate location of river networks the river burn in option in swat was used to generate arcs based on river network data national land agency okinawa prefecture a total of 11 sub watersheds were delineated using a threshold area of 25 ha and 436 hrus were generated based on the threshold levels 0 0 0 of land use soil and slope classifications the green ampt infiltration method was used for rainfall runoff estimation green and ampt 1911 while the penman monteith method was applied to estimating potential evapotranspiration pet monteith 1965 channel routing was computed using a variable storage coefficient method williams 1969 with sub daily configuration swat simulates sub daily erosion by incorporating splash erosion model based on eurosem model overland flow erosion model based on answers model and channel flow erosion model based on bagnold s model yang s model and brownlie model jeong et al 2011 in this study the yang s model was selected for channel flow erosion the swat model was further fully coupled with modflow using swatmod prep the interface for preparing swat modflow simulations bailey et al 2017 the interface allows users to set up a finite difference grid for a groundwater model based on modflow ntw which is directly linked with the hrus and sub basins of the swat model the groundwater model was discretized into finite different grids with a size of 30 30 m the groundwater aquifer was set to one layer with the thickness of 30 m the geological map with published ranges of parameters hydraulic conductivity specific storage specific yield and porosity was used as the groundwater model inputs 2 5 model calibration and validation in this study auto and manual calibration were performed interactively the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm built into the soil and water assessment tool calibration and uncertainty procedure swat cup 2012 abbaspour 2014 was used to calibrate the swat model against observed hourly stream flow and water quality with several repetitions of 500 simulations sufi 2 is an efficient algorithm using stochastic approach to evaluate the swat model performance and uncertainty during calibration and validation of the model abbaspour et al 2007 yang et al 2008 initially the ranges of targeted parameters for calibration are defined by physically meaningful values table s1 s2 and s3 in the supplementary materials those parameter values are then allowed to change by replacement addition and relative change to the initial values based on different hrus in sufi 2 uncertainty in parameters expressed as the ranges uniform distributions accounts for all sources of uncertainties such as uncertainty in driving variables e g rainfall conceptual model parameters and measured data the model outputs for each parameter iteration are then analyzed to quantify the model output uncertainty defined by 95 prediction uncertainty or 95ppu which is calculated within the 2 5 and 97 5 cumulative distribution of the model output results a five year warm up period 2006 2010 was run to establish proper initial conditions for the swat model which was calibrated from 2011 to 2013 and validated from 2014 to 2015 for both stream flow and water quality in terms of sediment no3 and po4 3 concentrations on hourly basis at the watershed outlet gauging station fig 1 the calibrated and validated swat model was then coupled with the modflow model and another calibration was manually performed for swat modflow by graphically re comparing the simulated and observed values of stream flow and water quality moreover at the same time the coupled model was also calibrated by comparing the simulated and observed groundwater head in a monitoring well k3 fig 1 during the period from 2014 to 2015 2 6 model evaluation the performance of the model for simulating stream flow and water quality is generally evaluated graphically using the coefficient of determination r2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as quantitative statistical tools tolson and shoemaker 2007 the coefficient of determination gives the proportion of the variance in measured data explained by the model r2 ranging from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating less error variance values of r2 normally greater than 0 5 are considered to be acceptable santhi et al 2001 van liew and garbrecht 2003 the nse is a normalized statistic that compares the variance of observations with the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the observed data variance nash and sutchliffe 1970 nse ranges from negative infinity to 1 with 1 indicating perfect agreement between simulated and observed values the model is considered to be perfect when nse is greater than 0 75 satisfactory when nse is between 0 36 and 0 75 and unsatisfactory when nse is lower than 0 36 nash and sutchliffe 1970 krause et al 2005 r2 and nse are computed by the following equations n s e 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 and r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 where o i and s i are the observed and simulated values respectively n is the total number of paired values and o and s are the mean observed and simulated values respectively 2 7 implementation of best management practices the bmp scenarios were only implemented for sugarcane farmland as this is the major crop in the study watershed the considered bmps are alternative tillage s1 and s2 fertilizer control s3 land cover conversions s4 to s13 filter strip s14 and s15 mulching s16 and s17 cover crop s18 to s21 and combined scenarios s22 and s23 table 3 most of the bmps were represented in the swat model by modifying parameters related to the mechanisms of the practices arabi et al 2008 waidler et al 2011 the reduced tillage s1 involves the reduction of soil mixing efficiency as compared with conventional tillage scenario whereas conservation tillage s2 involves the less aggressive mixing of soils the description of each tillage technique including mixing depth and mixing efficiency considered in the swat model is presented in table 4 the fertilizer control s3 scenario was implemented by considering the standard fertilizer utilities recommended by okinawa prefecture 2014 the schedule and amount of fertilizer application are shown in table 5 land cover conversion scenarios were also implemented by converting current summer sugarcane to other kinds of farmland the scenario s4 was simulated by turning summer sugarcane 2 farmland approximately 60 of the total summer sugarcane farmland areas into spring sugarcane which is planted immediately after harvesting the scenario s5 was applied by introducing the fertilizer control for spring sugarcane in scenario s4 the scenarios s6 and s7 involve the conversion of all summer sugarcane to spring sugarcane with and without fertilizer control respectively on the other hand scenarios s8 s9 s10 and s11 were applied by just introducing the spring perennial sugarcane ratooning instead of spring sugarcane in scenarios s4 s5 s6 and s7 respectively the plantation of spring perennial sugarcane is the same to that of spring sugarcane without tillage activities the cultivation management of both spring and spring perennial sugarcane including the planting schedule fertilizer application tillage and harvesting are presented in table 5 in addition the scenarios s12 and s13 were also introduced by updating summer sugarcane 2 and all summer sugarcane farmland to pasture farmland respectively the filter strip scenarios s14 and s15 were simulated by installing a vegetative filter strip of 1 m and 3 m width at sugarcane hrus the scenarios s16 and s17 involve the application of partially and fully mulching on sugarcane farmland respectively both mulching scenarios were simulated by manipulating crop cover and management factor usle c with the coefficient of 0 2 and 0 1 for partially mulching and fully mulching respectively those coefficients were adapted from previous studies in the same region higa et al 1994 hanashiro et al 1996 and mitsumoto et al 1996 moreover the curve number value for sugarcane was reduced by 2 units from the calibrated value to represent the residue management practices arabi et al 2008 the scenarios s18 s19 s20 and s21 involve the introduction of sweet clover oats cowpeas and sunflower cover crops respectively and were formulated by assuming the cover crops were planted after summer sugarcane harvesting and killed a week before the next plantation finally the combination of fertilizer control and mulching scenarios which were considered to be the most effective in reducing pollutant loads were modeled together under scenarios s22 and s23 the different types of conservation practices were selected and adapted from the department of agriculture and fisheries okinawa prefecture the load reductions were considered as the efficiencies of bmps which were represented as the percentage changes from the baseline scenario efficiency 100 baseline load bmps load baseline load 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation 3 1 1 stream flow simulation table s1 in the supplementary materials lists the 17 parameters for swat model calibration of stream flow in the todoroki watershed the initial range of these parameters was set as the default values extracted from swat documents the swat cup program with the sufi 2 algorithm was applied to calibrate the model against observed hourly stream flow with several iterations of 500 simulations fig 3 graphically illustrates the observed and simulated stream flow at the gauging station the results revealed that the model successfully predicted the hourly stream flow in the study watershed by indicating good agreement between observed and simulated values for the calibration period 2011 2013 fig 3a the nse and r2 values were 0 63 and 0 71 respectively moreover the calibrated model still performed satisfactorily for validation during a period 2014 2015 with goodness of fit statistics nse 0 62 and r2 0 73 fig 3b in this study simulated groundwater head above mean sea level was also compared with the observed values at a k3 monitoring well located at the upper part of the watershed fig 3c the simulated and observed groundwater head over two years 2014 2015 also showed similar patterns with acceptable statistical criteria nse 0 48 r2 0 58 the parameters for modflow model calibration are shown in table s2 in the supplementary materials for the entire period of simulation 2011 2015 the model predicted the mean annual water balance in the study watershed the total mean annual precipitation mainly comprises the evapotranspiration et process 25 26 surface runoff 26 53 and recharge to the aquifer 48 21 fig 4 shows the seasonal patterns of rainfall surface runoff total groundwater discharge from the aquifer into the stream networks and evapotranspiration the monthly surface runoff follows the patterns of monthly rainfall with the high fractions occurring in may august september and october during the beginning of rainy season and typhoon occurrences it is interesting to observe that the highest et fractions occurred during the summer months april september when the temperature was relatively high and the lowest fractions could be observed during winter december january february however moderate et was found in autumn october november and spring february march when the temperature was relatively moderate moreover monthly groundwater discharge was negatively correlated with evapotranspiration the low groundwater discharge could be observed in summer months when et was relatively high conversely groundwater discharge was relatively high in winter months when the et was relatively low this could be explained by the fact that during summer months with high temperature large amounts of rainfall were evaporated reducing infiltration rates and further affecting groundwater discharge however in winter months low temperatures could cause low evapotranspiration allowing large amounts of rainfall to infiltrate into the watershed aquifer and inducing high groundwater discharge into the stream networks nevertheless in some months may and august the watershed always experienced flash flood events such that surface runoff was the predominant process with high fractions compared to those of evapotranspiration and groundwater discharge in the study watershed 3 1 2 water quality simulation simulation of the ssc in the todoroki watershed was calibrated for a period 2011 2013 and validated during 2014 2015 based on hourly time steps the calibration was carried out using both the swat cup program with several iterations of 500 simulations and manual calibration interactively the calibrated parameters used for sediment calibration are shown in table s3 in the supplementary materials the reasonable agreement could be observed for both calibration and validation fig 5 with hourly time steps nse 0 47 and r2 0 58 were observed during calibration while validation also indicated satisfactory statistical performance with nse 0 51 r2 0 56 for the simulations of no3 and po4 3 concentrations 42 measurements 2011 2013 and 24 measurements 2014 2015 were used for calibration and validation respectively the observed no3 and po4 3 concentrations were both found to be consistent with simulated values in the study watershed the graphical comparison for nitrate and phosphate showed that the temporal patterns and magnitude of simulated values followed those of observed values with reasonable agreement fig 6 shows a comparison of the observed and simulated no3 concentrations during the calibration 2011 2013 and validation 2014 2015 periods with nse 0 38 r2 0 61 and nse 0 42 r2 0 51 respectively the trends of no3 concentration was higher in 2012 and 2014 as compared with those in 2011 2012 and 2015 on the other hand fig 7 indicates that the swat model could also simulate the po4 3 concentration with goodness of fit statistics of nse 0 42 r2 0 52 and nse 0 29 r2 0 46 for calibration and validation respectively the parameters used for nutrients calibration are presented in table s3 in the supplementary materials 3 1 3 spatial distribution of the groundwater surface water interaction the simulated groundwater hydraulic head m at the end of the simulation 2011 2015 is shown in fig 8 a the spatial hydraulic head followed the topographical conditions in the study watershed the high heads could be observed at the upper part and low heads were found from the center part to the watershed outlet indicating that the groundwater flows from the upper part toward watershed outlet adjacent to the coastline the mean annual groundwater recharge estimated by swat is shown in fig 8b signifying that high groundwater recharge could be observed in areas of the upper part particularly forested ones however the low to moderate recharge rates were found in urban and agricultural areas with high slopes which possibly allowed large amounts of rainfall to flow overland rather than infiltrate into the aquifer fig 8c shows the mean annual nitrate leaching computed by the swat model in the study watershed the amount of annual nitrate leaching strongly depends on the annual amount of fertilizer applied to soil layers on agricultural lands in the study watershed the main sources of nitrate input are from sugarcane and pasture farmlands in which relatively high amounts of fertilizer were applied nitrate leaching from sugarcane farmland was relatively high compared to that from pasture farmland located in the southern part of the watershed this can be explained by the relatively high fertilizer input for the sugarcane farmland as compared to that for pasture farmland umezawa et al 2002 estimated the annual total nitrogen inputs from sugarcane farmland to be almost 20 times higher than nitrogen inputs from pasture farmland per hectare in the study watershed the spatial distribution of groundwater discharge into the stream network is indicated in fig 8d demonstrating that a low groundwater discharge rate could be observed at the upper part of the watershed where the stream bed elevations are considered to be slightly lower than the groundwater head elevation however the high groundwater discharge could be observed at the lower center part of the watershed in which the hydraulic gradient is strongly positive due to high groundwater head at the upper part the spatial distribution of no3 moving from the watershed aquifer into the stream networks obviously followed the spatial distribution of groundwater discharge fig 8e moreover the simulated spatial distribution of no3 is exactly consistent with observations conducted by blanco et al 2010 indicating groundwater is a major source of no3 in the river streams 3 1 4 scenario analysis for best management practices bmps the annual reduction efficiencies of sediment no3 and po4 3 loads obtained by bmp scenario analysis for the period 2011 2015 are presented by boxplots as shown in fig 9 the most efficient bmp scenario for sediment load reduction was the conversion of all sugarcane farmland to pasture s13 with the mean removal efficiency of 86 1 followed by the conversion of all summer sugarcane to spring perennial sugarcane s10 75 the mulching scenarios were also effective for reducing the sediment load with mean removal efficiencies of 62 5 and 70 5 for partially mulching s16 and fully mulching s17 respectively the other remaining land cover conversion scenarios s4 to s9 moderately reduced sediment load with the mean removal efficiencies ranging from 33 3 to 44 1 moreover the mean removal efficiencies from four cover crop scenarios s18 to s21 were found to be relatively low ranging from 17 4 to 26 1 however alternative tillage scenarios s1 and s2 and filter strip scenarios s14 and 15 were not very effective for sediment load reduction in the study watershed with the mean removal efficiencies of less than 20 the scenario s3 and s13 achieved large reduction in the amount of nitrate no3 load with the mean removal efficiencies of 53 5 and 39 respectively followed by scenarios s12 25 4 cover crop scenarios 15 2 18 8 s11 16 9 and s7 14 9 the other scenarios including alternative tillage land cover conversions without fertilizer control and filter strip were not effective in no3 load reduction on the other hand most of bmp scenarios were effective in phosphate po4 3 load reduction in the study watershed the conversion of summer sugarcane to spring perennial sugarcane s10 and s11 were the most effective for po4 3 load reduction with the mean removal efficiency of approximately 65 however other land cover conversion scenarios achieved the moderate reduction of po4 3 load varying from 13 1 to 59 8 both partially and fully mulching scenarios reduced po4 3 load by 35 4 and 41 8 respectively whereas the removal efficiencies for cover crop and alternative tillage scenarios ranged from 10 4 to 21 1 in addition the combined scenarios were very effective for reducing po4 3 load with the removal efficiencies of 50 9 and 55 6 while implementing partially s16 and fully mulching s17 together with fertilizer control s3 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 model performance the swat model either underestimated or overestimated for extreme flood events even though it successfully simulated the stream flow with acceptable limits in the study watershed moreover significant fluctuation of the hydrological conditions characterized by episodic events caused the difficulties for the stream flow calibration in the study watershed in addition it is important to note that with the hourly temporal resolution of continuous long term data too many break points of observed values were compared with those of simulated values possibly resulting in difficulties in stream flow calibration as well the fully coupled model swat modflow could successfully simulate belowground components by giving good performance when comparing the simulated and observed groundwater head in a monitoring well located in upper part of the watershed during the period 2014 2015 fig 3 the groundwater head gradually decreased from mid 2014 until early 2015 due to the absence of intensive flood events however it highly fluctuated in 2015 when plenty of moderate to high flooding events occurred confirming that groundwater in the study watershed is characterized as episodic and highly dynamic responses to rainfall events nearly half 48 1 of rainfall are recharged to the aquifer and return to stream networks as lateral flow the high amount of groundwater discharge was indicated by the setup of the high permeability of the subsurface structure which was predominated by ryukyu limestone moreover the groundwater boundary was setup as no flow or water divide following the watershed boundary bailey et al 2016 therefore the groundwater recharge into the watershed aquifer simulated by swat was not likely moving out of the watershed aquifer but discharging into stream networks instead the swat model with sub daily configuration could reasonably predict the sediment concentration in the study watershed however only a few studies have used sediment concentration instead of sediment load or yield for calibration and validation because it is difficult to have good matches between the observed and simulated values oeurng et al 2011 qiu and wang 2013 on the other hand with a new sub daily algorithm which incorporates more realistic components including splash erosion based on the kinetic energy delivered by raindrops and overland flow erosion using a physically based equation the swat model performed as well as or better than the swat with daily structure jeong et al 2011 although the sub daily algorithm is likely able to sophisticatedly predict sub daily erosion in a small watershed swat is still not able to consider the overland deposited sediment generated from previous flood events and allows all soil eroded by overland flow to reach the river directly the swat model could reasonably simulate no3 concentration for the period of validation and po4 3 concentration for the period of calibration the poor statistical indicator with nse 0 40 might be caused by many large irregular gaps between each observation due to the limited number of observed data resulting in poorly capturing the water quality fluctuation in addition the contribution from groundwater in the study site might also significantly influence in regulating the water quality in the streams however in this study the groundwater simulation was not calibrated against the water quality possibly resulting in incapability to correctly predict the water quality of groundwater seepage into the streams which eventually impacts on the water quality at the outlet of the watershed the simulated no3 concentration was generally drastically decreased during rainfall events with a gradual increase in river discharge this adverse relationship indicated the strong discharge input from surface runoff causing dilution effects other researchers also reported that the relatively low no3 concentration was always observed during intensive flood rainfall due to the dilution effect of surface runoff in an intensive agricultural watershed stutter et al 2008 and kato et al 2009 after rainfall events the no3 concentration slightly increased because the contribution from groundwater become dominant over surface runoff in controlling no3 concentration umezawa et al 2002 indicated that the no3 concentration from groundwater is higher than those from rain water and river water in the same study watershed the long term trend of simulated no3 concentration also showed seasonal variability which followed the seasonal patterns of rainfall and the schedule of fertilizer application fig 6 during the months of intensive rainfall events from august to october overlapping with the planting of summer sugarcane the no3 concentration presented high values larger than 3 mg l 1 this could be explained by the fact that with adequate rainfall a large amount of nitrate in the top soil were leached via groundwater recharge and returned to the stream networks resulting in increasing the nitrate concentration level moreover it is noted that the simulated no3 concentration trend also showed inter annual patterns due to different fractions of summer sugarcanes summer sugarcane 1 and 2 planted in the study watershed in this study summer sugarcane 1 which had a smaller fraction about 40 of the total sugarcane farmland was planted in 2011 while plantation of summer sugarcane 2 which had a higher fraction about 60 of the total sugarcane farmland began in 2012 therefore during months of intensive rainfall events the simulated trends of no3 concentration were relatively higher in 2012 and 2014 as compared with those in 2011 2013 and 2015 fig 6 in the study watershed the simulated trend of po4 3 concentration did not show any seasonal patterns however the po4 3 concentration likely followed the fluctuation of hydrological conditions blanco et al 2010 indicated that po4 3 generally exhibited elevated concentration during rainfall events particularly low to moderate rainfall 4 2 impact of bmps on sediment nitrate and phosphate loads the satisfactory performance of the model with sub daily configuration suggested that the model can be applied to assess the impacts of bmps in the study watershed the alternative tillage scenarios s1 and s2 were slightly effective for reducing sediment and po4 3 loads and did not have any significant impact upon the soluble nitrate no3 load this can be explained by the fact that undisturbed soil by reduced and conservation tillage can reduce splash erosion by rainfall hence the decreasing in sediment load the reduction of the soil disturbance could leave more soluble nutrients on top soil which can be further easily transported by overland flow her et al 2017 the successful implementation of alternative tillage scenarios for the increase of the sediment nitrogen and phosphorus losses within watershed scale studies has been reported previously chung et al 2002 ulén et al 2010 francesconi et al 2014 motsinger et al 2016 taylor et al 2016 however in other study sites the alternative tillage scenarios including no tillage and conservation tillage did not significantly reduce the total nitrogen and phosphorus loads lam et al 2011 bosch et al 2013 taylor et al 2016 her et al 2017 therefore it is obvious that the effectiveness of those scenarios depends upon the watershed characteristics and hydrological conditions the conversion of summer sugarcane to either spring or spring perennial sugarcane farmland scenarios s4 to s11 were effective in reduction of sediment and po4 3 loads but did not show any significant influence on no3 load except for the ones with fertilizer control s7 and s11 based on the plantation schedule of sugarcane table 2 the conversion of summer sugarcane to either spring or spring perennial sugarcane reduced the bare soil cover after summer sugarcane harvesting for approximately 5 months march to july resulting in the decrease of sediment load in the study watershed moreover the conversion from summer to spring perennial sugarcane scenarios s8 to s11 eliminated the tillage activities which were the main factor controlling of the soil erosion in addition po4 3 load were also significantly reduced by 13 1 to 66 5 for scenarios s4 to s11 whereas there were not notable changes of no3 load from the baseline scenario this can be explained by a large amount of fertilizer application for both spring and spring perennial sugarcane as compared with that of summer sugarcane based on the cultivation management the same amount of fertilizer was applied two times per year for summer sugarcane while three times per year for either spring or spring perennial sugarcane table 2 even though changing the types of sugarcane may notably influence the sediment no3 and po4 3 loads it may also economically impact the local farmers living in the study watershed both directly and indirectly by changing the crop yield verma 2002 confirmed that perennial crops produce relatively low crop yields as compared with main crops due to soil conditions such as compaction and low fertility moreover unlike summer sugarcane planted in august both spring and perennial sugarcane which are planted in spring march may be severely damaged by typhoons occurring in august to september resulting in the decrease of crop yields based on the interviews with livestock farmers the number of cattle has been increased due to the high demand of fattening calves from local people and for exporting to other areas in japan this condition might cause a possible shift from sugarcane to pasture farmland in this study the conversion of summer sugarcane to pasture farmland scenarios s12 and s13 largely reduced sediment no3 and po4 3 loads by 61 and 86 1 25 4 and 53 5 and 37 7 and 51 5 respectively this is obvious that the rapid growth of pasture without any tillage activities significantly minimizes the severe soil erosion however the amount of fertilizer application for pasture was relatively small as compared with that for sugarcane resulting in low nutrients exported from the study watershed implementation of the filter strip scenarios s14 and s15 increased the sediment losses 7 5 and 18 9 and phosphate losses 27 6 and 38 2 but did not significantly affect the nitrate losses 0 9 and 2 4 respectively this finding is consistent with other previous studies which reported that implementation of filter strip scenario does not achieve a significant reduction in nitrogen load particularly in soluble form taylor et al 2016 jang et al 2017 and her et al 2017 however the effectiveness of filter strip depends upon the local conditions such as slope the size of the filter strips and the scope of the areas where they are implemented the mulching scenario is commonly and effectively applied for reducing the sediment and associated particulate nutrients by minimizing splash and overland flow erosion in mulching scenarios s16 and s17 the crop cover and management factors were introduced together with the reduction in the runoff to realistically represent mulching according to the finding of this investigation the mulching scenario in this study achieved a relatively high amount of reduction in pollution loads as compared with other previous relevant studies in which mulching was modeled by only introducing the runoff reduction the sediment and po4 3 loads were significantly reduced by 62 5 and 70 5 and 35 4 and 41 8 while the no3 load was slightly decreased by only 0 9 and 1 1 for partially and fully mulching respectively the fact that little reduction occurred in the no3 load can be explained that the surface runoff reduction caused increasing infiltration capacity thereby no3 was quickly leached from the top soil to the aquifer and further transported by groundwater flow into the streams the cover crops were very effective at reducing the sediment no3 and po4 3 loads in the study watershed the scenarios s18 to s21 archived the reduction of sediment no3 and po4 3 loads ranging from 17 4 to 26 1 15 2 to 18 8 and 14 2 to 21 1 respectively the planting of a cover crop provided a leaf canopy to protect against soil erosion by reducing the rainfall detachment force moreover during the growing stage the cover crop can increase the uptake of the remaining nutrients in the soil from previous main crops the assessment of combined scenarios is to figure out the most effective mitigation option for reducing all pollutant loads in this study the fertilizer control scenario s3 which was a very effective scenario for soluble nutrient reduction was combined with mulching scenarios s16 and s17 which achieved large reduction of sediment the scenarios s22 and s23 could reduce sediment no3 and po4 3 loads by 62 5 40 1 and 50 9 and 70 5 40 4 and 55 6 respectively the effectiveness of the multiple combined scenarios is almost equal to the sum of their individual effectiveness in reducing of sediment no3 and po4 3 loads this finding is consistent with other studies through a wide range of watershed scales and conditions bosch et al 2013 taylor et al 2016 jang et al 2017 4 3 impact of bmps on sediment nitrate and phosphate concentrations although some bmps were very effective at reduction of sediment no3 and po4 3 loads it is needed to assess their effectiveness to achieve the statutory target for water quality status within the study watershed the percent exceedance curve which indicates the percentage of time that sediment no3 and po4 3 concentrations are exceeded a particular level were developed on hourly basis during the whole simulation period 2011 2015 for each bmp scenario fig 10 in this study only sediment concentration has the reference of reduction target in which the sediment concentration is higher than 200 mg l 1 is considered to be harmful to downstream coral reef ecosystem okinawa prefectural government ordinance in 1995 however there is no such reference for nutrient reduction so percent exceedance curve for no3 and po4 3 can be used to assess which bmp is potential in reducing the concentration level in the study watershed fig 10a indicates the percent exceedance curve for sediment concentration under scenarios s0 s1 s2 s4 s6 s8 s10 s12 s13 s14 s15 s16 s17 and s20 except for fertilizer control scenario s3 and the scenarios combined with fertilizer control under baseline scenario s0 the sediment concentration exceeded the reduction target 200 mg l 1 with approximately 0 93 of the time which was reduced to 0 054 while implementing scenario s13 conversion of all summer sugarcane to pasture moreover the conversion of summer sugarcane to spring perennial sugarcane scenarios s8 and s10 were also significantly effective for sediment reduction with the percent of time exceeded of 0 21 and 0 13 respectively the mulching scenarios s16 and s17 significantly achieved the reduction of time exceeded percentage by 0 44 and 0 26 as compared to the baseline scenario s0 the conversion of summer sugarcane to spring sugarcane s4 and s6 slightly reduced the amount of time that the sediment concentration exceeded 200 mg l 1 by 0 77 and 0 69 respectively however the alternative tillage s1 and s2 filter strip s14 and s15 and cover crop scenarios s18 s21 had very limited effect on the percent exceedance curve 0 88 and 0 87 0 83 and 0 81 and 0 78 0 86 respectively fig 10b shows the percent of time exceeded for hourly nitrate no3 concentration during the whole simulation period the fertilizer control s3 and mulching with fertilizer control s22 and s23 scenarios were found to be the most effective in minimizing the no3 concentration level followed by the conversion of summer sugarcane to pasture s12 and s13 and cover crop scenarios s18 s21 the conversion of all summer sugarcane to either spring s6 and s7 or spring perennial sugarcane scenarios s10 and s11 induced significantly elevated no3 concentration as compared with baseline scenario s0 although they were found to have slightly influence on no3 load this can be explained by the reduction in runoff which caused the decreasing in load but the increasing in concentration in addition the remaining scenarios s1 s2 s4 s5 s8 s9 and s14 s17 had very limited influence on no3 concentration level in the study watershed the percent exceedance curve of po4 3 concentration is illustrated in fig 10c the most effective scenarios for minimizing of po4 3 concentration level were conversion of summer sugarcane 2 to spring perennial sugarcane without and with fertilizer control scenarios s8 and s9 followed by conversion of all summer sugarcane to spring perennial sugarcane s10 and s11 combined mulching with fertilizer control s22 and s23 mulching s16 and s17 conversion of summer sugarcane to pasture farmland s12 and s13 filter strip s14 and s15 conversion summer sugarcane 2 to spring sugarcane s4 and s5 cover crop s18 s21 fertilizer control s3 and alternative tillage scenarios s1 and s2 however conversion of all summer sugarcane to spring sugarcane s6 and s7 were not effective but slightly increased the po4 3 concentration level in the study watershed due to the larger amount of fertilizer application under s6 and s7 as compared with that under baseline scenario s0 5 conclusions this study investigated the applicability of a coupled swat modflow model to simulate hydrology and water quality and to evaluate the bmps in a small agricultural watershed in a subtropical island the model effectively predicted continuous long term and high resolution stream flow and water quality with acceptable statistical criteria even though there were some discrepancies between the simulated and observed values during calibration and validation the coupling model also effectively simulated the groundwater head in the study watershed with good statistical criteria this study also confirms that groundwater in the study watershed is characterized as episodic and highly dynamic responses to rainfall events and nearly half 48 1 of rainfall are recharged to the aquifer and return to stream networks as lateral flow the satisfactory model was further applied to evaluate the effectiveness of bmp scenarios in reducing sediment no3 and po4 3 loads in this study varieties of bmps were introduced by realistically modifying parameters relevant to the mechanism of each bmp in the swat model moreover this is the first study to quantify the impacts of bmps on the long term and high resolution water quality for sediment and nutrients from the model results the land cover conversion scenario performed very well at reducing sediment load with the efficiency ranging from 18 8 to 86 1 the mulching scenario also significantly achieved the reduction of sediment load by 62 5 and 70 5 for partially and fully mulching respectively the cover crop alternative tillage and filter strip scenarios moderately reduced the sediment load with the efficiencies varying from 7 5 to 26 1 however these scenarios could be given to the reduction in agricultural productivity as a result of changing the planting method moreover the farmers need to expense for installation and maintenance of the bmps the conversion of all summer sugarcane to pasture and fertilizer control scenarios gave the superior reduction in nitrate no3 load by 53 5 and 39 0 respectively while the efficiencies of other remaining scenarios were found to be less than 20 the increase of pasture farmland however is resulted from an increase in the number of cattle which may possibly trigger the point source pollutions leading to the increase of not only nutrients but also bacteria if there is not a proper management of the cattle moreover a decrease of fertilizer may also result in loss of crop yield most of the scenarios achieved the significant reduction of phosphate po4 3 load the conversion of summer sugarcane to spring perennial sugarcane and pasture scenarios were the most effective in po4 3 load reduction with efficiencies 37 7 66 1 and followed by mulching scenarios 35 4 41 8 the results further suggested that the bmps recommended in the study are appropriately combined scenarios which achieved a significant reduction in all nps loads the pollutant loads sediment no3 and po4 3 were reduced by 62 5 40 1 and 50 9 and 70 5 40 4 and 55 6 respectively while implementing partially and fully mulching together with fertilizer control however the fertilizer control should be studied in detail by not only decreasing amount of fertilizer but also the splitting of fertilizer with appropriate amount and timing and their effects on crop yield even though the effective bmps were revealed in this study to make actual implementation happen it is strongly depending on the farmers whether they are willing to accept all the consequences such as the loss of crop yield and the expenses for bmp installation therefore the local government should promote those effective bmps and encourage local farmers to implement those bmps by assuring that the installation and maintenance of bmps can be subsidized or the loss of crop yield can be financially compensated acknowledgements this research was financially supported by the environment research and

11211,improving irrigation efficiency is widely believed to be a promising opportunity for large water savings however more and more voices have been raised against this idea in recent years this study investigated the impacts of irrigation efficiency improvement on water use and consumption by combining an agro economic model with the conceptualization of hydrological pathways the investigation was conducted under two different conditions i e case 1 unlimited water supply and restricted irrigatable land and case 2 limited water supply and unrestricted irrigatable land at the scale of the wuu we found that the water uses could be reduced significantly after improving irrigation efficiency while the water consumptions would be of similar magnitudes for different irrigation techniques under the condition of case 1 however in the condition of case 2 the water uses would be inelastic to the enhanced irrigation efficiency and the water consumption would increase slightly if the fixed cost ratio is high at the scale of the irrigation system the reductions in water use as a result of efficiency improvement would be more and more insignificant in response to increasing water cost ratios and numbers of wuus under the condition of case 1 in contrast the water uses would increase although with small magnitudes when the fixed cost ratios and the number of reuse cycles are relatively high under the condition of case 2 this study demonstrated that alternative restrictions on water supply and irrigatable land could effectively constrain water use and consumption after modernizing the irrigation systems the sensitivity of the major assumptions and the uncertainties and limitations have been revealed and discussed along with some implications for agricultural water managements the findings can shed some light on the lively debate regarding the effectiveness of technological water saving measures keywords irrigation efficiency water use water consumption efficiency paradox agro economic model hydrological pathways 1 introduction there are growing interests on how to use natural resources more efficiently in a resource scarce world lankford 2014 efficient use of fresh water resources is given particular attention by the policy makers owing to the burgeoning demands and the increasing variabilities induced by climate change gómez and pérez blanco 2014 liu et al 2018 the improvement of irrigation efficiency is widely believed to be a promising opportunity for large water savings because irrigation agriculture accounts for a large proportion 60 of the global water withdrawal knox et al 2012 contor and taylor 2013 while the on farm irrigation efficiency is below 50 worldwide brown 2006 however more and more voices are being raised against this idea and argued that the efficient techniques may stimulate crop intensification and land expansion resulting in an overall increase rather than a reduction in the total water use batchelor et al 2014 scott et al 2014 perry 2017 the theory behind the phenomenon of the positive association between efficiency and water use is the so called jevons paradox also known as the rebound effect which suggests that the efficiency improvement may actually worsen rather than alleviate the resource prospects alcott 2005 york and mcgee 2016 although the concept of rebound effect comes from basic economic principles and was originally analyzed in relation to coal consumption polimeni et al 2015 it has been extended to water resources dumont et al 2013 and raised a lively debate regarding the effectiveness of technological water saving measures nonetheless unlike coal the used water should not be deemed as a complete loss and can be partitioned into the beneficial consumed non beneficial consumed non recoverable non consumed and recoverable non consumed fractions batchelor 2014 the first three fractions get out of the irrigation system and are no longer available for reuses and the reduction in them refers to the real or wet water savings seckler 1996 the last proportion however returns to the water resource system and can be reused downstream and the reduction in them refers to paper or dry water savings seckler 1996 in view of this it is important to distinguish between water use and consumption when exploring the impacts of efficiency improvement berbel et al 2018 moreover unlike coal water is more expensive to transport and thus could generally have limitations within a catchment that may restrict its supply additionally the use of coal for producing energy is typically not restricted whereas for water its use could be constrained by the irrigatable land it is therefore essential to investigate the impacts of efficiency improvement on water use and consumption under alternative restrictions on water supply and land availability which however receives little attention in the literature the influences of irrigation efficiency improvement on water use and consumption have increasingly been explored in recent years e g contor and taylor 2013 pfeiffer and lin 2014 huang et al 2017 sese minguez et al 2017 berbel et al 2018 nevertheless the findings vary from case to case and sometimes are even contradictory to each other a significant number of studies concluded that water can be saved when the irrigation method shifts from traditional surface irrigation systems to more efficient ones such as sprinkler and drip e g soto garcía et al 2013 graveline et al 2014 sanchis ibor et al 2015 huang et al 2017 however there are some other studies which have reported increases in water use in response to improved irrigation techniques e g ward and pulido velazquez 2008 pfeiffer and lin 2014 song et al 2018 this appears to be intuitively confirmed by the significant increase in global total irrigation water during the recent decades despite that many countries around the world such as the united states spain and china have been strongly promoting the use of efficient irrigation technologies huang et al 2018 additionally some other researchers such as peterson and ding 2005 huffaker 2008 and gómez and pérez blanco 2014 gave ambiguous results arguing that the improved irrigation efficiency may either increase or decrease water use the inconsistent findings may be due to that i the water use and consumption are not distinguished ii the scales upon which the analyses are based are different iii the assumptions behind the method are different or due to some other factors such as the differences in the previous situation basin or aquifer characteristics berbel et al 2015 in this context more investigations are therefore needed to reveal the impacts of irrigation efficiency improvement the relationship between irrigation efficiency improvement and water use and consumption is a complicated issue which involves many aspects such as economy agronomy hydrology and institution currently the empirical and theoretical approaches are typically used to investigate the problem berbel et al 2015 huang et al 2017 with observational data the empirical methods such as the direct comparison approach and the econometric analysis could provide powerful evidence regarding the effects of irrigation technology improvements on water uses pfeiffer and lin 2014 sanchis ibor et al 2017 huang et al 2018 nonetheless it can hardly decipher the mechanism behind the impacts hence various theoretical approaches such as analytical models and mathematical programming and simulation have been applied to analyze the changes of water use and consumption in response to increased irrigation efficiency scheierling et al 2006 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 and qureshi et al 2010 studied the effects of a series of water conservation subsidy policies and the associated increase in irrigation efficiency on hydrologic and agronomic factors such as return flow water use and consumption by using the mathematical programming approach huffaker 2008 formulated an economic model and examined the conditions under which water can be saved when there is a public subsidy on investing in improved on farm irrigation efficiency gómez and pérez blanco 2014 distinguished the determinants of the emergence of the irrigation paradox by using an analytical framework the previous theoretical studies could significantly improve our understandings of the impacts of irrigation efficiency improvement and have great implications for water resource managements nevertheless few of them have taken deficit irrigation into account in their analyses and erroneously assumed a constant irrigation efficiency depending on the irrigation system deficit irrigation which is a promising management strategy for improving water productivity bell et al 2018 gonzalez dugo et al 2018 can have a profound impact on the actual irrigation efficiency even under the same irrigation system more importantly to our best knowledge few of the previous studies have systematically explored the impacts of irrigation efficiency improvement on water use and consumption respectively under alternative restrictions on water supply and irrigatable land recently berbel and mateos 2014 and berbel et al 2018 developed an agro economic model that analytically integrates the variable irrigation efficiency resulting from deficit irrigation and application uniformity and studied the effects of irrigation efficiency improvement on water use and consumption under the condition of unlimited water supply and restricted irrigatable land nevertheless they didn t explore the situation under the condition of limited water supply and unrestricted irrigatable land which might be the case in reality particularly in the arid and semi arid regions further the analyses were mainly performed at the scale of the field plot from the micro economic perspective the reuses of the irrigation return flows were not taken into account over larger scales despite its potentially substantial volumes simons et al 2015 in this study we extended the works of berbel and mateos 2014 and berbel et al 2018 to further investigate the impacts of irrigation efficiency on water use and consumption by combining an agro economic model with the conceptualization of hydrological pathways the analyses were performed at the scales of the water use unit wuu and the irrigation system respectively under two different conditions i e case 1 unlimited water supply and restricted irrigatable land and case 2 limited water supply and unrestricted irrigatable land the remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows section 2 and 3 introduce the agro economic model and the conceptualization of hydrological pathways section 4 presents the analyses regarding the effects of irrigation efficiency improvement on water use and consumption under the conditions of case 1 and case 2 finally some discussion and conclusions are given in section 5 and 6 respectively 2 agro economical model the agro economic model developed by berbel and mateos 2014 was used in this study to examine the microeconomic foundations of the influences of irrigation efficiency improvement the model was selected for its simplicity and more importantly the integration of the variable irrigation efficiency resulting from deficit irrigation and application uniformity into the crop production function besides the theoretical solution to the model have been derived for the situations of alternative restrictions on water supply and irrigatable land which makes it convenient for analyzing the impacts of efficiency improvement on water use and consumption the response of crop yield to applied water and irrigation efficiency is

referring to the studies of mateos 2008 simons et al 2015 and mateos and araus 2016 as shown in fig 1 a cascading of water use units wuus are arranged in parallel with a single and primary line water source e g a river or a canal which constitutes the irrigation system the available irrigation water in a wuu comes from the upstream wuu or the line source the water uses in a wuu are divided into non consumed and consumed fractions the former of which is further divided into three proportions i e the reusable return flows to the line water source ρ 1 and to the wuu downstream ρ 2 and the non reusable one 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 4 impacts of irrigation efficiency improvement on water use and consumption the study considered three typical irrigation techniques furrow sprinkler and drip whose standard efficiencies were set as 0 60 0 80 and 0 95 respectively by referring to the work of berbel et al 2018 the agro economic model was first applied to the wuu to investigate the impacts of irrigation efficacy improvement from the micro economic perspective the results were then aggregated for the irrigation systems with different numbers of wuus to further explore the impacts by taking the hydrological pathways into account the analyses were performed under two different conditions i e case 1 unlimited water supply and restricted irrigatable land and case 2 limited water supply and unrestricted irrigatable land in line with the assumptions of the argo economic model we hypothesized that i only one single crop exists in the wuu ii farmers in the wuu are homogeneous price takers and exhibit profit maximizing behaviors and iii crop yield is mainly affected by irrigation with the remaining inputs assumed to be fixed for simplicity the heterogeneity of the wuus was not considered leading to the same irrigation efficiency of each wuu eu which is equal to e as in eq 2 we additionally assumed that the applied water in a wuu results from adding water first from the reusable non consumed water of the upstream unit and then from the line source till obtaining an amount of water wu with these assumptions the water use ws and the relative water use ws of the irrigation system could be estimated using eqs 6 and 7 respectively mateos 2008 with regard to water consumption of the irrigation system it would be same with the wuu according to our hydrological conceptualization 6 w s w u n n 1 1 e u ρ 1 ρ 2 7 w s w s n w m n n 1 1 e u ρ 1 ρ 2 n w u where n is the number of wuus both ρ 1 and ρ 2 were set as 0 5 assuming all the non consumed water is reusable 4 1 case 1 unlimited water supply and restricted irrigatable land as mentioned before berbel et al 2018 have recently investigated the influences of irrigation efficiency improvement on water use and consumption under the condition of case 1 as shown in fig 2 the efficient irrigation technology would reduce water use significantly in the wuu when the water price is relatively low the farmer would not likely adopt deficit irrigation when confronted with low water price leading to obviously higher water uses under furrow irrigation compared with the other two methods the water consumptions i e the irrigation water consumed by crops are of the similar magnitudes for different irrigation methods because of the consistently full irrigation confronted with high water price however the farmer would be willing to adopt deficit irrigation to reduce water cost under inefficient irrigation systems hence the potential reductions in water use become smaller when the water price gets higher meanwhile the water consumption under drip irrigation is slightly greater than the other two irrigation methods due the higher actual irrigation efficiency fig 3 a plots the relationship between relative water use and water cost ratio under furrow irrigation for the irrigation system with different numbers of wuus the water use shows an apparent downward trend in response to growing water cost ratios however the trend gradually becomes insignificant with increasing numbers of water reuse cycles the results indicate the water price policy would play a slight role in curtailing water use at the scale of the irrigation system upon which water reuse is significant fig 3b shows the changes in relative water use when the irrigation technique switches from furrow to drip it is seen that the decreases in water use become more and more insignificant in response to increasing water cost ratios and numbers of wuus thus the shift from furrow to drip irrigation may have little potentials for reducing water use at the scale of the irrigation system providing the water cost ratio or the number of water reuse cycles is high under the condition of case 1 4 2 case 2 limited water supply and unrestricted irrigatable land the irrigated area lu in the wuu could be estimated using eq 8 under the condition of case 2 8 l u v w o p t where wopt is the optimum water use per unit of land and v is the water supply for the wuu as shown in fig 4 a the irrigated area is largest under furrow irrigation followed by sprinkler and drip when the fixed cost ratio is small the differences of the irrigated area are becoming small with increasing fixed cost ratios the area of land under drip irrigation tends to be larger than the other two methods when the fixed cost ratio approaches to great values the irrigation efficiency improvement therefore may either increase or decrease the irrigated area depending on the fixed cost ratio under the condition of case 2 the critical point carea could be derived as in eq 9 by taking the derivative of the optimum water use level i e eq 5 with respect to the fixed cost ratio and setting the result to zero the efficient irrigation technique would lead to smaller irrigated areas when the fixed cost ratio is lower than carea and would conversely induce larger irrigated areas when the fixed cost ratio is greater than carea 9 c a r e a 1 k y 2 1 r fig 4b presents the changes of water consumption in response to increasing fixed cost ratios in the wuu the water consumptions are almost of the same magnitudes under different irrigation techniques when the fix cost ratio is small this is because that when confronted with small fix costs the farmer would adopt deficit irrigation by increasing the area of land so as to obtain high revenue per unit of water all the available water would be consumed efficiently regardless of which irrigation technique is implemented however when faced with high fix costs the farmer would decrease the area of land to reduce the costs resulting in decreasing actual irrigation efficiency as shown in fig 5 the furrow irrigation has the highest decrement of the efficiency followed by sprinkler and drip hence the water consumption exhibits an increasing trend after modernizing the irrigation technologies when the fix cost ratio is high actually this is one of the important mechanisms that generates irrigation efficiency paradox if the deficit irrigation is not considered the farmer will likely expand the irrigatable land by using the water saved by more efficient irrigation techniques this would indeed be the case in reality considering that deficit irrigation is difficult to implement and meanwhile may bring high risks to farmers fig 6 a presents the relationship between water use and fixed cost ratio under furrow irrigation for the irrigation system the water use is inelastic to the increase in fixed cost ratio when the number water reuse cycles is relatively small however it shows a slight decreasing trend with increasing fixed cost ratios in the irrigation system with large numbers of water reuse cycles the water uses of the irrigation system increase proportionally to the number of wuus when the fixed cost ratio is small this is because as shown in fig 5 the actual irrigation efficiency is high under furrow irrigation in the wuu due to the adoption of deficit irrigation leading to small proportions of return flows fig 6b depicts the changes in water use in the irrigation system when the irrigation methods shifts from furrow to drip the more efficient technique tends to bring about more water uses when the fixed cost ratio and the number of reuse cycles are relatively high this is because as shown in fig 5 the actual irrigation efficiency of drip is greater than furrow providing the fixed cost ratio is high the drip irrigation would therefore produce less reusable return flows leading to the increase in the total water uses of the irrigation system in comparison with the furrow irrigation nonetheless the magnitudes of the increments are relatively small the largest of which would be less than 10 of the total water use 5 discussion 5 1 sensitivity of the major assumptions the standard efficiencies of the three typical irrigation methods i e furrow sprinkler and drip were presumed to be 0 6 0 80 and 0 95 respectively we further explored the sensitivity of the assumption by comparing the ranges of relative water use and consumption under furrow sprinkler and drip irrigation whose standard efficiencies span 0 50 0 60 0 70 0 80 and 0 85 0 95 respectively as plotted in fig 7 the water use exhibits a decreasing trend as the irrigation method shifts from furrow to sprinkler and drip in the wuu under the condition of case 1 although with varying magnitudes depending on the preset standard efficiencies the decreasing trend turns to be insignificant when the water cost ratio increases from 0 to 0 25 with regard to water consumption it shows slight divergences between different irrigation techniques these results are in consistent with our previous findings in the section of 4 1 which proves low sensitivity of the assumption regarding the standard efficiencies of the typical irrigation techniques furthermore the sum of the water reuse parameters i e ρ 1 and ρ 2 was assumed to be one in this research considering that it is difficult to determine the proportion of reusable non consumed water which largely depends on basin or aquifer characteristics this implicitly hypothesized that all the non consumed water is reusable for the downstream wuus therefore we additionally conducted the sensitivity analysis of the assumption by changing the values of ρ 1 and ρ 2 while holding the other parameters constant the sum of ρ 1 and ρ 2 was presumed to increase from 0 2 to 1 0 signifying smaller to larger proportions of reusable return flows the results are shown in fig 8 the water use of the irrigation system decreases significantly in response to increasing numbers of wuus under furrow irrigation when the proportion of reusable return flow is high e g ρ 1 ρ 2 1 0 while it only shows slight changes when the proportion is low e g ρ 1 ρ 2 0 2 as presented in fig 8b the water use reduces significantly when the irrigation method shifts from furrow to drip and has a decreasing magnitude in response to increasing numbers of wuus moreover the magnitudes of the reductions become smaller in response to increasing proportions of reusable return flow the results imply that the water use of the irrigation system depends greatly on the water reuse parameters implying a high sensitivity of the assumption regarding the proportions of reusable return flows nevertheless the assumption of a large proportion of reusable return flow seems meaningful in this study considering that a lower value could lead to similar responses of the water uses for the wuu and the irrigation system besides the degree of return flow reuse is actually co determined by the numbers of wuus and the proportion of reusable return flow the results for the condition of lower proportions of reusable return flows could be easily deduced from the situations of small numbers of wuus 5 2 implications for agricultural water management in this research the relationships between irrigation efficiency improvement and water use and consumption were analyzed under two different conditions i e case 1 unlimited water supply and restricted irrigatable land and case 2 limited water supply and unrestricted irrigatable land as stated by berbel and mateos 2014 the condition of case 1 might occur under the circumstances that there is i a physical constraint on more lands to be irrigated ii a legal prohibition against the expansion of irrigated land and iii a financial limitation on the farmer s ability to increase farm size meanwhile the condition of case 2 might occur as well particularly in the arid or semi arid regions where irrigatable land seems to be more adequate than water supply in both conditions we found that the water use and consumption would not likely increase significantly after improving irrigation efficiency this implies that alternative restrictions on water supply and irrigatable land could effectively constrain water use and consumption which may prevent from the occurrence of efficiency paradox after modernizing the irrigation systems this is confirmed by the previous studies such as berbel et al 2015 li and zhao 2016 and sanchis ibor et al 2017 the water use could be reduced significantly at the scale of the wuu by improving irrigation efficiency under the condition of case 1 however the reduction becomes insignificant when the hydrological pathways are taken into account due to the reuses of the return flow in the irrigation system this is often overlooked by water resource managers who expect to provide additional water supply for new uses through improving the on farm irrigation efficiency frederiksen and allen 2011 in the condition of case 2 the water use would not change at the scale of the wuu while it would increase although with small magnitudes for the irrigation system with a high degree of return flow reuses after modernizing the irrigation systems the results indicate that in both cases the expectations of large water savings through improving the irrigation techniques would not likely be achieved at the scale of the irrigation system upon which the degree of return flow reuses is high the agro economic model used in this study has one distinct feature that distinguishes it from others it integrates the variation of irrigation efficiency resulting from deficit irrigation and application uniformity into the modeling framework if the deficit irrigation is not taken into account the water use will decrease significantly and the water consumption will almost be the same for different irrigation methods at the scale of the wuu under the condition of case 1 moreover the water consumption is likely to increase after using more efficient irrigation techniques under the condition of case 2 considering that the saved water could be used to expand the irrigatable land the results can be very different from the situations which have taken the adoption of deficit irrigation into account hence the relationships between irrigation efficiency improvement and water use and consumption can be greatly affected by whether or not the deficit irrigation is implemented this needs to be considered by water resource managers for developing more effective strategies to conserve water resources 5 3 uncertainties and limitations in the agro economical model all the consumed water was implicitly assumed to be beneficial which might bring some uncertainties to the results the water consumption includes both beneficial and nonbeneficial components the latter of which might be of sizeable magnitude batchelor et al 2014 it may decrease if a large amount of non beneficial consumed water e g soil evaporation could be reduced substantially by more efficient techniques at the same time it may increase if the beneficial consumption could be enhanced significantly which can be embodied by the increase of crop yields the assumption thus may lead the findings of the study to be pessimistic or optimistic currently however it is difficult to determine how the proportions between beneficial and non beneficial water consumption could be influenced by more efficient irrigation techniques which depends on several factors such as soil texture crop canopy and the density of the drippers molle and tanouti 2017 in addition the beneficial and non beneficial consumptions themselves remain poorly measured gleick et al 2009 and the definitions of beneficial and non beneficial consumption are also controversial karimi et al 2013 the agro economical model only considers one single crop without considering the possible planting structure conversions induced by irrigation efficiency improvement the farmer may transform the crop structure from a lower water consuming one into a higher one in response to enhanced irrigation efficiency the potential reductions in water use may be overestimated by assuming one constant and single crop the multiple crops therefore need to be integrated into the agro economical model to more deeply unveil the impacts of irrigation efficiency improvement on water use and consumption the farmer would use all the available water for irrigation under the condition of case 2 consequently the demand for water would be independent of water price and irrigation methods however it shows an obviously upward trend in response to decreased water price under the condition of case 1 meanwhile the demand for water becomes less elastic with more efficient irrigation systems as shown in fig 2a in this study we assumed a constant water price regardless of which irrigation method is adopted which might produce biased results the water price cost may increase due to the fact that the more efficient irrigation technologies such as drip and sprinkler typically require more energy and could have higher operation and maintenance costs on the other hand it may decrease as well if there is a water conservation subsidy from government considering the own price elasticity of demand davidson and hellegers 2011 the potential reductions in water use may be underestimated if the water price exhibits an increasing trend and vice versa after modernizing the irrigation system at the scale of the wuu under the condition of case 1 6 conclusions in this study we analyzed the influences of irrigation efficiency improvement on water use and consumption by combining an agro economic model with the conceptualization of hydrological pathways the analyses were carried out at the scales of the water use unit wuu and the irrigation system under two different conditions i e case 1 unlimited water supply and restricted irrigatable land and case 2 limited water supply and unrestricted irrigatable land the water use would reduce significantly after improving irrigation efficiency in the wuu albeit with decreasing magnitudes as the water price increases under the condition of case 1 meanwhile the water consumptions would be of similar magnitudes for different irrigation techniques however the water use would not change in response to improved irrigation technology and the water consumption would increase slightly if the fixed cost ratio is high in the wuu under the condition of case 2 the water use of the irrigation system would decrease with shrinking magnitudes in response to increasing water cost ratios and numbers of wuus under the condition of case 1 in contrast it would increase although with small magnitudes when the fixed cost ratios and the number of reuse cycles are relatively high under the condition of case 2 the study demonstrated that alternative restrictions on water supply and irrigatable land could effectively constrain water use and consumption which may prevent from the occurrence of efficiency paradox after modernizing the irrigation systems moreover the water use seems unlikely to decrease considerably at the scale of the irrigation system upon which the degree of return flow reuses is high in addition the adoption of deficit irrigation needs to be considered by water resource managers for developing more effective strategies to conserve water resources acknowledgements this study was financially supported by

11211,improving irrigation efficiency is widely believed to be a promising opportunity for large water savings however more and more voices have been raised against this idea in recent years this study investigated the impacts of irrigation efficiency improvement on water use and consumption by combining an agro economic model with the conceptualization of hydrological pathways the investigation was conducted under two different conditions i e case 1 unlimited water supply and restricted irrigatable land and case 2 limited water supply and unrestricted irrigatable land at the scale of the wuu we found that the water uses could be reduced significantly after improving irrigation efficiency while the water consumptions would be of similar magnitudes for different irrigation techniques under the condition of case 1 however in the condition of case 2 the water uses would be inelastic to the enhanced irrigation efficiency and the water consumption would increase slightly if the fixed cost ratio is high at the scale of the irrigation system the reductions in water use as a result of efficiency improvement would be more and more insignificant in response to increasing water cost ratios and numbers of wuus under the condition of case 1 in contrast the water uses would increase although with small magnitudes when the fixed cost ratios and the number of reuse cycles are relatively high under the condition of case 2 this study demonstrated that alternative restrictions on water supply and irrigatable land could effectively constrain water use and consumption after modernizing the irrigation systems the sensitivity of the major assumptions and the uncertainties and limitations have been revealed and discussed along with some implications for agricultural water managements the findings can shed some light on the lively debate regarding the effectiveness of technological water saving measures keywords irrigation efficiency water use water consumption efficiency paradox agro economic model hydrological pathways 1 introduction there are growing interests on how to use natural resources more efficiently in a resource scarce world lankford 2014 efficient use of fresh water resources is given particular attention by the policy makers owing to the burgeoning demands and the increasing variabilities induced by climate change gómez and pérez blanco 2014 liu et al 2018 the improvement of irrigation efficiency is widely believed to be a promising opportunity for large water savings because irrigation agriculture accounts for a large proportion 60 of the global water withdrawal knox et al 2012 contor and taylor 2013 while the on farm irrigation efficiency is below 50 worldwide brown 2006 however more and more voices are being raised against this idea and argued that the efficient techniques may stimulate crop intensification and land expansion resulting in an overall increase rather than a reduction in the total water use batchelor et al 2014 scott et al 2014 perry 2017 the theory behind the phenomenon of the positive association between efficiency and water use is the so called jevons paradox also known as the rebound effect which suggests that the efficiency improvement may actually worsen rather than alleviate the resource prospects alcott 2005 york and mcgee 2016 although the concept of rebound effect comes from basic economic principles and was originally analyzed in relation to coal consumption polimeni et al 2015 it has been extended to water resources dumont et al 2013 and raised a lively debate regarding the effectiveness of technological water saving measures nonetheless unlike coal the used water should not be deemed as a complete loss and can be partitioned into the beneficial consumed non beneficial consumed non recoverable non consumed and recoverable non consumed fractions batchelor 2014 the first three fractions get out of the irrigation system and are no longer available for reuses and the reduction in them refers to the real or wet water savings seckler 1996 the last proportion however returns to the water resource system and can be reused downstream and the reduction in them refers to paper or dry water savings seckler 1996 in view of this it is important to distinguish between water use and consumption when exploring the impacts of efficiency improvement berbel et al 2018 moreover unlike coal water is more expensive to transport and thus could generally have limitations within a catchment that may restrict its supply additionally the use of coal for producing energy is typically not restricted whereas for water its use could be constrained by the irrigatable land it is therefore essential to investigate the impacts of efficiency improvement on water use and consumption under alternative restrictions on water supply and land availability which however receives little attention in the literature the influences of irrigation efficiency improvement on water use and consumption have increasingly been explored in recent years e g contor and taylor 2013 pfeiffer and lin 2014 huang et al 2017 sese minguez et al 2017 berbel et al 2018 nevertheless the findings vary from case to case and sometimes are even contradictory to each other a significant number of studies concluded that water can be saved when the irrigation method shifts from traditional surface irrigation systems to more efficient ones such as sprinkler and drip e g soto garcía et al 2013 graveline et al 2014 sanchis ibor et al 2015 huang et al 2017 however there are some other studies which have reported increases in water use in response to improved irrigation techniques e g ward and pulido velazquez 2008 pfeiffer and lin 2014 song et al 2018 this appears to be intuitively confirmed by the significant increase in global total irrigation water during the recent decades despite that many countries around the world such as the united states spain and china have been strongly promoting the use of efficient irrigation technologies huang et al 2018 additionally some other researchers such as peterson and ding 2005 huffaker 2008 and gómez and pérez blanco 2014 gave ambiguous results arguing that the improved irrigation efficiency may either increase or decrease water use the inconsistent findings may be due to that i the water use and consumption are not distinguished ii the scales upon which the analyses are based are different iii the assumptions behind the method are different or due to some other factors such as the differences in the previous situation basin or aquifer characteristics berbel et al 2015 in this context more investigations are therefore needed to reveal the impacts of irrigation efficiency improvement the relationship between irrigation efficiency improvement and water use and consumption is a complicated issue which involves many aspects such as economy agronomy hydrology and institution currently the empirical and theoretical approaches are typically used to investigate the problem berbel et al 2015 huang et al 2017 with observational data the empirical methods such as the direct comparison approach and the econometric analysis could provide powerful evidence regarding the effects of irrigation technology improvements on water uses pfeiffer and lin 2014 sanchis ibor et al 2017 huang et al 2018 nonetheless it can hardly decipher the mechanism behind the impacts hence various theoretical approaches such as analytical models and mathematical programming and simulation have been applied to analyze the changes of water use and consumption in response to increased irrigation efficiency scheierling et al 2006 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 and qureshi et al 2010 studied the effects of a series of water conservation subsidy policies and the associated increase in irrigation efficiency on hydrologic and agronomic factors such as return flow water use and consumption by using the mathematical programming approach huffaker 2008 formulated an economic model and examined the conditions under which water can be saved when there is a public subsidy on investing in improved on farm irrigation efficiency gómez and pérez blanco 2014 distinguished the determinants of the emergence of the irrigation paradox by using an analytical framework the previous theoretical studies could significantly improve our understandings of the impacts of irrigation efficiency improvement and have great implications for water resource managements nevertheless few of them have taken deficit irrigation into account in their analyses and erroneously assumed a constant irrigation efficiency depending on the irrigation system deficit irrigation which is a promising management strategy for improving water productivity bell et al 2018 gonzalez dugo et al 2018 can have a profound impact on the actual irrigation efficiency even under the same irrigation system more importantly to our best knowledge few of the previous studies have systematically explored the impacts of irrigation efficiency improvement on water use and consumption respectively under alternative restrictions on water supply and irrigatable land recently berbel and mateos 2014 and berbel et al 2018 developed an agro economic model that analytically integrates the variable irrigation efficiency resulting from deficit irrigation and application uniformity and studied the effects of irrigation efficiency improvement on water use and consumption under the condition of unlimited water supply and restricted irrigatable land nevertheless they didn t explore the situation under the condition of limited water supply and unrestricted irrigatable land which might be the case in reality particularly in the arid and semi arid regions further the analyses were mainly performed at the scale of the field plot from the micro economic perspective the reuses of the irrigation return flows were not taken into account over larger scales despite its potentially substantial volumes simons et al 2015 in this study we extended the works of berbel and mateos 2014 and berbel et al 2018 to further investigate the impacts of irrigation efficiency on water use and consumption by combining an agro economic model with the conceptualization of hydrological pathways the analyses were performed at the scales of the water use unit wuu and the irrigation system respectively under two different conditions i e case 1 unlimited water supply and restricted irrigatable land and case 2 limited water supply and unrestricted irrigatable land the remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows section 2 and 3 introduce the agro economic model and the conceptualization of hydrological pathways section 4 presents the analyses regarding the effects of irrigation efficiency improvement on water use and consumption under the conditions of case 1 and case 2 finally some discussion and conclusions are

referring to the studies of mateos 2008 simons et al 2015 and mateos and araus 2016 as shown in fig 1 a cascading of water use units wuus are arranged in parallel with a single and primary line water source e g a river or a canal which constitutes the irrigation system the available irrigation water in a wuu comes from the upstream wuu or the line source the water uses in a wuu are divided into

reusable one 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 4 impacts of irrigation efficiency improvement on water use and consumption the study considered three typical irrigation techniques furrow sprinkler and drip whose standard

and exhibit profit maximizing behaviors and iii crop yield is mainly affected by irrigation with the remaining inputs assumed to be fixed for simplicity the heterogeneity of the wuus was not considered leading to the same irrigation efficiency of each wuu eu which is equal to e as in eq 2 we additionally assumed that the applied water in a wuu results from adding water first from the reusable non consumed water of the upstream unit and then from the line source till obtaining an amount of water wu with these assumptions the water use ws and the relative water use ws of the irrigation system could be estimated using eqs 6 and 7 respectively mateos 2008 with regard to water consumption of the irrigation system it would be same with the wuu according to our hydrological conceptualization 6 w s w u n n 1 1 e u ρ 1 ρ 2 7 w s w s n w m n n 1 1 e u ρ 1 ρ 2 n w u where n is the number of wuus both ρ 1 and ρ 2 were set as 0 5 assuming all the non consumed water is reusable 4 1 case 1 unlimited water supply and restricted irrigatable land as mentioned before berbel et al 2018 have recently investigated the influences of irrigation efficiency improvement on water use and consumption under the condition of case 1 as shown in fig 2 the efficient irrigation technology would reduce water use significantly in the wuu when the water price is relatively low the farmer would not likely adopt deficit irrigation when confronted with low water price leading to obviously higher water uses under furrow irrigation compared with the other two methods the water consumptions i e the irrigation water consumed by crops are of the similar magnitudes for different irrigation methods because of the consistently full irrigation confronted with high water price however the farmer would be willing to adopt deficit irrigation to reduce water cost under inefficient irrigation systems hence the potential reductions in water use become smaller when the water price gets higher meanwhile the water consumption under drip irrigation is slightly greater than the other two irrigation methods due the higher actual irrigation efficiency fig 3 a plots the relationship between relative water use and water cost ratio under furrow irrigation for the irrigation system with different numbers of wuus the water use shows an apparent downward trend in response to growing water cost ratios however the trend gradually becomes insignificant with increasing numbers of water reuse cycles the results indicate the water price policy would play a slight role in curtailing water use at the scale of the irrigation system upon which water reuse is significant fig 3b shows the changes in relative water use when the irrigation technique switches from furrow to drip it is seen that the decreases in water use become more and more insignificant in response to increasing water cost ratios and numbers of wuus thus the shift from furrow to drip irrigation may have little potentials for reducing water use at the scale of the irrigation system providing the water cost ratio or the number of water reuse cycles is high under the condition of case 1 4 2 case 2 limited water supply and unrestricted irrigatable land the irrigated area lu in the wuu could be estimated using eq 8 under the condition of case 2 8 l u v w o p t where wopt is the optimum water use per unit of land and v is the water supply for the wuu as shown in fig 4 a the irrigated area is largest under furrow irrigation followed by sprinkler and drip when the fixed cost ratio is small the differences of the irrigated area are becoming small with increasing fixed cost ratios the area of land under drip irrigation tends to be larger than the other two methods when the fixed cost ratio approaches to great values the irrigation efficiency improvement therefore may either increase or decrease the irrigated area depending on the fixed cost ratio under the condition of case 2 the critical point carea could be derived as in eq 9 by taking the derivative of the optimum water use level i e eq 5 with respect to the fixed cost ratio and setting the result to zero the efficient irrigation technique would lead to smaller irrigated areas when the fixed cost ratio is lower than carea and would conversely induce larger irrigated areas when the fixed cost ratio is greater than carea 9 c a r e a 1 k y 2 1 r fig 4b presents the changes of water consumption in response to increasing fixed cost ratios in the wuu the water consumptions are almost of the same magnitudes under different irrigation techniques when the fix cost ratio is small this is because that when confronted with small fix costs the farmer would adopt deficit irrigation by increasing the area of land so as to obtain high revenue per unit of water all the available water would be consumed efficiently regardless of which irrigation technique is implemented however when faced with high fix costs the farmer would decrease the area of land to reduce the costs resulting in decreasing actual irrigation efficiency as shown in fig 5 the furrow irrigation has the highest decrement of the efficiency followed by sprinkler and drip hence the water consumption exhibits an increasing trend after modernizing the irrigation technologies when the fix cost ratio is high actually this is one of the important mechanisms that generates irrigation efficiency paradox if the deficit irrigation is not considered the farmer will likely expand the irrigatable land by using the water saved by more efficient irrigation techniques this would indeed be the case in reality considering that deficit irrigation is difficult to implement and meanwhile may bring high risks to farmers fig 6 a presents the relationship between water use and fixed cost ratio under furrow irrigation for the irrigation system the water use is inelastic to the increase in fixed cost ratio when the number water reuse cycles is relatively small however it shows a slight decreasing trend with increasing fixed cost ratios in the irrigation system with large numbers of water reuse cycles the water uses of the irrigation system increase proportionally to the number of wuus when the fixed cost ratio is small this is because as shown in fig 5 the actual irrigation efficiency is high under furrow irrigation in the wuu due to the adoption of deficit irrigation leading to small proportions of return flows fig 6b depicts the changes in water use in the irrigation system when the irrigation methods shifts from furrow to drip the more efficient technique tends to bring about more water uses when the fixed cost ratio and the number of reuse cycles are relatively high this is because as shown in fig 5 the actual irrigation efficiency of drip is greater than furrow providing the fixed cost ratio is high the drip irrigation would therefore produce less reusable return flows leading to the increase in the total water uses of the irrigation system in comparison with the furrow irrigation nonetheless the magnitudes of the increments are relatively small the largest of which would be less than 10 of the total water use 5 discussion 5 1 sensitivity of the major assumptions the standard efficiencies of the three typical irrigation methods i e furrow sprinkler and drip were presumed to be 0 6 0 80 and 0 95 respectively we further explored the sensitivity of the assumption by comparing the ranges of relative water use and consumption under furrow sprinkler and drip irrigation whose standard efficiencies span 0 50 0 60 0 70 0 80 and 0 85 0 95 respectively as plotted in fig 7 the water use exhibits a decreasing trend as the irrigation method shifts from furrow to sprinkler and drip in the wuu under the condition of case 1 although with varying magnitudes depending on the preset standard efficiencies the decreasing trend turns to be insignificant when the water cost ratio increases from 0 to 0 25 with regard to water consumption it shows slight divergences between different irrigation techniques these results are in consistent with our previous findings in the section of 4 1 which proves low sensitivity of the assumption regarding the standard efficiencies of the typical irrigation techniques furthermore the sum of the water reuse parameters i e ρ 1 and ρ 2 was assumed to be one in this research considering that it is difficult to determine the proportion of reusable non consumed water which largely depends on basin or aquifer characteristics this implicitly hypothesized that all the non consumed water is reusable for the downstream wuus therefore we additionally conducted the sensitivity analysis of the assumption by changing the values of ρ 1 and ρ 2 while holding the other parameters constant the sum of ρ 1 and ρ 2 was presumed to increase from 0 2 to 1 0 signifying smaller to larger proportions of reusable return flows the results are shown in fig 8 the water use of the irrigation system decreases significantly in response to increasing numbers of wuus under furrow irrigation when the proportion of reusable return flow is high e g ρ 1 ρ 2 1 0 while it only shows slight changes when the proportion is low e g ρ 1 ρ 2 0 2 as presented in fig 8b the water use reduces significantly when the irrigation method shifts from furrow to drip and has a decreasing magnitude in response to increasing numbers of wuus moreover the magnitudes of the reductions become smaller in response to increasing proportions of reusable return flow the results imply that the water use of the irrigation system depends greatly on the water reuse parameters implying a high sensitivity of the assumption regarding the proportions of reusable return flows nevertheless the assumption of a large proportion of reusable return flow seems meaningful in this study considering that a lower value could lead to similar responses of the water uses for the wuu and the irrigation system besides the degree of return flow reuse is actually co determined by the numbers of wuus and the proportion of reusable return flow the results for the condition of lower proportions of reusable return flows could be easily deduced from the situations of small numbers of wuus 5 2 implications for agricultural water management in this research the relationships between irrigation efficiency improvement and water use and consumption were analyzed under two different conditions i e case 1 unlimited water supply and restricted irrigatable land and case 2 limited water supply and unrestricted irrigatable land as stated by berbel and mateos 2014 the condition of case 1 might occur under the circumstances that there is i a physical constraint on more lands to be irrigated ii a legal prohibition against the expansion of irrigated land and iii a financial limitation on the farmer s ability to increase farm size meanwhile the condition of case 2 might occur as well particularly in the arid or semi arid regions where irrigatable land seems to be more adequate than water supply in both conditions we found that the water use and consumption would not likely increase significantly after improving irrigation efficiency this implies that alternative restrictions on water supply and irrigatable land could effectively constrain water use and consumption which may prevent from the occurrence of efficiency paradox after modernizing the irrigation systems this is confirmed by the previous studies such as berbel et al 2015 li and zhao 2016 and sanchis ibor et al 2017 the water use could be reduced significantly at the scale of the wuu by improving irrigation efficiency under the condition of case 1 however the reduction becomes insignificant when the hydrological pathways are taken into account due to the reuses of the return flow in the irrigation system this is often overlooked by water resource managers who expect to provide additional water supply for new uses through improving the on farm irrigation efficiency frederiksen and allen 2011 in the condition of case 2 the water use would not change at the scale of the wuu while it would increase although with small magnitudes for the irrigation system with a high degree of return flow reuses after modernizing the irrigation systems the results indicate that in both cases the expectations of large water savings through improving the irrigation techniques would not likely be achieved at the scale of the irrigation system upon which the degree of return flow reuses is high the agro economic model used in this study has one distinct feature that distinguishes it from others it integrates the variation of irrigation efficiency resulting from deficit irrigation and application uniformity into the modeling framework if the deficit irrigation is not taken into account the water use will decrease significantly and the water consumption will almost be the same for different irrigation methods at the scale of the wuu under the condition of case 1 moreover the water consumption is likely to increase after using more efficient irrigation techniques under the condition of case 2 considering that the saved water could be used to expand the irrigatable land the results can be very different from the situations which have taken the adoption of deficit irrigation into account hence the relationships between irrigation efficiency improvement and water use and consumption can be greatly affected by whether or not the deficit irrigation is implemented this needs to be considered by water resource managers for developing more effective strategies to conserve water resources 5 3 uncertainties and limitations in the agro economical model all the consumed water was implicitly assumed to be beneficial which might bring some uncertainties to the results the water consumption includes both beneficial and nonbeneficial components the latter of which might be of sizeable magnitude batchelor et al 2014 it may decrease if a large amount of non beneficial consumed water e g soil evaporation could be reduced substantially by more efficient techniques at the same time it may increase if the beneficial consumption could be enhanced significantly which can be embodied by the increase of crop yields the assumption thus may lead the findings of the study to be pessimistic or optimistic currently however it is difficult to determine how the proportions between beneficial and non beneficial water consumption could be influenced by more efficient irrigation techniques which depends on several factors such as soil texture crop canopy and the density of the drippers molle and tanouti 2017 in addition the beneficial and non beneficial consumptions themselves remain poorly measured gleick et al 2009 and the definitions of beneficial and non beneficial consumption are also controversial karimi et al 2013 the agro economical model only considers one single crop without considering the possible planting structure conversions induced by irrigation efficiency improvement the farmer may transform the crop structure from a lower water consuming one into a higher one in response to enhanced irrigation efficiency the potential reductions in water use may be overestimated by assuming one constant and single crop the multiple crops therefore need to be integrated into the agro economical model to more deeply unveil the impacts of irrigation efficiency improvement on water use and consumption the farmer would use all the available water for irrigation under the condition of case 2 consequently the demand for water would be independent of water price and irrigation methods however it shows an obviously upward trend in response to decreased water price under the condition of case 1 meanwhile the demand for water becomes less elastic with more efficient irrigation systems as shown in fig 2a in this study we assumed a constant water price regardless of which irrigation method is adopted which might produce biased results the water price cost may increase due to the fact that the more efficient irrigation technologies such as drip and sprinkler typically require more energy and could have higher operation and maintenance costs on the other hand it may decrease as well if there is a water conservation subsidy from government considering the own price elasticity of demand davidson and hellegers 2011 the potential reductions in water use may be underestimated if the water price exhibits an increasing trend and vice versa after modernizing the irrigation system at the scale of the wuu under the condition of case 1 6 conclusions in this study we analyzed the influences of irrigation efficiency improvement on water use and consumption by combining an agro economic model with the conceptualization of hydrological pathways the analyses were carried out at the scales of the water use unit wuu and the irrigation system under two different conditions i e case 1 unlimited water supply and restricted irrigatable land and case 2 limited water supply and unrestricted irrigatable land the water use would reduce significantly after improving irrigation efficiency in the wuu albeit with decreasing magnitudes as the water price increases under the condition of case 1 meanwhile the water consumptions would be of similar magnitudes for different irrigation techniques however the water use would not change in response to improved irrigation technology and the water consumption would increase slightly if the fixed cost ratio is high in the wuu under the condition of case 2 the water use of the irrigation system would decrease with shrinking magnitudes in response to increasing water cost ratios and numbers of wuus under the condition of case 1 in contrast it would increase although with small magnitudes when the fixed cost ratios and the number of reuse cycles are relatively high under the condition of case 2 the study demonstrated that alternative restrictions on water supply and irrigatable land could effectively constrain water use and consumption which may prevent from the occurrence of efficiency paradox after modernizing the irrigation systems moreover the water use seems unlikely to decrease considerably at the scale of the irrigation system upon which the degree of return flow reuses is high in addition the adoption of deficit irrigation needs to be considered by water resource managers for developing more effective strategies to conserve water resources acknowledgements this study was financially supported by

11212,the rapid escalation in water demands for agriculture domestic and industry sectors requires skillful management of this limited resource globally the agriculture sector is considered the main user of the water resource actual evapotranspiration etc is an important tool in determining the water requirements of different crops therefore precise estimation of the etc is the major parameter in the water balance of arid and semi arid agriculture regions such as egypt recently both remote sensing and geographical information systems gis become the main techniques that can be efficiently used for estimating the etc on regional and global coverage the main goal of this study was to estimate the daily and seasonally etc over the nile delta using remote sensing techniques these techniques were surface energy balance for land sebal algorithm with 24 landsat 8 images additionally fao penman monteith method was used to validate the derived etc from sebal algorithm under the same conditions using several performance criteria to assess the performance of the sebal algorithm with landsat 8 in estimating the etc over the nile delta the results revealed that the sebal algorithm with landsat 8 images appears to provide an acceptable estimation of the spatial and temporal distributions of etc over the nile delta with acceptable accuracy with r2 97 83 rmse about 0 469 mm day and 15 9 nrmse the derived etc from sebal algorithm was then used to estimate the water balance and the irrigation efficiency of the study area results of water balance estimates revealed that most of the seasonal etc 93 was originally met by surface water and groundwater supplies however the remaining portion 7 was particularly met by precipitation furthermore the estimated irrigation efficiency was about 48 6 in the central portion of the nile delta overall the performance of the derived etc from sebal algorithm compared to available ground datasets demonstrates the potential of using the sebal algorithm with landsat 8 images for water use and water balance estimates within the nile delta keywords actual evapotranspiration sebal landsat 8 water balance nile delta 1 introduction actual evapotranspiration etc is a critical component of water balance at local field farm catchment and basin and global levels from an agricultural point of view the etc determines the amount of water to be applied through irrigation most hydrologic models and agricultural management applications require accurate estimation of the etc the etc is defined by the processes whereby water is lost through evaporation from the soil surface and through transpiration from the plants doorenbos 1984 running et al 2017 the transpiration of plants represents the main portion of the etc process the remaining portion of the etc is taken place due to the evaporation from soil and water surfaces liu et al 2003 the processes of evaporation and transpiration are existing simultaneously and there is no direct accurate way to separate the two processes ding et al 2013 there are several methods to estimate the etc which can be generally classified as empirical methods thornthwaite 1948 blaney 1952 surface energy balance methods and combination methods which combine the empirical methods with the surface energy balance methods penman 1948 allen et al 1998b nouri et al 2013b these methods vary in terms of the required data and the accuracy of the estimated etc the empirical methods are mainly used for the etc estimation based on point measurements they provide undesirable overestimation or underestimation values of the etc elhag et al 2011 furthermore the applications of these methods have some limitations such as time and cost involved in the daily obtaining and processing the required meteorological data moreover the number of stations where reliable meteorological data is generally limited droogers and allen 2002 fao penman monteith formula is considered the most common empirical method for the etc estimation in agriculture allen et al 1998b allen 2000 satellite imagery recently provides a dependable basis for various computational models that perform the etc estimation based on the surface energy balance mao and wang 2017 the estimated etc by satellite images is very useful for evaluating crop water requirements and the water balance at regional and subfields scales senay et al 2016 pinter et al 2003 furthermore satellite imagery and airborne images are considered the most efficient and economic techniques for the etc estimates in large areas allen et al 2011 the surface energy balance methods can be used to estimate the etc based on the residual concept calcagno et al 2007 the residual concept was used for several algorithms such as surface energy balance index sebi simplified surface energy balance system ssebs surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution and with internalized calibration metric and two source energy balance tseb the sebi algorithm can be efficiently used to estimate the etc however it requires plenty of ground based measurements menenti and choudhury 1993 the ssebs algorithm requires several parameters to estimate the etc under extreme temperatures su 2002 additionally it does not require ground base measurements roerink et al 2000 the tseb algorithm needs several ground based measurements to include the view geometry in the etc estimation tang et al 2011 the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal can be used to estimate the etc using the meteorological data however the input data for the sebal algorithm are largely varied which provide uncertainties to the etc estimates the modified and developed version of the sebal algorithm namely metric algorithm is appropriate for sloped areas liou and kar 2014 the sebal and metric algorithms have an internal calibration of the sensible heat computations it eliminates the need for atmospheric corrections for the surface temperature and reflectance measurements the internal calibration can undoubtedly reduce the impacts of the biases in the aerodynamic stability corrections tasumi et al 2005 the sebal algorithm was originally developed and successfully applied for the water uses estimates in spain and egypt bastiaanssen et al 1998 furthermore it requires minimum ground based measurements and can be successfully applied for the etc estimation in arid regions like egypt additionally the areas in the nile delta are mainly plain where the sebal algorithm can be efficiently applied estimation of the etc by combining both the meteorological data and remotely sensed data has been widely investigated nouri et al 2016 najmaddin et al 2017 meteorological data i e solar radiation wind speed and temperature are particularly used to estimate the reference evapotranspiration eto allen et al 1998b nouri et al 2013a calculated the crop coefficient kc depending on the growing stage using remote sensing techniques afterthought the etc was estimated by multiplying the eto by the kc additionally the etc can be predicted using a method which depends on soil vegetation atmosphere transfer savt model without using remote sensing techniques however olioso olioso et al 2005 reported that combining svat models with remote sensing techniques for the etc estimation is more efficient water demand in egypt is rapidly increasing due to the incredibly rapid growth of population the agriculture sector in egypt which represents the backbone of its economy consumes more than 85 of available water resources moreover about 45 of total agriculture water is depleted due to the etc elnmer et al 2015 khadr et al 2016 therefore efficient water resources management is the main priority to optimize the beneficial use of these resources to satisfy all the demands mwri 2010 el din 2013 the aim of the study is to 1 estimate the daily and seasonal etc over the nile delta using sebal algorithm with landsat 8 images 2 evaluate the performance of sebal algorithm with landsat 8 in the etc estimation using independent dataset which contains 21 ground truth points distributed over the study area and 3 estimate the water balance and irrigation efficiency based on the modeled etc for a pilot study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the methodology presented in this paper was implemented in the nile delta which represents 2 4 of the total area of egypt the study area is located between latitudes of 31 45 30 00ʹ n and longitudes of 30 00ʹ 32 00ʹ e as shown in fig 1 moreover about 49 of total inhabitant are concentrated and settled in this area where the agriculture and industry are the main activities as shown in fig 1 el kawy et al 2011 the climate in general is an arid mediterranean type and the coastal zone of the study area is characterized by relatively very low rainfall with an average amount of about 200 mm year which is used in the rain fed agriculture additionally the rainfall decreases from the north of the nile delta to the south to reach almost zero in the far south the old and new lands in the nile delta are mainly flat fertile the old lands represent about 93 of the total areas of the nile delta and being characterized by alluvial soils and irrigated by traditional systems kotb et al 2000 new lands are located in the west and east sides of the nile delta where the sprinkler and drip irrigation techniques are used wheat and clover crops dominate the crops in the winter season which extends from october to may summer crops are mainly rice and maize and the season extends from may to october elnmer et al 2015 the winter season consist of three seasons i e beginning growing and harvesting seasons the beginning season extents from november to december while the growing season extents from january to march the harvesting season runs from april to may 2 2 data set 2 2 1 satellite data in this study various datasets were used from various sources ranging from field records to remotely sensed images for the nile delta these datasets were metrological data landsat 8 images and field data about crops type and water supplies and demands in the study area the metrological data include temperature wind speed relative humidity rh surface pressure and precipitation sebal algorithm requires satellite images and meteorological data to calculate the etc at a regional scale a total of 24 cloud free 10 clouds landsat 8 images were used in the sebal algorithm for the nile delta during the winter season 2015 2016 landsat images which have been extensively used for water resource applications consists of an operational land imager oli and thermal infrared sensor tirs olioso et al 2005 serbina and miller 2014 the operational land imager oli has nine spectral bands to be able to collect the desired image moreover it has a sufficient resolution of 15 30 meter to distinguish different land uses du et al 2014 the thermal infrared sensor tirs is the tool to measure the thermal bands of 10 and 11 however the estimated errors for the tirs were 0 29 and 0 51 w m2 sr mm respectively montanaro et al 2014 table 1 summarizes landsat 8 data which were used in this study the region of the nile delta was covered by four satellite images for one satellite overpass these images have specific paths and rows according to their geographic locations landsat 8 overpasses the same point every 16 days hence for one month there are two landsat 8 images with 30 m resolution for this study one image was selected every month according to the cloud ratio for one month the four images for the region of the nile delta were captured in a different day so the daily etc map must be analyzed separately fig 1 illustrates the four images and their represented regions where 1 and 2 represent the south of the nile delta while 3 and 4 indicate the coastal area moreover table 2 illustrates the differences between the regions in terms of their location climate conditions and irrigation techniques 2 2 2 meteorological data regarding field data the meteorological data were collected from four weather stations located in the study area as shown in fig 1 these data were temperature maximum minimum and average wind speed relative humidity rh surface pressure precipitation and solar radiation which were recorded hourly for the nile delta during the winter season 2015 2016 additionally the required data for water balance estimation water supplies and demands in the study area were obtained from the egyptian ministry of water resources and irrigation mwri 2 3 sebal algorithm the processes of sebal algorithm produces many maps like net surface radiation rn soil heat flux g and sensible heat flux to the air h using the satellite images meteorological data the final map of the sebal algorithm is a spatial distribution of the etc bastiaanssen et al 1998 the derived etc from the sebal algorithm were estimated using a series of

so it is considered the same as the 24 hour average fig 2 shows the schematic diagram for estimating the etc using sebal algorithm and an application of the water balance and irrigation efficiency estimates in the center of the nile delta 2 4 validation of the sebal algorithm performance the eto was estimated using the fao penman monteith formula and the collected metrological data for the nile

and the correlation coefficient cr cole and tillman 2001 willmott and matsuura 2005 khadr 2016 however the validation of the sebal algorithm at regional and seasonal scales could not be performed in this study due to the limitation of the field data about the spatial distribution of the crops type in the four regions of the nile delta the efficiency nse proposed by nash and sutcliffe lehner et al 2001 is defined as one minus the sum of the absolute squared differences between the etc sat and etc fao values normalized by the variance of the etc fao values during the period under investigation

sat are equal while the alternative hypothesis was that there is a significant difference between the mean from the etc fao and etc sat 2 5 assessment of the water balance and irrigation efficiency the derived etc from the sebal algorithm and satellite images was implemented in the estimates of the water balance and irrigation efficiency for a district located in the central portion of the nile delta egypt during the winter season 2015 2016 the district is located between latitude of 30 43ʹ43 75ʺ 30 57ʹ40ʺ n and longitudes of 30 54ʹ42 15ʺ 31 1ʹ37 35ʺ e with an area of 215 775 km² the water balance in the central part of the nile delta consists of three terms water supplies water demands and water losses the water supplies in the study area are the surface water from main and branch canals followed by small amounts of groundwater and rainfall the data about surface water supplies were collected from the mwri moreover the rainfall data were collected from the weather station in the study area the water supplies satisfy the water demands of the domestic and the agriculture sectors however the water consumption of the industrial sector in the study area is almost negligible khadr et al 2016 the domestic water requirements were met by four water treatment plants in the study area with a daily consumption of 62 030 m3 day khadr et al 2016 the water demands of the agriculture sector are expressed by the crop water consumptions the crop water consumptions in the study area were estimated using the derived etc from sebal algorithm the water losses can be categorized into surface run off losses conveyance losses and percolation losses surface runoff losses and percolation losses could not be assessed in the study area due to the lack of field measurements the conveyance losses was estimated in this study as described earlier by khadr khadr et al 2016 furthermore the evaporation losses from the soil and water surfaces were included in the etc estimation liu et al 2003 thereafter the irrigation efficiency ei was estimated based on the water balance calculations in the study area during the winter season 2015 2016 the ei is the ratio between the etc sat to the surface water and groundwater supplies it depends on the water allocation crop type and metrological data i e temperature precipitation wind speed etc 3 results and discussion 3 1 sebal algorithm results 3 1 1 daily actual evapotranspiration etc daily etc represents the most important process for the determination of the surface and mass energy interaction for both water resources management and agriculture practices sellers et al 1996 however the etc is regionally and daily varied based on the environmental and climatic conditions in terms of temperature humidity and wind speed su et al 2003 understanding the temporal and spatial variations of the etc is essential to efficiently manage the limited water resources in the nile delta figs 3 a f show the daily distribution of the derived etc from sebal algorithm along the nile delta during the winter season starting from november 2015 to may 2016 the sebal algorithm results showed that the etc was quite low and highly varied from 1 3 to 3 0 mm day during november 2015 as shown in fig 3 a this was mainly due to the existing of unplanted areas and the vegetation cover was temporarily absent during the beginning season bastiaanssen et al 2009 this was not the case in december 2015 to april 2016 where the simulated etc was slightly increased and ranged from 1 85 to 3 56 mm day in december 2015 fig 3b due to the growth of plants in the growing season the etc was largely increased and varied from 2 5 to 4 2 mm day and from 2 8 to 4 5 mm day in february and march 2016 respectively as shown in fig 3 c and d nevertheless the etc was significantly dropped in the harvesting season it ranged from 1 5 to 4 2 mm day in april 2016 and from 0 5 to 2 3 mm day in may 2016 as shown in fig 3 e and f 3 1 2 seasonal actual evapotranspiration the sebal algorithm was efficiently used for assessing the seasonal etc distribution along the nile delta as shown in fig 4 the results showed that the seasonal etc was quite low and amounted to 0 81 mm season in the far west alexandra governorate where most of the new reclaimed lands exist this could be attributed to the using of the drip and sprinkler irrigation techniques which affect adversely on the etc the situation of the seasonal etc in the center of the nile delta is fully different as shown in fig 4 the etc was varied from 81 to 200 mm season due to the high abstraction of the groundwater which substantially reduced the etc these results are consistent with chen et al 2014 who found that the groundwater abstraction could significantly affect the etc the moderate seasonal etc was recorded in the east port said governorate and west el behira governorate as shown in fig 4 however the seasonal etc was substantially increased and varied from 430 to 700 mm season in the far east where the aquaculture practices are the most activities of the region and the presence of the water bodies the water bodies have high evaporation rates compared to the cultivated areas these results are comparable with those obtained by bastiaanssen pelgrum et al 2009 who used the sebal algorithm to calculate the daily and seasonally etc for the center of the nile delta during 2008 2009 they reported that the highest and lowest values of the etc were in july 2008 2009 and december 2008 2009 respectively the tirs banding artifacts in the satellite images were observed in fig 4 which should be avoided to provide an accurate estimation for the etc this problem was due to the tirs stray light problem in the landsat 8 satellite it started after launching of the landsat 8 satellite in march 2013 and several approaches have been pursued to correct the tirs stray light but they are in the early exploratory stages montanaro et al 2014 fig 5 shows the frequency distribution of the seasonal etc which was derived from the sebal algorithm the results revealed that the etc of 274 mm season was taken place in the most of the nile delta this strongly indicates that the crops in these areas consumed moderate irrigation water quantities during the growing season the high values of the etc in fig 5 were due to the presence of tirs stray light in the satellite images moreover inaccurate classification of the aquatic plants on the water surface in the far east of the nile delta resulted in the high values of the etc higher results were obtained by elhag et al 2011 who found that the frequency distribution of the daily etc over the nile delta exceeded 2 5 mm day in august 2007 this was attributed to the temperature differences between the summer and winter seasons in the nile delta which significantly influence the etc fig 6 illustrates the derived monthly etc from sebal algorithm and the rainfall over the study area during the winter season 2015 2016 the results showed that about 93 of the etc was met by the surface water and groundwater whereas the remaining portion of 7 was gained from the rainfall the rainfall was a maximum of 13 91 mm month in november 2015 followed by 10 51 mm month in february 2016 there was no rainfall in april and may 2016 as shown in fig 6 moreover the etc was maximized at a level of 123 75 mm month in march 2016 due to the growth of the plants in the growing season however the etc was quite low in april and may 2016 86 25 and 84 mm month respectively which was due to the harvesting season a similar trend was observed in the beginning season where the etc was 73 13 mm month in november 2015 3 1 3 regional actual evapotranspiration etc the daily etc temperature t and precipitation p over the four regions of the nile delta were extensively assessed in fig 7 the meteorological data i e t and p highly fluctuated from region 1 to 2 3 and 4 this spatial variation has significant influences on the etc in the nile delta allen et al 1998a reported that the main factors affecting the etc are the t and p additionally the irrigation techniques and water availability would influence the etc the flooding irrigation technique could increase the etc while the sparkling and dripping irrigation techniques would adversely affect the etc dehghanisanij and kosari 2011 the etc was slightly decreased from 3 0 to 2 8 mm day in regions 1 and 2 respectively in november 2015 this could be attributed to the decrease in the t from region 1 to 2 19 to 17 respectively and the existing of the p events in region 2 a similar trend was observed in march 2016 the etc and t decreased from 4 5 to 4 2 mm day and from 21 to 20 c in regions 1 and 2 respectively in march 2016 additionally the p in region 2 was 3 0 mm however the etc was quite high in march regarding november by a value of 50 due to the growth of crops and prevailed high t in the regions 1 and 2 respectively as shown in fig 7 the etc significantly dropped in region 2 by a value of 50 in april as compared to region 1 where the temperature fluctuated highly between 20 and 25 this can be attributed to the p event in region 2 by 5 0 mm the etc decreased in may 2016 and amounted to 3 1 2 0 mm day in regions 1 and 2 respectively as shown in fig 5 additionally the t decreased from 24 to 19 in absence of the p 0 0 mm in regions 1 and 2 respectively the situation for coastal areas regions 3 and 4 was extremely different where the etc was low in the north of the nile delta regarding the south this could be attributed to continuous precipitation events and the low temperatures in the north of the nile delta similar results were obtained by el shirbeny et al 2014 who estimated the daily etc and observed that the etc values increase from the north to the south of the nile delta they concluded that the increases in the t and the decreases in the relative humidity were the main deriving factors for the etc spatial variation the results in fig 7 revealed that the etc increased from 2 0 to 2 5 mm day in regions 3 and 4 in november and december 2015 respectively this could be attributed to the increase in the t from region 3 to 4 an adverse trend was observed in february 2016 where the etc decreased from 4 0 to 3 2 mm day in regions 3 and 4 respectively this may be due to the decrease in the t from 14 to 11 in addition to the p event in region 4 by 2 09 mm a similar trend was observed in april 2016 where the etc decreased from 3 0 to 2 5 mm day and the t decreased from 19 to 17 in regions 3 and 4 respectively however in march 2016 the t increased from 15 to 16 in regions 3 and 4 respectively and the etc decreased from 4 0 to 3 8 mm day this could be due to the p event in region 4 by 2 03 mm 3 2 validation of the sebal algorithm performance the derived etc from the sebal algorithm etc sat was validated at field scale using field data of the etc etc fao to assess the capability of the sebal algorithm in estimating of the etc over the nile delta it can be clearly seen from table 4 that the sebal model performs satisfactory and the overall evaluation results are fairly good from the r 2 rmse cr nse and nrmse viewpoints a significant positive correlation cr with 0 98 was detected between the etc fao and etc sat additionally the large value of r2 fig 8 is an indication of a perfect relationship between the etc fao and etc sat values according to eq 8 the range of nse lies between 1 0 perfect fit and high values of nse is an indication of a more efficient model however values of nse in the range of 0 indicate unacceptable performance the value of nse which is presented in table 4 is greater than 0 9 which indicates that etc sat has a perfect fit for the etc fao the rmse indicate that the etc sat values were close to the values of the etc fao with 0 469 mm day error moreover the nrmse was 15 98 which indicate that the etc sat values fit the values of the etc fao the validation process was performed using 21 fields of wheat crop hence the validation results were high due to the insignificant differences between the etc of different wheat fields similar results were obtained by dos santos et al 2010 where the derived etc from sebal algorithm had a good agreement with the field data of the etc with 95 accuracy in brazil additionally du et al 2013 reported that the daily etc from sebal algorithm was misestimating at an average range of 10 52 with the field data from the eddy covariance system in the sanjiang plain northeast china the value of the test static p almost equals 0 0 as shown in table 4 which indicates that z test does not reject the null hypothesis that the etc fao and etc sat come from a distribution with the same mean at a significance level of 5 in addition all calculated z values are located between z critical values 1 96 for two tailed at a 5 significance level 3 3 assessment of the water balance the water balance for a district in the center of the nile delta was analyzed to assess the irrigation water performance during the winter season from november 2015 to may 2016 the district is located at a latitude of 30 43ʹ 30 57ʹ n and a longitude of 30 54ʹ 31 1ʹ e as shown in fig 9 the water balance for the district in the center of the nile delta is shown in table 3 the surface water supplies were about 171 87 mm3 season and represented about 96 91 of the total water supplies in the study area it is controlled by the mwri to satisfy the domestic and agricultural water demands however the rainfall was about 3 09 of total water supplies this was due to the aridity of the study area the water supplies meet the agricultural demand according to the crop water requirements hence the summer season has higher surface water supplies than the winter season where the rice is the dominated crop in the summer crop pattern the agricultural water demand was represented by the crop water consumptions it was the largest water consumer in the study area the crop water consumptions were estimated by the derived seasonal etc from the sebal algorithm the seasonal etc was largely varied from 125 to 650 mm winter season with an average value of 400 mm winter season as shown in fig 9 the total crop water consumptions in the study area were about 86 23 mm3 winter season 48 62 the abstraction of the four water treatment plants was estimated in the water balance by 11 54 mm3 winter season the industrial demands in the study area were neglected where the surface water was used in the cooling process and drain again to the irrigation network elnmer et al 2018 the conveyance losses in the irrigation canals were estimated by 4 92 m³ sec in the study area it represented about 42 97 of the total water consumptions in the study area however the surface run off losses and evaporation losses could not be estimated in the study area due to the lack of field measurements 3 4 assessment of the irrigation efficiency the irrigation efficiency ei was estimated based on the water balance of the district during the winter season from november 2015 to may 2016 the seasonal ei in the center of the nile delta was about 50 05 it is classified as a poor performance i e ei 70 according to the standard irrigation performance molden and gates 1990 this could be attributed to the oversupplies of the irrigation water regarding the crop water consumptions similar results are obtained by khadr et al 2016 where they reported that the seasonally ei in the center of the nile delta was about 45 during the winter season of 2012 hence reducing the conveyance losses should be highly addressed in the water policies in the nile delta to improve the irrigation water performance the monthly water supplies etc and ei in the study area during the winter season from november 2015 to may 2016 are shown in fig 10 the monthly ei was fluctuated due to the variations in the water supplies and crop water requirements according to the growth phases the ei was gradually increased from november 2015 to march 2016 from 39 44 to 60 18 this could be attributed to the high crop water requirements during the growing season where the etc increased from 9 86 to 20 70 mm3 month as shown in fig 10 however the ei was dropped in april and may 2016 resulting values of 42 0 and 39 11 respectively this could be due to the lowest values of the etc during harvesting season the etc experienced the lowest values by 12 61 and 12 13 mm3 month in april and may 2016 respectively 4 conclusions effective water resources management requires an accurate estimation for the water uses and availability to face the water scarcity s challenges particularly in arid and semi arid areas such as egypt therefore in this study the daily and seasonally actual evapotranspiration etc were estimated using 24 landsat 8 images the surface energy balance for land sebal algorithm was used to compute the etc using landsat 8 images and the meteorological data the etc derived from sebal algorithm was validated through a comparison the etc derived from fao penman monteith formula under the same conditions results showed that the sebal algorithm with landsat 8 images are efficient tools in estimating the daily and seasonal etc in the nile delta with reasonable accuracy the water balance in the central part of the nile delta was then analyzed to assess the irrigation efficiency using the derived etc from sebal algorithm the calculated water balance for the study area revealed that the major portion of the water supplies was consumed by crops 86 23 mm3 season 48 62 the results strongly displayed that the irrigation efficiency was quite low 50 05 and classified as poor performance moreover the conveyance losses in the irrigation canals were relatively high 42 97 hence future efforts are needed to save much irrigation water from the conveyance losses in the center of the nile delta moreover irrigation water policies in the nile delta should focus on using a consistent methodology across years to have a sustainable irrigation management

11212,the rapid escalation in water demands for agriculture domestic and industry sectors requires skillful management of this limited resource globally the agriculture sector is considered the main user of the water resource actual evapotranspiration etc is an important tool in determining the water requirements of different crops therefore precise estimation of the etc is the major parameter in the water balance of arid and semi arid agriculture regions such as egypt recently both remote sensing and geographical information systems gis become the main techniques that can be efficiently used for estimating the etc on regional and global coverage the main goal of this study was to estimate the daily and seasonally etc over the nile delta using remote sensing techniques these techniques were surface energy balance for land sebal algorithm with 24 landsat 8 images additionally fao penman monteith method was used to validate the derived etc from sebal algorithm under the same conditions using several performance criteria to assess the performance of the sebal algorithm with landsat 8 in estimating the etc over the nile delta the results revealed that the sebal algorithm with landsat 8 images appears to provide an acceptable estimation of the spatial and temporal distributions of etc over the nile delta with acceptable accuracy with r2 97 83 rmse about 0 469 mm day and 15 9 nrmse the derived etc from sebal algorithm was then used to estimate the water balance and the irrigation efficiency of the study area results of water balance estimates revealed that most of the seasonal etc 93 was originally met by surface water and groundwater supplies however the remaining portion 7 was particularly met by precipitation furthermore the estimated irrigation efficiency was about 48 6 in the central portion of the nile delta overall the performance of the derived etc from sebal algorithm compared to available ground datasets demonstrates the potential of using the sebal algorithm with landsat 8 images for water use and water balance estimates within the nile delta keywords actual evapotranspiration sebal landsat 8 water balance nile delta 1 introduction actual evapotranspiration etc is a critical component of water balance at local field farm catchment and basin and global levels from an agricultural point of view the etc determines the amount of water to be applied through irrigation most hydrologic models and agricultural management applications require accurate estimation of the etc the etc is defined by the processes whereby water is lost through evaporation from the soil surface and through transpiration from the plants doorenbos 1984 running et al 2017 the transpiration of plants represents the main portion of the etc process the remaining portion of the etc is taken place due to the evaporation from soil and water surfaces liu et al 2003 the processes of evaporation and transpiration are existing simultaneously and there is no direct accurate way to separate the two processes ding et al 2013 there are several methods to estimate the etc which can be generally classified as empirical methods thornthwaite 1948 blaney 1952 surface energy balance methods and combination methods which combine the empirical methods with the surface energy balance methods penman 1948 allen et al 1998b nouri et al 2013b these methods vary in terms of the required data and the accuracy of the estimated etc the empirical methods are mainly used for the etc estimation based on point measurements they provide undesirable overestimation or underestimation values of the etc elhag et al 2011 furthermore the applications of these methods have some limitations such as time and cost involved in the daily obtaining and processing the required meteorological data moreover the number of stations where reliable meteorological data is generally limited droogers and allen 2002 fao penman monteith formula is considered the most common empirical method for the etc estimation in agriculture allen et al 1998b allen 2000 satellite imagery recently provides a dependable basis for various computational models that perform the etc estimation based on the surface energy balance mao and wang 2017 the estimated etc by satellite images is very useful for evaluating crop water requirements and the water balance at regional and subfields scales senay et al 2016 pinter et al 2003 furthermore satellite imagery and airborne images are considered the most efficient and economic techniques for the etc estimates in large areas allen et al 2011 the surface energy balance methods can be used to estimate the etc based on the residual concept calcagno et al 2007 the residual concept was used for several algorithms such as surface energy balance index sebi simplified surface energy balance system ssebs surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution and with internalized calibration metric and two source energy balance tseb the sebi algorithm can be efficiently used to estimate the etc however it requires plenty of ground based measurements menenti and choudhury 1993 the ssebs algorithm requires several parameters to estimate the etc under extreme temperatures su 2002 additionally it does not require ground base measurements roerink et al 2000 the tseb algorithm needs several ground based measurements to include the view geometry in the etc estimation tang et al 2011 the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal can be used to estimate the etc using the meteorological data however the input data for the sebal algorithm are largely varied which provide uncertainties to the etc estimates the modified and developed version of the sebal algorithm namely metric algorithm is appropriate for sloped areas liou and kar 2014 the sebal and metric algorithms have an internal calibration of the sensible heat computations it eliminates the need for atmospheric corrections for the surface temperature and reflectance measurements the internal calibration can undoubtedly reduce the impacts of the biases in the aerodynamic stability corrections tasumi et al 2005 the sebal algorithm was originally developed and successfully applied for the water uses estimates in spain and egypt bastiaanssen et al 1998 furthermore it requires minimum ground based measurements and can be successfully applied for the etc estimation in arid regions like egypt additionally the areas in the nile delta are mainly plain where the sebal algorithm can be efficiently applied estimation of the etc by combining both the meteorological data and remotely sensed data has been widely investigated nouri et al 2016 najmaddin et al 2017 meteorological data i e solar radiation wind speed and temperature are particularly used to estimate the reference evapotranspiration eto allen et al 1998b nouri et al 2013a calculated the crop coefficient kc depending on the growing stage using remote sensing techniques afterthought the etc was estimated by multiplying the eto by the kc additionally the etc can be predicted using a method which depends on soil vegetation atmosphere transfer savt model without using remote sensing techniques however olioso olioso et al 2005 reported that combining svat models with remote sensing techniques for the etc estimation is more efficient water demand in egypt is rapidly increasing due to the incredibly rapid growth of population the agriculture sector in egypt which represents the backbone of its economy consumes more than 85 of available water resources moreover about 45 of total agriculture water is depleted due to the etc elnmer et al 2015 khadr et al 2016 therefore efficient water resources management is the main priority to optimize the beneficial use of these resources to satisfy all the demands mwri 2010 el din 2013 the aim of the study is to 1 estimate the daily and seasonal etc over the nile delta using sebal algorithm with landsat 8 images 2 evaluate the performance of sebal algorithm with landsat 8 in the etc estimation using independent dataset which contains 21 ground truth points distributed over the study area and 3 estimate the water balance and irrigation efficiency based on the modeled etc for a pilot study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the methodology presented in this paper was implemented in the nile delta which represents 2 4 of the total area of egypt the study area is located between latitudes of 31 45 30 00ʹ n and longitudes of 30 00ʹ 32 00ʹ e as shown in fig 1 moreover about 49 of total inhabitant are concentrated and settled in this area where the agriculture and industry are the main activities as shown in fig 1 el kawy et al 2011 the climate in general is an arid mediterranean type and the coastal zone of the study area is characterized by relatively very low rainfall with an average amount of about 200 mm year which is used in the rain fed agriculture additionally the rainfall decreases from the north of the nile delta to the south to reach almost zero in the far south the old and new lands in the nile delta are mainly flat fertile the old lands represent about 93 of the total areas of the nile delta and being characterized by alluvial soils and irrigated by traditional systems kotb et al 2000 new lands are located in the west and east sides of the nile delta where the sprinkler and drip irrigation techniques are used wheat and clover crops dominate the crops in the winter season which extends from october to may summer crops are mainly rice and maize and the season extends from may to october elnmer et al 2015 the winter season consist of three seasons i e beginning growing and harvesting seasons the beginning season extents from november to december while the growing season extents from january to march the harvesting season runs from april to may 2 2 data set 2 2 1 satellite data in this study various datasets were used from various sources ranging from field records to remotely sensed images for the nile delta these datasets were metrological data landsat 8 images and field data about crops type and water supplies and demands in the study area the metrological data include temperature wind speed relative humidity rh surface pressure and precipitation sebal algorithm requires satellite images and meteorological data to calculate the etc at a regional scale a total of 24 cloud free 10 clouds landsat 8 images were used in the sebal algorithm for the nile delta during the winter season 2015 2016 landsat images which have been extensively used for water resource applications consists of an operational land imager oli and thermal infrared sensor tirs olioso et al 2005 serbina and miller 2014 the operational land imager oli has nine spectral bands to be able to collect the desired image moreover it has a sufficient resolution of 15 30 meter to distinguish different land uses du et al 2014 the thermal infrared sensor tirs is the tool to measure the thermal bands of 10 and 11 however the estimated errors for the tirs were 0 29 and 0 51 w m2 sr mm respectively montanaro et al 2014 table 1 summarizes landsat 8 data which were used in this study the region of the nile delta was covered by four satellite images for one satellite overpass these images have specific paths and rows according to their geographic locations landsat 8 overpasses the same point every 16 days hence for one month there are two landsat 8 images with 30 m resolution for this study one image was selected every month according to the cloud ratio for one month the four images for the region of the nile delta were captured in a different day so the daily etc map must be analyzed separately fig 1 illustrates the four images and their represented regions where 1 and 2 represent the south of the nile delta while 3 and 4 indicate the coastal area moreover table 2 illustrates the differences between the regions in terms of their location climate conditions and irrigation techniques 2 2 2 meteorological data regarding field data the meteorological data were collected from four weather stations located in the study area as shown in fig 1 these data were temperature maximum minimum and average wind speed relative humidity rh surface pressure precipitation and solar radiation which were recorded hourly for the nile delta during the winter season 2015 2016 additionally the required data for water balance estimation water supplies and demands in the study area were obtained from the egyptian ministry of water resources and irrigation mwri 2 3 sebal algorithm the processes of sebal algorithm produces many maps like net surface radiation rn soil heat flux g and sensible heat flux to the air h using the satellite images meteorological data the final map of the sebal algorithm is a spatial distribution of the etc bastiaanssen et al 1998 the derived etc from the sebal algorithm were estimated using a series of computations for rn g and h it is calculated as a residual of the surface energy balance equation as shown in eq 1 the rn was calculated using eq 2 1 rn g h λetc 2 rn 1 α rs rl rl 1 ε rl where α is

lai were used to calculate the ε after that the near surface temperature ts and the rl were estimated based on the ε li et al 2005 the inputs for the g module are the rn ts ndvi and α as shown in eq 3 the main equation for the h estimation is eq 4 3 g rn ts α 0 0038 α 0 0074 α² 1 0 98 ndvi4 4 h ρ cp dt rah where ρ is the air density kg m3 cp is the air specific heat 1004 j kg k dt k is the

the momentum roughness length zom subsequently the zom was used to calculate the friction velocity u the u was used to calculate the wind speed at a height of 200 m the rah was estimated based on the modified u the rah was corrected for the weather instability using five iterations and the monin obukhov length formula venkatram 1980 two anchor pixels hot and cold pixels were selected and their etc g and rn were used to estimate the h the dt and ts were estimated to establish a regression model for each pixel in the study area thereafter the instantaneous evapotranspiration etinst was calculated by eq 5 the daily etc etc 24 was computed by eq 6 5 etinst 3600 λetc λ where λ is the latent heat of vaporization j kg 6 etc 24 etr f eto 24 where eto 24 is the cumulative 24 hour eto for the day of the image etr f is the evapotranspiration fraction which is defined as the ratio between the etinst mm hr to the eto mm hr abrishamkar and ahmadi 2017 e t r f is relatively constant throughout the day so it is considered the same as the 24 hour average fig 2 shows the schematic diagram for estimating the etc using sebal algorithm and an application of the water balance and irrigation efficiency estimates in the center of the nile delta 2 4 validation of the sebal algorithm performance the eto was estimated using the fao penman monteith formula and the collected metrological data for the nile delta during the winter season 2015 2016 allen et al 1998a the daily et c of twenty one wheat fields were estimated based on eq 7 during the growing and harvesting seasons 7 e t c e t o k c where kc is the crop factor which depends on the crop growth phase type and the climate conditions the simulated daily etc of the wheat fields using the sebal algorithm etc sat was compared with the values

and the correlation coefficient cr cole and tillman 2001 willmott and matsuura 2005 khadr 2016 however the validation of the sebal algorithm at regional and seasonal scales could not be performed in this study due to the limitation of the field data about the spatial distribution of the crops type in the four regions of the nile delta the efficiency nse proposed by nash and sutcliffe lehner et al 2001 is defined as one minus the sum of the absolute squared differences between the etc sat and etc fao values normalized by the variance of the etc fao values during the period under investigation

a z test for the means was employed in the analysis the z test had two hypothesizes i e the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis the null hypothesis was that the mean from the etc fao and etc sat are equal while the alternative hypothesis was that there is a significant difference between the mean from the etc fao and etc sat 2 5 assessment of the water balance and irrigation efficiency the derived etc from the sebal algorithm and satellite images was implemented in the estimates of the water balance and irrigation efficiency for a district located in the central portion of the nile delta egypt during the winter season 2015 2016 the district is located between latitude of 30 43ʹ43 75ʺ 30 57ʹ40ʺ n and longitudes of 30 54ʹ42 15ʺ 31 1ʹ37 35ʺ e with an area of 215 775 km² the water balance in the central part of the nile delta consists of three terms water supplies water demands and water losses the water supplies in the study area are the surface water from main and branch canals followed by small amounts of groundwater and rainfall the data about surface water supplies were collected from the mwri moreover the rainfall data were collected from the weather station in the study area the water supplies satisfy the water demands of the domestic and the agriculture sectors however the water consumption of the industrial sector in the study area is almost negligible khadr et al 2016 the domestic water requirements were met by four water treatment plants in the study area with a daily consumption of 62 030 m3 day khadr et al 2016 the water demands of the agriculture sector are expressed by the crop water consumptions the crop water consumptions in the study area were estimated using the derived etc from sebal algorithm the water losses can be categorized into surface run off losses conveyance losses and percolation losses surface runoff losses and percolation losses could not be assessed in the study area due to the lack of field measurements the conveyance losses was estimated in this study as described earlier by khadr khadr et al 2016 furthermore the evaporation losses from the soil and water surfaces were included in the etc estimation liu et al 2003 thereafter the irrigation efficiency ei was estimated based on the water balance calculations in the study area during the winter season 2015 2016 the ei is the ratio between the etc sat to the surface water and groundwater supplies it depends on the water allocation crop type and metrological data i e temperature precipitation wind speed etc 3 results and discussion 3 1 sebal algorithm results 3 1 1 daily actual evapotranspiration etc daily etc represents the most important process for the determination of the surface and mass energy interaction for both water resources management and agriculture practices sellers et al 1996 however the etc is regionally and daily varied based on the environmental and climatic conditions in terms of temperature humidity and wind speed su et al 2003 understanding the temporal and spatial variations of the etc is essential to efficiently manage the limited water resources in the nile delta figs 3 a f show the daily distribution of the derived etc from sebal algorithm along the nile delta during the winter season starting from november 2015 to may 2016 the sebal algorithm results showed that the etc was quite low and highly varied from 1 3 to 3 0 mm day during november 2015 as shown in fig 3 a this was mainly due to the existing of unplanted areas and the vegetation cover was temporarily absent during the beginning season bastiaanssen et al 2009 this was not the case in december 2015 to april 2016 where the simulated etc was slightly increased and ranged from 1 85 to 3 56 mm day in december 2015 fig 3b due to the growth of plants in the growing season the etc was largely increased and varied from 2 5 to 4 2 mm day and from 2 8 to 4 5 mm day in february and march 2016 respectively as shown in fig 3 c and d nevertheless the etc was significantly dropped in the harvesting season it ranged from 1 5 to 4 2 mm day in april 2016 and from 0 5 to 2 3 mm day in may 2016 as shown in fig 3 e and f 3 1 2 seasonal actual evapotranspiration the sebal algorithm was efficiently used for assessing the seasonal etc distribution along the nile delta as shown in fig 4 the results showed that the seasonal etc was quite low and amounted to 0 81 mm season in the far west alexandra governorate where most of the new reclaimed lands exist this could be attributed to the using of the drip and sprinkler irrigation techniques which affect adversely on the etc the situation of the seasonal etc in the center of the nile delta is fully different as shown in fig 4 the etc was varied from 81 to 200 mm season due to the high abstraction of the groundwater which substantially reduced the etc these results are consistent with chen et al 2014 who found that the groundwater abstraction could significantly affect the etc the moderate seasonal etc was recorded in the east port said governorate and west el behira governorate as shown in fig 4 however the seasonal etc was substantially increased and varied from 430 to 700 mm season in the far east where the aquaculture practices are the most activities of the region and the presence of the water bodies the water bodies have high evaporation rates compared to the cultivated areas these results are comparable with those obtained by bastiaanssen pelgrum et al 2009 who used the sebal algorithm to calculate the daily and seasonally etc for the center of the nile delta during 2008 2009 they reported that the highest and lowest values of the etc were in july 2008 2009 and december 2008 2009 respectively the tirs banding artifacts in the satellite images were observed in fig 4 which should be avoided to provide an accurate estimation for the etc this problem was due to the tirs stray light problem in the landsat 8 satellite it started after launching of the landsat 8 satellite in march 2013 and several approaches have been pursued to correct the tirs stray light but they are in the early exploratory stages montanaro et al 2014 fig 5 shows the frequency distribution of the seasonal etc which was derived from the sebal algorithm the results revealed that the etc of 274 mm season was taken place in the most of the nile delta this strongly indicates that the crops in these areas consumed moderate irrigation water quantities during the growing season the high values of the etc in fig 5 were due to the presence of tirs stray light in the satellite images moreover inaccurate classification of the aquatic plants on the water surface in the far east of the nile delta resulted in the high values of the etc higher results were obtained by elhag et al 2011 who found that the frequency distribution of the daily etc over the nile delta exceeded 2 5 mm day in august 2007 this was attributed to the temperature differences between the summer and winter seasons in the nile delta which significantly influence the etc fig 6 illustrates the derived monthly etc from sebal algorithm and the rainfall over the study area during the winter season 2015 2016 the results showed that about 93 of the etc was met by the surface water and groundwater whereas the remaining portion of 7 was gained from the rainfall the rainfall was a maximum of 13 91 mm month in november 2015 followed by 10 51 mm month in february 2016 there was no rainfall in april and may 2016 as shown in fig 6 moreover the etc was maximized at a level of 123 75 mm month in march 2016 due to the growth of the plants in the growing season however the etc was quite low in april and may 2016 86 25 and 84 mm month respectively which was due to the harvesting season a similar trend was observed in the beginning season where the etc was 73 13 mm month in november 2015 3 1 3 regional actual evapotranspiration etc the daily etc temperature t and precipitation p over the four regions of the nile delta were extensively assessed in fig 7 the meteorological data i e t and p highly fluctuated from region 1 to 2 3 and 4 this spatial variation has significant influences on the etc in the nile delta allen et al 1998a reported that the main factors affecting the etc are the t and p additionally the irrigation techniques and water availability would influence the etc the flooding irrigation technique could increase the etc while the sparkling and dripping irrigation techniques would adversely affect the etc dehghanisanij and kosari 2011 the etc was slightly decreased from 3 0 to 2 8 mm day in regions 1 and 2 respectively in november 2015 this could be attributed to the decrease in the t from region 1 to 2 19 to 17 respectively and the existing of the p events in region 2 a similar trend was observed in march 2016 the etc and t decreased from 4 5 to 4 2 mm day and from 21 to 20 c in regions 1 and 2 respectively in march 2016 additionally the p in region 2 was 3 0 mm however the etc was quite high in march regarding november by a value of 50 due to the growth of crops and prevailed high t in the regions 1 and 2 respectively as shown in fig 7 the etc significantly dropped in region 2 by a value of 50 in april as compared to region 1 where the temperature fluctuated highly between 20 and 25 this can be attributed to the p event in region 2 by 5 0 mm the etc decreased in may 2016 and amounted to 3 1 2 0 mm day in regions 1 and 2 respectively as shown in fig 5 additionally the t decreased from 24 to 19 in absence of the p 0 0 mm in regions 1 and 2 respectively the situation for coastal areas regions 3 and 4 was extremely different where the etc was low in the north of the nile delta regarding the south this could be attributed to continuous precipitation events and the low temperatures in the north of the nile delta similar results were obtained by el shirbeny et al 2014 who estimated the daily etc and observed that the etc values increase from the north to the south of the nile delta they concluded that the increases in the t and the decreases in the relative humidity were the main deriving factors for the etc spatial variation the results in fig 7 revealed that the etc increased from 2 0 to 2 5 mm day in regions 3 and 4 in november and december 2015 respectively this could be attributed to the increase in the t from region 3 to 4 an adverse trend was observed in february 2016 where the etc decreased from 4 0 to 3 2 mm day in regions 3 and 4 respectively this may be due to the decrease in the t from 14 to 11 in addition to the p event in region 4 by 2 09 mm a similar trend was observed in april 2016 where the etc decreased from 3 0 to 2 5 mm day and the t decreased from 19 to 17 in regions 3 and 4 respectively however in march 2016 the t increased from 15 to 16 in regions 3 and 4 respectively and the etc decreased from 4 0 to 3 8 mm day this could be due to the p event in region 4 by 2 03 mm 3 2 validation of the sebal algorithm performance the derived etc from the sebal algorithm etc sat was validated at field scale using field data of the etc etc fao to assess the capability of the sebal algorithm in estimating of the etc over the nile delta it can be clearly seen from table 4 that the sebal model performs satisfactory and the overall evaluation results are fairly good from the r 2 rmse cr nse and nrmse viewpoints a significant positive correlation cr with 0 98 was detected between the etc fao and etc sat additionally the large value of r2 fig 8 is an indication of a perfect relationship between the etc fao and etc sat values according to eq 8 the range of nse lies between 1 0 perfect fit and high values of nse is an indication of a more efficient model however values of nse in the range of 0 indicate unacceptable performance the value of nse which is presented in table 4 is greater than 0 9 which indicates that etc sat has a perfect fit for the etc fao the rmse indicate that the etc sat values were close to the values of the etc fao with 0 469 mm day error moreover the nrmse was 15 98 which indicate that the etc sat values fit the values of the etc fao the validation process was performed using 21 fields of wheat crop hence the validation results were high due to the insignificant differences between the etc of different wheat fields similar results were obtained by dos santos et al 2010 where the derived etc from sebal algorithm had a good agreement with the field data of the etc with 95 accuracy in brazil additionally du et al 2013 reported that the daily etc from sebal algorithm was misestimating at an average range of 10 52 with the field data from the eddy covariance system in the sanjiang plain northeast china the value of the test static p almost equals 0 0 as shown in table 4 which indicates that z test does not reject the null hypothesis that the etc fao and etc sat come from a distribution with the same mean at a significance level of 5 in addition all calculated z values are located between z critical values 1 96 for two tailed at a 5 significance level 3 3 assessment of the water balance the water balance for a district in the center of the nile delta was analyzed to assess the irrigation water performance during the winter season from november 2015 to may 2016 the district is located at a latitude of 30 43ʹ 30 57ʹ n and a longitude of 30 54ʹ 31 1ʹ e as shown in fig 9 the water balance for the district in the center of the nile delta is shown in table 3 the surface water supplies were about 171 87 mm3 season and represented about 96 91 of the total water supplies in the study area it is controlled by the mwri to satisfy the domestic and agricultural water demands however the rainfall was about 3 09 of total water supplies this was due to the aridity of the study area the water supplies meet the agricultural demand according to the crop water requirements hence the summer season has higher surface water supplies than the winter season where the rice is the dominated crop in the summer crop pattern the agricultural water demand was represented by the crop water consumptions it was the largest water consumer in the study area the crop water consumptions were estimated by the derived seasonal etc from the sebal algorithm the seasonal etc was largely varied from 125 to 650 mm winter season with an average value of 400 mm winter season as shown in fig 9 the total crop water consumptions in the study area were about 86 23 mm3 winter season 48 62 the abstraction of the four water treatment plants was estimated in the water balance by 11 54 mm3 winter season the industrial demands in the study area were neglected where the surface water was used in the cooling process and drain again to the irrigation network elnmer et al 2018 the conveyance losses in the irrigation canals were estimated by 4 92 m³ sec in the study area it represented about 42 97 of the total water consumptions in the study area however the surface run off losses and evaporation losses could not be estimated in the study area due to the lack of field measurements 3 4 assessment of the irrigation efficiency the irrigation efficiency ei was estimated based on the water balance of the district during the winter season from november 2015 to may 2016 the seasonal ei in the center of the nile delta was about 50 05 it is classified as a poor performance i e ei 70 according to the standard irrigation performance molden and gates 1990 this could be attributed to the oversupplies of the irrigation water regarding the crop water consumptions similar results are obtained by khadr et al 2016 where they reported that the seasonally ei in the center of the nile delta was about 45 during the winter season of 2012 hence reducing the conveyance losses should be highly addressed in the water policies in the nile delta to improve the irrigation water performance the monthly water supplies etc and ei in the study area during the winter season from november 2015 to may 2016 are shown in fig 10 the monthly ei was fluctuated due to the variations in the water supplies and crop water requirements according to the growth phases the ei was gradually increased from november 2015 to march 2016 from 39 44 to 60 18 this could be attributed to the high crop water requirements during the growing season where the etc increased from 9 86 to 20 70 mm3 month as shown in fig 10 however the ei was dropped in april and may 2016 resulting values of 42 0 and 39 11 respectively this could be due to the lowest values of the etc during harvesting season the etc experienced the lowest values by 12 61 and 12 13 mm3 month in april and may 2016 respectively 4 conclusions effective water resources management requires an accurate estimation for the water uses and availability to face the water scarcity s challenges particularly in arid and semi arid areas such as egypt therefore in this study the daily and seasonally actual evapotranspiration etc were estimated using 24 landsat 8 images the surface energy balance for land sebal algorithm was used to compute the etc using landsat 8 images and the meteorological data the etc derived from sebal algorithm was validated through a comparison the etc derived from fao penman monteith formula under the same conditions results showed that the sebal algorithm with landsat 8 images are efficient tools in estimating the daily and seasonal etc in the nile delta with reasonable accuracy the water balance in the central part of the nile delta was then analyzed to assess the irrigation efficiency using the derived etc from sebal algorithm the calculated water balance for the study area revealed that the major portion of the water supplies was consumed by crops 86 23 mm3 season 48 62 the results strongly displayed that the irrigation efficiency was quite low 50 05 and classified as poor performance moreover the conveyance losses in the irrigation canals were relatively high 42 97 hence future efforts are needed to save much irrigation water from the conveyance losses in the center of the nile delta moreover irrigation water policies in the nile delta should focus on using a consistent methodology across years to have a sustainable irrigation management

11213,diversity in the knowledge mindset strategies and tools that growers use to manage irrigation and fertilizer nitrogen culminates in diversity in profitability and environmental impact among farms as growers academia and industry strive together to tackle the technological and non technological challenges impeding better irrigation and fertilizer nitrogen management a science based evaluation of grower input amount and timing becomes an important initial step in the process providing such valuable feedback to growers is a high priority objective for the university of nebraska lincoln testing ag performance solutions unl taps farm management competition in this competition each team of mostly growers made management decisions for field corn in three replicated plots within the same field at the west central research and extension center in north platte ne and vied for maximum profitability and most judicious input management the 2017 dataset affirmed existing theory predicting that many efficiency indices strictly decrease in value with increasing seasonal input amount and thus would fail to point towards an appropriate input level furthermore grain yield was heavily affected by cultivar choice so efficiency indices that depend on yield actually obscured rather than facilitated the evaluation of irrigation and fertilizer nitrogen management an alternate evaluation approach is to compare a grower s seasonal input amount or input temporal distribution against an appropriate range enveloped by university recommendations on the high end and observed yield limiting thresholds on the low end where irrigation and fertilizer nitrogen are relatively inexpensive and where producing near maximum yield is optimal this approach is suitable for analyzing an input in isolation and for analyzing multiple inputs simultaneously keywords efficiency evaluation irrigation nitrogen requirement unl taps 1 introduction increasing crop production while limiting adverse environmental impacts is a widely stated goal in agricultural science and more judicious application of inputs is regarded as one primary means of achieving this goal excessive input application relative to crop requirements not only can decrease farm profits but also can degrade the environment excessive irrigation can unsustainably deplete groundwater and streamflow whereas excessive fertilizer nitrogen can waste fossil fuels generate additional greenhouse gases and contaminate surface water and groundwater thus much research has occurred to develop scientific methods to better match the amount and timing of input availability to the amount and timing of crop demand examples of such methods include crop coefficients kc soil moisture sensors and infrared thermometry for irrigation taghvaeian et al 2012 bartlett et al 2015 rudnick et al 2015 singh et al 2018 and include soil testing tissue sampling controlled release formulations and active optical sensors for fertilizer nitrogen ferguson 2015 thompson et al 2015 although the science and engineering of many methods can be further refined arguably the greatest barriers to further improving on farm input management are not technological adopting one of these methods effectively on a farm can be extremely challenging due to non technological reasons alone growers would need to become convinced about the need to improve input management become informed about the tools available become comfortable with using a subset of one or more tools and become successful in integrating that subset of tools into their operations this process often necessitates substantial time knowledge money and mindset changes while extension will not enable growers to bypass this process one of the ways extension can ease this process is by providing quantitative evaluation of input management to inform growers learning by doing growers usually notice their crop yield and farm profitability but may be less aware of the quality of their input management input management evaluation would identify how each grower can improve the amount and or timing of irrigation and fertilizer nitrogen this objective information would then become a starting point for in depth discussion among growers industry and university staff on how mentalities technologies and strategies can be revised for future years however the evaluation of grower decisions may need to differ from that of highly controlled experiments first ideal evaluation methods must consider both irrigation and nitrogen management because the two inputs are tightly linked and contribute jointly to crop performance second ideal evaluation methods must be flexible enough to handle the countless ways growers may vary the amount and timing of irrigation and fertilizer nitrogen third ideal evaluation methods must be resistant to cultivar effects this paper examines methods for evaluating the amount and timing of irrigation and fertilizer nitrogen through an on station farm management competition dataset efficiency indices numerical ratios of crop output over crop input may be the first method that comes to mind but not all conventional efficiency indices prove to be suitable for this purpose two new sets of efficiency indices and a requirement range approach are therefore proposed in response to the shortcomings of conventional efficiency indices finally the paper further discusses the general applicability of these methods to various contexts 2 methods 2 1 background the university of nebraska lincoln testing ag performance solutions taps taps unl edu program hosted a farm management competition in 2017 where growers competed for maximum profitability and optimal input irrigation and fertilizer nitrogen management there were a total of fifteen teams where each team grower or group of growers made irrigation fertilizer planting marketing and insurance decisions for a 1214 ha farm simulated by plots at the unl west central research and extension center in north platte ne in a zero risk setting the teams were able to try technologies and strategies hands on and had various opportunities to learn with from peers industry and university staff regarding technological and non technological challenges of input management the centralized location facilitated the collection of diverse measurements the comparison between contestant farms and the hosting of in depth field day workshops each contestant team was randomly assigned three replicate 0 05 ha plots inside a no till irrigated field following soybean preplant fertilizer was applied on 4 may by a double coulter liquid applicator dribbling urea ammonium nitrate uan 32 0 0 at a depth of 0 02 m and at a distance of 0 13 m from the center of the crop row on both sides hybrid field corn zea mays was planted 0 05 m deep on 9 may with 0 76 m row spacing at rates of 69 200 to 85 300 seeds ha 1 as decided by each contestant team sidedress fertilizer was applied on 12 june v5 growth stage by the same liquid applicator dribbling uan 32 0 0 at a depth of 0 02 m and at a distance of 0 19 m from the center of the crop row on both sides all teams had two opportunities per week to irrigate up to 25 mm irrigation was applied using a variable rate center pivot with solenoid valves to pulse pairs of sprinklers independently the sprinkler package was low pressure stationary spray heads at 0 6 m height in alternate interrows i e 1 5 m sprinkler spacing additionally all teams had four opportunities during the growing season to fertigate up to 34 kg ha 1 of nitrogen all fertilizer nitrogen rates in this paper refers to the mass of nitrogen and not the mass of fertilizer product the application dates were 29 june 13 july 20 july and 2 august v9 v14 r1 and r2 growth stages fertigation was applied through the center pivot using a variable rate injection pump that maintains the system concentration of uan 32 0 0 even as the irrigation system flow rate changed silking and physiological maturity were generally reached on 20 july and 10 october respectively a killing frost also occurred on the morning of 10 october which ended the growing season for all farms the 2017 growing season in north platte was characterized by relatively long alternating periods of high and low evaporative demand fig 1 minimal rainfall occurred during the periods of high evaporative demand while the transitions from high to low evaporative demand were abrupt and began with heavy rainfall the periods of high evaporative demand were the first half of may early june to late july and late august to late september the periods of low evaporative demand were the second half of may late july to late august and late september to early october 2 2 data collection locally calibrated 503 elite hydroprobe neutron moisture meters campbell pacific nuclear concord ca were used to determine the crop evapotranspiration et in each plot during the growing season on 12 measurement dates a 15 s neutron count was measured at depths of 0 15 0 46 0 76 1 07 1 37 and 1 68 m in one tube per plot crop et between two measurement dates can be directly calculated from the change in total water over the 1 83 m profile whenever runoff and deep percolation are negligible this assumption was deemed appropriate for the intervals between seven pairs of measurement dates none of these intervals were preceded by or contained heavy rainfall and total runoff during each interval was estimated to be less than 1 mm when conservatively assuming a runoff curve number of 80 that corresponds to poor hydrologic condition nrcs 2004 during each interval crop et equaled precipitation plus irrigation minus change in total water over the 1 83 m profile for each plot a piecewise linear curve in the style of allen et al 1996 of alfalfa reference stressed mean crop coefficients ks kcr as a function of growing degree days was fitted by minimizing the sum of squared differences between observed and modeled crop et during those seven intervals with each difference weighted by the number of days during the interval this approach was chosen because the errors of ks kcr curve fitting were expected to be smaller than the uncertainties in daily water balance parameters for runoff deep percolation and water stress seasonal crop et for each plot was calculated by summing the daily product between kcr and etr to minimize the effect of outliers seasonal crop et for each farm was taken to be the median rather than average seasonal et among the three constituent plots on several dates during the growing season non contact sensors were mounted at 2 9 m height to a custom built tractor mounted boom for collecting canopy measurements in the core of every plot the tractor was driven at 1 m s 1 in both directions along the alleys between strips of plots so that both the left and right sides of the boom passed once over each plot and so that all measurements were collected generally within one hour during the early or mid afternoon the left and right sides of the boom were equipped with the identical set of sensors each set included two si 1h1 infrared thermometers apogee instruments logan ut and one acs 430 active optical sensor holland scientific lincoln ne the infrared thermometers were oriented at 60 from nadir pointed perpendicular with crop rows away from the tractor and sampled once every 3 s the active optical sensor was positioned between crop rows shaver et al 2017 oriented nadir with the longer dimension of the field of view perpendicular with crop rows and sampled once every 0 1 s omitting data from the buffer areas where irrigation and fertilizer nitrogen rates transitioned from those of one plot to those of another plot each set of sensors collected at least 8 canopy temperature measurements and at least 240 canopy reflectance measurements from each plot on each measurement date again to minimize the effect of outliers the canopy temperature and normalized difference red edge ndre vegetation index values for each plot were taken to be the average of the median value according to the left set of sensors and the median value according to the right set of sensors destructive sampling was also performed in each plot the uppermost collared leaf from each of 12 plants per plot was sampled on 13 july 2017 approximately v14 according to the leaf collar system of vegetative growth stages immediately before the second fertigation application on 16 october after physiological maturity the corn ears and the 0 20 m segment of stalk from 0 15 to 0 36 m above the ground were sampled from each of ten plants per plot the grain from those ten plants was separated from the cobs using an electrically powered mechanical sheller leaf nitrogen content stalk nitrate content and grain nitrogen content analyses were conducted by ward laboratories kearney ne on 2 november the grain from the middle 18 m of the center six crop rows in each plot was harvested using a six row combine grain moisture content was measured using the moisture sensor of the yield monitor system inside the combine and wet grain weight was measured using a weigh wagon market grain yield y was normalized to 15 5 grain moisture and grain nitrogen uptake g was calculated as the product of dry grain yield and grain nitrogen content again to minimize the effect of outliers y and g for each farm were taken to be the median y and g among the three constituent plots 2 3 efficiency indices an efficiency index by definition is a ratio of output over input and thus can be represented by a slope i e ratio of rise over run on a graph that plots an output variable on the vertical axis and an input variable on the horizontal axis eight conventional efficiency indices for irrigation and nitrogen management are depicted in figs 2 a f and the corresponding equations equations 1 8 are listed below indices 2 4 were calculated according to rudnick and irmak 2013 indices 5 8 were calculated according to dobermann 2007 but g was substituted for aboveground nitrogen uptake u because the latter was not measured in the 2017 unl taps competition if u was used instead figs 2d e and the associated indices would be more similar to figs 2a b and the associated indices respectively indices 1 3 4 5 7 and 8 were not calculated for the zero input treatment i e nonirrigated and unfertilized farm 7 because the index value would be undefined the line with long grey dashes denotes perfect conversion of irrigation i to evapotranspiration et in figs 2a and 2c whereas it denotes perfect conversion of fertilizer nitrogen f to g in figs 2d and 2f fig 2 shows only the rising and plateau segments of the theoretical water and nitrogen production functions the declining segment of the production functions can be relevant for some combinations of crop cultivar environment and management but is rarely observed under the conditions and input levels observed in the 2017 unl taps competition while this paper focuses on the rising and plateau segments of production functions the analyses and conclusions remain valid on a declining segment irrigation efficiency ie 1 i e e t e t n i where et crop evapotranspiration of the farm under evaluation l etn crop evapotranspiration of the zero input treatment l i gross

component and a management supplied component specifically total water input equaled et of the zero input treatment etn plus i of the farm under evaluation while total nitrogen input equaled u of the zero input treatment un plus f of the farm under evaluation y total water input and total nitrogen input can then be divided by y of the zero input treatment yn etn and un respectively for non dimensionalization one new set of efficiency indices can be calculated as the ratio of dimensionless yield over dimensionless total input these new indices without non dimensionalization would be almost the same as cwue and ne when considering just one input i e water or nitrogen but non dimensionalization is necessary when considering water and nitrogen simultaneously the value of these new indices always equals 1 for the zero input treatment farms that produce more y per unit of total input i e more efficient than the zero input treatment achieve index values exceeding 1 those that produce less y per unit of total input i e less efficient than the zero input treatment achieve index values below 1 another new set of efficiency indices can be calculated as the ratio of dimensionless yield increase i e y yn yn over dimensionless total input the value of these new indices always equals 0 for the zero input treatment all farms that produce more y than the zero input treatment achieve positive index values but the yield increase is discounted by the magnitude of dimensionless total input the first new set of three efficiency indices equations 9 11 and the second new set of three efficiency indices equations 12 14 are depicted in figs 2g i and the corresponding equations are listed below again the line with long grey dashes denotes perfect conversion of i to

assumes the supply of i and f is plentiful enough that producing near maximum y is optimal this assumption is still the reality for the competition site at the time of writing but certainly is not the reality everywhere every year if the physical economic and or legal regulatory scarcity of i and f is so severe that the optimal production is significantly lower than maximum yield the evaluation of input management becomes a much more sophisticated optimization problem that is far beyond the scope of this paper university extension recommendations are typically intended to maximize yield or profit amid uncertainties in weather equipment and information shapiro et al 2008 therefore the input quantity that is applied when following university extension recommendations tends to be larger than the minimum input quantity that is required for producing maximum yield in this paper the higher i and f requirements according to university extension recommendations are denoted as ireq h and freq h respectively on the other hand the lower i and f requirements to prevent narrowly any yield loss due to input deficiencies are denoted as ireq l and freq l respectively for both i and f the seasonal and daily season to date input quantities of the farm under evaluation can be compared with the seasonal and daily season to date higher and lower requirements upon the conclusion of the growing season an input quantity may be deemed appropriate if it falls between the higher and lower requirements and deemed inappropriate otherwise alternatively metrics can be constructed to quantify the seasonal or daily deviation of the farm under evaluation from the center of the range spanned by the higher and lower requirements the first three metrics below equations 15 17 summarize seasonal

fully irrigated by a lateral move system subsequently the company provided the authors with final data from its eddypro processing software after filtering out data points that were either deemed as low quality by eddypro or were corresponding to footprints located outside the field based on wind direction 2265 half hourly latent heat flux values between 27 april and 22 september remained inspection of days with complete data revealed that half hourly solar radiation rs exhibited a strong linear relationship with half hourly crop et to ensure adequate spread in rs to develop linear regression for gap filling crop et the 48 half hour intervals in a day were divided into 3 eight hour bins based on expected clear sky rs among all dates when half hourly rs was available 67 days contained at least one rs versus crop et data point in each of the three bins only for each of these 67 days missing half hourly crop et was estimated from half hourly rs using date specific linear regression average r2 of 0 89 and daily crop et was calculated as the sum of all 48 half hourly crop et values a piecewise linear curve in the style of allen et al 1996 of alfalfa reference mean crop coefficients kcr as a function of growing degree days was fitted by minimizing the sum of squared differences between observed and modeled crop et on those 67 days fig 3 growth stage records were used to fine tune the kcr curve to match observations of crop development from the 2017 unl taps competition the seasonal fully irrigated crop et was modeled to be 641 mm assuming a runoff curve number of 75 that corresponds to good hydrologic condition and assuming 20 mm of irrigation applied at most once every three days whenever soil water depletion exceeded the threshold adapted from unl extension recommendations seasonal ireq h was found to be 220 mm the associated irrigation schedule was used to obtain daily season to date ireq h ireq l for the 2017 unl taps competition was determined by modeling the minimum irrigation that was required to produce maximum yield with the hybrid chosen by the most contestant farms this procedure eliminated the noise that was introduced to the yield versus irrigation data by cultivar differences however the procedure was valid only if the farms with the most popular hybrid and with seasonal irrigation in the vicinity of seasonal ireq l also received f greater than or equal to seasonal freq l which was later verified to be true sufficient spread in seasonal irrigation among the five farms that planted the most popular hybrid dyna gro d53vc55rib enabled the fitting of a quadratic irrigation water production function the vertex of the resultant concave down function corresponded to 150 mm of seasonal irrigation which was chosen as seasonal ireq l daily season to date ireq l was simplistically assumed to be the same as daily season to date ireq h divided by the ratio of seasonal ireq l over seasonal ireq h this assumption is similar to the concept of a limited irrigation treatment whose daily application depths are a fixed percentage of the daily application depths for the fully irrigated treatment rudnick et al 2018 seasonal freq h was determined using the unl nitrogen algorithm shapiro et al 2008 soil samples were collected from the competition site on 6 march and were analyzed by ward laboratories kearney ne the 0 0 2 m depth contained 1 9 organic matter and 8 2 ppm nitrate nitrogen whereas the 0 2 0 9 m depth contained 3 8 ppm nitrate nitrogen with 50 kg ha 1 nitrogen credit for the previous soybean crop and with a yield goal of 15 1 mg ha 1 seasonal freq h was calculated to be 197 kg ha 1 seasonal freq l was determined by modeling the minimum fertilizer nitrogen that was required to produce maximum yield with one hybrid under full irrigation the spread in fertilizer nitrogen for any hybrid in the 2017 unl taps competition was insufficient for curve fitting therefore fertilizer nitrogen production function was taken from an immediately adjacent study where fontanelle 6a327rbc corn following soybean was subjected to nine nitrogen treatments under full irrigation the fitted quadratic plateau model indicated that seasonal freq l was 78 kg ha 1 b t krienke et al unpublished preliminary data 2017 seasonal irrigation and seasonal fertilizer nitrogen for the center of range 185 mm and 137 kg ha 1 respectively was calculated by averaging the corresponding quantities for the higher and lower requirements daily season to date irrigation for the center of range was calculated by averaging the daily season to date irrigation for the higher and lower requirements the authors were unaware of exact definitive guidance on optimal temporal distribution of fertilizer nitrogen for the purpose of illustration the fertilizer nitrogen applications for the center of range were assumed to be 70 kg ha 1 at preplant 34 kg ha 1 at the 1st fertigation opportunity and 34 kg ha 1 at the 3rd fertigation opportunity 3 results and discussion 3 1 input management decisions across the 2017 unl taps competition irrigation spanned a total of three months and was distributed among 21 applications seasonal irrigation ranged from 0 farm 7 zero input treatment to 273 mm farm 15 with a median of 174 mm fig 4 a for ten farms the half month that received the most irrigation or was tied for most irrigation was the 2nd half of july this half month generally coincided with low rainfall high crop evapotranspiration et and high crop sensitivity to water stress fig 1 however the irrigation amount applied during this half month was also the most variable among the contestant farms ranging from 20 to 79 mm the 1st half of august through the 1st half of september in contrast accounted for less than 25 of seasonal irrigation for ten farms the latter half of the 2017 irrigation season generally coincided with high rainfall low crop et and low crop sensitivity to water stress overall the majority of contestant teams appeared to have accounted for such crop and weather factors to some degree in their irrigation management fertilizer nitrogen was distributed among six applications over three months seasonal fertilizer nitrogen ranged from 0 farm 7 zero input treatment to 269 kg ha 1 farm 4 with a median of 202 kg ha 1 fig 4b all contestant farms except the zero input treatment followed the university recommendation to split apply fertilizer nitrogen so that a minimum 30 of the seasonal rate is applied as sidedress and or fertigation shapiro et al 2008 the majority of farms relied on preplant and fertigation as the primary means of fertilizer nitrogen applications at least 40 of the seasonal fertilizer nitrogen was applied as preplant for eight farms as sidedress for three farms and as fertigation for nine farms ignoring the zero input treatment only one farm applied no preplant five farms applied no sidedress and zero farms applied no fertigation all contestant teams appeared to value the ability to apply fertilizer nitrogen during the late vegetative and early reproductive periods via fertigation 3 2 conventional efficiency indices not all hybrids in the 2017 unl taps competition were described by the same production functions here the dyna gro d53vc55rib hybrid not only showed above average yield potential by achieving two of three top farm yields but also produced above average yield given the same seasonal crop et fig 5 a or the same seasonal irrigation fig 5b this hybrid also exhibited above average grain nitrogen content fig 6 a and produced above average yield given the same seasonal fertilizer nitrogen fig 6b differences in production functions among hybrids in turn resulted in differences in the relationships between input quantity and efficiency indices while one distinct curve of efficiency index versus seasonal i or seasonal f could usually be traced when examining the dyna gro d53vc55rib hybrid alone much more scatter was present when examining all farms together figs 5c f and 6c f yield is arguably the variable that would differ most among cultivars under identical input management if all variables were measured perfectly while water and nitrogen availability is undoubtedly important y is also affected by assimilate partitioning stress response physiology and many other characteristics that vary among cultivars in contrast different cultivars generally evapotranspire at similar rates under well watered conditions unless relative maturity peak height or peak leaf area were substantially different allen et al 1996 howell et al 1998 allen and pereira 2009 hao et al 2015 nagore et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 excluding the zero input treatment the 2017 unl taps competition witnessed relative maturity ratings between 108 and 113 according to the seed companies peak height between 2 4 and 3 1 m and peak leaf area above 4 5 m3 m 3 according to an lai 2200c plant canopy analyzer li cor biosciences lincoln ne the optimal amount and timing of irrigation would consequently be expected to be similar among these cultivars even as yield may differ widely the optimal seasonal rate of f admittedly is generally related to yield shapiro et al 2008 yet unless the study design controls for both cultivar and management and thus isolates the two types of effects determining the optimal seasonal rate of f for each cultivar might be impossible so a cultivar blind optimal seasonal rate would need to be assumed therefore a relatively uncontrolled evaluation of input management across cultivars may benefit from focusing on input amount and timing and from avoiding efficiency indices that depend on yield furthermore not all efficiency indices appear to reward appropriate seasonal input quantities theory described in figs 2a and 2c predicts that both irrigation efficiency ie and irrigation water use efficiency iwue decrease monotonically with increasing seasonal i the 2017 unl taps data matches this theory figs 5c and 5f the correlation coefficient between each of these two indices and seasonal i were 0 69 and 0 81 respectively while converting gravity irrigation to pressurized irrigation and improving the temporal distribution of i within a growing season would be constructive means of increasing the values of the two water efficiency indices these two indices provide no meaningful information on optimal seasonal i likewise theory described in figs 2d f predicts that recovery efficiency re internal efficiency ne physiological efficiency pe and agronomic efficiency ae all decrease monotonically with increasing seasonal f the 2017 unl taps data also matches this theory figs 6c f the correlation coefficient between each of these four indices and seasonal f were 0 58 0 58 0 51 and 0 74 respectively while adjusting the timing placement and or product of fertilizer application to improve the spatiotemporal correspondence between nutrient availability and plant uptake would be a constructive means of increasing the values of the four nitrogen efficiency indices these indices provide no meaningful information on optimal seasonal f in conclusion treatments differing only in seasonal i should not be evaluated using ie or iwue and treatments differing only in seasonal f should not be evaluated using re or ae on the other hand theory described in fig 2b predicts that evapotranspiration water use efficiency etwue remains constant and then decreases with increasing seasonal i whereas crop water use efficiency cwue increases and then decreases with increasing seasonal i this theoretical trend of cwue was observed in the 2017 unl taps data fig 5d and makes cwue suitable for evaluating seasonal i because maximum cwue is achieved by applying the minimum seasonal i required for maximum yield a major challenge of widely using cwue is the difficulty of measuring crop et accurately unless the climate of interest is significantly more arid than the competition site and thus allows seasonal crop et to be estimated simply from precipitation irrigation and seasonal change in soil water howell 2001 et determination is generally resource intensive and prone to substantial uncertainties here farm 2 achieved the highest cwue despite applying more seasonal i than farms 1 3 5 and 14 and producing lower y than those four farms this unexpected result is likely caused in part by an underestimation of et for farm 2 by the way if ne was calculated using aboveground nitrogen uptake u instead of g ne would be completely analogous to cwue this version of ne would increase and then decrease with increasing seasonal f and the maximum index value would be achieved by applying the minimum seasonal f required for maximum y similarly a major challenge of widely using this version of ne is the need to sample and analyze the aboveground biomass of enough plants for each farm under evaluation to measure u accurately relying heavily on variables that are difficult to measure accurately is not ideal for evaluating input management two outcomes of water and nitrogen interactions were observed in the 2017 unl taps competition first the values of the ie etwue iwue re pe and ae indices were universally overestimated because a zero input treatment was used as the reference concurrent deficiency in water and nitrogen would decrease crop et g and y by a larger magnitude than would deficiency in one input alone eck 1984 pandey et al 2000a b pandey et al 2000a o neill et al 2004 hernández et al 2015 this phenomenon partly explains why ie values for farms 1 3 and 5 exceeded 100 at the same time the irrigation applied to these three farms would increase leaf area and root growth enabling the plants in these farms not only to use all of the irrigation water but also to extract more stored subsoil moisture than the plants in a non irrigated treatment are able second the apparent relationship between y and f for dyna gro d53vc55rib fig 6b misrepresented the f production function of this hybrid as subsequent analyses will reveal i and not f was the dominant input driving yield differences in the 2017 unl taps competition for dyna gro d53vc55rib increased i caused the apparent y increase with increasing medium rates of f while decreased i caused the apparent y decrease with increasing high rates of f in the absence of such i effects re and ae values of this hybrid would display a larger decrease with increasing medium rates of f and a smaller decrease with increasing high rates of f as compared with what is shown in figs 6c and 6f ne and pe in contrast are noticeably more resilient to i effects because both the numerator and denominator terms of these two indices y and g or u are influenced by i a relatively uncontrolled evaluation of input management must carefully consider all inputs plus all extraneous factors such as hail and pest damage 3 3 new efficiency indices lamentably the two new types of efficiency indices presented herein equations 9 14 also depend on y and are thus as susceptible to cultivar effects as the eight conventional efficiency indices discussed earlier while these two new types of efficiency indices remain general indicators of overall crop performance rather than specific indicators of optimal input management two advantages are noteworthy first the difficult measurements of crop et and u need to be made on the zero input treatment only this advantage greatly facilitates the use of these indices when evaluating many farms second the dimensionless nature of these two new types of efficiency indices enabled the construction of water nitrogen indices water nitrogen indices are not merely more compatible with the use of a zero input treatment that lacks both i and f as the reference more importantly water nitrogen indices have the potential to capture the reality that when both inputs deviate from their respective optimum quantity the consequence is exacerbated multiplicatively excessive i with excessive f compounds nitrate leaching because deep percolation and nitrate concentration are simultaneously high gheysari et al 2009 deficient i with excessive f compounds soil salinization chen et al 2004 and stover nitrate toxicity for livestock rasby et al 2014 excessive or deficient i with deficient f compounds nitrogen stress nitrate is flushed out of the root zone under excessive i rudnick and irmak 2013 whereas passive nitrogen uptake decreases with decreasing root water uptake under deficient i wu and kersebaum 2008 the authors hope that the use of water nitrogen efficiency indices would promote more integrated thinking across the traditionally separate disciplines of irrigation management and fertilizer nitrogen management just like cwue relative water input efficiency rwie and water intensification performance index wipi followed a concave down curve increasing and then decreasing as seasonal i increases in the 2017 unl taps competition fig 7 a and 7d rwie however appears to be maximized at lower seasonal i than wipi these two observations matches the theory described in figs 2g i for the two new types of indices the first new type of index equations 9 11 may represent the priorities of a context where managed inputs are scarcer than land suitable for receiving managed inputs so spreading the available managed input over a larger land area to produce slightly below maximum yield is preferred the second new type of index equations 12 14 may represent the priorities of a context where land suitable for receiving managed inputs is scarcer than managed inputs so producing maximum yield is preferred as discussed later all farms excluding the zero input treatment applied high seasonal rates of f given the conditions of the 2017 unl taps competition consequently these farms fell in the range where relative nitrogen input efficiency rnie and nitrogen intensification performance index nipi decrease monotonically with increasing seasonal f if cultivar effects and i effects were removed figs 7b and 7e such high seasonal rates of f also caused the nitrogen term to be more influential than the water term in relative water nitrogen input efficiency rwnie fig 7c and water nitrogen intensification performance index wnipi fig 7f with the inclusion of lower seasonal rates of f rwnie and wnipi data is expected to increase and then decrease with increasing seasonal input as predicted by theory fig 2i 3 4 input requirement ranges unlike most efficiency indices results from the input requirement range approach are easy to understand and interpret for diverse audiences in the 2017 unl taps competition six contestant farms irrigated under four farms irrigated within and five farms irrigated above the range spanned by the higher and lower seasonal requirements fig 4a on the other hand one contestant farm i e the zero input treatment fertilized under six farms fertilized within if counting farm 9 whose seasonal fertilizer nitrogen was equal to the higher requirement and eight farms fertilized above the range spanned by the higher and lower seasonal requirements fig 4b inferring from the lower requirement six farms including the zero input treatment experienced y loss induced by water stress whereas only the zero input treatment experienced yield loss induced by nitrogen stress yield differences observed in the 2017 unl taps competition that are not attributed to cultivar effects should therefore be primarily attributed to irrigation management and not fertilizer nitrogen management three farms were within the higher and lower seasonal requirements for both i and f two of these farms furthermore ranked in the top three for y and serve as examples of producing high yield without excessive inputs meanwhile four out of the five farms that applied excessive i also applied excessive f the relationship between grower mentality and strategy for irrigation management and grower mentality and strategy for nitrogen management deserves further investigation and may have significant implications for extension efforts while efficiency indices often failed to identify truly optimal seasonal input quantities the input requirement range approach performed this task clearly and reliably the results in turn allow i and f excesses and deficiencies to begin to be detected analyzed and addressed as would be expected in an effective evaluation of input management the input requirement range approach is conducive to evaluating not only the amount but also the timing of input applications the same seasonal input quantity but a different application schedule may lead to significantly different outcomes farms 1 4 6 8 9 and 15 exemplify the diversity in the temporal distribution of irrigation during the 2017 unl taps competition fig 8 for the first half of the irrigation season farms 1 and 15 maintained cumulative irrigation slightly under the lower requirement and slightly above the higher requirement respectively for the second half of the irrigation season farm 1 largely withheld irrigation whereas farm 15 outpaced the higher requirement substantially farms 6 and 9 applied similar seasonal irrigation between the higher and lower requirements but farm 6 postponed its irrigation and finally caught up with farm 9 in early august farms 4 and 8 applied similar seasonal irrigation above the higher requirement but farm 8 applied 36 mm more in july than farm 4 and was not overtaken by farm 4 until late august given the high sensitivity of pollination and kernel setting to water stress farms 1 8 and 9 were prudent to concentrate irrigation in july the time shortly before and during this critical period at least as much as the higher and lower requirements did yet farm 8 irrigated so generously that its cumulative irrigation remained more than 25 mm above the higher requirement for approximately two months almost consecutively which may be leaving too little room in the root zone to hold heavy in season rainfall on the other hand irrigating more frequently than the higher requirement during the latter half of the irrigation season as did farms 6 and 15 was not the most sensible temporal distribution of irrigation for the 2017 unl taps competition while the seasonal metrics equations 15 17 merely conveyed the same information as fig 4 the daily metrics equations 18 20 reflected the aforementioned differences in the timing of input application seasonal i and relative deviation in irrigation rdi of farm 8 were 6 mm and 15 lower respectively than those of farm 4 nevertheless relative root mean squared deviation in irrigation rrmsdi of farm 8 was actually 38 higher than that of farm 4 table 1 because farm 8 diverged much more from the irrigation schedule for the center of the requirement range than did farm 4 between july and august fig 8 seasonal f and relative deviation in fertilizer nitrogen rdf of farm 11 was 1 kg ha 1 and 1 lower respectively than those of farm 3 nonetheless relative root mean squared deviation in fertilizer nitrogen rrmsdf of farm 11 was 26 higher than that of farm 3 because farm 11 diverged much more from the f schedule for the center of the requirement range than did farm 3 farm 11 applied 87 of its seasonal rate as preplant and sidedress but farm 3 as well as the center of range applied roughly half of their respective seasonal rates as preplant and applied the remaining half as fertigation as expected absolute relative deviation in irrigation fertilizer nitrogen ardi f was smallest for the three farms that were within the seasonal requirement range for both irrigation and fertilizer nitrogen it was largest for farm 3 which applied the second lowest seasonal irrigation but the fourth highest seasonal fertilizer nitrogen among all contestant farms and for farm 7 the zero input treatment because farm 8 had a high rrmsdi given its rdi and because farm 11 had a high rrmsdf given its rdf farms 8 and 11 each had a relatively high relative root mean squared deviation in irrigation fertilizer nitrogen rrmsdi f given their respective ardi f plant tissue analyses support the diagnosis by the requirement range approach that high seasonal rates of f were pervasive in the 2017 unl taps competition excluding the three plots of the zero input treatment all but two plots reported stalk nitrate levels in the high category of 2000 ppm no3 n fig 9 b sawyer and mallarino 2018 the observation that the higher requirement for seasonal f was 119 kg ha 1 153 above the lower requirement and also resulted in high stalk nitrate levels highlights the uncertainty in current predictions of f requirements the large discrepancy between the higher and lower requirements may be attributed in part to above average pre season temperatures in 2017 between 7 march i e day after soil nitrate sampling in 2017 and 8 may i e day before planting in 2017 the daily averages of maximum and minimum temperature were 1 4 c higher on average for 2017 than for the 1987 2016 mean hprcc 2018 the higher requirement was based on soil testing and assumptions of average weather conditions so it cannot account for any temperature driven increase in nitrogen mineralization after the soil sampling date given the inability of traditional f recommendation algorithms to adapt to deviations from normality emerging technologies such as in season nitrogen simulation models nitrate specific soil sensors and active optical sensors would be needed to overcome this problem leaf nitrogen tests may be informative as well by the v14 growth stage all contestant farms except the zero input treatment had applied more f than the lower requirement the nitrogen content of the uppermost collared leaf was above 2 7 for every plot of these farms but not for any plot of the zero input treatment fig 9a all methods are associated with some degree of uncertainty and may each experience difficulty distinguishing between deficient sufficient and excessive nitrogen availability under different circumstances thus using an ensemble of multiple methods may be the best means of in season f management thompson et al 2015 there are particular challenges of using emerging technologies for nitrogen management in the presence of multiple stresses for instance active optical sensors may unintentionally respond to both water stress and nitrogen stress normalized difference red edge ndre is a vegetation index that is commonly calculated from red edge and near infrared active reflectance as an indicator of crop nitrogen status shiratsuchi et al 2011 canopy temperature is commonly calculated from infrared thermometer data as an indicator of crop water status idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 yet on two dates around the vt r1 growth stage and on two dates during plant senescence the correlation between ndre and canopy temperature was 0 71 0 80 0 78 and 0 77 respectively for the plots of the 2017 unl taps competition figs 10 a d the key to unfolding this mystery lies in the fact that water stress generally decreases leaf area water stress during the vegetative period reduces leaf expansion indeed correlation between vegetative period irrigation and peak leaf area index was 0 72 for the 2017 unl taps competition water stress during the reproductive period on the other hand accelerates leaf senescence rudnick and irmak 2014 because the active optical sensors were placed between crop rows and were oriented nadir the ndre measurements were sensitive to leaf area even when the canopy would be considered to be effectively closed therefore on the four warm and clear days featured in fig 10 the underirrigated plots showed both low ndre and high canopy temperatures regardless of crop nitrogen status ndre values that have been dragged down by water stress should be used with caution to avoid underestimating crop nitrogen status and overestimating in season f needs research on this subject is ongoing shiratsuchi et al 2011 ward 2015 3 5 applicability the input requirement range approach may be the generally most preferred method to evaluate grower i and f amount and timing from a grower s perspective it is actually better to have a requirement range to stay within rather than a magical i e optimal number to aim for drivers informed by a fuel gauge can decide the amount and timing of their fuel purchases by further considering their driving plan their proximity to filling stations and spatiotemporal predictions of fuel price likewise growers informed by an input requirement range can decide the amount and timing of their input application by further considering their labor availability their equipment capabilities and past and future weather also the ability to analyze temporal distributions is a particularly noteworthy strength producing a graph such as fig 8 for both i and f would summarize the evaluation effectively diagnosing when and how much growers are over or under applying inputs would then initiate conversation about current technological and non technological challenges and how to improve in future seasons the higher requirement for i and f should be easier to establish than the lower requirement the higher requirement for i can be calculated from growth stage kc local weather data start of season soil moisture and university recommendations on soil water depletion the higher requirement for f can be obtained from widely tested university algorithms based on basic information such as soil test results previous crop and y goal as for the lower requirement for i and f a gradient of i levels and a gradient of f levels could be imposed at a centralized location in some environments care would need to be taken to account for the effect of soil moisture and soil nitrogen levels carrying over from one season to the next also if the declining segment of the production functions is present and the plateau segment is short a factorial design would be necessary instead of separate gradients for i and f multiple cultivars could be included if cultivar differences are suspected to influence the lower requirement the higher and lower requirements might be directly applicable across a small non mountainous area perhaps 1000 km2 with similar soil and similar past management yet if the fields under evaluation are spread over a larger area or are more heterogeneous the lower requirement may need to be determined experimentally at multiple locations or extrapolated from one location to other locations using crop models with increasing prevalence of variable rate application technology and improving accuracy of crop models establishing the lower requirement would continue to become easier aspects of the input requirement range approach would benefit from further investigation better understanding of the spatial variability of higher and lower requirements would facilitate the evaluation of multiple fields also although this paper focused on post season evaluations the potential of predicting higher and lower requirements in real time to inform in season decision making deserves greater exploration additionally the most suitable assumptions for each context would need to be discovered for instance this paper evaluated the temporal distribution of i and f in terms of daily season to date cumulative input amounts which relied on the assumption that in season losses were uniformly negligible in regions or seasons where this assumption is false the evaluation may need to be conducted in terms of soil moisture content and soil inorganic nitrogen content instead finally how to best use the results of the input requirement approach in a follow up conversation with growers would need to be learned colleagues are highly encouraged to try assess and adapt the input requirement range approach and then share their experiences through journal publication and or direct correspondence with the authors 4 conclusion efficiency indices have been successfully used to compare agricultural regions parameterize crop models and contrast irrigation systems and fertilizer programs yet among conventional efficiency indices only crop water use efficiency and physiological efficiency if calculated from aboveground nitrogen uptake rather than grain nitrogen uptake are maximized at an apparently optimal input level instead of never increasing with input level alternate efficiency indices presented in this paper capture similar information as crop water use efficiency and physiological efficiency while minimizing the need to make difficult measurements of crop evapotranspiration and aboveground nitrogen uptake nonetheless the alternate indices also depend on yield whose sensitivity to cultivar differences can obscure evaluation of input management overall efficiency indices were found to be less than ideal for evaluation of grower irrigation and fertilizer nitrogen amount and timing in contrast the input requirement range approach proposed in this paper clearly points out when and by how much growers are over or under applying inputs this approach was not only capable of assessing seasonal input quantities but also distinguishing more appropriate and less appropriate temporal distributions that totaled to the same seasonal quantity the input requirement range approach meets the three criteria set forth in the introduction first input management ranges can consider both irrigation and nitrogen management when aiming for near maximum yield second input management ranges are flexible to any temporal distribution of irrigation and fertilizer because it can analyze on a daily weekly monthly or seasonal time step third input management ranges are relatively resistant to cultivar effects because the evaluation does not directly depend on yield therefore the input requirement range approach is especially recommended

11213,diversity in the knowledge mindset strategies and tools that growers use to manage irrigation and fertilizer nitrogen culminates in diversity in profitability and environmental impact among farms as growers academia and industry strive together to tackle the technological and non technological challenges impeding better irrigation and fertilizer nitrogen management a science based evaluation of grower input amount and timing becomes an important initial step in the process providing such valuable feedback to growers is a high priority objective for the university of nebraska lincoln testing ag performance solutions unl taps farm management competition in this competition each team of mostly growers made management decisions for field corn in three replicated plots within the same field at the west central research and extension center in north platte ne and vied for maximum profitability and most judicious input management the 2017 dataset affirmed existing theory predicting that many efficiency indices strictly decrease in value with increasing seasonal input amount and thus would fail to point towards an appropriate input level furthermore grain yield was heavily affected by cultivar choice so efficiency indices that depend on yield actually obscured rather than facilitated the evaluation of irrigation and fertilizer nitrogen management an alternate evaluation approach is to compare a grower s seasonal input amount or input temporal distribution against an appropriate range enveloped by university recommendations on the high end and observed yield limiting thresholds on the low end where irrigation and fertilizer nitrogen are relatively inexpensive and where producing near maximum yield is optimal this approach is suitable for analyzing an input in isolation and for analyzing multiple inputs simultaneously keywords efficiency evaluation irrigation nitrogen requirement unl taps 1 introduction increasing crop production while limiting adverse environmental impacts is a widely stated goal in agricultural science and more judicious application of inputs is regarded as one primary means of achieving this goal excessive input application relative to crop requirements not only can decrease farm profits but also can degrade the environment excessive irrigation can unsustainably deplete groundwater and streamflow whereas excessive fertilizer nitrogen can waste fossil fuels generate additional greenhouse gases and contaminate surface water and groundwater thus much research has occurred to develop scientific methods to better match the amount and timing of input availability to the amount and timing of crop demand examples of such methods include crop coefficients kc soil moisture sensors and infrared thermometry for irrigation taghvaeian et al 2012 bartlett et al 2015 rudnick et al 2015 singh et al 2018 and include soil testing tissue sampling controlled release formulations and active optical sensors for fertilizer nitrogen ferguson 2015 thompson et al 2015 although the science and engineering of many methods can be further refined arguably the greatest barriers to further improving on farm input management are not technological adopting one of these methods effectively on a farm can be extremely challenging due to non technological reasons alone growers would need to become convinced about the need to improve input management become informed about the tools available become comfortable with using a subset of one or more tools and become successful in integrating that subset of tools into their operations this process often necessitates substantial time knowledge money and mindset changes while extension will not enable growers to bypass this process one of the ways extension can ease this process is by providing quantitative evaluation of input management to inform growers learning by doing growers usually notice their crop yield and farm profitability but may be less aware of the quality of their input management input management evaluation would identify how each grower can improve the amount and or timing of irrigation and fertilizer nitrogen this objective information would then become a starting point for in depth discussion among growers industry and university staff on how mentalities technologies and strategies can be revised for future years however the evaluation of grower decisions may need to differ from that of highly controlled experiments first ideal evaluation methods must consider both irrigation and nitrogen management because the two inputs are tightly linked and contribute jointly to crop performance second ideal evaluation methods must be flexible enough to handle the countless ways growers may vary the amount and timing of irrigation and fertilizer nitrogen third ideal evaluation methods must be resistant to cultivar effects this paper examines methods for evaluating the amount and timing of irrigation and fertilizer nitrogen through an on station farm management competition dataset efficiency indices numerical ratios of crop output over crop input may be the first method that comes to mind but not all conventional efficiency indices prove to be suitable for this purpose two new sets of efficiency indices and a requirement range approach are therefore proposed in response to the shortcomings of conventional efficiency indices finally the paper further discusses the general applicability of these methods to various contexts 2 methods 2 1 background the university of nebraska lincoln testing ag performance solutions taps taps unl edu program hosted a farm management competition in 2017 where growers competed for maximum profitability and optimal input irrigation and fertilizer nitrogen management there were a total of fifteen teams where each team grower or group of growers made irrigation fertilizer planting marketing and insurance decisions for a 1214 ha farm simulated by plots at the unl west central research and extension center in north platte ne in a zero risk setting the teams were able to try technologies and strategies hands on and had various opportunities to learn with from peers industry and university staff regarding technological and non technological challenges of input management the centralized location facilitated the collection of diverse measurements the comparison between contestant farms and the hosting of in depth field day workshops each contestant team was randomly assigned three replicate 0 05 ha plots inside a no till irrigated field following soybean preplant fertilizer was applied on 4 may by a double coulter liquid applicator dribbling urea ammonium nitrate uan 32 0 0 at a depth of 0 02 m and at a distance of 0 13 m from the center of the crop row on both sides hybrid field corn zea mays was planted 0 05 m deep on 9 may with 0 76 m row spacing at rates of 69 200 to 85 300 seeds ha 1 as decided by each contestant team sidedress fertilizer was applied on 12 june v5 growth stage by the same liquid applicator dribbling uan 32 0 0 at a depth of 0 02 m and at a distance of 0 19 m from the center of the crop row on both sides all teams had two opportunities per week to irrigate up to 25 mm irrigation was applied using a variable rate center pivot with solenoid valves to pulse pairs of sprinklers independently the sprinkler package was low pressure stationary spray heads at 0 6 m height in alternate interrows i e 1 5 m sprinkler spacing additionally all teams had four opportunities during the growing season to fertigate up to 34 kg ha 1 of nitrogen all fertilizer nitrogen rates in this paper refers to the mass of nitrogen and not the mass of fertilizer product the application dates were 29 june 13 july 20 july and 2 august v9 v14 r1 and r2 growth stages fertigation was applied through the center pivot using a variable rate injection pump that maintains the system concentration of uan 32 0 0 even as the irrigation system flow rate changed silking and physiological maturity were generally reached on 20 july and 10 october respectively a killing frost also occurred on the morning of 10 october which ended the growing season for all farms the 2017 growing season in north platte was characterized by relatively long alternating periods of high and low evaporative demand fig 1 minimal rainfall occurred during the periods of high evaporative demand while the transitions from high to low evaporative demand were abrupt and began with heavy rainfall the periods of high evaporative demand were the first half of may early june to late july and late august to late september the periods of low evaporative demand were the second half of may late july to late august and late september to early october 2 2 data collection locally calibrated 503 elite hydroprobe neutron moisture meters campbell pacific nuclear concord ca were used to determine the crop evapotranspiration et in each plot during the growing season on 12 measurement dates a 15 s neutron count was measured at depths of 0 15 0 46 0 76 1 07 1 37 and 1 68 m in one tube per plot crop et between two measurement dates can be directly calculated from the change in total water over the 1 83 m profile whenever runoff and deep percolation are negligible this assumption was deemed appropriate for the intervals between seven pairs of measurement dates none of these intervals were preceded by or contained heavy rainfall and total runoff during each interval was estimated to be less than 1 mm when conservatively assuming a runoff curve number of 80 that corresponds to poor hydrologic condition nrcs 2004 during each interval crop et equaled precipitation plus irrigation minus change in total water over the 1 83 m profile for each plot a piecewise linear curve in the style of allen et al 1996 of alfalfa reference stressed mean crop coefficients ks kcr as a function of growing degree days was fitted by minimizing the sum of squared differences between observed and modeled crop et during those seven intervals with each difference weighted by the number of days during the interval this approach was chosen because the errors of ks kcr curve fitting were expected to be smaller than the uncertainties in daily water balance parameters for runoff deep percolation and water stress seasonal crop et for each plot was calculated by summing the daily product between kcr and etr to minimize the effect of outliers seasonal crop et for each farm was taken to be the median rather than average seasonal et among the three constituent plots on several dates during the growing season non contact sensors were mounted at 2 9 m height to a custom built tractor mounted boom for collecting canopy measurements in the core of every plot the tractor was driven at 1 m s 1 in both directions along the alleys between strips of plots so that both the left and right sides of the boom passed once over each plot and so that all measurements were collected generally within one hour during the early or mid afternoon the left and right sides of the boom were equipped with the identical set of sensors each set included two si 1h1 infrared thermometers apogee instruments logan ut and one acs 430 active optical sensor holland scientific lincoln ne the infrared thermometers were oriented at 60 from nadir pointed perpendicular with crop rows away from the tractor and sampled once every 3 s the active optical sensor was positioned between crop rows shaver et al 2017 oriented nadir with the longer dimension of the field of view perpendicular with crop rows and sampled once every 0 1 s omitting data from the buffer areas where irrigation and fertilizer nitrogen rates transitioned from those of one plot to those of another plot each set of sensors collected at least 8 canopy temperature measurements and at least 240 canopy reflectance measurements from each plot on each measurement date again to minimize the effect of outliers the canopy temperature and normalized difference red edge ndre vegetation index values for each plot were taken to be the average of the median value according to the left set of sensors and the median value according to the right set of sensors destructive sampling was also performed in each plot the uppermost collared leaf from each of 12 plants per plot was sampled on 13 july 2017 approximately v14 according to the leaf collar system of vegetative growth stages immediately before the second fertigation application on 16 october after physiological maturity the corn ears and the 0 20 m segment of stalk from 0 15 to 0 36 m above the ground were sampled from each of ten plants per plot the grain from those ten plants was separated from the cobs using an electrically powered mechanical sheller leaf nitrogen content stalk nitrate content and grain nitrogen content analyses were conducted by ward laboratories kearney ne on 2 november the grain from the middle 18 m of the center six crop rows in each plot was harvested using a six row combine grain moisture content was measured using the moisture sensor of the yield monitor system inside the combine and wet grain weight was measured using a weigh wagon market grain yield y was normalized to 15 5 grain moisture and grain nitrogen uptake g was calculated as the product of dry grain yield and grain nitrogen content again to minimize the effect of outliers y and g for each farm were taken to be the median y and g among the three constituent plots 2 3 efficiency indices an efficiency index by definition is a ratio of output over input and thus can be represented by a slope i e ratio of rise over run on a graph that plots an output variable on the vertical axis and an input variable on the horizontal axis eight conventional efficiency indices for irrigation and nitrogen management are depicted in figs 2 a f and the corresponding equations equations 1 8 are listed below indices 2 4 were calculated according to rudnick and irmak 2013 indices 5 8 were calculated according to dobermann 2007 but g was substituted for aboveground nitrogen uptake u because the latter was not measured in the 2017 unl taps competition if u was used instead figs 2d e and the associated indices would be more similar to figs 2a b and the associated indices respectively indices 1 3 4 5 7 and 8 were not calculated for the zero input treatment i e nonirrigated and unfertilized farm 7 because the index value would be undefined the line with long grey dashes denotes perfect conversion of irrigation i to evapotranspiration et in figs 2a and 2c whereas it denotes perfect conversion of fertilizer nitrogen f to g in figs 2d and 2f fig 2 shows only the rising and plateau segments of the theoretical water and nitrogen production functions the declining segment of the production functions can be relevant for some combinations of crop cultivar environment and management but is rarely observed under the conditions and input levels observed in the 2017 unl taps competition while this paper focuses on the rising and plateau segments of production functions the analyses and conclusions remain valid on a declining segment irrigation efficiency ie 1 i e e t e t n i where et crop evapotranspiration of the farm under evaluation l etn crop evapotranspiration of the zero input treatment l i gross

component and a management supplied component specifically total water input equaled et of the zero input treatment etn plus i of the farm under evaluation while total nitrogen input equaled u of the zero input treatment un plus f of the farm under evaluation y total water input and total nitrogen input can then be divided by y of the zero input treatment yn etn and un respectively for non dimensionalization one new set of efficiency indices can be calculated as the ratio of dimensionless yield over dimensionless total input these new indices without non dimensionalization would be almost the same as cwue and ne when considering just one input i e water or nitrogen but non dimensionalization is necessary when considering water and nitrogen simultaneously the value of these new indices always equals 1 for the zero input treatment farms that produce more y per unit of total input i e more efficient than the zero input treatment achieve index values exceeding 1 those that produce less y per unit of total input i e less efficient than the zero input treatment achieve index values below 1 another new set of efficiency indices can be calculated as the ratio of dimensionless yield increase i e y yn yn over dimensionless total input the value of these new indices always equals 0 for the zero input treatment all farms that produce more y than the zero input treatment achieve positive index values but the yield increase is discounted by the magnitude of dimensionless total input the first new set of three efficiency indices equations 9 11 and the second new set of three efficiency indices equations 12 14 are depicted in figs 2g i and the corresponding equations are listed below again the line with long grey dashes denotes perfect conversion of i to

assumes the supply of i and f is plentiful enough that producing near maximum y is optimal this assumption is still the reality for the competition site at the time of writing but certainly is not the reality everywhere every year if the physical economic and or legal regulatory scarcity of i and f is so severe that the optimal production is significantly lower than maximum yield the evaluation of input management becomes a much more sophisticated optimization problem that is far beyond the scope of this paper university extension recommendations are typically intended to maximize yield or profit amid uncertainties in weather equipment and information shapiro et al 2008 therefore the input quantity that is applied when following university extension recommendations tends to be larger than the minimum input quantity that is required for producing maximum yield in this paper the higher i and f requirements according to university extension recommendations are denoted as ireq h and freq h respectively on the other hand the lower i and f requirements to prevent narrowly any yield loss due to input deficiencies are denoted as ireq l and freq l respectively for both i and f the seasonal and daily season to date input quantities of the farm under evaluation can be compared with the seasonal and daily season to date higher and lower requirements upon the conclusion of the growing season an input quantity may be deemed appropriate if it falls between the higher and lower requirements and deemed inappropriate otherwise alternatively metrics can be constructed to quantify the seasonal or daily deviation of the farm under evaluation from the center of the range spanned by the higher and lower requirements the first three metrics below equations 15 17 summarize seasonal deviation from the center of range whereas the second three metrics equations 18 20 summarize daily season to date deviation from the center of range relative deviation in irrigation rdi 15 r d i i i

recommendations li cor biosciences lincoln ne installed an eddy covariance system on the northern edge of a no till field 1 4 km away that was growing fully fertilized corn following soybeans and was fully irrigated by a lateral move system subsequently the company provided the authors with final data from its eddypro processing software after filtering out data points that were either deemed as low quality by eddypro or were corresponding to footprints located outside the field based on wind direction 2265 half hourly latent heat flux values between 27 april and 22 september remained inspection of days with complete data revealed that half hourly solar radiation rs exhibited a strong linear relationship with half hourly crop et to ensure adequate spread in rs to develop linear regression for gap filling crop et the 48 half hour intervals in a day were divided into 3 eight hour bins based on expected clear sky rs among all dates when half hourly rs was available 67 days contained at least one rs versus crop et data point in each of the three bins only for each of these 67 days missing half hourly crop et was estimated from half hourly rs using date specific linear regression average r2 of 0 89 and daily crop et was calculated as the sum of all 48 half hourly crop et values a piecewise linear curve in the style of allen et al 1996 of alfalfa reference mean crop coefficients kcr as a function of growing degree days was fitted by minimizing the sum of squared differences between observed and modeled crop et on those 67 days fig 3 growth stage records were used to fine tune the kcr curve to match observations of crop development from the 2017 unl taps competition the seasonal fully irrigated crop et was modeled to be 641 mm assuming a runoff curve number of 75 that corresponds to good hydrologic condition and assuming 20 mm of irrigation applied at most once every three days whenever soil water depletion exceeded the threshold adapted from unl extension recommendations seasonal ireq h was found to be 220 mm the associated irrigation schedule was used to obtain daily season to date ireq h ireq l for the 2017 unl taps competition was determined by modeling the minimum irrigation that was required to produce maximum yield with the hybrid chosen by the most contestant farms this procedure eliminated the noise that was introduced to the yield versus irrigation data by cultivar differences however the procedure was valid only if the farms with the most popular hybrid and with seasonal irrigation in the vicinity of seasonal ireq l also received f greater than or equal to seasonal freq l which was later verified to be true sufficient spread in seasonal irrigation among the five farms that planted the most popular hybrid dyna gro d53vc55rib enabled the fitting of a quadratic irrigation water production function the vertex of the resultant concave down function corresponded to 150 mm of seasonal irrigation which was chosen as seasonal ireq l daily season to date ireq l was simplistically assumed to be the same as daily season to date ireq h divided by the ratio of seasonal ireq l over seasonal ireq h this assumption is similar to the concept of a limited irrigation treatment whose daily application depths are a fixed percentage of the daily application depths for the fully irrigated treatment rudnick et al 2018 seasonal freq h was determined using the unl nitrogen algorithm shapiro et al 2008 soil samples were collected from the competition site on 6 march and were analyzed by ward laboratories kearney ne the 0 0 2 m depth contained 1 9 organic matter and 8 2 ppm nitrate nitrogen whereas the 0 2 0 9 m depth contained 3 8 ppm nitrate nitrogen with 50 kg ha 1 nitrogen credit for the previous soybean crop and with a yield goal of 15 1 mg ha 1 seasonal freq h was calculated to be 197 kg ha 1 seasonal freq l was determined by modeling the minimum fertilizer nitrogen that was required to produce maximum yield with one hybrid under full irrigation the spread in fertilizer nitrogen for any hybrid in the 2017 unl taps competition was insufficient for curve fitting therefore fertilizer nitrogen production function was taken from an immediately adjacent study where fontanelle 6a327rbc corn following soybean was subjected to nine nitrogen treatments under full irrigation the fitted quadratic plateau model indicated that seasonal freq l was 78 kg ha 1 b t krienke et al unpublished preliminary data 2017 seasonal irrigation and seasonal fertilizer nitrogen for the center of range 185 mm and 137 kg ha 1 respectively was calculated by averaging the corresponding quantities for the higher and lower requirements daily season to date irrigation for the center of range was calculated by averaging the daily season to date irrigation for the higher and lower requirements the authors were unaware of exact definitive guidance on optimal temporal distribution of fertilizer nitrogen for the purpose of illustration the fertilizer nitrogen applications for the center of range were assumed to be 70 kg ha 1 at preplant 34 kg ha 1 at the 1st fertigation opportunity and 34 kg ha 1 at the 3rd fertigation opportunity 3 results and discussion 3 1 input management decisions across the 2017 unl taps competition irrigation spanned a total of three months and was distributed among 21 applications seasonal irrigation ranged from 0 farm 7 zero input treatment to 273 mm farm 15 with a median of 174 mm fig 4 a for ten farms the half month that received the most irrigation or was tied for most irrigation was the 2nd half of july this half month generally coincided with low rainfall high crop evapotranspiration et and high crop sensitivity to water stress fig 1 however the irrigation amount applied during this half month was also the most variable among the contestant farms ranging from 20 to 79 mm the 1st half of august through the 1st half of september in contrast accounted for less than 25 of seasonal irrigation for ten farms the latter half of the 2017 irrigation season generally coincided with high rainfall low crop et and low crop sensitivity to water stress overall the majority of contestant teams appeared to have accounted for such crop and weather factors to some degree in their irrigation management fertilizer nitrogen was distributed among six applications over three months seasonal fertilizer nitrogen ranged from 0 farm 7 zero input treatment to 269 kg ha 1 farm 4 with a median of 202 kg ha 1 fig 4b all contestant farms except the zero input treatment followed the university recommendation to split apply fertilizer nitrogen so that a minimum 30 of the seasonal rate is applied as sidedress and or fertigation shapiro et al 2008 the majority of farms relied on preplant and fertigation as the primary means of fertilizer nitrogen applications at least 40 of the seasonal fertilizer nitrogen was applied as preplant for eight farms as sidedress for three farms and as fertigation for nine farms ignoring the zero input treatment only one farm applied no preplant five farms applied no sidedress and zero farms applied no fertigation all contestant teams appeared to value the ability to apply fertilizer nitrogen during the late vegetative and early reproductive periods via fertigation 3 2 conventional efficiency indices not all hybrids in the 2017 unl taps competition were described by the same production functions here the dyna gro d53vc55rib hybrid not only showed above average yield potential by achieving two of three top farm yields but also produced above average yield given the same seasonal crop et fig 5 a or the same seasonal irrigation fig 5b this hybrid also exhibited above average grain nitrogen content fig 6 a and produced above average yield given the same seasonal fertilizer nitrogen fig 6b differences in production functions among hybrids in turn resulted in differences in the relationships between input quantity and efficiency indices while one distinct curve of efficiency index versus seasonal i or seasonal f could usually be traced when examining the dyna gro d53vc55rib hybrid alone much more scatter was present when examining all farms together figs 5c f and 6c f yield is arguably the variable that would differ most among cultivars under identical input management if all variables were measured perfectly while water and nitrogen availability is undoubtedly important y is also affected by assimilate partitioning stress response physiology and many other characteristics that vary among cultivars in contrast different cultivars generally evapotranspire at similar rates under well watered conditions unless relative maturity peak height or peak leaf area were substantially different allen et al 1996 howell et al 1998 allen and pereira 2009 hao et al 2015 nagore et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 excluding the zero input treatment the 2017 unl taps competition witnessed relative maturity ratings between 108 and 113 according to the seed companies peak height between 2 4 and 3 1 m and peak leaf area above 4 5 m3 m 3 according to an lai 2200c plant canopy analyzer li cor biosciences lincoln ne the optimal amount and timing of irrigation would consequently be expected to be similar among these cultivars even as yield may differ widely the optimal seasonal rate of f admittedly is generally related to yield shapiro et al 2008 yet unless the study design controls for both cultivar and management and thus isolates the two types of effects determining the optimal seasonal rate of f for each cultivar might be impossible so a cultivar blind optimal seasonal rate would need to be assumed therefore a relatively uncontrolled evaluation of input management across cultivars may benefit from focusing on input amount and timing and from avoiding efficiency indices that depend on yield furthermore not all efficiency indices appear to reward appropriate seasonal input quantities theory described in figs 2a and 2c predicts that both irrigation efficiency ie and irrigation water use efficiency iwue decrease monotonically with increasing seasonal i the 2017 unl taps data matches this theory figs 5c and 5f the correlation coefficient between each of these two indices and seasonal i were 0 69 and 0 81 respectively while converting gravity irrigation to pressurized irrigation and improving the temporal distribution of i within a growing season would be constructive means of increasing the values of the two water efficiency indices these two indices provide no meaningful information on optimal seasonal i likewise theory described in figs 2d f predicts that recovery efficiency re internal efficiency ne physiological efficiency pe and agronomic efficiency ae all decrease monotonically with increasing seasonal f the 2017 unl taps data also matches this theory figs 6c f the correlation coefficient between each of these four indices and seasonal f were 0 58 0 58 0 51 and 0 74 respectively while adjusting the timing placement and or product of fertilizer application to improve the spatiotemporal correspondence between nutrient availability and plant uptake would be a constructive means of increasing the values of the four nitrogen efficiency indices these indices provide no meaningful information on optimal seasonal f in conclusion treatments differing only in seasonal i should not be evaluated using ie or iwue and treatments differing only in seasonal f should not be evaluated using re or ae on the other hand theory described in fig 2b predicts that evapotranspiration water use efficiency etwue remains constant and then decreases with increasing seasonal i whereas crop water use efficiency cwue increases and then decreases with increasing seasonal i this theoretical trend of cwue was observed in the 2017 unl taps data fig 5d and makes cwue suitable for evaluating seasonal i because maximum cwue is achieved by applying the minimum seasonal i required for maximum yield a major challenge of widely using cwue is the difficulty of measuring crop et accurately unless the climate of interest is significantly more arid than the competition site and thus allows seasonal crop et to be estimated simply from precipitation irrigation and seasonal change in soil water howell 2001 et determination is generally resource intensive and prone to substantial uncertainties here farm 2 achieved the highest cwue despite applying more seasonal i than farms 1 3 5 and 14 and producing lower y than those four farms this unexpected result is likely caused in part by an underestimation of et for farm 2 by the way if ne was calculated using aboveground nitrogen uptake u instead of g ne would be completely analogous to cwue this version of ne would increase and then decrease with increasing seasonal f and the maximum index value would be achieved by applying the minimum seasonal f required for maximum y similarly a major challenge of widely using this version of ne is the need to sample and analyze the aboveground biomass of enough plants for each farm under evaluation to measure u accurately relying heavily on variables that are difficult to measure accurately is not ideal for evaluating input management two outcomes of water and nitrogen interactions were observed in the 2017 unl taps competition first the values of the ie etwue iwue re pe and ae indices were universally overestimated because a zero input treatment was used as the reference concurrent deficiency in water and nitrogen would decrease crop et g and y by a larger magnitude than would deficiency in one input alone eck 1984 pandey et al 2000a b pandey et al 2000a o neill et al 2004 hernández et al 2015 this phenomenon partly explains why ie values for farms 1 3 and 5 exceeded 100 at the same time the irrigation applied to these three farms would increase leaf area and root growth enabling the plants in these farms not only to use all of the irrigation water but also to extract more stored subsoil moisture than the plants in a non irrigated treatment are able second the apparent relationship between y and f for dyna gro d53vc55rib fig 6b misrepresented the f production function of this hybrid as subsequent analyses will reveal i and not f was the dominant input driving yield differences in the 2017 unl taps competition for dyna gro d53vc55rib increased i caused the apparent y increase with increasing medium rates of f while decreased i caused the apparent y decrease with increasing high rates of f in the absence of such i effects re and ae values of this hybrid would display a larger decrease with increasing medium rates of f and a smaller decrease with increasing high rates of f as compared with what is shown in figs 6c and 6f ne and pe in contrast are noticeably more resilient to i effects because both the numerator and denominator terms of these two indices y and g or u are influenced by i a relatively uncontrolled evaluation of input management must carefully consider all inputs plus all extraneous factors such as hail and pest damage 3 3 new efficiency indices lamentably the two new types of efficiency indices presented herein equations 9 14 also depend on y and are thus as susceptible to cultivar effects as the eight conventional efficiency indices discussed earlier while these two new types of efficiency indices remain general indicators of overall crop performance rather than specific indicators of optimal input management two advantages are noteworthy first the difficult measurements of crop et and u need to be made on the zero input treatment only this advantage greatly facilitates the use of these indices when evaluating many farms second the dimensionless nature of these two new types of efficiency indices enabled the construction of water nitrogen indices water nitrogen indices are not merely more compatible with the use of a zero input treatment that lacks both i and f as the reference more importantly water nitrogen indices have the potential to capture the reality that when both inputs deviate from their respective optimum quantity the consequence is exacerbated multiplicatively excessive i with excessive f compounds nitrate leaching because deep percolation and nitrate concentration are simultaneously high gheysari et al 2009 deficient i with excessive f compounds soil salinization chen et al 2004 and stover nitrate toxicity for livestock rasby et al 2014 excessive or deficient i with deficient f compounds nitrogen stress nitrate is flushed out of the root zone under excessive i rudnick and irmak 2013 whereas passive nitrogen uptake decreases with decreasing root water uptake under deficient i wu and kersebaum 2008 the authors hope that the use of water nitrogen efficiency indices would promote more integrated thinking across the traditionally separate disciplines of irrigation management and fertilizer nitrogen management just like cwue relative water input efficiency rwie and water intensification performance index wipi followed a concave down curve increasing and then decreasing as seasonal i increases in the 2017 unl taps competition fig 7 a and 7d rwie however appears to be maximized at lower seasonal i than wipi these two observations matches the theory described in figs 2g i for the two new types of indices the first new type of index equations 9 11 may represent the priorities of a context where managed inputs are scarcer than land suitable for receiving managed inputs so spreading the available managed input over a larger land area to produce slightly below maximum yield is preferred the second new type of index equations 12 14 may represent the priorities of a context where land suitable for receiving managed inputs is scarcer than managed inputs so producing maximum yield is preferred as discussed later all farms excluding the zero input treatment applied high seasonal rates of f given the conditions of the 2017 unl taps competition consequently these farms fell in the range where relative nitrogen input efficiency rnie and nitrogen intensification performance index nipi decrease monotonically with increasing seasonal f if cultivar effects and i effects were removed figs 7b and 7e such high seasonal rates of f also caused the nitrogen term to be more influential than the water term in relative water nitrogen input efficiency rwnie fig 7c and water nitrogen intensification performance index wnipi fig 7f with the inclusion of lower seasonal rates of f rwnie and wnipi data is expected to increase and then decrease with increasing seasonal input as predicted by theory fig 2i 3 4 input requirement ranges unlike most efficiency indices results from the input requirement range approach are easy to understand and interpret for diverse audiences in the 2017 unl taps competition six contestant farms irrigated under four farms irrigated within and five farms irrigated above the range spanned by the higher and lower seasonal requirements fig 4a on the other hand one contestant farm i e the zero input treatment fertilized under six farms fertilized within if counting farm 9 whose seasonal fertilizer nitrogen was equal to the higher requirement and eight farms fertilized above the range spanned by the higher and lower seasonal requirements fig 4b inferring from the lower requirement six farms including the zero input treatment experienced y loss induced by water stress whereas only the zero input treatment experienced yield loss induced by nitrogen stress yield differences observed in the 2017 unl taps competition that are not attributed to cultivar effects should therefore be primarily attributed to irrigation management and not fertilizer nitrogen management three farms were within the higher and lower seasonal requirements for both i and f two of these farms furthermore ranked in the top three for y and serve as examples of producing high yield without excessive inputs meanwhile four out of the five farms that applied excessive i also applied excessive f the relationship between grower mentality and strategy for irrigation management and grower mentality and strategy for nitrogen management deserves further investigation and may have significant implications for extension efforts while efficiency indices often failed to identify truly optimal seasonal input quantities the input requirement range approach performed this task clearly and reliably the results in turn allow i and f excesses and deficiencies to begin to be detected analyzed and addressed as would be expected in an effective evaluation of input management the input requirement range approach is conducive to evaluating not only the amount but also the timing of input applications the same seasonal input quantity but a different application schedule may lead to significantly different outcomes farms 1 4 6 8 9 and 15 exemplify the diversity in the temporal distribution of irrigation during the 2017 unl taps competition fig 8 for the first half of the irrigation season farms 1 and 15 maintained cumulative irrigation slightly under the lower requirement and slightly above the higher requirement respectively for the second half of the irrigation season farm 1 largely withheld irrigation whereas farm 15 outpaced the higher requirement substantially farms 6 and 9 applied similar seasonal irrigation between the higher and lower requirements but farm 6 postponed its irrigation and finally caught up with farm 9 in early august farms 4 and 8 applied similar seasonal irrigation above the higher requirement but farm 8 applied 36 mm more in july than farm 4 and was not overtaken by farm 4 until late august given the high sensitivity of pollination and kernel setting to water stress farms 1 8 and 9 were prudent to concentrate irrigation in july the time shortly before and during this critical period at least as much as the higher and lower requirements did yet farm 8 irrigated so generously that its cumulative irrigation remained more than 25 mm above the higher requirement for approximately two months almost consecutively which may be leaving too little room in the root zone to hold heavy in season rainfall on the other hand irrigating more frequently than the higher requirement during the latter half of the irrigation season as did farms 6 and 15 was not the most sensible temporal distribution of irrigation for the 2017 unl taps competition while the seasonal metrics equations 15 17 merely conveyed the same information as fig 4 the daily metrics equations 18 20 reflected the aforementioned differences in the timing of input application seasonal i and relative deviation in irrigation rdi of farm 8 were 6 mm and 15 lower respectively than those of farm 4 nevertheless relative root mean squared deviation in irrigation rrmsdi of farm 8 was actually 38 higher than that of farm 4 table 1 because farm 8 diverged much more from the irrigation schedule for the center of the requirement range than did farm 4 between july and august fig 8 seasonal f and relative deviation in fertilizer nitrogen rdf of farm 11 was 1 kg ha 1 and 1 lower respectively than those of farm 3 nonetheless relative root mean squared deviation in fertilizer nitrogen rrmsdf of farm 11 was 26 higher than that of farm 3 because farm 11 diverged much more from the f schedule for the center of the requirement range than did farm 3 farm 11 applied 87 of its seasonal rate as preplant and sidedress but farm 3 as well as the center of range applied roughly half of their respective seasonal rates as preplant and applied the remaining half as fertigation as expected absolute relative deviation in irrigation fertilizer nitrogen ardi f was smallest for the three farms that were within the seasonal requirement range for both irrigation and fertilizer nitrogen it was largest for farm 3 which applied the second lowest seasonal irrigation but the fourth highest seasonal fertilizer nitrogen among all contestant farms and for farm 7 the zero input treatment because farm 8 had a high rrmsdi given its rdi and because farm 11 had a high rrmsdf given its rdf farms 8 and 11 each had a relatively high relative root mean squared deviation in irrigation fertilizer nitrogen rrmsdi f given their respective ardi f plant tissue analyses support the diagnosis by the requirement range approach that high seasonal rates of f were pervasive in the 2017 unl taps competition excluding the three plots of the zero input treatment all but two plots reported stalk nitrate levels in the high category of 2000 ppm no3 n fig 9 b sawyer and mallarino 2018 the observation that the higher requirement for seasonal f was 119 kg ha 1 153 above the lower requirement and also resulted in high stalk nitrate levels highlights the uncertainty in current predictions of f requirements the large discrepancy between the higher and lower requirements may be attributed in part to above average pre season temperatures in 2017 between 7 march i e day after soil nitrate sampling in 2017 and 8 may i e day before planting in 2017 the daily averages of maximum and minimum temperature were 1 4 c higher on average for 2017 than for the 1987 2016 mean hprcc 2018 the higher requirement was based on soil testing and assumptions of average weather conditions so it cannot account for any temperature driven increase in nitrogen mineralization after the soil sampling date given the inability of traditional f recommendation algorithms to adapt to deviations from normality emerging technologies such as in season nitrogen simulation models nitrate specific soil sensors and active optical sensors would be needed to overcome this problem leaf nitrogen tests may be informative as well by the v14 growth stage all contestant farms except the zero input treatment had applied more f than the lower requirement the nitrogen content of the uppermost collared leaf was above 2 7 for every plot of these farms but not for any plot of the zero input treatment fig 9a all methods are associated with some degree of uncertainty and may each experience difficulty distinguishing between deficient sufficient and excessive nitrogen availability under different circumstances thus using an ensemble of multiple methods may be the best means of in season f management thompson et al 2015 there are particular challenges of using emerging technologies for nitrogen management in the presence of multiple stresses for instance active optical sensors may unintentionally respond to both water stress and nitrogen stress normalized difference red edge ndre is a vegetation index that is commonly calculated from red edge and near infrared active reflectance as an indicator of crop nitrogen status shiratsuchi et al 2011 canopy temperature is commonly calculated from infrared thermometer data as an indicator of crop water status idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 yet on two dates around the vt r1 growth stage and on two dates during plant senescence the correlation between ndre and canopy temperature was 0 71 0 80 0 78 and 0 77 respectively for the plots of the 2017 unl taps competition figs 10 a d the key to unfolding this mystery lies in the fact that water stress generally decreases leaf area water stress during the vegetative period reduces leaf expansion indeed correlation between vegetative period irrigation and peak leaf area index was 0 72 for the 2017 unl taps competition water stress during the reproductive period on the other hand accelerates leaf senescence rudnick and irmak 2014 because the active optical sensors were placed between crop rows and were oriented nadir the ndre measurements were sensitive to leaf area even when the canopy would be considered to be effectively closed therefore on the four warm and clear days featured in fig 10 the underirrigated plots showed both low ndre and high canopy temperatures regardless of crop nitrogen status ndre values that have been dragged down by water stress should be used with caution to avoid underestimating crop nitrogen status and overestimating in season f needs research on this subject is ongoing shiratsuchi et al 2011 ward 2015 3 5 applicability the input requirement range approach may be the generally most preferred method to evaluate grower i and f amount and timing from a grower s perspective it is actually better to have a requirement range to stay within rather than a magical i e optimal number to aim for drivers informed by a fuel gauge can decide the amount and timing of their fuel purchases by further considering their driving plan their proximity to filling stations and spatiotemporal predictions of fuel price likewise growers informed by an input requirement range can decide the amount and timing of their input application by further considering their labor availability their equipment capabilities and past and future weather also the ability to analyze temporal distributions is a particularly noteworthy strength producing a graph such as fig 8 for both i and f would summarize the evaluation effectively diagnosing when and how much growers are over or under applying inputs would then initiate conversation about current technological and non technological challenges and how to improve in future seasons the higher requirement for i and f should be easier to establish than the lower requirement the higher requirement for i can be calculated from growth stage kc local weather data start of season soil moisture and university recommendations on soil water depletion the higher requirement for f can be obtained from widely tested university algorithms based on basic information such as soil test results previous crop and y goal as for the lower requirement for i and f a gradient of i levels and a gradient of f levels could be imposed at a centralized location in some environments care would need to be taken to account for the effect of soil moisture and soil nitrogen levels carrying over from one season to the next also if the declining segment of the production functions is present and the plateau segment is short a factorial design would be necessary instead of separate gradients for i and f multiple cultivars could be included if cultivar differences are suspected to influence the lower requirement the higher and lower requirements might be directly applicable across a small non mountainous area perhaps 1000 km2 with similar soil and similar past management yet if the fields under evaluation are spread over a larger area or are more heterogeneous the lower requirement may need to be determined experimentally at multiple locations or extrapolated from one location to other locations using crop models with increasing prevalence of variable rate application technology and improving accuracy of crop models establishing the lower requirement would continue to become easier aspects of the input requirement range approach would benefit from further investigation better understanding of the spatial variability of higher and lower requirements would facilitate the evaluation of multiple fields also although this paper focused on post season evaluations the potential of predicting higher and lower requirements in real time to inform in season decision making deserves greater exploration additionally the most suitable assumptions for each context would need to be discovered for instance this paper evaluated the temporal distribution of i and f in terms of daily season to date cumulative input amounts which relied on the assumption that in season losses were uniformly negligible in regions or seasons where this assumption is false the evaluation may need to be conducted in terms of soil moisture content and soil inorganic nitrogen content instead finally how to best use the results of the input requirement approach in a follow up conversation with growers would need to be learned colleagues are highly encouraged to try assess and adapt the input requirement range approach and then share their experiences through journal publication and or direct correspondence with the authors 4 conclusion efficiency indices have been successfully used to compare agricultural regions parameterize crop models and contrast irrigation systems and fertilizer programs yet among conventional efficiency indices only crop water use efficiency and physiological efficiency if calculated from aboveground nitrogen uptake rather than grain nitrogen uptake are maximized at an apparently optimal input level instead of never increasing with input level alternate efficiency indices presented in this paper capture similar information as crop water use efficiency and physiological efficiency while minimizing the need to make difficult measurements of crop evapotranspiration and aboveground nitrogen uptake nonetheless the alternate indices also depend on yield whose sensitivity to cultivar differences can obscure evaluation of input management overall efficiency indices were found to be less than ideal for evaluation of grower irrigation and fertilizer nitrogen amount and timing in contrast the input requirement range approach proposed in this paper clearly points out when and by how much growers are over or under applying inputs this approach was not only capable of assessing seasonal input quantities but also distinguishing more appropriate and less appropriate temporal distributions that totaled to the same seasonal quantity the input requirement range approach meets the three criteria set forth in the introduction first input management ranges can consider both irrigation and nitrogen management when aiming for near maximum yield second input management ranges are flexible to any temporal distribution of irrigation and fertilizer because it can analyze on a daily weekly monthly or seasonal time step third input management ranges are relatively resistant to cultivar effects because the evaluation does not directly depend on yield therefore the input requirement range approach is especially recommended for less controlled evaluations in on station competitions and on farm research where more structured statistical analyses might be impossible acknowledgments the authors are grateful to turner dorr

11214,the application of soil microorganisms in the agroecosystems is one of possibility that improve crops yield via increase resources use efficiency and capture capacity the aim of this study was to evaluate ecophysiological traits such as radiation absorption and use efficiency and yield of soybean under the water deficit stress and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria pgpr application conditions treatments evaluated in the study were contribution of different irrigation regimes including the water deficit stress from mid pod to maturity stages i1 the water deficit stress from grain filling to maturity stages i2 and optimum irrigation in all development stages i3 and the pgpr application including uninoculated control b1 bacillus subtilis b2 and bacillus licheniformis b3 the water deficit stress reduced all measured traits of soybean significantly in all irrigation regimes the highest and the lowest measured traits were observed in the b licheniformis application and uninoculated control respectively the greatest effects of the pgpr inoculated observed for grain yield 22 9 followed by protein content 18 8 and radiation use efficiency 15 2 respectively in the i2 treatment than other irrigation regimes the pgpr application increased significantly leaf area index 13 2 total dry weight 13 0 radiation use efficiency 15 2 grain yield 13 1 and oil 9 2 and protein 9 6 content in b3 compared to b1 treatments the greatest effects of pgpr were observed in the i2 treatment compared to other treatments the pgpr could promote soybean yield under the water deficit stress via increasing of photosynthesis and radiation use efficiency keywords radiation use efficiency radiation absorption oil content plant growth promoting rhizobacteria protein content water deficit stress 1 introduction the rapid increase of the world population pollution of natural resources global warming and climate change nowadays increase the pressure on limited water resources food and water demand also increase in parallel to the world population increase water scarcity and frequent droughts are becoming a serious problem particularly in the context of alarming predictions of climate change in the world within the arid and semi arid regions water availability is a major limitation for crop production thus it is necessitate to increase crops yield and the efficient utilization of available water in the irrigated agroecosystems çolak et al 2015 high yields of crops depend on the availability of irrigation water especially important at sensitive growth stages when a deficiency of water produces the more negative impacts on the growth sufficient water at or after anthesis not only allows the plant to increase photosynthesis rate but more importantly gives the plant extra time to translocate the carbohydrates to grains zhang et al 1998 thus enhancing the grain size which ultimately results in a higher grain yield crop growth and yield are considered a function of photosynthetically active radiation par that is intercepted by plant as well its utilization efficiency to produce dry matter the water deficit stress influences significantly both factors monteith 1977 net primary production has often been found to be linearly related to the photosynthetically active radiation par intercepted by crops monteith 1972 1977 the slope of this relationship is radiation use efficiency rue a number of authors have found close correlation among crop growth and yield with the radiation absorption and the rue li et al 2009 miranzadeh et al 2011 ali et al 2012 in recent decades agricultural production systems have already explored many methods to get high yields most of these methods involved increasing the efficiency in the use of resources such as nutrients solar radiation and atmospheric co2 nassiri mahallati et al 2015 due to intensive utilization many of these resources are becoming limited which is a problem for more crop production awal et al 2006 on the other hand the importance of reducing chemical inputs into agroecosystems has been increasing and governments and farmers are aiming to decrease them ruzzi and aroca 2015 the chemical pollution of underground water and rivers and the salinisation of soils caused by agricultural practices have risen in recent years phogat et al 2014 as previously mentioned one of the most natural resources that most limit plant growth and yield is water according to global change predictions several areas of the globe could become arid or semi arid regions due to a reduction in precipitation sivakumar 2011 therefore sustainable methods that reduce the amount of water added to crops without a loss in yield are needed one possibility to enhance crops yield under water limitations is the use of soil microorganisms that increase indirectly the radiation and water use efficiency and their capture capacity armada et al 2014 among soil microorganisms plant growth promoting rhizobacteria pgpr are the most promising including all bacteria inhabiting the rhizosphere and the rhizoplane which able to stimulate plant growth and yield ruzzi and aroca 2015 rhizobacteria with pgp activity occur in a number of bacterialphyla actinobacteria proteobacteria and firmicutes including strains belonging to genera bacillus pseudomonas azospirillum azotobacter alcaligens arthobacter agrobacterium burkholderia comamonas pantoea rhizobium serratia and variovorax kloepper et al 1989 some pgpr increase root surface area which lead to improvement in crops yield adesemoye and kloepper 2009 while some of them can enter the root indoor to establish endophytic populations with adaptability to the niche and benefits to the host plants compant et al 2005 the modes of action of pgpr are clearly diverse and not all bacteria possess the same mechanisms dey et al 2004 these mechanisms vary from changes in hormonal content production of volatile compounds increasing of nutrient availability and enhance the water deficit stress tolerance via lowering of the ethylene levels in the root of developing plants by hydrolysis of 1 aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylic acid acc deaminase and production of hormones like abscisic acid gibberellic acid cytokinins and auxin choudhary et al 2011 timmusk and nevo 2011 zahir et al 2008 yang et al 2009 dimkpa et al 2009 therefore the objectives of present study were i to evaluate radiation use efficiency ii to assess the effect of water deficit stress occurring during the growing season and iii to identify effects of the pgpr on the quantity and quality characteristics of soybean 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design a split plot experiment was conducted based on randomized complete block designin 2016 at the

cultivation in depth of 0 to 30 and 30 to 60 cm at experimental site the experiment farm soil type was inceptisol physical and chemical properties of the soil were determined in the soil analysis laboratory table 1 the water deficit stress affected on soybean growth and yield at 50 of the total available water in the root zone 30 40 cm sarkar et al 2015 meyer and green 1981 therefore in the optimal irrigation treatment i3 treatment according to soil water monitoring the soybean plants were irrigated before reaching the soil water to 50 of the total available water about every 7 days the experimental plots were irrigated based on furrow method the i3 treatment were irrigated every 7 days until the end of the growing period while in the i1 and i2 treatments the irrigation was cut from mid pod development stage to maturity stage and from grain filling development stage to maturity stage respectively the soil water content was measured using direct measurement method in this method

bionozhan company north khorasan province iran the experimental field was ploughed twice and harrowed once for seedbed preparation before sowing according to the recommendation of soil analysis laboratory 50 kg n ha 1and 150 kg p ha 1 was incorporated manually into the soil the sowing date was 13th may in 2016 the i1 and i2 treatments were applied on 22 and 29th august in 2016 respectively the i1 and i2 treatment periods were 28 and 21 day respectively weeds were controlled early in the season by hand weeding 2 2 data collection and analysis the measurement indexes were leaf area index lai radiation absorption total above ground dry weight tdw radiation use efficiency rue grain yield and oil and protein content of soybean randomized sampling was conducted from 14 days after emergence dae until harvesting in each sampling five plants from each plot were randomly chosen and leaf area and total above ground dry weight was measured the lai was determined using a leaf area meter li 3000 a the samples were oven dried at 70 c for 72 h then weighed to calculate daily tdw the following equation was used shoor et al 2012 1 t d w a 1 b e c x where a is the maximum tdw that estimated from measured data g m 2 b is x value for log in the linear stage of tdw trend c indicate relative growth ratio g g day 1 and x is the time dae the rue was calculated on the basis of g mj 1 through the slope of linear regression between total above ground dry weight accumulation g m 2 and cumulative absorbed the total daily solar radiation bange et al 1997 radiation absorption level was calculated using the following equations tsubo et al 2005 2 i a b s i 0 1 p 1 e k l a i where iabs is absorbed radiation by soybean canopy mj m 2 i0 is total daily radiation mj m 2 which was simulated by the method cited by goudriaan and van laar 1993 for growing seasons of 2016 p and k are reflection and radiation extinction coefficients considered 0 05 and 0 62 respectively ebadi et al 2014 lai is daily leaf area index to calculate daily lai the following equation was used loomis and williams 1963 3 l a i a b 4 e x c d 1 e x c d 2 where a is the intercept b is maximum lai c is x value for maximum lai estimated from data d is the inflection point of lai and x is the time dae grain yield was measured at maturity in an area of 1 5 m2 corresponding to the two central rows of each plot the soybean was harvested manually on 6 13 and 19th september in 2016 for i1 i2 and i3 treatments respectively soybean grain yield was measured at the physiological maturity stage the protein content in

determined by folch method folch et al 1957 2 3 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance glm at significantly different level of5 by minitab software version 16 2 4 differences among treatments were tested using tukey multiple range test p 0 05 slidewrite and an excel spread sheet 2007 were used for curve fitting and drawing the figures respectively 3 results 3 1 soil water status the volumetric soil water content was monitored during the water deficit stress treatments the soil water content was gradually reduced after applying water deficit stress treatments fig 1 the soil water content was 0 337 0 002 m3 m 3 at the beginning of irrigation cut falling to 0 242 0 004 and 0 204 0 008 m3 m 3 on days 14 and 28 after applying the i1 treatment respectively it was 0 336 0 003 m3 m 3 at the beginning of irrigation cut falling to 0 238 0 004 and 0 220 0 005 m3 m 3on days 14 and 21 after applying the i2 treatment respectively fig 1 3 2 leaf area index the regression coefficients of the fitted eq 3 on the observed lai data were about 0 9 to 0 98 the average of lai value maximum was decreased from 6 7 0 2 to 5 4 0 4 when irrigation was reduced from i3 to i1 treatment regardless of the pgpr fig 2 the maximum values of lai were observed at 64 69 and 75 days after emergence dae for i1 i2 and i3 treatments respectively the lai reach to final at 105 112 and 118 dae in the i1 i2 and i3 respectively the lai was enhanced when the pgpr applied in each the irrigation regime fig 2 in all irrigation regimes the highest and the lowest lai were observed in b licheniformis and uninoculated control respectively by pgpr application in the b3 treatment compared to b1 treatment the lai improved about 6 9 14 1 and 8 5 in the i1 i2 and i3 respectively 3 3 radiation absorption the maximum of radiation absorption had not significant differences among treatments regardless of the pgpr treatments fig 3 the average of the maximum of radiation absorption was reduced from 18 0 0 50 to 17 5 0 2 mj m 2 when irrigation was decreased from i3 to i1 treatment the radiation absorption reaches to final at 105 112 and 118 dae in the i1 i2 and i3 respectively the radiation absorption was not exchanged when the pgpr applied in each irrigation regime fig 3 although the maximum of radiation absorption was not affected by experimental treatments but initial and final stages of the radiation absorption were diverse at the end of growing season radiation absorbed by the pgpr inoculated plants was higher than uninoculated control the radiation absorption generally achieve to 95 to 98 of solar daily radiation when the lai is about 3 5 to 4 in the crops canopy therefore it was not unexpected that there was a little difference among the treatments 3 4 total above ground dry weight tdw the regression coefficients of the fitted eq 1 on the observed tdw data were about 0 87 to 0 94 the average of tdw values maximum was reduced from 1098 9 89 7 to 996 9 56 4 and 886 9 73 2 g m 2 ini3 to i2 and i1 treatments respectively regardless of the pgpr treatments fig 4 the tdw reach to final at 105 112 and 118 dae in the i1 i2 and i3 respectively the tdw was enhanced when the pgpr was applied in each irrigation regime fig 4 the highest tdw was related to the i3 and b licheniformis treatment and the lowest twd was observed in the i1 and uninoculated control by pgpr application in the b3 treatment compared to b1 treatment the tdw improved about 8 5 13 0 and 4 9 in the i1 i2 and i3 respectively 3 5 radiation use efficiency rue was reduced with increasing of water deficit stress from the i3 to i1 treatments regardless of the pgpr treatments fig 5 the averages of rue were 0 935 0 053 0 966 0 080 and 1 027 0 029 g mj 1 for i1 i2 andi3 treatments respectively the rue was enhanced when the pgpr applied in each irrigation regime fig 5 in all irrigation regimes the highest and the lowest rue were observed in the b licheniformis and uninoculated control respectively in the i1 condition the rue were 0 876 0 951 and 0 979 g mj 1 for b1 b2 and b3 treatments respectively it was increased about 10 5 in b3 respect to b1 in the i2 condition the rue were 0 879 0 982 and 1 037 g mj 1 for b1 b2 and b3 treatments respectively it was about 15 2 higher in b3 than b1 in the i3 condition the rue were 0 999 1 024 and 1 057 g mj 1 for b1 b2 and b3 treatments respectively it was about 5 5 higher in b3 than b1 the highest rue was related to the i3 and b licheniformis treatment and the lowest rue was observed in the i1 and uninoculated control fig 5 3 6 grain yield combined analysis of variance using data indicated that the effects of irrigation regimes and the pgpr were significant for gy table 2 the water deficit stress decreased gy significantly the highest and the lowest gy were in i3 and i1 treatments respectively table 3 decrease of gy due to the water deficit stress was about 60 1 in i1 treatment compared to i3 treatment the pgpr application increased gy significantly table 2 the highest and the lowest gy were observed in the b licheniformis application and uninoculated control respectively the gy increase due to the pgpr application was about 13 1 the results also indicated that interactions of irrigation regimes and the pgpr had significant effect on gy table 2 in i1 treatment the gy was about 13 1 higher in b3 than b1 in i2 treatment the gy was about 22 9 higher in b3 than b1 in i3 treatment the gy the gy was about 7 6 higher in b3 than b1 3 7 oil and protein content of soybean grain the results indicated that the impacts of irrigation regimes and the pgpr were significant for the oil and protein content table 2 the oil and protein content decreased by increasing of water deficit stress significantly the highest oil and protein content were related to the i3 and the lowest oil and protein content were observed in i1 treatments respectively table 3 the decrease of oil and protein content due to the water deficit stress were about18 4 and 31 6 in i1 treatment compared to i3 treatment respectively the pgpr application increased the oil and protein content significantly table 2 the highest and the lowest oil and protein content were in the b licheniformis application and uninoculated control respectively the increase of oil and protein content due to the pgpr application were about 9 2 and 9 6 respectively the interactions of irrigation regimes and the pgpr application were not significant effect on the oil and protein content table 2 by pgpr application in the b3 treatment compared to b1 treatment the protein content improved about 7 1 18 8 and 8 8 and the oil content increased about 7 6 10 5 and 8 8 in the i1 i2 and i3 respectively 4 discussion the water deficit stress significantly reduced all measured traits of soybean except radiation absorption although the maximum of radiation absorption was not affected by the irrigation regime treatments the final stages of radiation absorbed were diverse among treatments at the end of soybean growing season the radiation absorption generally achieve to 95 98 of solar daily radiation when the lai is about 3 5 4 in the crops canopy therefore it was not unexpected that there were not significant differences among the experiment treatments in the farm conditions crops growth and yield are dependent on the ability of canopy to intercept incident radiation and radiation use efficiency which are function of the lai canopy architecture and net photosynthesis gifford et al 1984 therefore the effects of water deficit stress on the yield may act by limiting these factors han et al 2008 the results showed that the pgpr significantly improved the lai of soybean in all irrigation regimes treatments this increase might be due to improvement in net photosynthesis rate and subsequently an increase in partitioning of dry matter to produce more leaves the pgpr improved the tdw gy oil and protein content of soybean in all irrigation regime treatments in this study b licheniformis compared to b subtilis had more effects on measured traits of soybean the greatest effects of the pgpr on measured traits also were observed in i2 treatment it seems that the pgpr in the mid drought stress in comparison with hard drought stress had greater effects on the growth and yield of inoculated soybean compared to uninoculated control zahir et al 2008 reported that inoculation of plants with rhizobacteria containing acc deaminase significantly decreased the drought stress effects on growth and yield of peas pisum sativum they stated that at the lowest soil moisture level 25 field capacity rhizobacterial isolate pseudomonas fluorescens biotype g acc 5 was more promising compared with p fluorescens acc 14 and p putida biotype a q 7 as it caused maximum increases in fresh weight dry weight root length shoot length number of leaves per plant and water use efficiency compared with uninoculated controls the pgpr inoculated plant compared to uninoculated control increased significantly the rue of soybean the rue was estimated as the slope of a fitted linear relationship between the cumulative absorbed solar radiation and the tdw for each treatment the rue acutely indicated the amount of dry matter that could be produced by soybean through photosynthesis per unit of absorbed radiation thus in this linear relationship increase in the tdw is more important as the results of this study showed under the pgpr application conditions the tdw improved in the water deficit stress treatments while radiation absorption was not affected by the pgrp in all treatments a main effect of the water deficit stress is decrease in photosynthesis which arises through a reduction in leaf expansion disordered photosynthetic pathway premature leaf senescence and coupled reduction in dry matter production wahid and rasul 2005 moreover it seems that the co2 diffusion process from surrounded environmental to chloroplast is being damaged under the water deficit stress water stress induced stomatal closure restricts the co2 uptake by leaves and it could lead to an increased susceptibility to photo damage cornic and massacci 1996 the pgpr reduced drought stress either directly by producing extracellular polysaccharides trehalose 6 phosphate and solubilizing nutrients sharifi et al 2010 or by improving root growth and modulating stress related hormones sharifi and ryu 2018a sharifi and ryu 2017 also reported that the pgpr increase the aba biosynthesis in plants under water deficit stress thereby reducing water transpiration in the stomata the aba can increases primary root elongation to help the plant get to new water sources treatment of grapevines with b licheniformis under the water deficit stress increased aba production by 70 salomon et al 2014 on the other hands dodd et al 2010 found that the aba increases drought tolerance in plants by promoting stomatal closure which decreases transpiration by the stomata furthermore rhizobacteria increase the water deficit stress tolerance via lowering of the ethylene levels by hydrolysis of 1 aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylic acid acc choudhary et al 2011 zahir et al 2008 this mechanisms increase secondary root number and root hairs furthermore some bacterial determinants such as volatile compounds induce systemic tolerance to water stress by increasing proline and glycine betaine synthesis and reducing ros damage sharifi and ryu 2018b sarma and saikia 2014 demonstrated that a strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa improved the growth of vigna radiata plants under the water deficit stress naveed et al 2014 found that a main effect of pgpr inoculation on plants under water deficit stress was the improvement of leaf water status salomon et al 2014 demonstrated that grapevines inoculated by the pgpr lost 10 less water 5 conclusion the results demonstrated that the water deficit stress significantly decreased all measured traits of soybean except radiation absorption in the optimal irrigation treatment compared to treatment of water deficit stress from mid pod development stage to maturity stage the lai tdw rue decreased about 19 4 19 3 8 9 respectively decrease of gy oil and protein content due to the water deficit stress were about 60 1 18 4 and 31 6 in i1 treatment compared to i3 treatment respectively our results also showed that the pgpr improved the lai tdw rue gy oil and protein content of soybean in all irrigation regime treatments in this study b licheniformis compared to b subtilis was more effectiveness on measured traits of soybean the greatest effects of the pgpr on measured traits also were observed in i2 treatment b licheniformis improved the lai tdw rue gy oil and protein content about 14 1 13 0 15 2 22 9 18 8 and 10 5 in the i2 treatment respectively in the treatment of water deficit stress from grain filling development stage to maturity stage than other irrigation treatments the highest effects of the pgpr inoculated observed for grain yield followed by protein content and radiation use efficiency respectively therefore according to the results of this study it seems that the pgpr could improve the tdw by improving the current photosynthesis and subsequently the rue increased which ultimately improved the gy oil and protein content of soybean plants in the studied region 
11214,the application of soil microorganisms in the agroecosystems is one of possibility that improve crops yield via increase resources use efficiency and capture capacity the aim of this study was

6 content in b3 compared to b1 treatments the greatest effects of pgpr were observed in the i2 treatment compared to other treatments the pgpr could promote soybean yield under the water deficit stress via increasing of photosynthesis and radiation use efficiency keywords radiation use efficiency radiation absorption oil content plant growth promoting rhizobacteria protein content water deficit stress 1 introduction the rapid increase of the world population pollution of natural resources global warming and climate change nowadays increase the pressure on limited water resources food and water demand also increase in parallel to the world population increase water scarcity and frequent droughts are becoming a serious problem particularly in the context of alarming predictions of climate change in the world within the arid and semi arid regions water availability is a major limitation for crop production thus it is necessitate to increase crops yield and the efficient utilization of available water in the irrigated agroecosystems çolak et al 2015 high yields of crops depend on the availability of irrigation water especially important at sensitive growth stages when a deficiency of water produces the more negative impacts on the growth sufficient water at or after anthesis not only allows the plant to increase photosynthesis rate but more importantly gives the plant extra time to translocate the carbohydrates to grains zhang et al 1998 thus enhancing the grain size which ultimately results in a higher grain yield crop growth and yield are considered a function of photosynthetically active radiation par that is intercepted by plant as well its utilization efficiency to produce dry matter the water deficit stress influences significantly both factors monteith 1977 net primary production has often been found to be linearly related to the photosynthetically active radiation par intercepted by crops monteith 1972 1977 the slope of this relationship is radiation use efficiency rue a number of authors have found close correlation among crop growth and yield with the radiation absorption and the rue li et al 2009 miranzadeh et al 2011 ali et al 2012 in recent decades agricultural production systems have already explored many methods to get high yields most of these methods involved increasing the efficiency in the use of resources such as nutrients solar radiation and atmospheric co2 nassiri mahallati et al 2015 due to intensive utilization many of these resources are becoming limited which is a problem for more crop production awal et al 2006 on the other hand the importance of reducing chemical inputs into agroecosystems has been increasing and governments and farmers are aiming to decrease them ruzzi and aroca 2015 the chemical pollution of underground water and rivers and the salinisation of soils caused by agricultural practices have risen in recent years phogat et al 2014 as previously mentioned one of the most natural resources that most limit plant growth and yield is water according to global change predictions several areas of the globe could become arid or semi arid regions due to a reduction in precipitation sivakumar 2011 therefore sustainable methods that reduce the amount of water added to crops without a loss in yield are needed one possibility to enhance crops yield under water limitations is the use of soil microorganisms that increase indirectly the radiation and water use efficiency and their capture capacity armada et al 2014 among soil microorganisms plant growth promoting rhizobacteria pgpr are the most promising including all bacteria inhabiting the rhizosphere and the rhizoplane which able to stimulate plant growth and yield ruzzi and aroca 2015 rhizobacteria with pgp activity occur in a number of bacterialphyla actinobacteria proteobacteria and firmicutes including strains belonging to genera bacillus pseudomonas azospirillum azotobacter alcaligens arthobacter agrobacterium burkholderia comamonas pantoea rhizobium serratia and variovorax kloepper et al 1989 some pgpr increase root surface area which lead to improvement in crops yield adesemoye and kloepper 2009 while some of them can enter the root indoor to establish endophytic populations with adaptability to the niche and benefits to the host plants compant et al 2005 the modes of action of pgpr are clearly diverse and not all bacteria possess the same mechanisms dey et al 2004 these mechanisms vary from changes in hormonal content production of volatile compounds increasing of nutrient availability and enhance the water deficit stress tolerance via lowering of the ethylene levels in the root of developing plants by hydrolysis of 1 aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylic acid acc deaminase and production of hormones like abscisic acid gibberellic acid cytokinins and auxin choudhary et al 2011 timmusk and nevo 2011 zahir et al 2008 yang et al 2009 dimkpa et al 2009 therefore the objectives of present study were i to evaluate radiation use efficiency ii to assess the effect of water deficit stress occurring during the growing season and iii to identify effects of the pgpr on the quantity and quality characteristics of soybean 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design a split plot experiment was conducted based on randomized complete block designin 2016 at the

results 3 1 soil water status the volumetric soil water content was monitored during the water deficit stress treatments the soil water content was gradually reduced after applying water deficit stress treatments fig 1 the soil water content was 0 337 0 002 m3 m 3 at the beginning of irrigation cut falling to 0 242 0 004 and 0 204 0 008 m3 m 3 on days 14 and 28 after applying the i1 treatment

area index the regression coefficients of the fitted eq 3 on the observed lai data were about 0 9 to 0 98 the average of lai value maximum was decreased from 6 7 0 2 to 5 4 0 4 when irrigation was reduced from i3 to i1 treatment regardless of the pgpr fig 2 the maximum values of lai were observed at 64 69 and 75 days after emergence dae for i1 i2 and i3 treatments respectively the lai reach to final at 105 112 and 118 dae in the i1 i2 and i3 respectively the lai was enhanced when the pgpr applied in each the irrigation regime fig 2 in all irrigation regimes the highest and the lowest lai were observed in b licheniformis and uninoculated control respectively by pgpr application in the b3 treatment compared to b1 treatment the lai improved about 6 9 14 1 and 8 5 in the i1 i2 and i3 respectively 3 3 radiation absorption the maximum of radiation absorption had not significant differences among treatments regardless of the pgpr treatments fig 3 the average of the maximum of radiation absorption was reduced from 18 0 0 50 to 17 5 0 2 mj m 2 when irrigation was decreased from i3 to i1 treatment the radiation absorption reaches to final at 105 112 and 118 dae in the i1 i2 and i3 respectively the radiation absorption was not exchanged when the pgpr applied in each irrigation regime fig 3 although the maximum of radiation absorption was not affected by experimental treatments but initial and final stages of the radiation absorption were diverse at the end of growing season radiation absorbed by the pgpr inoculated plants was higher than uninoculated control the radiation absorption generally achieve to 95 to 98 of solar daily radiation when the lai is about 3 5 to 4 in the crops canopy therefore it was not unexpected that there was a little difference among the treatments 3 4 total above ground dry weight tdw the regression coefficients of the fitted eq 1 on the observed tdw data were about 0 87 to 0 94 the average of tdw values maximum was reduced from

respectively the tdw was enhanced when the pgpr was applied in each irrigation regime fig 4 the highest tdw was related to the i3 and b licheniformis treatment and the lowest twd was observed in the i1 and uninoculated control by pgpr application in the b3 treatment compared to b1 treatment the tdw improved about 8 5 13 0 and 4 9 in the i1 i2 and i3 respectively 3 5 radiation use efficiency rue was reduced with increasing of water deficit stress from the i3 to i1 treatments regardless of the pgpr treatments fig 5 the averages of rue were 0 935 0 053 0 966 0 080 and 1 027 0 029 g mj 1 for i1 i2 andi3 treatments respectively the rue was enhanced when the pgpr applied in each irrigation regime fig 5 in all irrigation regimes the highest and the lowest rue were observed in the b licheniformis and uninoculated control respectively in the i1 condition the rue were 0 876 0 951 and 0 979 g mj 1 for b1 b2 and b3 treatments respectively it was increased about 10 5 in b3 respect to b1 in the i2 condition the rue were 0 879 0 982 and 1 037 g mj 1 for b1 b2 and b3 treatments respectively it was about 15 2 higher in b3 than b1 in the i3 condition the rue were 0 999 1 024 and 1 057 g mj 1 for b1 b2 and b3 treatments respectively it was about 5 5 higher in b3 than b1 the highest rue was related to the i3 and b licheniformis treatment and the lowest rue was observed in the i1 and uninoculated control fig 5 3 6 grain yield combined analysis of variance using data indicated that the effects of irrigation regimes and the pgpr were significant for gy table 2 the water deficit stress decreased gy significantly the highest and the lowest gy were in i3 and i1 treatments respectively table 3 decrease of gy due to the water deficit stress was about 60 1 in i1 treatment compared to i3 treatment the pgpr application increased gy significantly table 2 the highest and the lowest gy were observed in the b licheniformis application and uninoculated control respectively the gy increase due to the pgpr application was about 13 1 the results also indicated that interactions of irrigation regimes and the pgpr had significant effect on gy table 2 in i1 treatment the gy was about 13 1 higher in b3 than b1 in i2 treatment the gy was about 22 9 higher in b3 than b1 in i3 treatment the gy the gy was about 7 6 higher in b3 than b1 3 7 oil and protein content of soybean grain the results indicated that the impacts of irrigation regimes and the pgpr were significant for the oil and protein content table 2 the oil and protein content decreased by increasing of water deficit stress significantly the highest oil and protein content were related to the i3 and the lowest oil and protein content were observed in i1 treatments respectively table 3 the decrease of oil and protein content due to the water deficit stress were about18 4 and 31 6 in i1 treatment compared to i3 treatment respectively the pgpr application increased the oil and protein content significantly table 2 the highest and the lowest oil and protein content were in the b licheniformis application and uninoculated control respectively the increase of oil and protein content due to the pgpr application were about 9 2 and 9 6 respectively the interactions of irrigation regimes and the pgpr application were not significant effect on the oil and protein content table 2 by pgpr application in the b3 treatment compared to b1 treatment the protein content improved about 7 1 18 8 and 8 8 and the oil content increased about 7 6 10 5 and 8 8 in the i1 i2 and i3 respectively 4 discussion the water deficit stress significantly reduced all measured traits of soybean except radiation absorption although the maximum of radiation absorption was not affected by the irrigation regime treatments the final stages of radiation absorbed were diverse among treatments at the end of soybean growing season the radiation absorption generally achieve to 95 98 of solar daily radiation when the lai is about 3 5 4 in the crops canopy therefore it was not unexpected that there were not significant differences among the experiment treatments in the farm conditions crops growth and yield are dependent on the ability of canopy to intercept incident radiation and radiation use efficiency which are function of the lai canopy architecture and net photosynthesis gifford et al 1984 therefore the effects of water deficit stress on the yield may act by limiting these factors han et al 2008 the results showed that the pgpr significantly improved the lai of soybean in all irrigation regimes treatments this increase might be due to improvement in net photosynthesis rate and subsequently an increase in partitioning of dry matter to produce more leaves the pgpr improved the tdw gy oil and protein content of soybean in all irrigation regime treatments in this study b licheniformis compared to b subtilis had more effects on measured traits of soybean the greatest effects of the pgpr on measured traits also were observed in i2 treatment it seems that the pgpr in the mid drought stress in comparison with hard drought stress had greater effects on the growth and yield of inoculated soybean compared to uninoculated control zahir et al 2008 reported that inoculation of plants with rhizobacteria containing acc deaminase significantly decreased the drought stress effects on growth and yield of peas pisum sativum they stated that at the lowest soil moisture level 25 field capacity rhizobacterial isolate pseudomonas fluorescens biotype g acc 5 was more promising compared with p fluorescens acc 14 and p putida biotype a q 7 as it caused maximum increases in fresh weight dry weight root length shoot length number of leaves per plant and water use efficiency compared with uninoculated controls the pgpr inoculated plant compared to uninoculated control increased significantly the rue of soybean the rue was estimated as the slope of a fitted linear relationship between the cumulative absorbed solar radiation and the tdw for each treatment the rue acutely indicated the amount of dry matter that could be produced by soybean through photosynthesis per unit of absorbed radiation thus in this linear relationship increase in the tdw is more important as the results of this study showed under the pgpr application conditions the tdw improved in the water deficit stress treatments while radiation absorption was not affected by the pgrp in all treatments a main effect of the water deficit stress is decrease in photosynthesis which arises through a reduction in leaf expansion disordered photosynthetic pathway premature leaf senescence and coupled reduction in dry matter production wahid and rasul 2005 moreover it seems that the co2 diffusion process from surrounded environmental to chloroplast is being damaged under the water deficit stress water stress induced stomatal closure restricts the co2 uptake by leaves and it could lead to an increased susceptibility to photo damage cornic and massacci 1996 the pgpr reduced drought stress either directly by producing extracellular polysaccharides trehalose 6 phosphate and solubilizing nutrients sharifi et al 2010 or by improving root growth and modulating stress related hormones sharifi and ryu 2018a sharifi and ryu 2017 also reported that the pgpr increase the aba biosynthesis in plants under water deficit stress thereby reducing water transpiration in the stomata the aba can increases primary root elongation to help the plant get to new water sources treatment of grapevines with b licheniformis under the water deficit stress increased aba production by 70 salomon et al 2014 on the other hands dodd et al 2010 found that the aba increases drought tolerance in plants by promoting stomatal closure which decreases transpiration by the stomata furthermore rhizobacteria increase the water deficit stress tolerance via lowering of the ethylene levels by hydrolysis of 1 aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylic acid acc choudhary et al 2011 zahir et al 2008 this mechanisms increase secondary root number and root hairs furthermore some bacterial determinants such as volatile compounds induce systemic tolerance to water stress by increasing proline and glycine betaine synthesis and reducing ros damage sharifi and ryu 2018b sarma and saikia 2014 demonstrated that a strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa improved the growth of vigna radiata plants under the water deficit stress naveed et al 2014 found that a main effect of pgpr inoculation on plants under water deficit stress was the improvement of leaf water status salomon et al 2014 demonstrated that grapevines inoculated by the pgpr lost 10 less water 5 conclusion the results demonstrated that the water deficit stress significantly decreased all measured traits of soybean except radiation absorption in the optimal irrigation treatment compared to treatment of water deficit stress from mid pod development stage to maturity stage the lai tdw rue decreased about 19 4 19 3 8 9 respectively decrease of gy oil and protein content due to the water deficit stress were about 60 1 18 4 and 31 6 in i1 treatment compared to i3 treatment respectively our results also showed that the pgpr improved the lai tdw rue gy oil and protein content of soybean in all irrigation regime treatments in this study b licheniformis compared to b subtilis was more effectiveness on measured traits of soybean the greatest effects of the pgpr on measured traits also were observed in i2 treatment b licheniformis improved the lai tdw rue gy oil and protein content about 14 1 13 0 15 2 22 9 18 8 and 10 5 in the i2 treatment respectively in the treatment of water deficit stress from grain filling development stage to maturity stage than other irrigation treatments the highest effects of the pgpr inoculated observed for grain yield followed by protein content and radiation use efficiency respectively therefore according to the results of this study it seems that the pgpr could improve the tdw by improving the current photosynthesis and subsequently the rue increased which ultimately improved the gy oil and protein content of soybean plants in the studied region
