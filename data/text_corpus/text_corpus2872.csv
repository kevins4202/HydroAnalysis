13 g t solid together with flocculant injection strategy on the thickening performance was examined the thickeners underflow density and overflow clarity increased with raising the slurry ph and

consumption corresponding to an annual savings of 576 000 keywords iron ore tailings thickener dewatering water recovery flocculation sedimentation 1 introduction there is a rising global demand for water because of the increasing world population changing consumption patterns and developing of high water consuming industries this necessitates reducing water consumption and improving water resources management 1 dewatering of the final concentrate and tailings of the mineral processing plants is necessary owing to substantial quantities of water accompanied by the ore minerals thickeners are recognized as one of the most cost effective technologies for water recovery from concentrate and tailings streams the concentrated slurry from the thickening process is transported to the tailings dam for disposal and the recycled water is returned to the processing plant the type of tailings embankment is generally determined by tailings properties topography geology climate

higher in the continuous shear vessel compared to those obtained in the batch cylinder 7 studies have shown that the flocculant solution ageing has a significant impact on flocculant activity and flocculation performance owen et al 2002 and 2009 9 13 sabah et al 2004 introduced dual flucculant systems for dewatering of fine coal tailings 10 the highest settling rates and the lowest turbidity were observed with nonionic cationic and anionic nonionic flocculant combinations respectively nasser and james 2006 investigated the effects of surface charge and molecular weight of anionic and cationic polyacrylamide on the flocculation characteristics of kaolinite suspensions at neutral ph to determine optimal flocculation condition 14 mcguire et al 2006 showed that polymer type anionic or non ionic polyacrylamide ph and shear have significant effects on the interfacial chemistry rheology and dewaterability of model colloidal iron oxide dispersions 11 kahane et al 2002 used computational fluid dynamics cfd modeling to improve full scale thickeners performance at worsley alumina limited collie wa australia 15 owen et al 2009 developed a cfd model of thickener feedwell incorporating flocculant adsorption to investigate the effect of flocculant injection conditions on flocculant distribution and adsorption 13 the simulation results showed that the flocculant inlet direction and velocity have a profound effect on the feedwell performance rudman et al 2010 defined efficiency measures for optimal design and operation of rakes in the gravity thickeners based on cfd simulations 16 dash et al 2011 studied the adsorption characteristics of polyacrylamide polymers on the dewatering of an iron ore tailings sample 12 the adsorption data were best fitted to the freundlich model the settling rate was found to reduce with the slurry ph and increase with the flocculant dosage aghajani shahrivar et al 2013 modeled the influence of some operating variables feed flowrate slurry solid flocculant dosage and feedwell height on the performance underflow solid and bed height of a lab scale tailings thickener 17 galvez et al 2014 proposed mathematical models for optimizing the design of dewatering systems 3 the developed models were successfully validated against some industrial case studies literature review shows that most of the research works so far have focused on batch studies which are not necessarily applicable to full scale operation the main contribution of this research study is to improve the dewatering performance of tailings thickeners of an iron beneficiation plant based on several laboratory and industrial tests conducted under various process conditions the hypothesis is the dewatering performance is affected by the process variables like flocculation dosage slurry solids slurry ph and flocculant dilution the main research question is how these variables would affect the flocculation efficiency especially in full scale dewatering system 2 tailings thickeners at sangan iron beneficiation plant laboratory and industrial tests were conducted at sangan iron beneficiation plant in the north east of iran in this plant 700 t h ore containing 51 iron is treated to produce 350 400 t h concentrate with iron contents of 63 the tailing of the iron ore beneficiation plant containing 17 iron at a mass flow rate of 300 350 t h in slurry form with 5 8 w v solids is usually dewatered in two parallel thickeners d 55 m h 6 6 m a 0 5 solution of an anionic polyacrylamide flocculant from nalco company is prepared and pumped to the tailings thickeners the thickeners underflow is transported to the tailings disposal site and the overflow is recirculated to the plant the water scarcity problem is one of the most serious challenges at sangan iron ore complex the total water consumption of the process is about 8500 m3 day which is purchased from the local water suppliers to the value of 1 m3 thus optimization of the dewatering systems for water recovery is of critical importance 3 characterization studies the slurry samples used in the experiments were taken from the feed stream of the tailings thickeners a representative sample was sent for sizing chemical and mineralogical analysis as well as zeta potential measurement the wet sizing was done at sieve sizes 150 106 75 63 45 38 and 25 μm x ray fluorescence spectroscopy xrf and x ray diffraction xrd techniques were used for chemical and mineralogical analysis of the sample respectively the zeta potential was measured by malvern zeta potentiometer at different levels of ph from 2 to 10 4 laboratory flocculation tests the batch settling tests were conducted within a 1000 ml graduated cylinder flocculation tests using the graduated cylinder were conducted by preparing the slurry with desired solids content and then adding the flocculant solution of known concentration immediately the slurry and flocculant were mixed gently by inverting the cylinder for four times prior to commencing the sedimentation process 7 a homogeneous stock solution of anionic polyacrylamide flocculant was prepared every day and used the slurry ph was adjusted by h2so4 or naoh solutions prior to adding the flocculant in the laboratory flocculation tests the effect of flocculant dosage 5 20 g t solid slurry solids concentration 3 12 ph 4 12 and flocculant dilution 0 05 1 on the performance indicators including settling rate cm s turbidity of supernatant ntu and sediment volume ml were evaluated higher settling rate and lower supernatant turbidity and sediment volume are desirable a five level four factor central composite design ccd was developed to determine the effect of different factors on the response variables table 1 a total of 33 experimental runs were conducted according to a randomized block design experimental design and statistical analysis was performed using statistica 12 software the settling rate of particles was determined from the slope of the linear section of the interface position mud line height versus time curve after 2 min settling a calibrated turbidity sensor was inserted to a distance of 50 mm below the water level to measure the supernatant turbidity the flocculated suspension was allowed to stand for a period of 10 min and the sediment volume was recorded 5 industrial dewatering tests the satisfactory laboratory findings were further extended to the full scale operations in the plant site experiments the influence of i slurry ph ii dosage of flocculant and iii flocculant injection strategy on the thickening performance indicators including the thickener underflow density kg m3 and overflow turbidity ntu were investigated the underflow density is a function of the solids ability to settle and the residence time in the thickener the thickener underflow piping is equipped with nuclear density gauge to measure the underflow density and hence slurry solids content the overflow turbidity was manually measured at several points around the overflow launder by the turbidity sensor the operating parameters of the thickeners during the experiments were recorded from the control room 6 results and discussion 6 1 characterization of tailings thickeners feed the chemical and mineralogical compositions of the tailings thickeners feed are shown in tables 2 and 3 respectively the chemical analysis shows that the most important components are fe2o3 sio2 al2o3 cao mgo with a negligible amount of other oxides the mineralogical analysis shows that the major iron bearing minerals are hematite followed by goethite the main gangue minerals identified are quartz chlorite calcite and dolomite the particle size analysis showed that d80 d50 and d20 of the sample are 31 16 and 6 5 μm respectively the zeta potential of the tailings thickeners feed as a function of ph is shown in fig 1 the results reveal that the sample exhibits positive charge at ph 2 7 and negative charge at ph 2 7 thus the point of zero charge of the sample is at phzpc 2 7 the surface charge of the particles is negative over a broad range of ph and its absolute value increases with increasing ph the surface charge is about 17 mv at the natural ph of 8 of the tailings slurry in the plant 6 2 laboratory flocculation tests in the batch sedimentation tests the influence of the process variables on the flocculation efficiency was evaluated the pareto charts presented in fig 2 highlights the standardized effects of the different factors on the settling rate supernatant turbidity and sediment volume on the pareto charts factors bars that cross the reference line are statistically significant at 95 confidence level the results indicate that the slurry ph flocculant dosage and slurry solids have the greatest influence on the settling rate respectively the settling rate increases with the flocculant dosage and slurry ph as well as reduces with the slurry solids content the interaction between ph and flocculant dosage is statistically significant at 95 confidence level thus the effect of each of these variables on the settling rate depends on the value of one another the flocculant dosage is the only significant factor affecting the residual turbidity in an inverse relationship in fact the flocculant dosage is the only factor affecting both the settling rate and the supernatant turbidity the sediment volume is much affected by the slurry solids concentration and slurry ph there is no meaningful correlation between the flocculant dilution and the performance parameters the slurry ph and solids content substantially influence the particle settling rate and sediment volume respectively while their effect on the supernatant clarity is negligible in general the flocculation performance improves at higher slurry ph and flocculate dosage and lower slurry solids content fig 3 shows in 3d surface plots the relationship between the process variables with the performance indicators the results suggest that the settling rate and the supernatant clarity increase while the sediment volume reduces with increasing the slurry ph the most dramatic influence is related to the settling rate particularly at higher polymer dosages at high flocculant dosage 20 g t the settling rate increases from 0 8 to 2 9 cm s by increasing the slurry ph from 4 to 12 the reducing effect of ph on the supernatant turbidity is more pronounced at lower flocculant dosages the sediment volume reduces from 155 to 132cc by increasing the slurry ph from 4 to 12 while the flocculant dosage is adjusted at its maximum concentration 20 g t the surface charge of particles is negative at alkaline ph and the employed flocculant is anionic hence electrostatic interactions and charge neutralization cannot be responsible for aggregation and flocs formation thus polymer bridging through hydrogen bonding between the particles surface and polymer molecule is the predominant flocculation mechanism in this system 18 ray and hogg 1987 showed that the flocs formed by bridging are larger and stronger than those formed by charge neutralization or electrostatic patch mechanism 19 more activity of the anionic flocculant at higher ph values may be related to ionizing of the carboxylate groups and uncoiling or extension of the polymer chain due to electrostatic repulsion between the charged groups on the polymer chain as the ph decreases the anionic polymers start to coil up and their activity reduce 18 20 21 the flocculant dosage has a considerable effect on the flocculation performance a significant improvement in the settling rate and the supernatant clarity is observed with increasing the polymer dosage at alkaline ph ph 12 the settling rate increases from 0 7 to 2 8 cm s and the supernatant turbidity reduces from 52 to 32 ntu by increasing the flocculant dosage from 5 g t to 20 g t there is no obvious relationship between the polymer concentration and the sediment volume at low flocculant dosage the flocs size is small due to insufficient flocculant molecules available for bridging the particles resulting in poor settling rate with increasing the flocculent dosage the amount of adsorbed polymer increases and larger flocs are formed leading to the enhanced settling rate 22 there is no clear correlation between the sediment volume and the flocculant dosage the slurry solids has a significant impact on the settling rate and the sediment volume whereas its influence on the residual turbidity is of minor importance in general the flocculation performance reduces with increasing the slurry solids content at alkaline ph ph 12 the settling rate increases from 1 1 to 2 4 cm s and the sediment volume rises from 80 to 208cc by reducing the slurry solids content from 12 to 3 this is related to non uniform distribution of the flocculant through the slurry as well as increased flocculant demand and inefficient flocculation furthermore as the proportion of solids in the slurry increases the effect of particle particle contacts become more evident because of the prevailing hindered settling conditions and the settling rate of the particles reduce 23 6 3 industrial dewatering tests 6 3 1 effect of slurry ph the laboratory tests showed that the settling rate and the supernatant clarity improved with increasing the slurry ph the effect of increasing the slurry ph on the performance of full scale thickeners was studied the ph of the tailings thickeners feed is normally around 8 for increasing the slurry ph a 50 naoh solution was prepared and added to the thickeners feed stream the operating data were collected when the process was deemed to have reached a steady state variation of slurry ph of the tailings thickeners before and after ph adjustment is shown in fig 4 the ph of thickeners increased from ph 8 1 to ph 11 2 as a result of naoh addition the effect of increasing the slurry ph on the thickeners performance parameters is presented in figs 5 and 6 the results indicate that the thickener underflow density increases from 1586 8 to 1625 7 kg m3 and the overflow turbidity reduces from 57 7 to 41 6 ntu with increasing the slurry ph from 8 1 to 11 2 quicker settling of solid particles in alkaline ph produces a more clarified overflow which can be recycled and reused in the process and a thicker underflow which can be disposed with less environmental problems improving the dewatering performance of the tailings thickeners in alkaline conditions can be attributed to more expanded position of anionic polymer chain in suspension enhancing its flocculating power in other words more activity of anionic flocculants at higher ph is related to more uncoiling or extension of the polymer structure both of which improve their bridging capability 6 3 2 effect of flocculant dosage the optimum flocculant dosage varies from operation to operation and is influenced by the mineralogical nature of the tailings particle size and slurry solids as well as system specific factors the underflow density bed level and overflow turbidity are often used as indicators of optimum flocculant demand at present the flocculant is prepared in three 4 7 m3 preparation tanks as a 0 5 solution and pumped to the tailings thickeners at a rate of 8 g t solid it is evident that the flocculant dosage is much less than one that is typically consumed in most full scale thickening operations averaging about 20 g t solid the laboratory settling tests demonstrated that flocculant dosage has a marked effect on the settling rate and supernatant turbidity studies were further extended to investigate the effect of flocculant dosage on the tailings thickeners performance figs 7 and 8 show the influence of flocculant dosage on the thickeners underflow density and overflow turbidity respectively increasing the flocculant dosage from 8 to 13 g t increases the thickener underflow density from 1589 1 to 1628 8 kg m3 and reduces the overflow turbidity from 59 9 to 44 4 ntu as the flocculant dosage increases larger flocs are formed because of more flocculant molecules available to be adsorbed on the particles which promote the particle settling rate the enhanced particle settling rate is accompanied by the formation of more clarified overflow liquid and thicker underflow slurry generally insufficient and excessive flocculant available inhibits the flocculation performance inadequate flocculant dosage cause smaller and more fragile flocs to form while the addition of large amounts of flocculent lead to re stabilization of particles 6 3 3 effect of flocculant injection strategy the mixing conditions during flocculation has a dramatic influence on the distribution and adsorption of flocculant and hence the flocculation performance the effect of mixing on the flocculation efficiency was examined in both laboratory and industrial scale in the laboratory tests not shown here the influence of number of inversions of cylinder prior to particle sedimentation 2 4 6 8 on the flocculation parameters was studied the results indicated that the number of inversions has a significant influence on the sedimentation parameters the maximum settling rate and the minimum residual turbidity were achieved with two inversions in the industrial tests the effect of flocculant sparge location on the performance of the tailings thickeners was assessed the location of the flocculant injection point should be such that turbulence will ensure a good dispersion of the flocculant with the feed slurry 13 24 the flocculant solution is currently injected into the feedwell of the tailings thickeners fig 9 test 1 a 9 2 25 m open feedwell with e duc feed dilution system is used in the tailings thickeners in another experiments the flocculant solution was added at different locations inside the feed stream and its influence on the thickening performance was examined fig 9 tests 2 and 3 the effect of flocculant sparge location on the thickeners performance is presented in figs 10 and 11 the results suggest that the underflow density and overflow clarity improve when the flocculant is distributed at different locations throughout the feed stream the underflow density increased from 1582 3 kg m3 to 1592 2 kg m3 and the overflow turbidity reduced from 79 6 ntu to 51 5 ntu the improved overflow clarity is related to effective flocculation and capturing of fine particles and preventing their short circuiting to the overflow when the flocculant in added to the feed stream the flocculant is fully absorbed by the particles and the aggregates have sufficient time to grow undisrupted in a region of lower shear and turbulence prior to entering the feedwell the literature shows that regions with medium shear rate in the range 50 150 s 1 are required for efficient flocculation 25 the worst results were obtained when the flocculant was entirely added within the feedwell this can be attributed to high level of shear and turbulence that occurs in the feedwell which enhance the aggregate breakage rate it has been shown that the direction and velocity of flocculant injection are also significant parameters affecting the feedwell and hence the flocculation performance 13 fig 12 displays the magnitude of the effect of changes in process conditions on the tailings thickeners performance the results suggest that the increasing the slurry ph and flocculant dosage have the greatest influence on the underflow density whereas changing the flocculant injection point substantially affect the overflow clarity it is expected that simultaneous application of these changes will considerably improve the dewatering performance of the tailings thickeners 6 3 4 practical implementation the promising results encouraged the company to implement the changes in the plant site over a long period the ph of feed slurry was increased from 8 to 11 by adding hydrated lime to the thickeners feeding tank the flocculant solution was distributed over the feed stream at a flow rate of 13 g t solid fig 13 shows the tailings thickeners underflow density before and after changes within a period of 186 days the results indicate that the underflow density increases from 1385 kg m3 to 1582 kg m3 in response to the changes in the process operating conditions an increase of 14 22 in the underflow density can significantly reduce the operating costs due to improving the water recovery and diminishing the volume of slurry delivered to tailings storage facilities the disposal of a slurry with higher solids concentration in beneficial to the process in terms of smaller impoundment area improved water and chemical recovery lower risk of groundwater contamination and easier final reclamation of the site increased water recovery is very important to sangan iron beneficiation plant due to the scarcity of fresh water in this area fig 14 compares the total process water consumption before and after changes the total water consumption reduces from 8564 m3 day to 6644 m3 day equal to 22 42 savings on water consumption providing an annual savings of 576 000 this corresponds approximately to a savings of around 0 4 in the plant annual turnover consequently reducing the capital and operating costs through improving the water and chemical recovery as well as minimizing tailings impoundment areas complying with environmental regulations are the main drivers for implementing the proposed changes in the plant site in recent years paste thickeners have been employed in many mining operations particularly those in arid and semi arid areas where water availability is limited the advantages of paste thickeners in dewatering and tailings disposal circuits have been well established for most minerals 26 29 the past thickeners maximize water recovery enable surface stacking of the tailings reduce impoundment area and mitigate environmental problems nevertheless yet today less than 1 of iron beneficiation plants employ paste thickeners in their dewatering circuits thus using paste thickening technology can be another alternative for improving the dewatering performance of sangan iron tailings 7 conclusion characterization studies showed that the tailings thickeners feed of sangan iron beneficiation plant is composed of hematite goethite quartz chlorite calcite and dolomite the point of zero charge of the sample was 2 7 and its zeta potential was 17 mv at the natural ph of the tailings slurry in the plant the laboratory settling studies were carried out to examine the effect of flocculant dosage slurry solids concentration ph and flocculant dilution on the flocculation performance the optimum settling conditions was achieved at higher slurry ph and flocculate dosage and lower slurry solids content the flocculant dilution was found to be insignificant in terms of the flocculation performance in the industrial studies the influence of increasing the slurry ph and flocculant dosage as well as flocculant injection strategy on the thickening performance was investigated the thickener underflow density increased from 1586 8 to 1625 7 kg m3 and the overflow turbidity reduced from 57 7 to 41 6 ntu with increasing the slurry ph from 8 1 to 11 2 increasing the flocculant dosage from 8 to 13 g t solid was associated with a rising in the thickener underflow density from 1589 1 to 1628 8 kg m3 and a falling in the overflow turbidity from 59 9 to 44 4 ntu the thickeners performance in particular the overflow clarity improved dramatically by changing the flocculant injection point from the feedwell to the feed stream the proposed modifications were accompanied by a reduction of 23 in the total water consumption corresponding to an annual savings of 576 000 the effect of slurry rheology and chemistry on the flocculation efficiency is required to be addressed in the future studies

turbidity the sediment volume is much affected by the slurry solids concentration and slurry ph there is no meaningful correlation between the flocculant dilution and the performance parameters the slurry ph and solids content substantially influence the particle settling rate and sediment volume respectively while their effect on the supernatant clarity is negligible in general the flocculation performance improves at higher slurry ph and flocculate dosage and lower slurry solids content fig 3 shows in 3d surface plots the relationship between the process variables with the performance indicators the results suggest that the settling rate and the supernatant clarity increase while the sediment volume reduces with increasing the slurry ph the most dramatic influence is related to the settling rate particularly at higher polymer dosages at high flocculant dosage 20 g t the settling rate increases from 0 8 to 2 9 cm s by increasing the slurry ph from 4 to 12 the reducing effect of ph on the supernatant turbidity is more pronounced at lower flocculant dosages the sediment volume reduces from 155 to 132cc by increasing the slurry ph from 4 to 12 while the flocculant dosage is adjusted at its maximum concentration 20 g t the surface charge of particles is negative at alkaline ph and the employed flocculant is anionic hence electrostatic interactions and charge neutralization cannot be responsible for aggregation and flocs formation thus polymer bridging through hydrogen bonding between the particles surface and polymer molecule is the predominant flocculation mechanism in this system 18 ray and hogg 1987 showed that the flocs formed by bridging are larger and stronger than those formed by charge neutralization or electrostatic patch mechanism 19 more activity of the anionic flocculant at higher ph values may be related to ionizing of the carboxylate groups and uncoiling or extension of the polymer chain due to electrostatic repulsion between the charged groups on the polymer chain as the ph decreases the anionic polymers start to coil up and their activity reduce 18 20 21 the flocculant dosage has a considerable effect on the flocculation performance a significant improvement in the settling rate and the supernatant clarity is observed with increasing the polymer dosage at alkaline ph ph 12 the settling rate increases from 0 7 to 2 8 cm s and the supernatant turbidity reduces from 52 to 32 ntu by increasing the flocculant dosage from 5 g t to 20 g t there is no obvious relationship between the polymer concentration and the sediment volume at low flocculant dosage the flocs size is small due to insufficient flocculant molecules available for bridging the particles resulting in poor settling rate with increasing the flocculent dosage the amount of adsorbed polymer increases and larger flocs are formed leading to the enhanced settling rate 22 there is no clear correlation between the sediment volume and the flocculant dosage the slurry solids has a significant impact on the settling rate and the sediment volume whereas its influence on the residual turbidity is of minor importance in general the flocculation performance reduces with increasing the slurry solids content at alkaline ph ph 12 the settling rate increases from 1 1 to 2 4 cm s and the sediment volume rises from 80 to 208cc by reducing the slurry solids content from 12 to 3 this is related to non uniform distribution of the flocculant through the slurry as well as increased flocculant demand and inefficient flocculation furthermore as the proportion of solids in the slurry increases the effect of particle particle contacts become more evident because of the prevailing hindered settling conditions and the settling rate of the particles reduce 23 6 3 industrial dewatering tests 6 3 1 effect of slurry ph the laboratory tests showed that the settling rate and the supernatant clarity improved with increasing the slurry ph the effect of increasing the slurry ph on the performance of full scale thickeners was studied the ph of the tailings thickeners feed is normally around 8 for increasing the slurry ph a 50 naoh solution was prepared and added to the thickeners feed stream the operating data were collected when the process was deemed to have reached a steady state variation of slurry ph of the tailings thickeners before and after ph adjustment is shown in fig 4 the ph of thickeners increased from ph 8 1 to ph 11 2 as a result of naoh addition the effect of increasing the slurry ph on the thickeners performance parameters is presented in figs 5 and 6 the results indicate that the thickener underflow density increases from 1586 8 to 1625 7 kg m3 and the overflow turbidity reduces from 57 7 to 41 6 ntu with increasing the slurry ph from 8 1 to 11 2 quicker settling of solid particles in alkaline ph produces a more clarified overflow which can be recycled and reused in the process and a thicker underflow which can be disposed with less environmental problems improving the dewatering performance of the tailings thickeners in alkaline conditions can be attributed to more expanded position of anionic polymer chain in suspension enhancing its flocculating power in other words more activity of anionic flocculants at higher ph is related to more uncoiling or extension of the polymer structure both of which improve their bridging capability 6 3 2 effect of flocculant dosage the optimum flocculant dosage varies from operation to operation and is influenced by the mineralogical nature of the tailings particle size and slurry solids as well as system specific factors the underflow density bed level and overflow turbidity are often used as indicators of optimum flocculant demand at present the flocculant is prepared in three 4 7 m3 preparation tanks as a 0 5 solution and pumped to the tailings thickeners at a rate of 8 g t solid it is evident that the flocculant dosage is much less than one that is typically consumed in most full scale thickening operations averaging about 20 g t solid the laboratory settling tests demonstrated that flocculant dosage has a marked effect on the settling rate and supernatant turbidity studies were further extended to investigate the effect of flocculant dosage on the tailings thickeners performance figs 7 and 8 show the influence of flocculant dosage on the thickeners underflow density and overflow turbidity respectively increasing the flocculant dosage from 8 to 13 g t increases the thickener underflow density from 1589 1 to 1628 8 kg m3 and reduces the overflow turbidity from 59 9 to 44 4 ntu as the flocculant dosage increases larger flocs are formed because of more flocculant molecules available to be adsorbed on the particles which promote the particle settling rate the enhanced particle settling rate is accompanied by the formation of more clarified overflow liquid and thicker underflow slurry generally insufficient and excessive flocculant available inhibits the flocculation performance inadequate flocculant dosage cause smaller and more fragile flocs to form while the addition of large amounts of flocculent lead to re stabilization of particles 6 3 3 effect of flocculant injection strategy the mixing conditions during flocculation has a dramatic influence on the distribution and adsorption of flocculant and hence the flocculation performance the effect of mixing on the flocculation efficiency was examined in both laboratory and industrial scale in the laboratory tests not shown here the influence of number of inversions of cylinder prior to particle sedimentation 2 4 6 8 on the flocculation parameters was studied the results indicated that the number of inversions has a significant influence on the sedimentation parameters the maximum settling rate and the minimum residual turbidity were achieved with two inversions in the industrial tests the effect of flocculant sparge location on the performance of the tailings thickeners was assessed the location of the flocculant injection point should be such that turbulence will ensure a good dispersion of the flocculant with the feed slurry 13 24 the flocculant solution is currently injected into the feedwell of the tailings thickeners fig 9 test 1 a 9 2 25 m open feedwell with e duc feed dilution system is used in the tailings thickeners in another experiments the flocculant solution was added at different locations inside the feed stream and its influence on the thickening performance was examined fig 9 tests 2 and 3 the effect of flocculant sparge location on the thickeners performance is presented in figs 10 and 11 the results suggest that the underflow density and overflow clarity improve when the flocculant is distributed at different locations throughout the feed stream the underflow density increased from 1582 3 kg m3 to 1592 2 kg m3 and the overflow turbidity reduced from 79 6 ntu to 51 5 ntu the improved overflow clarity is related to effective flocculation and capturing of fine particles and preventing their short circuiting to the overflow when the flocculant in added to the feed stream the flocculant is fully absorbed by the particles and the aggregates have sufficient time to grow undisrupted in a region of lower shear and turbulence prior to entering the feedwell the literature shows that regions with medium shear rate in the range 50 150 s 1 are required for efficient flocculation 25 the worst results were obtained when the flocculant was entirely added within the feedwell this can be attributed to high level of shear and turbulence that occurs in the feedwell which enhance the aggregate breakage rate it has been shown that the direction and velocity of flocculant injection are also significant parameters affecting the feedwell and hence the flocculation performance 13 fig 12 displays the magnitude of the effect of changes in process conditions on the tailings thickeners performance the results suggest that the increasing the slurry ph and flocculant dosage have the greatest influence on the underflow density whereas changing the flocculant injection point substantially affect the overflow clarity it is expected that simultaneous application of these changes will considerably improve the dewatering performance of the tailings thickeners 6 3 4 practical implementation the promising results encouraged the company to implement the changes in the plant site over a long period the ph of feed slurry was increased from 8 to 11 by adding hydrated lime to the thickeners feeding tank the flocculant solution was distributed over the feed stream at a flow rate of 13 g t solid fig 13 shows the tailings thickeners underflow density before and after changes within a period of 186 days the results indicate that the underflow density increases from 1385 kg m3 to 1582 kg m3 in response to the changes in the process operating conditions an increase of 14 22 in the underflow density can significantly reduce the operating costs due to improving the water recovery and diminishing the volume of slurry delivered to tailings storage facilities the disposal of a slurry with higher solids concentration in beneficial to the process in terms of smaller impoundment area improved water and chemical recovery lower risk of groundwater contamination and easier final reclamation of the site increased water recovery is very important to sangan iron beneficiation plant due to the scarcity of fresh water in this area fig 14 compares the total process water consumption before and after changes the total water consumption reduces from 8564 m3 day to 6644 m3 day equal to 22 42 savings on water consumption providing an annual savings of 576 000 this corresponds approximately to a savings of around 0 4 in the plant annual turnover consequently reducing the capital and operating costs through improving the water and chemical recovery as well as minimizing tailings impoundment areas complying with environmental regulations are the main drivers for implementing the proposed changes in the plant site in recent years paste thickeners have been employed in many mining operations particularly those in arid and semi arid areas where water availability is limited the advantages of paste thickeners in dewatering and tailings disposal circuits have been well established for most minerals 26 29 the past thickeners maximize water recovery enable surface stacking of the tailings reduce impoundment area and mitigate environmental problems nevertheless yet today less than 1 of iron beneficiation plants employ paste thickeners in their dewatering circuits thus using paste thickening technology can be another alternative for improving the dewatering performance of sangan iron tailings 7 conclusion characterization studies showed that the tailings thickeners feed of sangan iron beneficiation plant is composed of hematite goethite quartz chlorite calcite and dolomite the point of zero charge of the sample was 2 7 and its zeta potential was 17 mv at the natural ph of the tailings slurry in the plant the laboratory settling studies were carried out to examine the effect of flocculant dosage slurry solids concentration ph and flocculant dilution on the flocculation performance the optimum settling conditions was achieved at higher slurry ph and flocculate dosage and lower slurry solids content the flocculant dilution was found to be insignificant in terms of the flocculation performance in the industrial studies the influence of increasing the slurry ph and flocculant dosage as well as flocculant injection strategy on the thickening performance was investigated the thickener underflow density increased from 1586 8 to 1625 7 kg m3 and the overflow turbidity reduced from 57 7 to 41 6 ntu with increasing the slurry ph from 8 1 to 11 2 increasing the flocculant dosage from 8 to 13 g t solid was associated with a rising in the thickener underflow density from 1589 1 to 1628 8 kg m3 and a falling in the overflow turbidity from 59 9 to 44 4 ntu the thickeners performance in particular the overflow clarity improved dramatically by changing the flocculant injection point from the feedwell to the feed stream the proposed modifications were accompanied by a reduction of 23 in the total water consumption corresponding to an annual savings of 576 000 the effect of slurry rheology and chemistry on the flocculation efficiency is required to be addressed in the future studies

14361,the disposal of industrial effluents containing dyes in wastewater streams is a serious environmental concern due to their synthetic origin and complex molecular structure making these compounds difficult to biodegrade in this work dual functional psf pva membranes modified by separately incorporating silica and zno nanoparticles were fabricated for the removal of congo red dye in aqueous solutions removal efficiency was tested using a dead end filtration setup it was found that theremoval mechanism of the dye molecules was through adsorption and rejection the highest dye removal capacity 53 5 was achieved by psf pva zno 0 5 w t membrane the removal capacity of the membranes decreased during reusability studies the highest removal capacity obtained at the second cycles was 31 1 this study shows that membranes that have a re usabilitypotential and have a dual removal mechanism can be fabricated by incorporating silica and zno nanoparticles keywords dual functional membranes ultrafiltration removal capacity congo red dye 1 introduction the development of membranes with multifunctional properties and less energy consumption during application for the removal of pollutants has attracted interest in membrane technology integration of nanotechnology and membrane technology has led to numerous advances in membrane design 1 this has enabled controlling the pore structure of membranes therefore improving the hydrophilicity and permeates flux of the nanocomposite membrane these nano architectured membranes have proven to be more reactive rather than just behaving as a physical barrier for the passage of solutes 2 integrating nanoparticles in polymeric membranes results in long lasting membranes as it decelerates the membrane fouling process which has become a limitation in the large scale application of membranes as mentioned earlier the pore size is an important parameter in membrane design as it differentiates on the type of membrane process to be utilized for example ultrafiltration uf membranes have pore sizes ranging from 3 to 100 nm and are suitable for removing colloidal or molecular particles proteins most bacteria partially viruses at low pressure whilst generating high fluxes 3 however due to the size of the pores uf membranes are unable to selectively remove low molecules or ionic contaminants from aqueous solutions 4 therefore there is a high demand of developing multifunctional membranes for the efficient removal of both large molecules and ionic contaminants from water using a one step procedure this can be achieved by fabricating uf membranes with both rejection and adsorption functionalities for low cost and efficient water decontamination the use of nano adsorbents for the removal of contaminants with low molecular weight is a promising approach due to the high surface area abundant sorption sites and fast adsorption kinetics 5 6 however due their size nanoparticles as adsorbents require posttreatment for their complete separation of from the aqueous solutions after adsorption adding up on the application costs of these nano adsorbents furthermore it is difficult to use nanoparticles for the removal of macromolecules and particulates a strategy to overcome these shortcomings of using nano adsorbents for water purification is by embedding these nanoparticles in polymer matrices forming an ultrafiltration nanocomposite membrane which will not only act as barrier to pollutants but also possessing synergistic effects 7 to this date many adsorbents have been incorporated in polymer matrices to modify the properties of filtration membranes for example silver nanoparticles agnps and carbon nanotubes have been introduced in polymeric matrices to introduce antimicrobial properties to the resultant membranes 8 titania 9 zinc oxide 10 and graphene oxide have been reported to introduce photocatalytic properties in membranes incorporating nanoparticles in the polymeric casting solution will inevitably decrease the membrane selectivity due to the formation of leaky interfacial voids and non selective membrane defects 11 the adsorption properties exhibited by these nanocomposite membranes are unsatisfactory due the low loading of nanoparticles 6 w t that can be incorporated while preserving the uf functionality of these membranes 12 another reason for the unsatisfactory adsorption functionality in nanocomposite membranes is due to the polymer layer coating the incorporated nano adsorbents this therefore reduces the number of active adsorption sites causing reduction in the adsorption performance of the nanocomposite membranes pan et al 2017 investigated the simultaneous removal of model pollutants colloidal gold polyethylene glycol peg and lead ii pb2 ions from a mixed matrix membrane the removal of these contaminants was facilitated through using polyether sulfone pes polyethyleneimine pei poly vinylpyrrolidone pvp blend membranes and nanocomposite blended membrane the dual functional ultrafiltration dfuf membranes were modified by entrapping hollow porous zirconium hydroxide nanoparticles in the finger like structure of the membranes instead of incorporating these nanoparticles in the polymer matrix the filtration results in a dead end cell studies displayed that these membranes had a high performance as they were able to reduce the concentration of pb2 100 pm to 10 ppm while simultaneously achieving a 97 6 and 98 removal for colloidal silver and peg respectively this removal capacity of the dfuf membranes showed 2 1 fold increase in removal efficiency of the pollutants as compared to the blended membranes 13 another study by tomina et al 2015 investigated the performance of ceramic membranes functionalized with h s groups for the removal of silver i ag ions from the results it was observed that the membranes with the lowest degree of modification possessed high fluxes and low removal capacities while membranes with high degree of modification were characterized by low fluxes but high removal capacities of ag 70 90 the removal mechanism of ag ions was mainly attributed to the interaction of ag ions with the h s groups on the surface of the functionalized membrane the removal capacity of these ions as a function of time decreased due to the saturation of adsorption sites on the membrane surface it was observed that the permeate flux decreased as a function of time due to the compaction of the membranes this study showed that the retention of ag ions was not based on size exclusion mechanism as the membrane was operated at low pressures 0 6 bars 14 this study is focused on the removal of congo red dye 3 3 1 1 biphenyl 4 4 diyl bis 4 aminonaphthalene 1 sulfonic acid using psf pva sio2 or zno membranes the membranes were cast using a two bilayer casting technique where the first layer was the polymer matrix without nanoparticles and the second layer was a polymer matrix with nanoparticles therefore exposing the nanoparticles on the membrane surface this enhanced the interaction between the nanoparticles and dye molecules this was done to minimize the covering of the nanoparticles by the rigid polymer layer which may result in the reduced number or effective adsorption sites and thus decreasing the adsorption capacity 2 experimental 2 1 materials all chemicals ar grade were purchased from sigma aldrich south africa and these were used without any modification polysulfone psf acs reagent powdered poly vinyl alcohol 87 89 acs reagent and n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp were used to prepare different polymeric matrices hydrochloric acid 98 acs reagent was used to hydrolyse the crosslinking agent dl malic acid tetraethyl ortho silicate teos and nitrate zn no3 2 were used as precursors for the synthesis of sio2 and zno nanoparticles respectively congo red dye cr direct red 28 used in this study is the sodium salt of benzidinenediazo bis 1 naphthylamine 4 sulfonic acid and was purchased from sigma aldrich 2 2 psf pva sio2 and psf pva zno nanocomposite membranes mesoporous silica nanoparticles snps were synthesized following a modified procedure reported by zhao and co workers 1998 15 mesoporous silica nanoparticles snps were synthesized following a modified procedure reported by zhao and co workers 1 4 g of p123 porosity precursor was dissolved in 120 ml of 2 m hcl and 30 ml of deionized water di water the mixture was vigorously stirred at ambient conditions until the surfactant had been completely dissolved 9 1 ml teos was added into the mixture and the temperature was increase to 45 c for 5 h under stirring a white precipitate was formed the temperature was then raised to 90 c for 18 h at static conditions the mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature solids were filtered and washed 3 times with water and acetone and finally the nanoparticles denoted as snps were calcined at 550 c for 6 h the reaction mechanisms are shown fig 1 some of the silica nanoparticles were then functionalized with methyl functional groups to make them less hydrophilic for the purposes of membrane distillation snps 0 9 g were dispersed in hexamethyldisilane hdms figure s1 and the mixture was vigorously stirred for 5 h at 30 c to functionalize the snps with hydrophobic methyl groups after functionalizing the silica mixture was filtered and washed several times with pentane the resultant material denoted as mfsnps was dispersed in pentane and the mixture was vigorously stirred for 1 h at 30 c to wash off all the hmds from the nanoparticles the mfsnps were filtered and vacuum dried at 120 c zinc oxide nanoparticles were prepared using a synthesis route reported by gusatti et al 2 sodium hydroxide was dissolved in deionized water and the resultant solution was heated at 70 c under constant stirring to oxidize the reaction a solution of zn no3 2 was added drop wise over 1 h into the beaker containing the naoh aqueous solution under constant stirring the resulting mixture was stirred for 2 h at 70 c the precipitate formed was filtered and washed several times with deionized water to remove impurities the washed sample was dried overnight at 65 c in an oven the weighed mass of psf pva ratio of 80 20 was dissolved separately in different beakers using n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp as a common solvent both mixtures were stirred until the polymers were dissolved using a magnetic starrier after dissolving the two solutions were mixed together to form a polymer blend under constant stirring to produce a homogenous mixture then a specified weight percentage of the crosslinking agent d malic acid was added to obtain the desired theoretical crosslinking degree this was followed by the addition of 2 m hydrochloric acid hcl into the polymer blend under constant stirring to hydrolyse the crosslinking agent and homogenize the crosslinked psf pva solution cross linking degree was calculated using eq 1 1 x w c l m w p s f u n i t 2 w p s f m w c l 100 where wpsf and wcl represent the weight of psf and the crosslinking agent respectively mwpsf unit and mwcl represent the molecular weight of the psf monomer and that of the crosslinking agent hydrochloric acid hcl was added into the polymer matrix to hydrolyze the crosslinking agent nanoparticle loading in membranes are ms 1 0 1 ms 2 0 2 ms 3 0 3 for sio2 and mz 1 0 1 mz 1 01 mz 2 0 mz 3 0 3 for zno modified membranes ms and mz membranes respectively 2 3 characterization techniques the fabricated nanocomposite membranes were characterised using fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflection ftir atr spectroscopy perkin elmer ftir spectrometer frontier optica to obtain a good representation of the surface functional groups on the nanoparticles and membrane surface x ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectro xps was used to confirm the elemental compositions of the nanoparticles the size distribution of nanoparticles was determined by the dynamic light scattering dls technique using a malvern zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd gb the zinc oxide nanoparticles were first dispersed in water and sonicated for 5 min prior to the measurement of size and zeta potential zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd gb uses laser doppler velocimetry to determine electrophoretic mobility of the nanoparticles the zeta potential was obtained from the electrophoretic mobility using the smoluchowski equation water contact angle analysis was performed to assess the hydrophilic properties of the membranes using a dsa3oe kruss drop shape analyzer gnbh germany the surface morphologies of the nanocomposite membranes were investigated by a scanning electron microscopy sem jeol jsm it300 membranes were sputter coated with carbon before analysis atomic force micrographs were obtained from atomic force microscopy afm witec alpha 300 atomic force microscope wi tec gmbh germany to investigate the changes in the membrane surface due to the incorporation of nanoparticles themembrane surface elemental composition was analysed using an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer eds oxford instruments attached to the sem surface roughness parameters were calculated by control four software witec gmbh germany the zeta potentials of the different types of nanocomposite membranes were determined by measurements of streaming potential at different phs over a range of 2 to 12 using a surpass electro kinetic analyser anton paar gmbh austria with a background electrolyte of 10 mm kcl 2 4 performance tests purewaterflux a filtration cell operated in dead end mode was used during the filtration experiments and the pressure was maintained at 0 5 bar to maximize the retention time for filtration of the feed solution the membranes were first compacted at 1 bar until the flux was stabilized flux variation was less than 5 then the pure water flux was measured rejection the dye stock solution 1000 mg ml was prepared by weighing and dissolving 1 g of cr dye into a 1 l of deionized di water under vigorous stirring for 3 4 h the experimental feed solutions were obtained by diluting the dye stock solutions to 100 mg l in a 2 l volumetric flask the filtrate samples were collected after reaching a steady flux rate and the feed was vigorously stirred to maintain homogenous mixture of the feed solution the rejection rate was estimated by the difference in the concentration of feed and permeate obtained by using uv vis spectroscopy the removal efficiencies of the membranes were calculated using eq 1 1 re m o v a l c f c p t c f x 100 where cf and cp are the feed and permeate concentrations respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of nanoparticles ftir spectra of the nanoparticles are shown in fig 2 it shows peaks corresponding to si o stretching and o si o deformation vibrations due to bending were observed at 1107 and 762 cm 1 respectively metal oxides absorb ir below the finger print region 1000 cm 1 however a broad band at 3000 3500 cm 1 can be observed on the zno ftir spectra this peak is attributed to the characteristic adsorption of hydroxyl groups by the zno nanoparticles the intense peak at 1465 cm 1 is due to the bending of the water molecules on the zno surface the peak at 650 cm 1 is due to the presence of the zn o bond the peak at 800 cm 1 is an unresolved peak due to impurities in the precipitate while the peak at 1585 cm 1 is due to zn no3angular deformation since zinc nitrate was used as a zinc precursor during the synthesis of the nanoparticles fig 3 shows the effect of ph on zeta potential of silica and zinc oxide nanoparticles the value of zeta potential for silica and zinc oxide nanoparticles at ph 7 5 was 25 and 35 mv respectively the zeta potential of the nanoparticles increased with decreasing ph due to the addition of h ions from hcl and decreased with the increase of ph due to the presence of oh ions from naoh the zeta potential of silica nanoparticles was negatively charged through out the 4 to 9 5 ph range therefore it is expected that the zeta potential of membranes modified by silica nanoparticles will be lower compared to membranes modified with zinc oxide nanoparticles the point of zero charge for zno nanoparticles was reached at ph 8unlike in silica nanoparticles where the surface remained negative the implication here is that the silica nanoparticles will impart a negative surface on the membrane over a wide range of ph 2 to 10 while the zinc oxide nano particles will remain predominately positive at neutral to acidic conditions the particle size of the nanoparticles can be influenced by several factors such as sonication of nanoparticles and the dispersant used the sizes of the nanoparticles for sio2 is 252 7 and zno 330 6 after dispersing the nanoparticles in water and sonicating them for 5 min the zinc oxide nanoparticles were larger than the silica nanoparticles particle size is related to surface area of the nanoparticles where large particles have a lower surface area than small particles this means that the silica nanoparticles had a higher surface area as compared to zinc nanoparticles therefore silica membranes are expected to show high rejection of lead ions due to electrostatic interactions the application of xps generally allows an in depth analysis of the surface of the prepared materials it is specifically used to analyse the elemental composition or state of the elements present a broad scan typically from 1200 ev to 0 ev will establish a gross elemental composition of the sample s surface in this study the o1 s scan was performed to ascertain bonding state of the oxygen fig 5 shows the survey spectra of zno and sio2 peaks corresponding to zno i e zn 2p 3s 3p 3d zn auger zn lmm and o 1s were observed confirming the successful synthesis of zno fig 4 a in fig 4 b sio2 related peaks can be observed i e si 2 s 2p and o1 s carbon contamination as an unreacted residual or surface contamination was not observed implying the successful decomposition of the unreacted organics during calcination of the nanoparticles xps elemental analysis in this study was performed to confirm the successful oxygenation of the zinc and silica precursors during the synthesis of zno and sio2 respectively fig 6 presents the o1 s high resolution scan of zno and silica in fig 5 a the overall deconvoluted peak consists of two peaks the peaks at 528 and 530 mv are attributed to oxygen in zinc oxide bonding 17 this confirms the successful oxidation of zinc nitrate to form zinc oxide nanoparticles the overall deconvoluted peaks in fig 5 b consists of a single peak ascribed to o1 s confirming the successful oxygenation of the silicon precursor teos 18 these results concur with the ftir spectra reported for the nanoparticles 3 2 membrane characteristics contact angle is a surface technique used to evaluate the surface properties of the membranes 19 in this study the contact angle was used to compare the relative hydrophilicity as the nanoparticle loading was increased as it can be observed in figure s2 the increase in nanoparticle loading resulted in a general decrease in the water contact angle for all membranes with 0 2 increase of the nanoparticles loading for example a 17 decrease in the contact angle was observed in silica modified psf pva membranes when the silica loading was further increased to 0 5 wt the water angle decreased from 48o to about 43 a 10 decrease in zno modified membranes it was observed that the first 0 2 filler loading resulted in a lower percentage decrease 9 8 and further increment to 0 5 zno in membrane resulted in a 13 decrease in the contact angle the decrease in contact angle due to an increase in sio2 is due to the hydroxyl groups on the silica nanoparticles forming hydrophilic network on the membrane surface the decrease in the contact angle in psf pva nanoparticles is attributed to the steric stabilization due to the presence of pva in the matrix 20 the presence of pva stabilizes nanoparticles and prevents the nanoparticle aggregation through the presence of intra and inter molecular hydroxyl bonding with the hydroxyl groups of the nanoparticles 21 the surface morphology of the membranes was evaluated using sem it can be observed that when psf was modified with only pva the membrane surface had more apparent and evenly distributed pores with similar pore geometry as observed in fig 3 a upon addition of high amount of silica nanoparticles figure s3 b nanoparticle agglomerates were observed on the membrane surface even at low magnification x 500 this could mean that even in the presence of pva silica nanoparticles will aggregate on the surface of the membrane the double casting procedure showed no visible difference in the visual pore distribution than the normally cast in figure s3 b the surface of the zno 0 5 wt modified membrane was observed to have unevenly distributed pores which is attributed to the miscibility of the zno nanoparticles and the polymer blend the nanoparticles were also observed to aggregate in order to confirm the presence of the nanoparticles on the surface of the membranes an eds scan was performed it revealed thatthere were no nanoparticles on the psf pva membrane since the present peaks indicated the presence of only carbon oxygen and sulphur elements that are present in the psf and pva polymers figure s4 a the silica and zinc oxide modified membranes as observed in figure s4 b and c showed additional peaks associated with si and zn confirming the incorporation of the nanoparticles in the membranes and their presence on the membrane surface streaming potential measurements of the fabricated ultrafiltration membranes determine the change of the zeta potential of the membranes as a function of ph zeta potential is a measure of magnitude of electrostatic interactions between charged surfaces formed at the interphase of the liquid solid interphase in a system 22 the zeta potential of the membranes represents the surface charge which occurs in presence of an aqueous solution when functional groups dissociate from the membrane surface 23 the net surface charge of the nanocomposite membrane is influenced by the zeta potentials of the incorporated nanoparticles due ionisable groups on the membrane surface 4 the measured zeta potential of the zno modified membranes varied linearly in the ph region 4 to 10 while the sio2 modified membranes varied linearly with ph over the entire measured ph range most importantly the ms membranes had a negative potential over the measured ph this is particulary important for ionic solute rejection either by repulsion of adsorption the ph dependent streaming potential measurements observed helped in the identification of the isoelectric point an isoelectric point is the ph value where the zeta potential of the membranes is zero in figure s5 it can be observed that the isoelectric point of the membranes shifts towards a lower ph with increasing content of the nanoparticles suggesting the increase in membrane hydrophilicity the zno modified membranes figure s5 b showed negative zeta potentials in the ph range of 5 12 whereas the sio2 modified membranes had negative zeta potentials over the entire measured ph range 2 12 indicating their strong hydrophilic properties and suggesting strong electrostatic interactions during the rejection of the studied pollutants two isoelectric points were observed for mz membranes indicating heterogeneous composition on membrane surface this means that the zno membranes may react with both positively and negatively charged pollutants the tensile strength of the membranes was measured to establish the effect of crosslinking and nanoparticle loading in the fabricated membranes previous studies have reported that mechanical properties of membranes may be compromised in resultant membranes prepared from polymer blends 24 this is because of the different solubility of the polymers resulting in low miscibility due to dispersion of the molecules and phase interactions between the components of the polymer blends however crosslinking reactions in polymers have received significant interests due to the efficiency in improving the mechanical properties of membranes 25 table 1 shows that crosslinking the membranes increases elongation by 2 this indicates the improved tensile strength of the membrane since crosslinking shifted the breaking point of the membrane from point of lower stress 4 n mm2 to a point of higher stress 11 n mm2 in previous studies the incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles in polymeric matrices has been reported to enhance physical mechanical and chemical stability of the composite membrane 26 however at high nanoparticle loading the tensile strength is slowly compromised due to the nanoparticles interfering with the phases between the polymer molecules 11 figure s6 shows the effect of nanoparticles loading on the membrane tensile strength it can be observed that the tensile strength increased with increasing loading of the nanoparticles since the solution with the nanoparticles was cast as a thin top layer it is presumed that there was little interference with membrane mechanical properties also due to heat induced solvent evaporation a dense skin layer on the membrane surface was formed further increasing the tensile strength of the membrane 27 3 3 ultrafiltration performance of the membranes the filtration performance of the fabricated nanocomposite membranes was evaluated by permeate flux and removal efficiency of cr dye a similar result was obtained by modi et al 28 where in increase in pure water permeability was improved when zno carboxylated graphite oxide nanoparticle loading was increased improved hydrophilicity as a result of hydroxyl and epoxy functional groups was cited as the main reason for the increased performance the permeate flux increased with increasing loading of the nanoparticles fig 6 a this means that the porosity of membranes was improved with increasing nanoparticle loading in addition to the observed hydrophilicity the permeate flux was higher during the second cycle as compared to the first cycle this may be attributed by the membrane cleaning procedure which may have resulted in membrane deformations during uf the physical sieving phenomena is the main driving force which controls the rejection of macromolecules based on the pore sizes of the membrane 29 additional to molecular sieving the charge of the pollutants donnan exclusion membrane hydrophilic properties and swelling rate of the membranes contribute to the membrane selectivity 30 it was observed that the removal efficiency of pb2 ions increased with increasing nanoparticle loading fig 6 b however the rejection rate for sio2 modified membranes was higher than those modified using zno nanoparticles at highest nanoparticle loading 0 5 w t the highest removal efficiency obtained was 72 for ms 3 and 56 for mz 3 these results indicate a rejection due to electrostatic forces resulting from the negative zeta potential of the membrane surfaces however due to the small size of pb2 ions their removal would be attributed to electrostatic interactions on the exposed nanoparticles on the membrane surface the main mechanism of their adsorption is due to negatively charged hydroxyl groups interacting with positively charged lead ions this increases the adsorption of pb2 ions from water this adsorption is stronger in sio2 loaded membranes than in zno membranes as observed by the zeta potential of the nanoparticles and the observed removal efficiencies cr is an anionic dye meaning it deprotonate in aqueous solutions to give negatively charged ions 31 therefore in solution cr dye is negatively charged and can be rejected due to electrostatic interactions between the molecules of the dye and the membrane surface in addition to electrostatic interactions during the removal of cr size exclusion due to membrane pores also plays an important role in the first cycle fig 7 b the zno modified membranes showed a higher removal efficiency than the silica modified membranes the removal efficiency in both types of the membranes increased with increasing nanoparticle loading indicating a rejection due to electrostatic interaction and size exclusion as it is a macromolecule in the second cycle the removal efficiencies for both lead ions and crd dye were lower than the removal efficiencies obtained in the second cycle this was attributed to the formation of membrane defects resulting in the increase in the membrane flux and compromising the selectivity of the membranes the highest obtained removal efficiency was 60 for membrane with the highest loading of zinc oxide nanoparticles and 34 for the membrane with highest loading of silica nanoparticles during the first cycle the selectivity of the membranes decreased in the second cycle the recovered membrane selectivity was 39 62 for mz 3 and 31 5 ms 3 membranes suggesting that deformations were formed in the membrane structure to confirm the formation of deformations a third cycle was performed a further significant increase in the water flux and decrease in membrane selectivity was observed see figure s7 the highest obtained rejection of cr dye molecules was 11 6 for mz 3 this may mean that there were surface changes on the membranes due to the backwashing with deionized water and soaking the membranes in naclo such as the removal of the nanoparticles on the membranes surface this was confirmed by the passage of lead ions through the membrane meaning there was no or less electrostatic interaction between lead ions and the nanoparticle on the membrane surface 4 conclusion in this work dual functional membranes for the removal of cr dye and pb2 ions were fabricated and tested the pore morphology and geometry were improved with increasing nanoparticles loading the contact angles of the membranes were reduced with increasing weight percentage of the nanoparticles resulting in improved hydrophilicity of the membrane malic acid improved the membrane tensile strength by two folds higher nanoparticle loading resulted in the improved performance in both the membrane selectivity and permeate flux the point of zero charges of the membranes suggested rejection due to electrostatic interactions for the cr and adsorption of the lead ions the sio2

14361,the disposal of industrial effluents containing dyes in wastewater streams is a serious environmental concern due to their synthetic origin and complex molecular structure making these compounds difficult to biodegrade in this work dual functional psf pva membranes modified by separately incorporating silica and zno nanoparticles were fabricated for the removal of congo red dye in aqueous solutions removal efficiency was tested using a dead end filtration setup it was found that theremoval mechanism of the dye molecules was through adsorption and rejection the highest dye removal capacity 53 5 was achieved by psf pva zno 0 5 w t membrane the removal capacity of the membranes decreased during reusability studies the highest removal capacity obtained at the second cycles was 31 1 this study shows that membranes that have a re usabilitypotential and have a dual removal mechanism can be fabricated by incorporating silica and zno nanoparticles keywords dual functional membranes ultrafiltration removal capacity congo red dye 1 introduction the development of membranes with multifunctional properties and less energy consumption during application for the removal of pollutants has attracted interest in membrane technology integration of nanotechnology and membrane technology has led to numerous advances in membrane design 1 this has enabled controlling the pore structure of membranes therefore improving the hydrophilicity and permeates flux of the nanocomposite membrane these nano architectured membranes have proven to be more reactive rather than just behaving as a physical barrier for the passage of solutes 2 integrating nanoparticles in polymeric membranes results in long lasting membranes as it decelerates the membrane fouling process which has become a limitation in the large scale application of membranes as mentioned earlier the pore size is an important parameter in membrane design as it differentiates on the type of membrane process to be utilized for example ultrafiltration uf membranes have pore sizes ranging from 3 to 100 nm and are suitable for removing colloidal or molecular particles proteins most bacteria partially viruses at low pressure whilst generating high fluxes 3 however due to the size of the pores uf membranes are unable to selectively remove low molecules or ionic contaminants from aqueous solutions 4 therefore there is a high demand of developing multifunctional membranes for the efficient removal of both large molecules and ionic contaminants from water using a one step procedure this can be achieved by fabricating uf membranes with both rejection and adsorption functionalities for low cost and efficient water decontamination the use of nano adsorbents for the removal of contaminants with low molecular weight is a promising approach due to the high surface area abundant sorption sites and fast adsorption kinetics 5 6 however due their size nanoparticles as adsorbents require posttreatment for their complete separation of from the aqueous solutions after adsorption adding up on the application costs of these nano adsorbents furthermore it is difficult to use nanoparticles for the removal of macromolecules and particulates a strategy to overcome these shortcomings of using nano adsorbents for water purification is by embedding these nanoparticles in polymer matrices forming an ultrafiltration nanocomposite membrane which will not only act as barrier to pollutants but also possessing synergistic effects 7 to this date many adsorbents have been incorporated in polymer matrices to modify the properties of filtration membranes for example silver nanoparticles agnps and carbon nanotubes have been introduced in polymeric matrices to introduce antimicrobial properties to the resultant membranes 8 titania 9 zinc oxide 10 and graphene oxide have been reported to introduce photocatalytic properties in membranes incorporating nanoparticles in the polymeric casting solution will inevitably decrease the membrane selectivity due to the formation of leaky interfacial voids and non selective membrane defects 11 the adsorption properties exhibited by these nanocomposite membranes are unsatisfactory due the low loading of nanoparticles 6 w t that can be incorporated while preserving the uf functionality of these membranes 12 another reason for the unsatisfactory adsorption functionality in nanocomposite membranes is due to the polymer layer coating the incorporated nano adsorbents this therefore reduces the number of active adsorption sites causing reduction in the adsorption performance of the nanocomposite membranes pan et al 2017 investigated the simultaneous removal of model pollutants colloidal gold polyethylene glycol peg and lead ii pb2 ions from a mixed matrix membrane the removal of these contaminants was facilitated through using polyether sulfone pes polyethyleneimine pei poly vinylpyrrolidone pvp blend membranes and nanocomposite blended membrane the dual functional ultrafiltration dfuf membranes were modified by entrapping hollow porous zirconium hydroxide nanoparticles in the finger like structure of the membranes instead of incorporating these nanoparticles in the polymer matrix the filtration results in a dead end cell studies displayed that these membranes had a high performance as they were able to reduce the concentration of pb2 100 pm to 10 ppm while simultaneously achieving a 97 6 and 98 removal for colloidal silver and peg respectively this removal capacity of the dfuf membranes showed 2 1 fold increase in removal efficiency of the pollutants as compared to the blended membranes 13 another study by tomina et al 2015 investigated the performance of ceramic membranes functionalized with h s groups for the removal of silver i ag ions from the results it was observed that the membranes with the lowest degree of modification possessed high fluxes and low removal capacities while membranes with high degree of modification were characterized by low fluxes but high removal capacities of ag 70 90 the removal mechanism of ag ions was mainly attributed to the interaction of ag ions with the h s groups on the surface of the functionalized membrane the removal capacity of these ions as a function of time decreased due to the saturation of adsorption sites on the membrane surface it was observed that the permeate flux decreased as a function of time due to the compaction of the membranes this study showed that the retention of ag ions was not based on size exclusion mechanism as the membrane was operated at low pressures 0 6 bars 14 this study is focused on the removal of congo red dye 3 3 1 1 biphenyl 4 4 diyl bis 4 aminonaphthalene 1 sulfonic acid using psf pva sio2 or zno membranes the membranes were cast using a two bilayer casting technique where the first layer was the polymer matrix without nanoparticles and the second layer was a polymer matrix with nanoparticles therefore exposing the nanoparticles on the membrane surface this enhanced the interaction between the nanoparticles and dye molecules this was done to minimize the covering of the nanoparticles by the rigid polymer layer which may result in the reduced number or effective adsorption sites and thus decreasing the adsorption capacity 2 experimental 2 1 materials all chemicals ar grade were purchased from sigma aldrich south africa and these were used without any modification polysulfone psf acs reagent powdered poly vinyl alcohol 87 89 acs reagent and n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp were used to prepare different polymeric matrices hydrochloric acid 98 acs reagent was used to hydrolyse the crosslinking agent dl malic acid tetraethyl ortho silicate teos and nitrate zn no3 2 were used as precursors for the synthesis of sio2 and zno nanoparticles respectively congo red dye cr direct red 28 used in this study is the sodium salt of benzidinenediazo bis 1 naphthylamine 4 sulfonic acid and was purchased from sigma aldrich 2 2 psf pva sio2 and psf pva zno nanocomposite membranes mesoporous silica nanoparticles snps were synthesized following a modified procedure reported by zhao and co workers 1998 15 mesoporous silica nanoparticles snps were synthesized following a modified procedure reported by zhao and co workers 1 4 g of p123 porosity precursor was dissolved in 120 ml of 2 m hcl and 30 ml of deionized water di water the mixture was vigorously stirred at ambient conditions until the surfactant had been completely dissolved 9 1 ml teos was added into the mixture and the temperature was increase to 45 c for 5 h under stirring a white precipitate was formed the temperature was then raised to 90 c for 18 h at static conditions the mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature solids were filtered and washed 3 times with water and acetone and finally the nanoparticles denoted as snps were calcined at 550 c for 6 h the reaction mechanisms are shown fig 1 some of the silica nanoparticles were then functionalized with methyl functional groups to make them less hydrophilic for the purposes of membrane distillation snps 0 9 g were dispersed in hexamethyldisilane hdms figure s1 and the mixture was vigorously stirred for 5 h at 30 c to functionalize the snps with hydrophobic methyl groups after functionalizing the silica mixture was filtered and washed several times with pentane the resultant material denoted as mfsnps was dispersed in pentane and the mixture was vigorously stirred for 1 h at 30 c to wash off all the hmds from the nanoparticles the mfsnps were filtered and vacuum dried at 120 c zinc oxide nanoparticles were prepared using a synthesis route reported by gusatti et al 2 sodium hydroxide was dissolved in deionized water and the resultant solution was heated at 70 c under constant stirring to oxidize the reaction a solution of zn no3 2 was added drop wise over 1 h into the beaker containing the naoh aqueous solution under constant stirring the resulting mixture was stirred for 2 h at 70 c the precipitate formed was filtered and washed several times with deionized water to remove impurities the washed sample was dried overnight at 65 c in an oven the weighed mass of psf pva ratio of 80 20 was dissolved separately in different beakers using n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp as a common solvent both mixtures were stirred until the polymers were dissolved using a magnetic starrier after dissolving the two solutions were mixed together to form a polymer blend under constant stirring to produce a homogenous mixture then a specified weight percentage of the crosslinking agent d malic acid was added to obtain the desired theoretical crosslinking degree this was followed by the addition of 2 m hydrochloric acid hcl into the polymer blend under constant stirring to hydrolyse the crosslinking agent and homogenize the crosslinked psf pva solution cross linking degree was calculated using eq 1 1 x w c l m w p s f u n i t 2 w p s f m w c l 100 where wpsf and wcl represent the weight of psf and the crosslinking agent respectively mwpsf unit and mwcl represent the molecular weight of the psf monomer and that of the crosslinking agent hydrochloric acid hcl was added into the polymer matrix to hydrolyze the crosslinking agent nanoparticle loading in membranes are ms 1 0 1 ms 2 0 2 ms 3 0 3 for sio2 and mz 1 0 1 mz 1 01 mz 2 0 mz 3 0 3 for zno modified membranes ms and mz membranes respectively 2 3 characterization techniques the fabricated nanocomposite membranes were characterised using fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflection ftir atr spectroscopy perkin elmer ftir spectrometer frontier optica to obtain a good representation of the surface functional groups on the nanoparticles and membrane surface x ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectro xps was used to confirm the elemental compositions of the nanoparticles the size distribution of nanoparticles was determined by the dynamic light scattering dls technique using a malvern zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd gb the zinc oxide nanoparticles were first dispersed in water and sonicated for 5 min prior to the measurement of size and zeta potential zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd gb uses laser doppler velocimetry to determine electrophoretic mobility of the nanoparticles the zeta potential was obtained from the electrophoretic mobility using the smoluchowski equation water contact angle analysis was performed to assess the hydrophilic properties of the membranes using a dsa3oe kruss drop shape analyzer gnbh germany the surface morphologies of the nanocomposite membranes were investigated by a scanning electron microscopy sem jeol jsm it300 membranes were sputter coated with carbon before analysis atomic force micrographs were obtained from atomic force microscopy afm witec alpha 300 atomic force microscope wi tec gmbh germany to investigate the changes in the membrane surface due to the incorporation of nanoparticles themembrane surface elemental composition was analysed using an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer eds oxford instruments attached to the sem surface roughness parameters were calculated by control four software witec gmbh germany the zeta potentials of the different types of nanocomposite membranes were determined by measurements of streaming potential at different phs over a range of 2 to 12 using a surpass electro kinetic analyser anton paar gmbh austria with a background electrolyte of 10 mm kcl 2 4 performance tests purewaterflux a filtration cell operated in dead end mode was used during the filtration experiments and the pressure was maintained at 0 5 bar to maximize the retention time for filtration of the feed solution the membranes were first compacted at 1 bar until the flux was stabilized flux variation was less than 5 then the pure water flux was measured rejection the dye stock solution 1000 mg ml was prepared by weighing and dissolving 1 g of cr dye into a 1 l of deionized di water under vigorous stirring for 3 4 h the experimental feed solutions were obtained by diluting the dye stock solutions to 100 mg l in a 2 l volumetric flask the filtrate samples were collected after reaching a steady flux rate and the feed was vigorously stirred to maintain homogenous mixture of the feed solution the rejection rate was estimated by the difference in the concentration of feed and permeate obtained by using uv vis spectroscopy the removal efficiencies of the membranes were calculated using eq 1 1 re m o v a l c f c p t c f x 100 where cf and cp are the feed and permeate concentrations respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of nanoparticles ftir spectra of the nanoparticles are shown in fig 2 it shows peaks corresponding to si o stretching and o si o deformation vibrations due to bending were observed at 1107 and 762 cm 1 respectively metal oxides absorb ir below the finger print region 1000 cm 1 however a broad band at 3000 3500 cm 1 can be observed on the zno ftir spectra this peak is attributed to the characteristic adsorption of hydroxyl groups by the zno nanoparticles the intense peak at 1465 cm 1 is due to the bending of the water molecules on the zno surface the peak at 650 cm 1 is due to the presence of the zn o bond the peak at 800 cm 1 is an unresolved peak due to impurities in the precipitate while the peak at 1585 cm 1 is due to zn no3angular deformation since zinc nitrate was used as a zinc precursor during the synthesis of the nanoparticles fig 3 shows the effect of ph on zeta potential of silica and zinc oxide nanoparticles the value of zeta potential for silica and zinc oxide nanoparticles at ph 7 5 was 25 and 35 mv respectively the zeta potential of the nanoparticles increased with decreasing ph due to the addition of h ions from hcl and decreased with the increase of ph due to the presence of oh ions from naoh the zeta potential of silica nanoparticles was negatively charged through out the 4 to 9 5 ph range therefore it is expected that the zeta potential of membranes modified by silica nanoparticles will be lower compared to membranes modified with zinc oxide nanoparticles the point of zero charge for zno nanoparticles was reached at ph 8unlike in silica nanoparticles where the surface remained negative the implication here is that the silica nanoparticles will impart a negative surface on the membrane over a wide range of ph 2 to 10 while the zinc oxide nano particles will remain predominately positive at neutral to acidic conditions the particle size of the nanoparticles can be influenced by several factors such as sonication of nanoparticles and the dispersant used the sizes of the nanoparticles for sio2 is 252 7 and zno 330 6 after dispersing the nanoparticles in water and sonicating them for 5 min the zinc oxide nanoparticles were larger than the silica nanoparticles particle size is related to surface area of the nanoparticles where large particles have a lower surface area than small particles this means that the silica nanoparticles had a higher surface area as compared to zinc nanoparticles therefore silica membranes are expected to show high rejection of lead ions due to electrostatic interactions the application of xps generally allows an in depth analysis of the surface of the prepared materials it is specifically used to analyse the elemental composition or state of the elements present a broad scan typically from 1200 ev to 0 ev will establish a gross elemental composition of the sample s surface in this study the o1 s scan was performed to ascertain bonding state of the oxygen fig 5 shows the survey spectra of zno and sio2 peaks corresponding to zno i e zn 2p 3s 3p 3d zn auger zn lmm and o 1s were observed confirming the successful synthesis of zno fig 4 a in fig 4 b sio2 related peaks can be observed i e si 2 s 2p and o1 s carbon contamination as an unreacted residual or surface contamination was not observed implying the successful decomposition of the unreacted organics during calcination of the nanoparticles xps elemental analysis in this study was performed to confirm the successful oxygenation of the zinc and silica precursors during the synthesis of zno and sio2 respectively fig 6 presents the o1 s high resolution scan of zno and silica in fig 5 a the overall deconvoluted peak consists of two peaks the peaks at 528 and 530 mv are attributed to oxygen in zinc oxide bonding 17 this confirms the successful oxidation of zinc nitrate to form zinc oxide nanoparticles the overall deconvoluted peaks in fig 5 b consists of a single peak ascribed to o1 s confirming the successful oxygenation of the silicon precursor teos 18 these results concur with the ftir spectra reported for the nanoparticles 3 2 membrane characteristics contact angle is a surface technique used to evaluate the surface properties of the membranes 19 in this study the contact angle was used to compare the relative hydrophilicity as the nanoparticle loading was increased as it can be observed in figure s2 the increase in nanoparticle loading resulted in a general decrease in the water contact angle for all membranes with 0 2 increase of the nanoparticles loading for example a 17 decrease in the contact angle was observed in silica modified psf pva membranes when the silica loading was further increased to 0 5 wt the water angle decreased from 48o to about 43 a 10 decrease in zno modified membranes it was observed that the first 0 2 filler loading resulted in a lower percentage decrease 9 8 and further increment to 0 5 zno in membrane resulted in a 13 decrease in the contact angle the decrease in contact angle due to an increase in sio2 is due to the hydroxyl groups on the silica nanoparticles forming hydrophilic network on the membrane surface the decrease in the contact angle in psf pva nanoparticles is attributed to the steric stabilization due to the presence of pva in the matrix 20 the presence of pva stabilizes nanoparticles and prevents the nanoparticle aggregation through the presence of intra and inter molecular hydroxyl bonding with the hydroxyl groups of the nanoparticles 21 the surface morphology of the membranes was evaluated using sem it can be observed that when psf was modified with only pva the membrane surface had more apparent and evenly distributed pores with similar pore geometry as observed in fig 3 a upon addition of high amount of silica nanoparticles figure s3 b nanoparticle agglomerates were observed on the membrane surface even at low magnification x 500 this could mean that even in the presence of pva silica nanoparticles will aggregate on the surface of the membrane the double casting procedure showed no visible difference in the visual pore distribution than the normally cast in figure s3 b the surface of the zno 0 5 wt modified membrane was observed to have unevenly distributed pores which is attributed to the miscibility of the zno nanoparticles and the polymer blend the nanoparticles were also observed to aggregate in order to confirm the presence of the nanoparticles on the surface of the membranes an eds scan was performed it revealed thatthere were no nanoparticles on the psf pva membrane since the present peaks indicated the presence of only carbon oxygen and sulphur elements that are present in the psf and pva polymers figure s4 a the silica and zinc oxide modified membranes as observed in figure s4 b and c showed additional peaks associated with si and zn confirming the incorporation of the nanoparticles in the membranes and their presence on the membrane surface streaming potential measurements of the fabricated ultrafiltration membranes determine the change of the zeta potential of the membranes as a function of ph zeta potential is a measure of magnitude of electrostatic interactions between charged surfaces formed at the interphase of the liquid solid interphase in a system 22 the zeta potential of the membranes represents the surface charge which occurs in presence of an aqueous solution when functional groups dissociate from the membrane surface 23 the net surface charge of the nanocomposite membrane is influenced by the zeta potentials of the incorporated nanoparticles due ionisable groups on the membrane surface 4 the measured zeta potential of the zno modified membranes varied linearly in the ph region 4 to 10 while the sio2 modified membranes varied linearly with ph over the entire measured ph range most importantly the ms membranes had a negative potential over the measured ph this is particulary important for ionic solute rejection either by repulsion of adsorption the ph dependent streaming potential measurements observed helped in the identification of the isoelectric point an isoelectric point is the ph value where the zeta potential of the membranes is zero in figure s5 it can be observed that the isoelectric point of the membranes shifts towards a lower ph with increasing content of the nanoparticles suggesting the increase in membrane hydrophilicity the zno modified membranes figure s5 b showed negative zeta potentials in the ph range of 5 12 whereas the sio2 modified membranes had negative zeta potentials over the entire measured ph range 2 12 indicating their strong hydrophilic properties and suggesting strong electrostatic interactions during the rejection of the studied pollutants two isoelectric points were observed for mz membranes indicating heterogeneous composition on membrane surface this means that the zno membranes may react with both positively and negatively charged pollutants the tensile strength of the membranes was measured to establish the effect of crosslinking and nanoparticle loading in the fabricated membranes previous studies have reported that mechanical properties of membranes may be compromised in resultant membranes prepared from polymer blends 24 this is because of the different solubility of the polymers resulting in low miscibility due to dispersion of the molecules and phase interactions between the components of the polymer blends however crosslinking reactions in polymers have received significant interests due to the efficiency in improving the mechanical properties of membranes 25 table 1 shows that crosslinking the membranes increases elongation by 2 this indicates the improved tensile strength of the membrane since crosslinking shifted the breaking point of the membrane from point of lower stress 4 n mm2 to a point of higher stress 11 n mm2 in previous studies the incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles in polymeric matrices has been reported to enhance physical mechanical and chemical stability of the composite membrane 26 however at high nanoparticle loading the tensile strength is slowly compromised due to the nanoparticles interfering with the phases between the polymer molecules 11 figure s6 shows the effect of nanoparticles loading on the membrane tensile strength it can be observed that the tensile strength increased with increasing loading of the nanoparticles since the solution with the nanoparticles was cast as a thin top layer it is presumed that there was little interference with membrane mechanical properties also due to heat induced solvent evaporation a dense skin layer on the membrane surface was formed further increasing the tensile strength of the membrane 27 3 3 ultrafiltration performance of the membranes the filtration performance of the fabricated nanocomposite membranes was evaluated by permeate flux and removal efficiency of cr dye a similar result was obtained by modi et al 28 where in increase in pure water permeability was improved when zno carboxylated graphite oxide nanoparticle loading was increased improved hydrophilicity as a result of hydroxyl and epoxy functional groups was cited as the main reason for the increased performance the permeate flux increased with increasing loading of the nanoparticles fig 6 a this means that the porosity of membranes was improved with increasing nanoparticle loading in addition to the observed hydrophilicity the permeate flux was higher during the second cycle as compared to the first cycle this may be attributed by the membrane cleaning procedure which may have resulted in membrane deformations during uf the physical sieving phenomena is the main driving force which controls the rejection of macromolecules based on the pore sizes of the membrane 29 additional to molecular sieving the charge of the pollutants donnan exclusion membrane hydrophilic properties and swelling rate of the membranes contribute to the membrane selectivity

14362,this study evaluates the performance of a large reactor in the degradation of sulfamethazine smt in water using uv and persulfate ps as well as the effects of uv wavelength ps concentration initial smt concentration and addition of anions on this process the degradation efficiency and rate of smt using the uv 254 nm ps process were higher than those using the uv 365 nm ps process the degradation efficiency of smt using the uv 254 nm ps process increased with ps concentration however ps at high concentration inhibited the smt degradation rate using the uv 254 nm ps process reducing the initial smt concentration increased the degradation efficiency and rate of smt under uv 254 nm the smt degradation using the uv 254 nm ps process in a large reactor followed pseudo first order kinetics radical scavenging tests revealed that so4 dominated in the smt degradation using the uv 254 nm ps process in a large reactor adding anions decreased the degradation efficiency and rate of smt using the uv 254 nm ps process in the order no3 so4 2 cl in the uv 254 nm ps process smt 5 mg l was completely degraded in 2 min at a ps concentration of 10 mm without the addition of anions therefore a large reactor with high ps concentrations is very effective in degrading smt in water using the uv 254 nm ps process keywords degradation antibiotic sulfamethazine uv persulfate 1 introduction recently sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops which have be developed for effectively degrading organic compounds in water have gained substantial attention 1 in sr aops a powerful sulfate radical so4 which has a high reactivity and a large oxidation potential eo 2 6 v 2 is produced to degrade organic compounds to nontoxic co2 and h2o 1 sr aops have been verified to be effective in the degradation of various organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals and their metabolites endocrine disruptors cyanotoxins volatile organic compounds and perfluorinated compounds 1 typically so4 is produced by the activation of persulfate s2o8 2 ps 1 2 several methods for producing so4 by the activation of ps have been developed they include ultraviolet uv irradiation heating ultra sonication electrochemical methods and the use of iron the use of minerals and the use of bases 1 2 among the many methods for activation uv irradiation is gaining increasing attention in the uv ps process two so4 can be produced by activating each ps under uv irradiation according to eq 1 2 the uv ps process that is involved in a reaction mechanism that is similar to fenton based aops is regarded as an effective process for effectively degrading diverse organic compounds in water 3 33 for example lin and wu 10 found that the degradation efficiency of ciprofloxacin 10 mg l at ph 7 and 25 c was 95 in 30 min with an na2s2o8 concentration of 1 92 g l under uv 254 nm lin and tsai 33 achieved the complete degradation of isopropyl alcohol 100 mg l in 20 min at ph 7 and 20 c with an na2s2o8 concentration of 2 1 g l under uv 254 nm 1 s2o8 2 hν 2so4 sulfamethazine smt as a sulfonamide antibiotic 34 is mostly used as a veterinary drug for controlling infectious diseases and promoting animal growth 35 37 since most smt is unlikely to be metabolized following its uptake by animals 35 37 it has been found in aquatic environments following discharge in feces and urine 35 37 since smt is resistant to biodegradation it cannot be effectively degraded biologically 36 37 therefore numerous effective approaches to degrading smt have been attempted including photolysis and photocatalytic decomposition 36 the uv h2o2 process 37 a fenton like process 38 electrochemical degradation 39 gamma irradiation with h2o2 40 and sonolytic degradation 41 in recent years sr aops have been used to degrade smt they include uv ps 5 heat ps 42 and the nanoscale zero valent iron ps 43 processes the uv ps process for degrading smt has been carried out at low ps concentrations 0 05 0 5 mm 5 gao et al 5 achieved about 97 degradation of smt 0 02 mm at a ps concentration of 0 2 mm in 45 min under uv 254 nm hence to promote the smt degradation high ps concentrations 0 5 mm should be used most studies of the degradation of organic compounds using the uv ps process have used a reactor with a capacity 0 5 l 4 6 13 15 19 21 22 24 25 27 32 for example wang et al 15 adopted the uv ps process to degrade 2 4 di tert butylphenol in a reactor that contained 200 ml aqueous 2 4 di tert butylphenol some earlier studies even used a reactor with a capacity 0 1 l to conduct the uv ps process 6 16 19 21 22 24 27 32 for example zhou et al 22 utilized the uv ps process to degrade diatrizoate in a reactor that contained 50 ml aqueous diatrizoate only our group has used a large reactor with a capacity of 3 l to perform the uv ps process 9 10 to promote the industrial use of the uv ps process a large reactor with a capacity of 3 l is utilized to investigate the effects of the operating parameters on the effectiveness of this process therefore the major goal of this study is to examine the performance of a large reactor that contained 3 l aqueous smt in the smt degradation using the uv ps process the effects of uv wavelength ps concentration initial smt concentration and addition of anions on the smt degradation are also determined 2 experimental 2 1 degradation of smt aqueous smt was produced by dissolving sulfamethazine powder 99 sigma aldrich in deionized water that was provided by a direct q 3 uv r tap to pure ultrapure water purification system merck millipore each experiment was carried out in a pyrex cylindrical reactor in a batch operation as shown in fig 1 in each experiment 3 l of aqueous smt was placed in the reactor two quartz sleeves were in a vertical orientation in the reactor each quartz sleeve housed a 8 w low pressure mercury lamp two kinds of uv lamp with different wavelengths of maximum emission 254 or 365 nm were used the aqueous smt was completely mixed using an agitator which was placed on the centerline of the reactor nitrogen aeration was carried out in the degradation to remove dissolved oxygen from the aqueous smt a temperature controlled water bath was used to maintain the aqueous smt at 25 c the original ph of the aqueous smt was about 6 a specified amount of na2s2o8 99 sigma aldrich was added as a source of ps when the temperature and ph of the aqueous smt were 25 c and 6 respectively the two uv lamps were subsequently turned on and the degradation continued for 30 min 2 2 analytical methods at each designated sampling interval a sample with a volume of 1 ml was withdrawn through a sampling port on the top of the reactor and quenched instantly by adding 1 ml of methanol 99 sigma aldrich which is an effective agent for quenching active radicals 37 a high performance liquid chromatography hplc jasco equipped with a shimadzu vp ods column 250 mm 4 6 mm and a uv vis detector was used to analyze the concentration of smt in the sample 37 43 a mixture of acetonitrile and deionized water in a ratio of 35 65 v v was used as the mobile phase 5 37 43 the flow rate of the mobile phase was kept at 1 ml min 5 37 43 the injected volume for each sample was 50 μl and the spectrophotometric analysis of smt was performed at 266 nm 5 37 43 a torch combustion toc analyzer teledyne tekmar was used to measure the concentration of total organic carbon toc in the sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 effectiveness of uv ps process to elucidate the effectiveness of the uv ps process smt was degraded using three processes 1 uv 2 ps and 3 uv ps the initial smt concentration was 10 mg l a uv wavelength of 254 nm was used in the uv and uv ps processes a ps concentration of 10 mm was used in the ps and uv ps processes fig 2 presents results concerning the smt degradation using the three processes the ps process only degraded 3 of smt in 30 min this observation indicates that ps alone only slightly degraded smt the degradation efficiency of smt using the uv process was 79 in 30 min 37 in the uv ps process the degradation efficiency of smt increased very significantly with time reaching 100 in 4 min our group obtained a similar result concerning the ciprofloxacin 10 mg l degradation using the uv ps process in a large reactor that contained 3 l of aqueous ciprofloxacin under uv 254 nm 10 our results showed that the degradation efficiency of ciprofloxacin using the uv process was 15 in 30 min 10 at an na2s2o8 concentration of 1 92 g l 95 of ciprofloxacin was degraded in 30 min using the uv ps process but no degradation of ciprofloxacin was achieved in the ps process 10 a similar result was obtained by gao et al 14 who utilized the uv ps process to degrade florfenicol 20 μm under uv 254 nm the degradation efficiency of florfenicol using the uv process was about 25 in 60 min 14 at an na2s2o8 concentration of 2 mm about 98 of florfenicol was degraded in 60 min using the uv ps process but no florfenicol was degraded in the ps process 14 recently our group degraded isopropyl alcohol 250 mg l using the uv ps process under uv 254 nm in a large reactor that contained 2 l of aqueous isopropyl alcohol 33 our results revealed that the degradation efficiency of isopropyl alcohol using the uv process was about 4 in 30 min 33 at an na2s2o8 concentration of 2 1 g l isopropyl alcohol was completely degraded in 25 min using the uv ps process whereas only about 4 of isopropyl alcohol was degraded in 30 min using the ps process 33 the ph value of the aqueous solution was an important parameter that influenced the degradation of target organic compounds as displayed in fig 3 in the uv ps process the ph fell from 6 1 to 4 3 in just 1 min and then decreased slowly to 2 6 at 30 min this observation was caused by the decomposition of ps eq 1 which yielded protons since so4 reacted with water eqs 2 and 3 9 10 and acidic by products that were produced in the smt degradation using the uv ps process in the uv process the ph declined from 5 9 to 4 8 after 30 min suggesting that acidic by products were produced in the smt degradation using the uv process however in the ps process the ph changed from 5 9 to 4 5 within just 1 min and then remained at the latter value possibly because few so4 was produced so the smt degradation was limited 2 so4 h2o hso4 ho 3 hso4 h so4 2 both so4 and ho have been proposed to be responsible for the degradation of organic compounds in the uv ps process 9 10 33 methanol meoh and tert butyl alcohol tba were used as probes to check the production of the dominant radical by the activation of ps 33 43 the rate constant 9 7 108 l mol 1 s 1 44 for the reaction of meoh with ho is close to the rate constant 6 0 108 l mol 1 s 1 44 for the reaction of tba with ho however the rate constant 1 0 107 l mol 1 s 1 45 for the reaction of meoh with so4 exceeds the rate constant 8 4 105 l mol 1 s 1 45 for the reaction of tba with so4 therefore meoh is utilized as a quenching agent for ho and so4 and tba is used as a scavenger of ho hence the smt degradation using the uv ps process was affected by the addition of these alcohols and the dominant radical that was produced in the smt degradation using the uv ps process can be identified radical scavenging tests were conducted at a ps concentration of 10 mm and an initial smt concentration of 10 mg l under uv 254 nm as shown in fig 4 adding tba tba ps molar ratio 10 1 reduced the degradation efficiency of smt in 1 min from 59 to 46 and adding meoh meoh ps molar ratio 10 1 reduced the degradation efficiency of smt in 1 min from 59 to 11 the inhibition of the smt degradation by the addition of meoh greatly exceeded that by the addition of tba revealing that so4 was produced in preference to ho in the smt degradation using the uv ps process under uv 254 nm as proposed by our group so4 predominated in the degradation of polyvinyl alcohol using the uv ps process in a large reactor that contained 3 l of aqueous polyvinyl alcohol under uv 254 nm 9 a similar result that was obtained by our group demonstrated that so4 was the primary radical for the efficient degradation of ciprofloxacin using the uv ps process in a large reactor that contained 3 l of aqueous ciprofloxacin under uv 254 nm 10 recently our group identified so4 as the dominant radical that was produced in the degradation of isopropyl alcohol using the uv ps process in a large reactor that contained 2 l of aqueous isopropyl alcohol under uv 254 nm resulting in the effective degradation of isopropyl alcohol 33 according to the above results and discussion the uv ps process can effectively degrade smt by the following mechanism one ps molecule can produce two so4 radicals under uv radiation consistent with eq 1 and so4 can induce a series of radical chain reactions by which smt was degraded eq 4 therefore in the uv ps process more so4 was produced strongly degrading smt as presented in fig 2 4 so4 smt degradation products 3 2 degradation of smt the smt degradation using the uv ps process is consistent with the pseudo first order kinetic model eq 5 the slope of a plot of ln c0 c versus time yields the observed degradation rate constant of smt k to determine the effects of the operating parameters on the smt degradation using the uv ps process k values were estimated under a wide range of operating parameters 5 ln c 0 c kt where c0 is the initial smt concentration c is the concentration of smt at time t and k is the observed degradation rate constant of smt 3 2 1 effect of uv wavelength to study the effect of uv wavelength on the smt degradation experiments were carried out using a ps concentration of 10 mm and an initial smt concentration of 10 mg l as presented in fig 5 the degradation efficiency of smt using the uv 365 nm ps and uv 254 nm ps processes was 25 and 100 respectively in 4 min suggesting that the degradation efficiency of smt was considerably affected by the uv wavelength the k values for the uv 365 nm ps and uv 254 nm ps processes were 0 078 and 2 026 min 1 respectively indicating that the latter process degraded smt much more rapidly than the former the energy that was obtained using uv 254 nm was higher than that obtained using uv 365 nm so more so4 was produced eq 1 therefore more smt was degraded eq 4 notably the ph of the aqueous smt declined in the degradation as displayed in fig 6 the final ph value 2 6 in the uv 254 nm ps process was lower than that 4 0 in the uv 365 nm ps process as stated elsewhere 13 when ps was present in the acidic aqueous solution more so4 was produced as a result of acid catalysis so the uv 254 nm ps process produced more so4 than the uv 365 nm ps process hence more degradation of smt was obtained in the uv 254 nm ps process eq 4 our group obtained a similar result when we used the uv ps process to degrade polyvinyl alcohol in a large reactor that contained 3 l of aqueous polyvinyl alcohol 9 the degradation efficiency of polyvinyl alcohol 20 mg l using the uv 254 nm ps and uv 365 nm ps processes was 100 and 14 in 5 min respectively at an na2s2o8 concentration of 0 12 g l 9 3 2 2 effect of ps concentration to elucidate the effect of ps concentration on the smt degradation experiments were performed at diverse ps concentrations and an initial smt concentration of 10 mg l under uv 254 nm fig 7 shows the results that were obtained at diverse ps concentrations 1 to 20 mm under uv 254 nm as shown in fig 7 the degradation efficiency of smt in 1 min at ps concentrations of 1 2 5 10 and 20 mm was 16 26 40 59 and 81 respectively revealing that increasing the ps concentration from 1 to 20 mm increased the degradation efficiency of smt the k values for the smt degradation at diverse ps concentrations were estimated graphically and shown in table 1 increasing ps concentration from 1 to 10 mm increased the k value and the k value at a ps concentration of 10 mm was about 13 7 times that at a ps concentration of 1 mm this observation demonstrates the absence of any inhibitive effect of ps at concentrations of 1 10 mm however the k value at a ps concentration of 20 mm was about 17 5 times that at a ps concentration of 1 mm more ps produced more so4 eq 1 leading to greater degradation of smt however at a ps concentration of 20 mm so4 reacted more strongly with more s2o8 2 eq 6 9 yielding a slightly higher concentration of so4 than at a lower ps concentration of 10 mm the results reveal that so4 more effectively degraded smt than did s2o8 accordingly ps inhibited the smt degradation rate using the uv 254 nm ps process at a high ps concentration of 20 mm 6 so4 s2o8 2 so4 2 s2o8 our group obtained a similar finding regarding the ciprofloxacin degradation using the uv ps process in a large reactor that contained 3 l of aqueous ciprofloxacin under uv 254 nm 10 the degradation efficiency of ciprofloxacin 10 mg l in 2 min at na2s2o8 concentrations of 0 24 0 48 0 96 1 92 and 3 84 g l were 16 26 35 50 and 54 respectively 10 these results show that excessive ps did not apparently increase the degradation efficiency of ciprofloxacin noticeably reducing the effect of ps concentration on the ciprofloxacin degradation 10 as shown in table 1 the coefficient of determination r2 can be used to estimate the agreement between experimental data and the results obtained using the model eq 5 the high values of r2 0 95 at all ps concentrations demonstrated that the smt degradation using the uv 254 nm ps process followed pseudo first order kinetics at all ps concentrations additionally the time for complete degradation decreased as the ps concentration was increased from 1 to 20 mm when the ps concentration was 10 mm all smt was degraded was in 4 min this period was close to that 3 min obtained at a ps concentration of 20 mm this observation verifies the inhibitory effect of ps on the smt degradation using the uv 254 nm ps process the final ph deceased as the ps concentration was increased from 1 to 20 mm and was always less than 4 suggesting that the smt degradation proceeded in acidic environments at all ps concentrations the electrical energy in kwh that is required to reduce the concentration of organic compounds in 1 m3 of water by one order of magnitude can be used to calculate the electrical energy per order of organic compounds removal ee o 10 33 37 46 47 the degradation of a low concentration of smt 10 mg l using the uv 254 nm ps process is consistent with pseudo first order kinetics and the ee o kwh m 3 order 1 is given by the following equation 10 33 37 46 47 the ee o values for the smt 10 mg l degradation using the uv 254 nm ps process at diverse ps concentrations were calculated and shown in table 1 the lowest ee o value in the uv 254 nm ps process with an initial smt concentration of 10 mg l was 0 079 kw h m 3 order 1 at a ps concentration of 20 mm 7 ee o 38 4p vk where p denotes the power of the uv lamp kw v represents the volume of the aqueous smt l and k is the observed degradation rate constant of smt min 1 3 2 3 effect of initial smt concentration the effect of the initial smt concentration on the smt degradation must be examined fig 8 presents the results obtained at a ps concentration of 10 mm under uv 254 nm the degradation efficiency of smt at initial smt concentrations of 5 10 20 and 50 mg l was 96 59 19 and 4 respectively in 1 min implying that reducing the initial smt concentration increased the degradation efficiency of smt this finding can be attributed to the fact that although the initial concentration of smt was increased the ps concentration did not suffice to degrade it as listed in table 2 reducing the initial smt concentration increased the k value implying that the degradation rate of smt increased as the initial smt concentration was decreased this relationship arose from the fact that increasingly more uv was absorbed by smt than by ps as the initial smt concentration was increased since the uv absorbance of smt at 254 nm was higher than that of ps hence less so4 was produced eq 1 so the reaction of so4 with smt was retarded the final ph increased from 2 38 to 3 24 with an increase in the initial smt concentration in the range from 5 to 50 mg l indicating that more acidic by products were produced in the smt degradation using the uv 254 nm ps process at a lower initial smt concentration a higher ee o value for the smt degradation using the uv 254 nm ps process was associated with a larger initial smt concentration showing that more energy had to be consumed to degrade more smt 3 2 4 effect of addition of anions to study the effect of the addition of anions 10 mm on the smt degradation nano3 99 5 sigma aldrich na2so4 99 j t baker and nacl 99 j t baker were added to the aqueous smt 10 mg l fig 9 displays the effect of the addition of anions on the degradation efficiency of smt at a ps concentration of 1 mm under uv 254 nm in 3 min the degradation efficiency of smt without anions was 34 which was higher than the 18 achieved with nano3 the 25 with na2so4 and the 32 with nacl based on eq 5 and fig 9 the k values that were obtained with the addition of nacl and na2so4 were 0 138 min 1 and 0 120 min 1 respectively which were slightly lower than that 0 148 min 1 obtained without anions however the k value that was obtained with the addition of nano3 was 0 078 min 1 which was much lower than that 0 148 min 1 obtained without anions these findings reveal that adding anions reduced the degradation efficiency and rate of smt hence the smt degradation using the uv 254 nm ps process was limited by the anions in the order no3 so4 2 cl adding no3 inhibited the smt degradation possibly because it reduced the amount of so4 by reacting with it 9 as described by eq 8 9 moreover so4 may be more reactive than no3 with smt therefore the degradation efficiency and rate of smt was reduced by adding no3 so4 2 slightly affected the smt degradation but it scarcely reacted with so4 9 thus the reduction in the degradation efficiency and rate of smt as a result of the presence of so4 2 is attributable to the fact that so4 2 may absorb more uv than s2o8 2 9 8 so4 no3 so4 2 no3 our group used the uv ps process to degrade polyvinyl alcohol in a large reactor that contained 3 l of aqueous polyvinyl alcohol with the addition of anions 9 the degradation efficiency of polyvinyl alcohol 20 mg l without anions in 2 min was about 99 which exceeded the about 13 29 and 84 that were achieved with nacl nano3 and na2so4 respectively at an na2s2o8 concentration of 0 5 mm and an anion concentration of 100 mm under uv 254 nm 9 these results demonstrate that cl and no3 strongly inhibited the degradation of polyvinyl alcohol using the uv 254 nm ps process in a large reactor that contained 3 l of aqueous polyvinyl alcohol however in this study cl slightly affected the smt degradation cl reacted with so4 to form cl eq 9 9 which reacted with cl to form cl2 eq 10 48 the reactivities of cl and cl2 with smt may be close to the reactivity of so4 with smt therefore adding cl negligibly inhibited the smt degradation 9 so4 cl so4 2 cl 10 cl cl cl2 3 3 mineralization of smt to verify the mineralization of smt in its degradation using the uv 254 nm ps process toc concentrations were measured table 3 presents the degradation and mineralization of smt 10 mg l at a ps concentration of 10 mm over time the degradation efficiency of smt in 15 min was 100 however the mineralization of smt was 83 at that time the mineralization of smt increased with time reaching 96 in 120 min with complete degradation gao et al 5 found that about 30 of smt at an initial concentration of 0 02 mm was mineralized at a ps concentration of 0 2 mm in 45 min under uv 254 nm accordingly a higher concentration of ps resulted in greater mineralization of smt 3 4 comparison with other methods table 4 compares the various methods for degrading smt the uv ps process degrades more smt than the uv h2o2 process suggesting that so4 was more reactive than oh with smt we found a similar result when we used the uv ps and uv h2o2 processes to degrade polyvinyl alcohol 20 mg l in large reactor that contained 3 l of aqueous polyvinyl alcohol 49 the degradation efficiency of polyvinyl alcohol using the uv ps and uv h2o2 processes at ph 3 and 25 c with an oxidant concentration of 0 25 mm under uv 254 nm was 100 and 58 respectively in 5 min implying that the uv ps process was more efficient than the uv h2o2 process in the degradation of polyvinyl alcohol 49 although the nzvi ps process is slightly less effective than the uv ps process when the volume of aqueous smt was increased to 3 l the degradation efficiency of smt decreased dramatically owing to the significant agglomeration of nzvi therefore the uv ps process degrades smt more effectively than other methods 4 conclusions this study concerns the performance of a large reactor in the degradation of sulfamethazine smt in water using the uv ps process the degradation efficiency and rate of smt using the uv 254 nm ps process were higher than those using the uv 365 nm ps process in the uv 254 nm ps process increasing the ps concentration increased the degradation efficiency of smt however ps at high concentration exhibited an inhibitory effect on the smt degradation rate using the uv 254 nm ps process a higher degradation efficiency and rate of smt using the uv 254 nm ps process was obtained at a lower initial smt concentration pseudo first order kinetics fit the smt degradation using the uv 254 nm ps process in a large reactor quenching studies using alcohols demonstrate that so4 dominated the smt degradation using the uv 254 nm ps process in a large reactor adding anions reduced the degradation efficiency and rate of smt using the uv 254 nm ps process in the order no3 so4 2 cl all smt was degraded in 2 min using the uv 254 nm ps process at a ps concentration of 10 mm and an initial smt concentration of 5 mg l without the addition of anions the obtained results obviously show the potential of a large reactor with high ps concentrations for the effective degradation of smt in water using the uv 254 nm ps process acknowledgements the

14362,this study evaluates the performance of a large reactor in the degradation of sulfamethazine smt in water using uv and persulfate ps as well as the effects of uv wavelength ps concentration initial smt concentration and addition of anions on this process the degradation efficiency and rate of smt using the uv 254 nm ps process were higher than those using the uv 365 nm ps process the degradation efficiency of smt using the uv 254 nm ps process increased with ps concentration however ps at high concentration inhibited the smt degradation rate using the uv 254 nm ps process reducing the initial smt concentration increased the degradation efficiency and rate of smt under uv 254 nm the smt degradation using the uv 254 nm ps process in a large reactor followed pseudo first order kinetics radical scavenging tests revealed that so4 dominated in the smt degradation using the uv 254 nm ps process in a large reactor adding anions decreased the degradation efficiency and rate of smt using the uv 254 nm ps process in the order no3 so4 2 cl in the uv 254 nm ps process smt 5 mg l was completely degraded in 2 min at a ps concentration of 10 mm without the addition of anions therefore a large reactor with high ps concentrations is very effective in degrading smt in water using the uv 254 nm ps process keywords degradation antibiotic sulfamethazine uv persulfate 1 introduction recently sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops which have be developed for effectively degrading organic compounds in water have gained substantial attention 1 in sr aops a powerful sulfate radical so4 which has a high reactivity and a large oxidation potential eo 2 6 v 2 is produced to degrade organic compounds to nontoxic co2 and h2o 1 sr aops have been verified to be effective in the degradation of various organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals and their metabolites endocrine disruptors cyanotoxins volatile organic compounds and perfluorinated compounds 1 typically so4 is produced by the activation of persulfate s2o8 2 ps 1 2 several methods for producing so4 by the activation of ps have been developed they include ultraviolet uv irradiation heating ultra sonication electrochemical methods and the use of iron the use of minerals and the use of bases 1 2 among the many methods for activation uv irradiation is gaining increasing attention in the uv ps process two so4 can be produced by activating each ps under uv irradiation according to eq 1 2 the uv ps process that is involved in a reaction mechanism that is similar to fenton based aops is regarded as an effective process for effectively degrading diverse organic compounds in water 3 33 for example lin and wu 10 found that the degradation efficiency of ciprofloxacin 10 mg l at ph 7 and 25 c was 95 in 30 min with an na2s2o8 concentration of 1 92 g l under uv 254 nm lin and tsai 33 achieved the complete degradation of isopropyl alcohol 100 mg l in 20 min at ph 7 and 20 c with an na2s2o8 concentration of 2 1 g l under uv 254 nm 1 s2o8 2 hν 2so4 sulfamethazine smt as a sulfonamide antibiotic 34 is mostly used as a veterinary drug for controlling infectious diseases and promoting animal growth 35 37 since most smt is unlikely to be metabolized following its uptake by animals 35 37 it has been found in aquatic environments following discharge in feces and urine 35 37 since smt is resistant to biodegradation it cannot be effectively degraded biologically 36 37 therefore numerous effective approaches to degrading smt have been attempted including photolysis and photocatalytic decomposition 36 the uv h2o2 process 37 a fenton like process 38 electrochemical degradation 39 gamma irradiation with h2o2 40 and sonolytic degradation 41 in recent years sr aops have been used to degrade smt they include uv ps 5 heat ps 42 and the nanoscale zero valent iron ps 43 processes the uv ps process for degrading smt has been carried out at low ps concentrations 0 05 0 5 mm 5 gao et al 5 achieved about 97 degradation of smt 0 02 mm at a ps concentration of 0 2 mm in 45 min under uv 254 nm hence to promote the smt degradation high ps concentrations 0 5 mm should be used most studies of the degradation of organic compounds using the uv ps process have used a reactor with a capacity 0 5 l 4 6 13 15 19 21 22 24 25 27 32 for example wang et al 15 adopted the uv ps process to degrade 2 4 di tert butylphenol in a reactor that contained 200 ml aqueous 2 4 di tert butylphenol some earlier studies even used a reactor with a capacity 0 1 l to conduct the uv ps process 6 16 19 21 22 24 27 32 for example zhou et al 22 utilized the uv ps process to degrade diatrizoate in a reactor that contained 50 ml aqueous diatrizoate only our group has used a large reactor with a capacity of 3 l to perform the uv ps process 9 10 to promote the industrial use of the uv ps process a large reactor with a capacity of 3 l is utilized to investigate the effects of the operating parameters on the effectiveness of this process therefore the major goal of this study is to examine the performance of a large reactor that contained 3 l aqueous smt in the smt degradation using the uv ps process the effects of uv wavelength ps concentration initial smt concentration and addition of anions on the smt degradation are also determined 2 experimental 2 1 degradation of smt aqueous smt was produced by dissolving sulfamethazine powder 99 sigma aldrich in deionized water that was provided by a direct q 3 uv r tap to pure ultrapure water purification system merck millipore each experiment was carried out in a pyrex cylindrical reactor in a batch operation as shown in fig 1 in each experiment 3 l of aqueous smt was placed in the reactor two quartz sleeves were in a vertical orientation in the reactor each quartz sleeve housed a 8 w low pressure mercury lamp two kinds of uv lamp with different wavelengths of maximum emission 254 or 365 nm were used the aqueous smt was completely mixed using an agitator which was placed on the centerline of the reactor nitrogen aeration was carried out in the degradation to remove dissolved oxygen from the aqueous smt a temperature controlled water bath was used to maintain the aqueous smt at 25 c the original ph of the aqueous smt was about 6 a specified amount of na2s2o8 99 sigma aldrich was added as a source of ps when the temperature and ph of the aqueous smt were 25 c and 6 respectively the two uv lamps were subsequently turned on and the degradation continued for 30 min 2 2 analytical methods at each designated sampling interval a sample with a volume of 1 ml was withdrawn through a sampling port on the top of the reactor and quenched instantly by adding 1 ml of methanol 99 sigma aldrich which is an effective agent for quenching active radicals 37 a high performance liquid chromatography hplc jasco equipped with a shimadzu vp ods column 250 mm 4 6 mm and a uv vis detector was used to analyze the concentration of smt in the sample 37 43 a mixture of acetonitrile and deionized water in a ratio of 35 65 v v was used as the mobile phase 5 37 43 the flow rate of the mobile phase was kept at 1 ml min 5 37 43 the injected volume for each sample was 50 μl and the spectrophotometric analysis of smt was performed at 266 nm 5 37 43 a torch combustion toc analyzer teledyne tekmar was used to measure the concentration of total organic carbon toc in the sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 effectiveness of uv ps process to elucidate the effectiveness of the uv ps process smt was degraded using three processes 1 uv 2 ps and 3 uv ps the initial smt concentration was 10 mg l a uv wavelength of 254 nm was used in the uv and uv ps processes a ps concentration of 10 mm was used in the ps and uv ps processes fig 2 presents results concerning the smt degradation using the three processes the ps process only degraded 3 of smt in 30 min this observation indicates that ps alone only slightly degraded smt the degradation efficiency of smt using the uv process was 79 in 30 min 37 in the uv ps process the degradation efficiency of smt increased very significantly with time reaching 100 in 4 min our group obtained a similar result concerning the ciprofloxacin 10 mg l degradation using the uv ps process in a large reactor that contained 3 l of aqueous ciprofloxacin under uv 254 nm 10 our results showed that the degradation efficiency of ciprofloxacin using the uv process was 15 in 30 min 10 at an na2s2o8 concentration of 1 92 g l 95 of ciprofloxacin was degraded in 30 min using the uv ps process but no degradation of ciprofloxacin was achieved in the ps process 10 a similar result was obtained by gao et al 14 who utilized the uv ps process to degrade florfenicol 20 μm under uv 254 nm the degradation efficiency of florfenicol using the uv process was about 25 in 60 min 14 at an na2s2o8 concentration of 2 mm about 98 of florfenicol was degraded in 60 min using the uv ps process but no florfenicol was degraded in the ps process 14 recently our group degraded isopropyl alcohol 250 mg l using the uv ps process under uv 254 nm in a large reactor that contained 2 l of aqueous isopropyl alcohol 33 our results revealed that the degradation efficiency of isopropyl alcohol using the uv process was about 4 in 30 min 33 at an na2s2o8 concentration of 2 1 g l isopropyl alcohol was completely degraded in 25 min using the uv ps process whereas only about 4 of isopropyl alcohol was degraded in 30 min using the ps process 33 the ph value of the aqueous solution was an important parameter that influenced the degradation of target organic compounds as displayed in fig 3 in the uv ps process the ph fell from 6 1 to 4 3 in just 1 min and then decreased slowly to 2 6 at 30 min this observation was caused by the decomposition of ps eq 1 which yielded protons since so4 reacted with water eqs 2 and 3 9 10 and acidic by products that were produced in the smt degradation using the uv ps process in the uv process the ph declined from 5 9 to 4 8 after 30 min suggesting that acidic by products were produced in the smt degradation using the uv process however in the ps process the ph changed from 5 9 to 4 5 within just 1 min and then remained at the latter value possibly because few so4 was produced so the smt degradation was limited 2 so4 h2o hso4 ho 3 hso4 h so4 2 both so4 and ho have been proposed to be responsible for the degradation of organic compounds in the uv ps process 9 10 33 methanol meoh and tert butyl alcohol tba were used as probes to check the production of the dominant radical by the activation of ps 33 43 the rate constant 9 7 108 l mol 1 s 1 44 for the reaction of meoh with ho is close to the rate constant 6 0 108 l mol 1 s 1 44 for the reaction of tba with ho however the rate constant 1 0 107 l mol 1 s 1 45 for the reaction of meoh with so4 exceeds the rate constant 8 4 105 l mol 1 s 1 45 for the reaction of tba with so4 therefore meoh is utilized as a quenching agent for ho and so4 and tba is used as a scavenger of ho hence the smt degradation using the uv ps process was affected by the addition of these alcohols and the dominant radical that was produced in the smt degradation using the uv ps process can be identified radical scavenging tests were conducted at a ps concentration of 10 mm and an initial smt concentration of 10 mg l under uv 254 nm as shown in fig 4 adding tba tba ps molar ratio 10 1 reduced the degradation efficiency of smt in 1 min from 59 to 46 and adding meoh meoh ps molar ratio 10 1 reduced the degradation efficiency of smt in 1 min from 59 to 11 the inhibition of the smt degradation by the addition of meoh greatly exceeded that by the addition of tba revealing that so4 was produced in preference to ho in the smt degradation using the uv ps process under uv 254 nm as proposed by our group so4 predominated in the degradation of polyvinyl alcohol using the uv ps process in a large reactor that contained 3 l of aqueous polyvinyl alcohol under uv 254 nm 9 a similar result that was obtained by our group demonstrated that so4 was the primary radical for the efficient degradation of ciprofloxacin using the uv ps process in a large reactor that contained 3 l of aqueous ciprofloxacin under uv 254 nm 10 recently our group identified so4 as the dominant radical that was produced in the degradation of isopropyl alcohol using the uv ps process in a large reactor that contained 2 l of aqueous isopropyl alcohol under uv 254 nm resulting in the effective degradation of isopropyl alcohol 33 according to the above results and discussion the uv ps process can effectively degrade smt by the following mechanism one ps molecule can produce two so4 radicals under uv radiation consistent with eq 1 and so4 can induce a series of radical chain reactions by which smt was degraded eq 4 therefore in the uv ps process more so4 was produced strongly degrading smt as presented in fig 2 4 so4 smt degradation products 3 2 degradation of smt the smt degradation using the uv ps process is consistent with the pseudo first order kinetic model eq 5 the slope of a plot of ln c0 c versus time yields the observed degradation rate constant of smt k to determine the effects of the operating parameters on the smt degradation using the uv ps process k values were estimated under a wide range of operating parameters 5 ln c 0 c kt where c0 is the initial smt concentration c is the concentration of smt at time t and k is the observed degradation rate constant of smt 3 2 1 effect of uv wavelength to study the effect of uv wavelength on the smt degradation experiments were carried out using a ps concentration of 10 mm and an initial smt concentration of 10 mg l as presented in fig 5 the degradation efficiency of smt using the uv 365 nm ps and uv 254 nm ps processes was 25 and 100 respectively in 4 min suggesting that the degradation efficiency of smt was considerably affected by the uv wavelength the k values for the uv 365 nm ps and uv 254 nm ps processes were 0 078 and 2 026 min 1 respectively indicating that the latter process degraded smt much more rapidly than the former the energy that was obtained using uv 254 nm was higher than that obtained using uv 365 nm so more so4 was produced eq 1 therefore more smt was degraded eq 4 notably the ph of the aqueous smt declined in the degradation as displayed in fig 6 the final ph value 2 6 in the uv 254 nm ps process was lower than that 4 0 in the uv 365 nm ps process as stated elsewhere 13 when ps was present in the acidic aqueous solution more so4 was produced as a result of acid catalysis so the uv 254 nm ps process produced more so4 than the uv 365 nm ps process hence more degradation of smt was obtained in the uv 254 nm ps process eq 4 our group obtained a similar result when we used the uv ps process to degrade polyvinyl alcohol in a large reactor that contained 3 l of aqueous polyvinyl alcohol 9 the degradation efficiency of polyvinyl alcohol 20 mg l using the uv 254 nm ps and uv 365 nm ps processes was 100 and 14 in 5 min respectively at an na2s2o8 concentration of 0 12 g l 9 3 2 2 effect of ps concentration to elucidate the effect of ps concentration on the smt degradation experiments were performed at diverse ps concentrations and an initial smt concentration of 10 mg l under uv 254 nm fig 7 shows the results that were obtained at diverse ps concentrations 1 to 20 mm under uv 254 nm as shown in fig 7 the degradation efficiency of smt in 1 min at ps concentrations of 1 2 5 10 and 20 mm was 16 26 40 59 and 81 respectively revealing that increasing the ps concentration from 1 to 20 mm increased the degradation efficiency of smt the k values for the smt degradation at diverse ps concentrations were estimated graphically and shown in table 1 increasing ps concentration from 1 to 10 mm increased the k value and the k value at a ps concentration of 10 mm was about 13 7 times that at a ps concentration of 1 mm this observation demonstrates the absence of any inhibitive effect of ps at concentrations of 1 10 mm however the k value at a ps concentration of 20 mm was about 17 5 times that at a ps concentration of 1 mm more ps produced more so4 eq 1 leading to greater degradation of smt however at a ps concentration of 20 mm so4 reacted more strongly with more s2o8 2 eq 6 9 yielding a slightly higher concentration of so4 than at a lower ps concentration of 10 mm the results reveal that so4 more effectively degraded smt than did s2o8 accordingly ps inhibited the smt degradation rate using the uv 254 nm ps process at a high ps concentration of 20 mm 6 so4 s2o8 2 so4 2 s2o8 our group obtained a similar finding regarding the ciprofloxacin degradation using the uv ps process in a large reactor that contained 3 l of aqueous ciprofloxacin under uv 254 nm 10 the degradation efficiency of ciprofloxacin 10 mg l in 2 min at na2s2o8 concentrations of 0 24 0 48 0 96 1 92 and 3 84 g l were 16 26 35 50 and 54 respectively 10 these results show that excessive ps did not apparently increase the degradation efficiency of ciprofloxacin noticeably reducing the effect of ps concentration on the ciprofloxacin degradation 10 as shown in table 1 the coefficient of determination r2 can be used to estimate the agreement between experimental data and the results obtained using the model eq 5 the high values of r2 0 95 at all ps concentrations demonstrated that the smt degradation using the uv 254 nm ps process followed pseudo first order kinetics at all ps concentrations additionally the time for complete degradation decreased as the ps concentration was increased from 1 to 20 mm when the ps concentration was 10 mm all smt was degraded was in 4 min this period was close to that 3 min obtained at a ps concentration of 20 mm this observation verifies the inhibitory effect of ps on the smt degradation using the uv 254 nm ps process the final ph deceased as the ps concentration was increased from 1 to 20 mm and was always less than 4 suggesting that the smt degradation proceeded in acidic environments at all ps concentrations the electrical energy in kwh that is required to reduce the concentration of organic compounds in 1 m3 of water by one order of magnitude can be used to calculate the electrical energy per order of organic compounds removal ee o 10 33 37 46 47 the degradation of a low concentration of smt 10 mg l using the uv 254 nm ps process is consistent with pseudo first order kinetics and the ee o kwh m 3 order 1 is given by the following equation 10 33 37 46 47 the ee o values for the smt 10 mg l degradation using the uv 254 nm ps process at diverse ps concentrations were calculated and shown in table 1 the lowest ee o value in the uv 254 nm ps process with an initial smt concentration of 10 mg l was 0 079 kw h m 3 order 1 at a ps concentration of 20 mm 7 ee o 38 4p vk where p denotes the power of the uv lamp kw v represents the volume of the aqueous smt l and k is the observed degradation rate constant of smt min 1 3 2 3 effect of initial smt concentration the effect of the initial smt concentration on the smt degradation must be examined fig 8 presents the results obtained at a ps concentration of 10 mm under uv 254 nm the degradation efficiency of smt at initial smt concentrations of 5 10 20 and 50 mg l was 96 59 19 and 4 respectively in 1 min implying that reducing the initial smt concentration increased the degradation efficiency of smt this finding can be attributed to the fact that although the initial concentration of smt was increased the ps concentration did not suffice to degrade it as listed in table 2 reducing the initial smt concentration increased the k value implying that the degradation rate of smt increased as the initial smt concentration was decreased this relationship arose from the fact that increasingly more uv was absorbed by smt than by ps as the initial smt concentration was increased since the uv absorbance of smt at 254 nm was higher than that of ps hence less so4 was produced eq 1 so the reaction of so4 with smt was retarded the final ph increased from 2 38 to 3 24 with an increase in the initial smt concentration in the range from 5 to 50 mg l indicating that more acidic by products were produced in the smt degradation using the uv 254 nm ps process at a lower initial smt concentration a higher ee o value for the smt degradation using the uv 254 nm ps process was associated with a larger initial smt concentration showing that more energy had to be consumed to degrade more smt 3 2 4 effect of addition of anions to study the effect of the addition of anions 10 mm on the smt degradation nano3 99 5 sigma aldrich na2so4 99 j t baker and nacl 99 j t baker were added to the aqueous smt 10 mg l fig 9 displays the effect of the addition of anions on the degradation efficiency of smt at a ps concentration of 1 mm under uv 254 nm in 3 min the degradation efficiency of smt without anions was 34 which was higher than the 18 achieved with nano3 the 25 with na2so4 and the 32 with nacl based on eq 5 and fig 9 the k values that were obtained with the addition of nacl and na2so4 were 0 138 min 1 and 0 120 min 1 respectively which were slightly lower than that 0 148 min 1 obtained without anions however the k value that was obtained with the addition of nano3 was 0 078 min 1 which was much lower than that 0 148 min 1 obtained without anions these findings reveal that adding anions reduced the degradation efficiency and rate of smt hence the smt degradation using the uv 254 nm ps process was limited by the anions in the order no3 so4 2 cl adding no3 inhibited the smt degradation possibly because it reduced the amount of so4 by reacting with it 9 as described by eq 8 9 moreover so4 may be more reactive than no3 with smt therefore the degradation efficiency and rate of smt was reduced by adding no3 so4 2 slightly affected the smt degradation but it scarcely reacted with so4 9 thus the reduction in the degradation efficiency and rate of smt as a result of the presence of so4 2 is attributable to the fact that so4 2 may absorb more uv than s2o8 2 9 8 so4 no3 so4 2 no3 our group used the uv ps process to degrade polyvinyl alcohol in a large reactor that contained 3 l of aqueous polyvinyl alcohol with the addition of anions 9 the degradation efficiency of polyvinyl alcohol 20 mg l without anions in 2 min was about 99 which exceeded the about 13 29 and 84 that were achieved with nacl nano3 and na2so4 respectively at an na2s2o8 concentration of 0 5 mm and an anion concentration of 100 mm under uv 254 nm 9 these results demonstrate that cl and no3 strongly inhibited the degradation of polyvinyl alcohol using the uv 254 nm ps process in a large reactor that contained 3 l of aqueous polyvinyl alcohol however in this study cl slightly affected the smt degradation cl reacted with so4 to form cl eq 9 9 which reacted with cl to form cl2 eq 10 48 the reactivities of cl and cl2 with smt may be close to the reactivity of so4 with smt therefore adding cl negligibly inhibited the smt degradation 9 so4 cl so4 2 cl 10 cl cl cl2 3 3 mineralization of smt to verify the mineralization of smt in its degradation using the uv 254 nm ps process toc concentrations were measured table 3 presents the degradation and mineralization of smt 10 mg l at a ps concentration of 10 mm over time the degradation efficiency of smt in 15 min was 100 however the mineralization of smt was 83 at that time the mineralization of smt increased with time reaching 96 in 120 min with complete degradation gao et al 5 found that about 30 of smt at an initial concentration of 0 02 mm was mineralized at a ps concentration of 0 2 mm in 45 min under uv 254 nm accordingly a higher concentration of ps resulted in greater mineralization of smt 3 4 comparison with other methods table 4 compares the various methods for degrading smt the uv ps process degrades more smt than the uv h2o2 process suggesting that so4 was more reactive than oh with smt we found a similar result when we used the uv ps and uv h2o2 processes to degrade polyvinyl alcohol 20 mg l in large reactor that contained 3 l of aqueous polyvinyl alcohol 49 the degradation efficiency of polyvinyl alcohol using the uv ps and uv h2o2 processes at ph 3 and 25 c with an oxidant concentration of 0 25 mm under uv 254 nm was 100 and 58 respectively in 5 min implying that the uv ps process was more efficient than the uv h2o2 process in the degradation of polyvinyl alcohol 49 although the nzvi ps process is slightly less effective than the uv ps process when the volume of aqueous smt was increased to 3 l the degradation efficiency of smt decreased dramatically owing to the significant agglomeration of nzvi therefore the uv ps process degrades smt more effectively than other methods 4 conclusions this study concerns the performance of a large reactor in the degradation of sulfamethazine smt in water using the uv ps process the degradation efficiency and rate of smt using the uv 254 nm ps process were higher than those using the uv 365 nm ps process in the uv 254 nm ps process increasing the ps concentration increased the degradation efficiency of smt however ps at high concentration exhibited an inhibitory effect on the smt degradation rate using the uv 254 nm ps process a higher degradation efficiency and rate of smt using the uv 254 nm ps process was obtained at a lower initial smt concentration pseudo first order kinetics fit the smt degradation using the uv 254 nm ps process in a large reactor quenching studies using alcohols demonstrate that so4 dominated the smt degradation using the uv 254 nm ps process in a large reactor adding anions reduced the degradation efficiency and rate of smt using the uv 254 nm ps process in the order no3 so4 2 cl all smt was degraded in 2 min using the uv 254 nm ps process at a ps concentration of 10 mm and an initial smt concentration of 5 mg l without the addition of anions the obtained results obviously show the potential of a large reactor with high ps concentrations for the effective degradation of smt in water using the uv 254 nm ps process acknowledgements the

14363,increasing presence of endocrine disrupting compounds edcs in water sources and their adverse health effects on aquatic life are major concerns for water utilities and authorities worldwide the oxidation kinetics for degradation of ozone resistant steroid hormones were investigated to quantify their removal in natural water under varying water temperatures and ph studying effect of temperature on oxidation of these compounds is one of the novel aspects of this research the fate of four progestogens progesterone medroxyprogesetrone levonorgestrel and norethindrone and for the first time of the androgenic steroid testosterone in the presence of ozone was measured at bench scale in ultrapure water natural surface water and wastewater the estimated second order constant rate for testosterone of 590 0 13 m 1s 1 was comparable to our estimates and previous reports for similar structure progesterone 444 601 m 1s 1 and medroxyprogesterone 532 0 04 m 1s 1 and significantly lower than for levonorgestrel 2233 m 1s 1 and norethindrone 2292 m 1s 1 for all compounds the second order rate constants increased from 3 folds for norethindrone to 5 5 folds for progesterone with temperatures ranging from 5 to 35 c the required activation energy was estimated for the five selected steroids and ranged from 30 kj mol 1 norethindrone to 39 kj mol 1 progesterone the removal rates of the selected compounds were predicted in natural water and wastewater finally we showed that ozonation using typical disinfection dosages cto3 2 mg min l 1 were capable of removing 77 progesterone to 99 levonorgestrel at 21 c and even less 47 medroxyprogesterone to 96 norethindrone at 5 c of the selected compounds keywords water and wastewater treatment ozone oxidation kinetic steroid hormones endocrine disruptors testosterone 1 introduction the adverse health effects of endocrine disrupting compounds edcs on aquatic life have resulted in increased concern regarding their occurrence in the aquatic environment 1 3 various hormones and their metabolites considered as edcs have been detected in wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents 4 10 and surface waters around the world since many years ago 11 16 progestogens were detected at concentrations ranging between 1 100 ng l 1 in surface waters at similar levels as in effluents of wastewater treatment plants with primary and secondary processes with no post disinfection or additional filtration processes 17 18 testosterone and progesterone were measured in french surface waters with concentrations in the range of 0 1 15 6 ng l 1 19 with effluents from treatment plants being recognized as the main source of these compounds 7 the occurrence of low but estrogenically active concentrations of steroidal hormones picogerams per liter pg l 1 to few nanograms per liter ng l 1 in treated drinking water is poorly documented mainly because of the costly and complex analytical methods required for their detection 20 24 while conventional water treatment processes such as coagulation sedimentation has been reported to be insufficient for steroids removal 25 26 advanced treatment processes such as activated carbon filtration and advanced oxidation processes have been found to effectively transforme or remove steroids 27 28 ozone has been reported as the most promising oxidant to consider for their removal from water and wastewater 29 35 the kinetics of hormone oxidation by common oxidants has been described for the chlorination of estrogens 36 37 and the oxidation of four progestogens with potassium permanganate 38 the oxidation of steroid estrogens estrone estradiol estriol and 17α ethinylestradiol by ozone over a wide range of ph 2 5 10 5 revealed very high reactivity of estrogens with ozone 1 05 105 m 1s 1 for estriol to 2 21 105 m 1s 1 for estradiol 39 under the water treatment conditions considered ph 7 21 c estrogens were easily removed 95 with a very low ozone exposure of 2 0 10 3 mg min l 1 39 as for more recalcitrant hormones which are the focus of this investigation limited information is available about the actual second order kinetic ozonation constants the effect of ph and water quality see table 2 for available data furthermore no information is available concerning the effect of water temperature on oxidation of these compounds barron et al 40 estimated the second order rate constant for progesterone at ph ranging from 2 to 8 showing that this compound was much less reactive than estrogenic hormones the second order kinetic rate constant of molecular ozone oxidation of progesterone in presence of tert butanol as hydroxyl radical scavenger was reported to be independent of ph and equal to 480 m 1 s 1 at 18 c 40 second order oxidation constants of four progestogens were estimated by broseus et al 41 who showed that a ct of 2 mg l 1 o3 removes more than 90 of natural and synthetic progestagens in filtered surface water observational studies reporting overall removals of hormones by ozone have focused mostly on natural estrogens 42 45 26 and at removal of some progestogens 40 41 the oxidation of pharmaceuticals and ee2 in wwtp effluents with variable suspended particle concentrations 0 20 mg l 1 was tested at ozone dosages of 2 mg l 1 43 ozonation of seven steroids including progesterone and testosterone was studied during surface water and wastewater ozonation in nevada usa 46 up to 99 84 and 87 of estrogenic steroids progesterone and testosterone respectively were removed with an ozone concentration of 2 5 mg l 1 in surface water ozonation toc 3 23 mg l 1 t 21 c for ww a much higher concentration of 7 1 mg l 1 was required to remove 99 of steroids including testosterone all these studies confirm the interest of ozonation to remove recalcitrant steroids including testosterone although ozonation appears to be a most promising treatment process it must be acknowledged that there is limited information on the fate and risks in terms of biological activity associated with the transformation products of ozone oxidation of steroid hormones 47 for example two ozonation by products of progesterone were found resistant to further reaction with ozone but are likely to be more biodegradable than the parent compound based on their structure 48 the objectives of this study were to fill several data gaps on the kinetics of five natural progesterone and testosterone and synthetic medroxyprogesterone norethindrone and levonorgestrel steroid hormones which are considered to be recalcitrant to ozonation by 1 providing the first estimate of a second order constant rate for the ozonation of testosterone 2 quantifying the effect of ph on the oxidation of these compounds 3 estimating the activation energy for the range of temperature typical in water treatment 4 applying the confirmed rate constants for the four progestogens and the newly estimated rate constant for testosterone in natural water and wastewater and finally 5 quantifying expected removal of the five target compounds under typical ozonation operational conditions set by disinfection 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards and reagents target compounds including progesterone medroxyprogesterone levonorgestrel norethindrone and testosterone were purchased from sigma aldrich canada oakville on canada 13c3 estradiol which is used as an internal standard was supplied by acp chemical inc montreal qc canada stock solutions of hormones were prepared by dissolving 25 mg of high purity hormone in 25 ml of lc grade acetone with final concentration of acetone equal to 0 6 mm the stock solutions of hormones were stored in the dark at 4 c diluted solutions 1 mg l 1 were prepared using ultrapure water to achieve an initial individual hormone concentration of 10 μg l 1 in the ozonation reactor pre tests on different initial concentrations of individual hormones on ozone demand confirmed that 10 μg l 1 of each hormone in acetone solution had a minimal effect on the initial ozone demand and also provided enough residual hormones after 10 min ozonation reaction in order to precisely measure their concentration over the reaction time as needed for kinetic constant calculations acetone has a low reactivity towards ozone k o3 acetone 0 032 m 1s 1 49 and pre tests showed that such a low quantity of acetone did not interfere with hormone oxidation figure s1 para chlorobenzoic acid ρcba and tert butanol tertbuoh solutions were prepared using commercial compounds dissolved in ultrapure water to yield final concentrations of 200 μg l 1 1 28 μm and 50 mm respectively 2 2 surface water and wwtp effluent samples water samples were collected i after conventional treatment alum coagulation settling and sand anthracite filtration and before ozonation and biological carbon filtration at a surface water drinking water treatment plant dwtp eastern canada and ii from the effluent of aerated lagoons with 90 000 m3 d 1 capacity samples were collected in pre washed distilled water and then ultrapure water 5 l polypropylene containers water samples were filtered through pre rinsed 0 45 μm hydrophilic polyethersulfone membranes supor 450 pall usa the characteristics of the water samples are provided in table 1 these samples were spiked with concentrations of 10 μg l 1 of each hormone prior to oxidation experiments based on a previous study 50 the background concentrations of hormones in surface water and wwtp effluent are much lower 2 ng l 1 to 90 ng l 1 than the spiked concentrations 2 3 ozonation experiments ozonation experiments were successively conducted on three types of tested waters buffered ultrapure water un buffered filtered water samples collected from a dwtp and diluted wwtp effluent the ozonation of wwtp effluents is usually tested in continuous systems due to the high initial ozone demand and to maintain a sufficient residual ozone concentration during the experiment the wastewater ww must be diluted during batch experiments in order to reduce the initial demands for ozone to detectable levels and follow the ozone decomposition during the reaction 1 l filtered ww was diluted with 1 l ultrapure water and the alkalinity was adjusted using 0 5 m sodium bicarbonate during experiments with ultrapure water the ph was held constant at 6 0 or 8 0 using a phosphate buffer final concentrations of 0 82 and 0 35 m respectively however for experiments with natural water and wwtp effluent the ph of samples remained untouched and pre examinations showed that dilution did not significantly affect the final ph of wwtp effluent neither the ozonation process changed the ph value zone stock solutions 50 60 mg l 1 were prepared by sparging gaseous ozone produced with an oxygen fed ozone generator ozone service bc ca through 1 l ultrapure water flasks placed in ice bath bath temperature 0 c all tests were conducted in a true batch reactor consisting of a 2 l beaker covered with a floating teflon lid to prevent ozone from degassing an appropriate volume of ozone stock solution was added in each reactor to yield the target ozone concentrations 0 10 mg l 1 without causing the dilution effect the maximum added volume of ozone stock solution to reach 10 mg o3 l 1 was 180 ml in 1000 ml of diluted wastewater dilution was accounted for in the measured concentrations hormone and ozone residuals were measured at defined time intervals over a 10 min period by collecting 5 ml samples that were dispensed in 20 ml of indigo solution 0 02 1 or 3 the reaction of hormones with ozone was stopped by using ascorbic acid initial concentration 2 mg l 1 2 4 determining the rate constants for the reaction of ozone with steroids the direct reaction kinetic of ozone with hormones is first order with respect to both ozone and hormone concentration 35 and is given by the following equation 1 l n p p 0 k o 3 p c t d t k o 3 p c t o 3 where p is the target compound and k o3 p is the second order rate constant with ozone m 1s 1 obtained from experiments in buffered ultrapure water with radical scavenger tert buoh at constant ph 6 ozone exposure cto3 values expressed in m s were calculated using the effective ct concept 51 which represents the area under the ozone decay curve at time t 2 c t o 3 c t e f f e c t i v e c t d t c 0 k 1 e x p k t where c and c0 are the residual ozone at time t and the initial ozone concentration mg l 1 respectively and k is the pseudo first order ozone decay rate min 1 the oxidation of steroids during ozonation is predicted by application of residual ozone concentration in order to calculate ct value and measure of compound s residual concentration over the reaction time in eq 1 to investigate ozonation of steroids with ozone and hydroxyl radicals the exposure to both oxidants should be known the ozone exposure can be measured by eq 2 and direct measurement of ozone residual however it is difficult to measure the concentration of radicals in the solution as they react super quickly in order to evaluate the reactivity of steroids with both oxidants indirect measurement of hydroxyl radicals using an ozone resistant reference compound ρcba has been recommended 35 since ρcba has a very low reactivity with ozone the oxidation of ρcba can be formulated as follow 3 l n ρ c b a ρ c b a 0 k o h ρ c b a o h d t k o h ρ c b a c t o h according to eq 3 radical exposure ctoh can be measured indirectly with relative decrease in concentration of ρcba over the time t elovitz et al 1999 has defined an empirical term rct which is the ratio of ozone exposure and radical exposure r c t c t o h c t o 3 52 the rct term can be replaced in eq 3 as follow in order to substitute radical exposure ctoh which is difficult to measure 4 l n ρ c b a ρ c b a 0 r c t k o h ρ c b a c t o 3 the rct value can be experimentally calculated by measuring the decrease in ρcba concentration while reacting with ozone the slop of the plot of eq 4 can yield the rct value at defined temperature and over the ozonation reaction time the observed second order rate constants for reaction of hormones with both ozone and hydroxyl radicals can be estimated without radical scavenger and using ρcba as reference compound the observed rate constants can be obtained using the following equation 5 l n p p 0 k o b s c t o 3 k o 3 p k o h p r c t c t o 3 where k o h p is the rate constant for the reaction of hormone p with hydroxyl radicals k o b s is the observed rate constant for reaction of hormone with both oxidants o3 and oh 2 5 dissolved ozone analysis the dissolved ozone concentrations in the stock solution and the residual ozone concentration following oxidation were both determined using the standard colorimetric method 4500 o3 53 using indigo trisulfonate ε600nm 20 000 m 1 cm 1 the absorbance was measured at 600 nm in a 1 cm or 2 cm quartz cell using a varian cary 100 victoria australia spectrophotometer 2 6 quantification of hormones and ρcba hormones were analyzed using on line solid phase extraction spe coupled with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry under the experimental condition the detection limit of steroids was 0 13 0 03 μg l 1 1500 μl injection volume the atmospheric pressure photoionization appi was used as an ionization source for the detection of hormones the complete detection and quantification methods used for hormones are described previously 50 the hydroxyl radical exposure was measured indirectly by oxidizing an ozone resistant molecule ρcba to analyze the degradation of ρcba 1 ml sub samples were also collected from reactor in parallel and filtered on 0 45 μm filters millex hv for analysis of ρcba concentration using reverse phase hplc 60 acidified water at ph 2 with h2so4 and 40 methanol the detection of ρcba was made using diode array detection at 236 nm with detection limit of 0 2 μg l 1 1 27 μm elite lachrom hitachi the detailed description of the column characteristics and mobile phases are described elsewhere 54 2 7 activation energy of the reaction of ozone hormone the activation energy eact for ozone hormone reactions is calculated in buffered ultrapure water at ph 6 using the arrhenius s law applied to the data obtained at four different temperatures 5 15 21 and 35 c 6 k a exp e a c t r t where eact is the activation energy j mol 1 r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 a is the frequency factor m 1 s 1 and t is the absolute temperature k 3 results and discussion 3 1 rate constants for the reactions of the hormones with ozone the second order rate constants for the reactions of four progestogens and for the first time for testosterone with ozone in buffered ultrapure water at ph 6 in the presence of a radical scavenger are determined using eq 1 and results are presented in table 2 testosterone exhibited similar reactivity towards ozone as progesterone and medroxyprogesterone c a ko3 532 594 m 1s 1 potentially due to their very similar chemical structures and more importantly because they have the same substituents at their cc double bound which probably results in similar reactive intermediates table 2 no significant difference was found between the reactivity of levonorgestrel and norethindrone towards ozone p 0 05 with reaction rate constants of ko3 levo 2233 m 1 s 1 and ko3 nore 2292 m 1 s 1 by comparing the chemical structure of selected compounds some hypotheses can raise to describe their different reactivity towards ozone the acetyl group on carbon 17 of progesterone has electron withdrawing additional substituent which reduces its reactivity towards ozone compared to the ethynyl group in the levonorgestrel and norethindrone structure this effect was observed before in galaxolide and tonalide as two similar musk fragrances tonalide with an acetyl group shows a smaller reaction rate constant ko3 tonalide 8 m 1s 1 compared to galaxolide ko3 galaxolide 140 m 1s 1 55 furthermore norethindrone and levonorgestrel have a hydrogen atom on their c10 carbon atom one of the substituents at cc double bound whereas three others have methyl on the same carbon although the methyl group has no direct effect on the reactivity of cc double bond the steric hindrance of the methyl group can decrease the reactivity of the steroid hormones or prevents further oxidation of intermediate oxidation products hence the higher reactivity of norethindrone and levonorgestrel could be explained by i higher reactivity of the ethynyl group towards ozonation or ii lower steric hindrance on cc bond due to the presence of h substituent instead of ch3 however further research is required to speculate which of the two reasons is the prevalent norethindrone and levonorgestrel have slightly different rate constants potentially due to their different reactive groups methyl in levonorgestrel and ethyl in norethindrone although methyl and ethyl group are both nonreactive towards ozone this difference in the additional reactive groups causes slightly different reaction constants in these two compounds comparing the reactivity of testosterone and progestogens with estrogens the reaction rate constants are about 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of estrogenic steroids ko3 estrogens 105 m 1s 1 although all the steroid hormones have three hexagonal rings a b and c and one pentagonal ring d there are significant differences between their functional groups estrogens have a phenolic group with high reactivity towards ozone ko3 phenol 1 3 104 m 1 s 1 49 in the a ring position while the progestogens and testosterone are olefinic compounds with carbonyl group in the same ring the carbonyl group is considered to reduce the reactivity of cc double bond in these compounds 33 carbamazepine an antiepileptic drug commonly detected in wwtp effluents and surface waters that has an olefin group as its electron rich moiety is highly reactive with ozone ko3 3 105 m 1 s 1 43 another olefinic compound that in contrast has a low reactivity with ozone is the artificial sweetener acesulfame with ko3 88 m 1 s 1 56 therefore being an olefinic compound is not the determining factor in reactivity towards ozone the electron withdrawing or donating properties of substituents at the cc double bound and their corresponding reactivity with ozone can strongly affect their second order rate constants even the different conformations of olefins isomeric olefins for instance can strongly affect the produced ozonide and consequently the related reaction rate constant as an example the reaction rate constant of 1 1 dicholoroethylene ko3 22 m 1 s 1 is much smaller than that of 1 2 dichloroethylene ko3 591 m 1 s 1 57 the biological activity of oxidation products could greatly change through the oxidation with ozone compare to parent compounds ozone transformation products from oxidation of olefinic compounds such as progesterone which usually results in production of aldehydes ketones or carboxylic acids are more reported easily biodegradable than the parent compounds 48 recently the application of computer aided programs using model compounds in combination with available reaction rate constants is developing rapidly hence product formation mechanisms as well as their reaction rate constants can be estimated via predictive in silico tools 48 58 recent advances in molecular modeling has significantly improved the ability to predict the reactivity if chemical compounds with different oxidants assessing the electronic structures of selected compounds could provide a better understanding of their oxidation reactivity towards ozone reactivity of two compounds depends on the energies of the frontier molecular orbitals that is εhomo the highest occupied molecular orbital and εlumo the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital which reflect the potential reactivity between two compounds these energies can be calculated for any chemical compound using computational quantum chemistry techniques the smaller the energy difference δε between the homo of the nucleophile reactant and the lumo of the electrophile oxidant the higher is the reactivity between two compounds ozone is a strong electrophile compound and has εhomo of 9 07 ev and εlumo of 5 50 ev 33 the greater reactivity of levonorgestrel compared to progesterone observed through experiments is in agreement with the δε differences between ozone and progesterone which is 1 2 ev and 1 07 ev between ozone and levonorgestrel also δε between ozone and estrogens is 0 52 ev which confirms their higher reactivity with ozone compared to progestogens 33 3 2 effect of ph on oxidative transformation of steroids the oxidation rate of steroids testosterone and progestogens using 2 mg l 1 of ozone at 21 c was evaluated at ph 6 in presence of a radical scavenger 50 mm tertbuoh and at ph 8 without radical scavenger figure s2 higher removal rates are expected at ph 8 since more hydroxyl radicals are produced from ozone decomposition at ph 8 59 however in the case of this study which ozone decomposition was the only source of hydroxyl radicals and no hydrogen peroxide was added the concentration of radicals was very low to affect the oxidation rate of recalcitrant compounds therefore the difference between removal rates at ph 6 and 8 was limited between 1 for norethindrone and 8 for medroxyprogesterone this result is consistent with the fact that steroid hormones are not ph sensitive because their chemical structure does not contain acidic or basic moieties the independence of the ko3 relative to ph was also noted in another study of progesterone oxidation with ozone 40 the rate constant for the direct reaction of progesterone with ozone 594 m 1s 1 at ph 6 was compared with a previously reported value 444 11 m 1s 1 at ph 6 49 40 the higher reaction rate obtained in this study potentially resulted from differences in the experimental conditions such as temperature which has an important effect on ozone decomposition 21 c vs 18 c radical scavenger concentration which controls the radical production 50 mm vs 10 mm and analytical accuracy other reaction rate constants agree with previously reported values except for testosterone for which no previous comparisons were found and also for levonorgestrel for which a higher rate constant was obtained in this study compared to previously reported value table 2 this difference is explained by different method of data analysis used to measure residual concentration of hormones although oxidation of progestogens is found independent of the ph of reaction environment hydroxyl radicals produced from faster ozone decomposition at ph 8 can result in slightly higher reaction kinetics compared to ph 6 3 3 effect of temperature on kinetic rate constants fig 1 and figure s3 show the effects of temperature 5 15 21 and 35 c on the kinetics of hormone oxidation by ozone and the oxidant decay rates in buffered ultrapure water ph 6 in presence of radical scavenger the results of hormones oxidation without radical scavenger are not presented the ozone decay rates decreased with decreasing temperature pseudo first order reaction rates for ozone decay show that ozone depletion rates increased up to one order of magnitude with temperature increase from 5 c ko3 0 58 s 1 to 35 c ko3 1 76 s 1 at higher temperatures the solubility of ozone in water decreases and its decomposition rate increases by the factor of 1 2 1 8 for every 10 c increase in temperature 3 02 folds from 5 to 35 c in absence of radical scavengers and at 21 c the ozone decomposition rate is accelerated by hydroxyl radicals and rate constants increase from 1 44 s 1 to 4 46 s 1 with and without radical scavenger respectively to investigate the effect of temperature the second order rate constants ko3 hormone for testosterone and progestogens must be quantified at different temperatures fig 1 the temperature revealed significant effect on removal rate of testosterone and progestogens oxidation the ko3 hormone values increased from 3 folds for norethindrone fig 1 d to 5 5 folds for progesterone fig 1 a following the temperature increase from 5 to 35 c the reaction of medroxyprogesterone and testosterone showed similar behavior as progesterone fig 1 b 1 c at temperature of 35 c with cto3 of 2 mg l 1 progesterone medroxyprogesterone and testosterone were removed almost 1 log whereas at 5 c the removal rate reduced significantly below 0 5 log these results indicate that very high ct values up to 10 mg l 1 would need to be applied at lower temperatures in order to obtain at least 1 log removal of such recalcitrant compounds levonorgestrel removal rate increased 4 folds at 30 c in case of norethindrone and levonorgestrel complete removal of these compounds could be achieved at 35 c with cto3 of 8 mg l 1 however like three other compounds more than 10 mg l 1 should be applied for complete removals of norethindrone and levonorgestrel the activation energies eact in ultrapure water at ph 6 were obtained from linear regression between temperature 1 t k 1 and second order rate constants of ozone hormone reaction lnk fig 2 the obtained results varied between 30 kj mol 1 norethindrone and 39 kj mol 1 progesterone the complete list of arrhenius equation parameters is presented in table s1 as shown in fig 2 the selected compounds have same trend of increasing decomposition rate from 5 c to 35 c however for defined cto3 the removal rate for testosterone progesterone and medroxyprogesterone were more variable with temperature increase than two other compounds for instance at cto3 2 mg l 1 testosterone removal increased from 42 5 to 93 7 when temperature increase from 5 c to 35 c while for norethindrone the removal rate changed only from 93 5 to 99 9 fig 2 also compares the variation of removal rates with temperature for selected steroids the activation energy can provide better understanding of the removal rates of recalcitrant compounds by giving information on temperature sensitivity of such compounds as the higher is the activation energy means the more sensitive is removal rate to the temperature 60 the obtained eact are in agreement with hoigne et al 1983 49 which states the activation energy required for the reaction of organic compounds such as phenolic compounds carboxylic acids and nitrogenous compounds with ozone is between 35 and 50 kj mol 1 to the best of our knowledge no reports of the activation energies for the temperature dependent rate constants of ozone steroid reactions exist these results are valuable specially during the critical periods of cold weather which biodegradation becomes very limited and the role of oxidation becomes more important for removal of such recalcitrant compounds accordingly the effect of temperature must be considered when evaluating the performance of ozone in water treatment plants subjected to large seasonal temperature variations 3 4 oxidation of hormones by ozone in real water matrices the effects of the water matrix on the kinetics of oxidation of hormones by ozone were studied during ozonation of natural filtered water and diluted filtered ww alkalinity is adjusted as described in ozonation experiments section effluent spiked with 10 3 μg l 1 of hormones in the presence of ρcba and or a radical scavenger tertbuoh and different ozone concentrations 2 mg l 1 for filtered water and 10 mg l 1 for diluted ww from oxidation experiments in real water matrices it was observed that ozone decay starts with a rapid decomposition of ozone due to the 30 and 49 initial demand of ozone in the natural water and ww effluent respectively figures s4 and s5 the immediate ozone demand was calculated as the difference between the applied ozone concentrations 2 and 10 mg l 1 and the initial concentration of ozone by assuming a pseudo first order reaction rate for ozone decomposition 54 initial ozone decay was followed by slower decay rates which fit with first order kinetics for both natural water and ww effluent inset of figures s4 and s5 kinetic rate constants obtained from oxidation of studied hormones in ultrapure water in presence of radical scavenger at ph 6 were used to predict the removal rates during ozonation of natural water and diluted ww effluent in presence of radical scavenger the determined rate constants were compared with predicted removal rates from oxidation of natural water and diluted ww effluent fig 3 a and b present the results of comparisons in natural water and ww effluent respectively for the five measured compounds in both types of water all removal rates were within the 95th prediction intervals fig 3a the data related to norethindrone and levonorgestrel were placed on the edge of regression bands of the 95th prediction intervals for which rapid removal during the first minutes of reaction reduced the accuracy of the observed data these findings indicate that the kinetic behavior of these compounds is highly predictable in different natural water conditions based on kinetic data from oxidation tests conducted in ultrapure water also the activation energies obtained in ultrapure water can be used to predict the reaction of steroids in natural waters and wastewaters the rct value can elucidate the relative importance of hydroxyl radicals on the oxidation of steroid hormones rct is also a key parameter when modeling the oxidation of micropollutants in natural waters when assuming that its value usually remains constant during the second phase of ozone decomposition 52 the values of rct was measured from the oxidation of natural filtered water and diluted wastewater using the slope of ln ρcba ρcba0 vs ozone exposure cto3 as demonstrated in figure s6 the rct value in the first phase of ozone decomposition 4 6 10 08 and 4 3 10 08 for natural water and wastewater is higher than the rct of the second phase 3 1 10 09 and 1 02 10 09 for natural water and wastewater the hydroxyl radical exposure ctoh was measured indirectly using rct and cto3 since there was no extra source of hydroxyl radicals such as hydrogen peroxide or using uv lamps to enhance ozone decomposition the ctoh values were very low ctoh10 12 and contribution of radicals in hormone oxidation was negligible consequently oxidation of steroids is governed by direct reaction with ozone precise estimation of rate constants for reaction of hormones with radicals becomes problematic at such low concentrations of radicals additionally no data was available on reaction rate constants of progestogens and testosterone with radicals therefore the contribution of radicals in hormone oxidation can be estimated by comparing the observed rate constants which contains both ko3 and koh with rate constants from direct reaction with ozone ko3 addition of radical scavenger provides the conditions to evaluate the effect of hydroxyl radical production through oxidation of natural organic matter by comparing with condition where no radical scavenger is added radical scavenger did not greatly modified the ozone decomposition rate in filtered water due to the low concentration of doc 2 8 mg l 1 and also lower contribution of hydroxyl radicals in ozone decomposition at that ph table 2 but reduced the decomposition of ozone in diluted wastewater effluent for about 27 percent the observed removal rates of steroids were compared to the fraction of compounds removed by ozone fig 4 the results of such comparison illustrated in fig 4a indicate the role of direct reaction of steroids with ozone specially testosterone progesterone and medroxyprogesterone with lower reaction rates testosterone was removed by 80 during the ozonation of natural filtered water in presence of radical scavenger and cto3 2 mg l 1 its removal rate increased only 1 when no radical scavenger was added in the oxidation reactor the 2 mg l 1 ozone exposure with no radical scavenger was enough to remove 2 5 and 3 5 log of norethindrone and levonorgestrel respectively after adding the radical scavenger the removal logs reduced to 1 4 and 2 log for norethindrone and levonorgestrel respectively direct reaction with ozone can consequently be considered as the main removal mechanism of testosterone progesterone and medroxyprogesterone as the most recalcitrant compounds among the studied steroids during natural water treatment the role of radicals becomes important during the oxidation of wastewater with higher loads of organic matter 11 5 mg l 1 as fig 4b shows steroids where removed more than 4 log with cto3 5 mg l 1 during ozonation of wwtp effluent at t 21 c when 50 mm of radical scavenger was added to the oxidation reactor the removal log reduced to 2 log for testosterone progesterone and medroxyprogesterone and 4 log for norethindrone the direct reaction of levonorgestrel and ozone could not be measured during oxidation of wwtp effluent because of rapid decomposition of this compound at the first minutes of reaction monitoring the residual concentration of levonorgestrel lod became difficult according to new information provided in this study if one wishes to use the ozonation potential to remove such micropollutants high ct values or the implementation of advanced oxidation processes aops using h2o2 and or uv are necessary to obtain sufficient removal of recalcitrant hormones or production of less harmful and more biodegradable by products application of aops can enhance ozone decomposition and produce more hydroxyl radicals which can unselectively oxidize ozone resistant compounds like testosterone incomplete removal of recalcitrant steroids in this study 1 log in natural water fig 4 a and necessity of modified treatment processes for complete removal of such compounds are in accordance with the previous observation on partial removal of other recalcitrant compounds such as anti inflammatory drug ibuprofen 9 6 m 1s 1 and anti anxiety agent diazepam 0 75 m 1s 1 43 since complete mineralization of selected compounds could not be reached with conventional doses of ozone used in water treatment processes further studies on the identification and quantification of potential oxidation byproducts will provide better perspective on the efficiency of removal of refractory steroids to ozone oxidation to date no standard regulations exist regarding the quantity of steroid hormones released in surface waters and their maximum allowable concentrations in drinking water the results obtained in this study confirm the persistence of recalcitrant steroids after ozonation at typical dosages applied by industry these relatively recalcitrant compounds could be used as indicator compounds for assessing the efficacy of wwtps and dwtps to reduce environmental risks and the possible health risks of human exposure to trace concentrations of steroid hormones 4 conclusion the main aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of ozone as powerful oxidant in water treatment processes for oxidation of steroid hormones the effects of temperature ph and natural organic matter were investigated the following conclusions can be drawn testosterone is moderately reactive towards ozone with rate constant of 590 0 13 m 1s 1 in ultrapure water in the same range of rate constant for progestogens 532 2593 m 1s 1 the effect of temperature on the performance of ozone in water treatment plants is significant in the range of water temperatures encountered by utilities the log removal of selected steroids increased 3 to 5 5 fold when the temperature increased from 5 to 35 c testosterone progesterone and medroxyprogesterone oxidation rates were more sensitive to temperature change as compared to levonorgestrel and norethindrone this fact confirms the importance of temperature on the potential of ozonation to oxidize recalcitrant steroids particularly during the cold weather the activation energies were calculated for the first time for ozone hormone reactions in ultrapure water at ph 6 and in presence of radical scavenger using the corresponding second order rate constants at different temperatures eact 30 39 kj mol 1 the oxidation constants were successfully predicted in natural filtered water and treated ww using established kinetic constants it is possible to adjust water treatment processes to ensure desired hormone removal from source waters the results of this study suggest that progestogens and testosterone will be removed by less than 1 log if typical ct values 2 and 5 mg l 1 at 21 c are applied during water treatment consequently high ct values or the implementation of advanced oxidation using h2o2 and or uv are necessary for obtaining sufficient removal of such ozone resisting compounds via indirect oxidation by radicals comparing the overall reaction of steroids with ozone and hydroxyl radicals direct reaction with ozone was found as governing removal mechanism for selected steroids with 97 removal with ozone for testosterone medroxyprogesterone and progesterone partial oxidation of progestogens and testosterone could lead to the formation of oxidation byproducts the identification and quantification of byproducts could help better understand the oxidation mechanisms involved and identify

14363,increasing presence of endocrine disrupting compounds edcs in water sources and their adverse health effects on aquatic life are major concerns for water utilities and authorities worldwide the oxidation kinetics for degradation of ozone resistant steroid hormones were investigated to quantify their removal in natural water under varying water temperatures and ph studying effect of temperature on oxidation of these compounds is one of the novel aspects of this research the fate of four progestogens progesterone medroxyprogesetrone levonorgestrel and norethindrone and for the first time of the androgenic steroid testosterone in the presence of ozone was measured at bench scale in ultrapure water natural surface water and wastewater the estimated second order constant rate for testosterone of 590 0 13 m 1s 1 was comparable to our estimates and previous reports for similar structure progesterone 444 601 m 1s 1 and medroxyprogesterone 532 0 04 m 1s 1 and significantly lower than for levonorgestrel 2233 m 1s 1 and norethindrone 2292 m 1s 1 for all compounds the second order rate constants increased from 3 folds for norethindrone to 5 5 folds for progesterone with temperatures ranging from 5 to 35 c the required activation energy was estimated for the five selected steroids and ranged from 30 kj mol 1 norethindrone to 39 kj mol 1 progesterone the removal rates of the selected compounds were predicted in natural water and wastewater finally we showed that ozonation using typical disinfection dosages cto3 2 mg min l 1 were capable of removing 77 progesterone to 99 levonorgestrel at 21 c and even less 47 medroxyprogesterone to 96 norethindrone at 5 c of the selected compounds keywords water and wastewater treatment ozone oxidation kinetic steroid hormones endocrine disruptors testosterone 1 introduction the adverse health effects of endocrine disrupting compounds edcs on aquatic life have resulted in increased concern regarding their occurrence in the aquatic environment 1 3 various hormones and their metabolites considered as edcs have been detected in wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents 4 10 and surface waters around the world since many years ago 11 16 progestogens were detected at concentrations ranging between 1 100 ng l 1 in surface waters at similar levels as in effluents of wastewater treatment plants with primary and secondary processes with no post disinfection or additional filtration processes 17 18 testosterone and progesterone were measured in french surface waters with concentrations in the range of 0 1 15 6 ng l 1 19 with effluents from treatment plants being recognized as the main source of these compounds 7 the occurrence of low but estrogenically active concentrations of steroidal hormones picogerams per liter pg l 1 to few nanograms per liter ng l 1 in treated drinking water is poorly documented mainly because of the costly and complex analytical methods required for their detection 20 24 while conventional water treatment processes such as coagulation sedimentation has been reported to be insufficient for steroids removal 25 26 advanced treatment processes such as activated carbon filtration and advanced oxidation processes have been found to effectively transforme or remove steroids 27 28 ozone has been reported as the most promising oxidant to consider for their removal from water and wastewater 29 35 the kinetics of hormone oxidation by common oxidants has been described for the chlorination of estrogens 36 37 and the oxidation of four progestogens with potassium permanganate 38 the oxidation of steroid estrogens estrone estradiol estriol and 17α ethinylestradiol by ozone over a wide range of ph 2 5 10 5 revealed very high reactivity of estrogens with ozone 1 05 105 m 1s 1 for estriol to 2 21 105 m 1s 1 for estradiol 39 under the water treatment conditions considered ph 7 21 c estrogens were easily removed 95 with a very low ozone exposure of 2 0 10 3 mg min l 1 39 as for more recalcitrant hormones which are the focus of this investigation limited information is available about the actual second order kinetic ozonation constants the effect of ph and water quality see table 2 for available data furthermore no information is available concerning the effect of water temperature on oxidation of these compounds barron et al 40 estimated the second order rate constant for progesterone at ph ranging from 2 to 8 showing that this compound was much less reactive than estrogenic hormones the second order kinetic rate constant of molecular ozone oxidation of progesterone in presence of tert butanol as hydroxyl radical scavenger was reported to be independent of ph and equal to 480 m 1 s 1 at 18 c 40 second order oxidation constants of four progestogens were estimated by broseus et al 41 who showed that a ct of 2 mg l 1 o3 removes more than 90 of natural and synthetic progestagens in filtered surface water observational studies reporting overall removals of hormones by ozone have focused mostly on natural estrogens 42 45 26 and at removal of some progestogens 40 41 the oxidation of pharmaceuticals and ee2 in wwtp effluents with variable suspended particle concentrations 0 20 mg l 1 was tested at ozone dosages of 2 mg l 1 43 ozonation of seven steroids including progesterone and testosterone was studied during surface water and wastewater ozonation in nevada usa 46 up to 99 84 and 87 of estrogenic steroids progesterone and testosterone respectively were removed with an ozone concentration of 2 5 mg l 1 in surface water ozonation toc 3 23 mg l 1 t 21 c for ww a much higher concentration of 7 1 mg l 1 was required to remove 99 of steroids including testosterone all these studies confirm the interest of ozonation to remove recalcitrant steroids including testosterone although ozonation appears to be a most promising treatment process it must be acknowledged that there is limited information on the fate and risks in terms of biological activity associated with the transformation products of ozone oxidation of steroid hormones 47 for example two ozonation by products of progesterone were found resistant to further reaction with ozone but are likely to be more biodegradable than the parent compound based on their structure 48 the objectives of this study were to fill several data gaps on the kinetics of five natural progesterone and testosterone and synthetic medroxyprogesterone norethindrone and levonorgestrel steroid hormones which are considered to be recalcitrant to ozonation by 1 providing the first estimate of a second order constant rate for the ozonation of testosterone 2 quantifying the effect of ph on the oxidation of these compounds 3 estimating the activation energy for the range of temperature typical in water treatment 4 applying the confirmed rate constants for the four progestogens and the newly estimated rate constant for testosterone in natural water and wastewater and finally 5 quantifying expected removal of the five target compounds under typical ozonation operational conditions set by disinfection 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards and reagents target compounds including progesterone medroxyprogesterone levonorgestrel norethindrone and testosterone were purchased from sigma aldrich canada oakville on canada 13c3 estradiol which is used as an internal standard was supplied by acp chemical inc montreal qc canada stock solutions of hormones were prepared by dissolving 25 mg of high purity hormone in 25 ml of lc grade acetone with final concentration of acetone equal to 0 6 mm the stock solutions of hormones were stored in the dark at 4 c diluted solutions 1 mg l 1 were prepared using ultrapure water to achieve an initial individual hormone concentration of 10 μg l 1 in the ozonation reactor pre tests on different initial concentrations of individual hormones on ozone demand confirmed that 10 μg l 1 of each hormone in acetone solution had a minimal effect on the initial ozone demand and also provided enough residual hormones after 10 min ozonation reaction in order to precisely measure their concentration over the reaction time as needed for kinetic constant calculations acetone has a low reactivity towards ozone k o3 acetone 0 032 m 1s 1 49 and pre tests showed that such a low quantity of acetone did not interfere with hormone oxidation figure s1 para chlorobenzoic acid ρcba and tert butanol tertbuoh solutions were prepared using commercial compounds dissolved in ultrapure water to yield final concentrations of 200 μg l 1 1 28 μm and 50 mm respectively 2 2 surface water and wwtp effluent samples water samples were collected i after conventional treatment alum coagulation settling and sand anthracite filtration and before ozonation and biological carbon filtration at a surface water drinking water treatment plant dwtp eastern canada and ii from the effluent of aerated lagoons with 90 000 m3 d 1 capacity samples were collected in pre washed distilled water and then ultrapure water 5 l polypropylene containers water samples were filtered through pre rinsed 0 45 μm hydrophilic polyethersulfone membranes supor 450 pall usa the characteristics of the water samples are provided in table 1 these samples were spiked with concentrations of 10 μg l 1 of each hormone prior to oxidation experiments based on a previous study 50 the background concentrations of hormones in surface water and wwtp effluent are much lower 2 ng l 1 to 90 ng l 1 than the spiked concentrations 2 3 ozonation experiments ozonation experiments were successively conducted on three types of tested waters buffered ultrapure water un buffered filtered water samples collected from a dwtp and diluted wwtp effluent the ozonation of wwtp effluents is usually tested in continuous systems due to the high initial ozone demand and to maintain a sufficient residual ozone concentration during the experiment the wastewater ww must be diluted during batch experiments in order to reduce the initial demands for ozone to detectable levels and follow the ozone decomposition during the reaction 1 l filtered ww was diluted with 1 l ultrapure water and the alkalinity was adjusted using 0 5 m sodium bicarbonate during experiments with ultrapure water the ph was held constant at 6 0 or 8 0 using a phosphate buffer final concentrations of 0 82 and 0 35 m respectively however for experiments with natural water and wwtp effluent the ph of samples remained untouched and pre examinations showed that dilution did not significantly affect the final ph of wwtp effluent neither the ozonation process changed the ph value zone stock solutions 50 60 mg l 1 were prepared by sparging gaseous ozone produced with an oxygen fed ozone generator ozone service bc ca through 1 l ultrapure water flasks placed in ice bath bath temperature 0 c all tests were conducted in a true batch reactor consisting of a 2 l beaker covered with a floating teflon lid to prevent ozone from degassing an appropriate volume of ozone stock solution was added in each reactor to yield the target ozone concentrations 0 10 mg l 1 without causing the dilution effect the maximum added volume of ozone stock solution to reach 10 mg o3 l 1 was 180 ml in 1000 ml of diluted wastewater dilution was accounted for in the measured concentrations hormone and ozone residuals were measured at defined time intervals over a 10 min period by collecting 5 ml samples that were dispensed in 20 ml of indigo solution 0 02 1 or 3 the reaction of hormones with ozone was stopped by using ascorbic acid initial concentration 2 mg l 1 2 4 determining the rate constants for the reaction of ozone with steroids the direct reaction kinetic of ozone with hormones is first order with respect to both ozone and hormone concentration 35 and is given by the following equation 1 l n p p 0 k o 3 p c t d t k o 3 p c t o 3 where p is the target compound and k o3 p is the second order rate constant with ozone m 1s 1 obtained from experiments in buffered ultrapure water with radical scavenger tert buoh at constant ph 6 ozone exposure cto3 values expressed in m s were calculated using the effective ct concept 51 which represents the area under the ozone decay curve at time t 2 c t o 3 c t e f f e c t i v e c t d t c 0 k 1 e x p k t where c and c0 are the residual ozone at time t and the initial ozone concentration mg l 1 respectively and k is the pseudo first order ozone decay rate min 1 the oxidation of steroids during ozonation is predicted by application of residual ozone concentration in order to calculate ct value and measure of compound s residual concentration over the reaction time in eq 1 to investigate ozonation of steroids with ozone and hydroxyl radicals the exposure to both oxidants should be known the ozone exposure can be measured by eq 2 and direct measurement of ozone residual however it is difficult to measure the concentration of radicals in the solution as they react super quickly in order to evaluate the reactivity of steroids with both oxidants indirect measurement of hydroxyl radicals using an ozone resistant reference compound ρcba has been recommended 35 since ρcba has a very low reactivity with ozone the oxidation of ρcba can be formulated as follow 3 l n ρ c b a ρ c b a 0 k o h ρ c b a o h d t k o h ρ c b a c t o h according to eq 3 radical exposure ctoh can be measured indirectly with relative decrease in concentration of ρcba over the time t elovitz et al 1999 has defined an empirical term rct which is the ratio of ozone exposure and radical exposure r c t c t o h c t o 3 52 the rct term can be replaced in eq 3 as follow in order to substitute radical exposure ctoh which is difficult to measure 4 l n ρ c b a ρ c b a 0 r c t k o h ρ c b a c t o 3 the rct value can be experimentally calculated by measuring the decrease in ρcba concentration while reacting with ozone the slop of the plot of eq 4 can yield the rct value at defined temperature and over the ozonation reaction time the observed second order rate constants for reaction of hormones with both ozone and hydroxyl radicals can be estimated without radical scavenger and using ρcba as reference compound the observed rate constants can be obtained using the following equation 5 l n p p 0 k o b s c t o 3 k o 3 p k o h p r c t c t o 3 where k o h p is the rate constant for the reaction of hormone p with hydroxyl radicals k o b s is the observed rate constant for reaction of hormone with both oxidants o3 and oh 2 5 dissolved ozone analysis the dissolved ozone concentrations in the stock solution and the residual ozone concentration following oxidation were both determined using the standard colorimetric method 4500 o3 53 using indigo trisulfonate ε600nm 20 000 m 1 cm 1 the absorbance was measured at 600 nm in a 1 cm or 2 cm quartz cell using a varian cary 100 victoria australia spectrophotometer 2 6 quantification of hormones and ρcba hormones were analyzed using on line solid phase extraction spe coupled with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry under the experimental condition the detection limit of steroids was 0 13 0 03 μg l 1 1500 μl injection volume the atmospheric pressure photoionization appi was used as an ionization source for the detection of hormones the complete detection and quantification methods used for hormones are described previously 50 the hydroxyl radical exposure was measured indirectly by oxidizing an ozone resistant molecule ρcba to analyze the degradation of ρcba 1 ml sub samples were also collected from reactor in parallel and filtered on 0 45 μm filters millex hv for analysis of ρcba concentration using reverse phase hplc 60 acidified water at ph 2 with h2so4 and 40 methanol the detection of ρcba was made using diode array detection at 236 nm with detection limit of 0 2 μg l 1 1 27 μm elite lachrom hitachi the detailed description of the column characteristics and mobile phases are described elsewhere 54 2 7 activation energy of the reaction of ozone hormone the activation energy eact for ozone hormone reactions is calculated in buffered ultrapure water at ph 6 using the arrhenius s law applied to the data obtained at four different temperatures 5 15 21 and 35 c 6 k a exp e a c t r t where eact is the activation energy j mol 1 r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 a is the frequency factor m 1 s 1 and t is the absolute temperature k 3 results and discussion 3 1 rate constants for the reactions of the hormones with ozone the second order rate constants for the reactions of four progestogens and for the first time for testosterone with ozone in buffered ultrapure water at ph 6 in the presence of a radical scavenger are determined using eq 1 and results are presented in table 2 testosterone exhibited similar reactivity towards ozone as progesterone and medroxyprogesterone c a ko3 532 594 m 1s 1 potentially due to their very similar chemical structures and more importantly because they have the same substituents at their cc double bound which probably results in similar reactive intermediates table 2 no significant difference was found between the reactivity of levonorgestrel and norethindrone towards ozone p 0 05 with reaction rate constants of ko3 levo 2233 m 1 s 1 and ko3 nore 2292 m 1 s 1 by comparing the chemical structure of selected compounds some hypotheses can raise to describe their different reactivity towards ozone the acetyl group on carbon 17 of progesterone has electron withdrawing additional substituent which reduces its reactivity towards ozone compared to the ethynyl group in the levonorgestrel and norethindrone structure this effect was observed before in galaxolide and tonalide as two similar musk fragrances tonalide with an acetyl group shows a smaller reaction rate constant ko3 tonalide 8 m 1s 1 compared to galaxolide ko3 galaxolide 140 m 1s 1 55 furthermore norethindrone and levonorgestrel have a hydrogen atom on their c10 carbon atom one of the substituents at cc double bound whereas three others have methyl on the same carbon although the methyl group has no direct effect on the reactivity of cc double bond the steric hindrance of the methyl group can decrease the reactivity of the steroid hormones or prevents further oxidation of intermediate oxidation products hence the higher reactivity of norethindrone and levonorgestrel could be explained by i higher reactivity of the ethynyl group towards ozonation or ii lower steric hindrance on cc bond due to the presence of h substituent instead of ch3 however further research is required to speculate which of the two reasons is the prevalent norethindrone and levonorgestrel have slightly different rate constants potentially due to their different reactive groups methyl in levonorgestrel and ethyl in norethindrone although methyl and ethyl group are both nonreactive towards ozone this difference in the additional reactive groups causes slightly different reaction constants in these two compounds comparing the reactivity of testosterone and progestogens with estrogens the reaction rate constants are about 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of estrogenic steroids ko3 estrogens 105 m 1s 1 although all the steroid hormones have three hexagonal rings a b and c and one pentagonal ring d there are significant differences between their functional groups estrogens have a phenolic group with high reactivity towards ozone ko3 phenol 1 3 104 m 1 s 1 49 in the a ring position while the progestogens and testosterone are olefinic compounds with carbonyl group in the same ring the carbonyl group is considered to reduce the reactivity of cc double bond in these compounds 33 carbamazepine an antiepileptic drug commonly detected in wwtp effluents and surface waters that has an olefin group as its electron rich moiety is highly reactive with ozone ko3 3 105 m 1 s 1 43 another olefinic compound that in contrast has a low reactivity with ozone is the artificial sweetener acesulfame with ko3 88 m 1 s 1 56 therefore being an olefinic compound is not the determining factor in reactivity towards ozone the electron withdrawing or donating properties of substituents at the cc double bound and their corresponding reactivity with ozone can strongly affect their second order rate constants even the different conformations of olefins isomeric olefins for instance can strongly affect the produced ozonide and consequently the related reaction rate constant as an example the reaction rate constant of 1 1 dicholoroethylene ko3 22 m 1 s 1 is much smaller than that of 1 2 dichloroethylene ko3 591 m 1 s 1 57 the biological activity of oxidation products could greatly change through the oxidation with ozone compare to parent compounds ozone transformation products from oxidation of olefinic compounds such as progesterone which usually results in production of aldehydes ketones or carboxylic acids are more reported easily biodegradable than the parent compounds 48 recently the application of computer aided programs using model compounds in combination with available reaction rate constants is developing rapidly hence product formation mechanisms as well as their reaction rate constants can be estimated via predictive in silico tools 48 58 recent advances in molecular modeling has significantly improved the ability to predict the reactivity if chemical compounds with different oxidants assessing the electronic structures of selected compounds could provide a better understanding of their oxidation reactivity towards ozone reactivity of two compounds depends on the energies of the frontier molecular orbitals that is εhomo the highest occupied molecular orbital and εlumo the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital which reflect the potential reactivity between two compounds these energies can be calculated for any chemical compound using computational quantum chemistry techniques the smaller the energy difference δε between the homo of the nucleophile reactant and the lumo of the electrophile oxidant the higher is the reactivity between two compounds ozone is a strong electrophile compound and has εhomo of 9 07 ev and εlumo of 5 50 ev 33 the greater reactivity of levonorgestrel compared to progesterone observed through experiments is in agreement with the δε differences between ozone and progesterone which is 1 2 ev and 1 07 ev between ozone and levonorgestrel also δε between ozone and estrogens is 0 52 ev which confirms their higher reactivity with ozone compared to progestogens 33 3 2 effect of ph on oxidative transformation of steroids the oxidation rate of steroids testosterone and progestogens using 2 mg l 1 of ozone at 21 c was evaluated at ph 6 in presence of a radical scavenger 50 mm tertbuoh and at ph 8 without radical scavenger figure s2 higher removal rates are expected at ph 8 since more hydroxyl radicals are produced from ozone decomposition at ph 8 59 however in the case of this study which ozone decomposition was the only source of hydroxyl radicals and no hydrogen peroxide was added the concentration of radicals was very low to affect the oxidation rate of recalcitrant compounds therefore the difference between removal rates at ph 6 and 8 was limited between 1 for norethindrone and 8 for medroxyprogesterone this result is consistent with the fact that steroid hormones are not ph sensitive because their chemical structure does not contain acidic or basic moieties the independence of the ko3 relative to ph was also noted in another study of progesterone oxidation with ozone 40 the rate constant for the direct reaction of progesterone with ozone 594 m 1s 1 at ph 6 was compared with a previously reported value 444 11 m 1s 1 at ph 6 49 40 the higher reaction rate obtained in this study potentially resulted from differences in the experimental conditions such as temperature which has an important effect on ozone decomposition 21 c vs 18 c radical scavenger concentration which controls the radical production 50 mm vs 10 mm and analytical accuracy other reaction rate constants agree with previously reported values except for testosterone for which no previous comparisons were found and also for levonorgestrel for which a higher rate constant was obtained in this study compared to previously reported value table 2 this difference is explained by different method of data analysis used to measure residual concentration of hormones although oxidation of progestogens is found independent of the ph of reaction environment hydroxyl radicals produced from faster ozone decomposition at ph 8 can result in slightly higher reaction kinetics compared to ph 6 3 3 effect of temperature on kinetic rate constants fig 1 and figure s3 show the effects of temperature 5 15 21 and 35 c on the kinetics of hormone oxidation by ozone and the oxidant decay rates in buffered ultrapure water ph 6 in presence of radical scavenger the results of hormones oxidation without radical scavenger are not presented the ozone decay rates decreased with decreasing temperature pseudo first order reaction rates for ozone decay show that ozone depletion rates increased up to one order of magnitude with temperature increase from 5 c ko3 0 58 s 1 to 35 c ko3 1 76 s 1 at higher temperatures the solubility of ozone in water decreases and its decomposition rate increases by the factor of 1 2 1 8 for every 10 c increase in temperature 3 02 folds from 5 to 35 c in absence of radical scavengers and at 21 c the ozone decomposition rate is accelerated by hydroxyl radicals and rate constants increase from 1 44 s 1 to 4 46 s 1 with and without radical scavenger respectively to investigate the effect of temperature the second order rate constants ko3 hormone for testosterone and progestogens must be quantified at different temperatures fig 1 the temperature revealed significant effect on removal rate of testosterone and progestogens oxidation the ko3 hormone values increased from 3 folds for norethindrone fig 1 d to 5 5 folds for progesterone fig 1 a following the temperature increase from 5 to 35 c the reaction of medroxyprogesterone and testosterone showed similar behavior as progesterone fig 1 b 1 c at temperature of 35 c with cto3 of 2 mg l 1 progesterone medroxyprogesterone and testosterone were removed almost 1 log whereas at 5 c the removal rate reduced significantly below 0 5 log these results indicate that very high ct values up to 10 mg l 1 would need to be applied at lower temperatures in order to obtain at least 1 log removal of such recalcitrant compounds levonorgestrel removal rate increased 4 folds at 30 c in case of norethindrone and levonorgestrel complete removal of these compounds could be achieved at 35 c with cto3 of 8 mg l 1 however like three other compounds more than 10 mg l 1 should be applied for complete removals of norethindrone and levonorgestrel the activation energies eact in ultrapure water at ph 6 were obtained from linear regression between temperature 1 t k 1 and second order rate constants of ozone hormone reaction lnk fig 2 the obtained results varied between 30 kj mol 1 norethindrone and 39 kj mol 1 progesterone the complete list of arrhenius equation parameters is presented in table s1 as shown in fig 2 the selected compounds have same trend of increasing decomposition rate from 5 c to 35 c however for defined cto3 the removal rate for testosterone progesterone and medroxyprogesterone were more variable with temperature increase than two other compounds for instance at cto3 2 mg l 1 testosterone removal increased from 42 5 to 93 7 when temperature increase from 5 c to 35 c while for norethindrone the removal rate changed only from 93 5 to 99 9 fig 2 also compares the variation of removal rates with temperature for selected steroids the activation energy can provide better understanding of the removal rates of recalcitrant compounds by giving information on temperature sensitivity of such compounds as the higher is the activation energy means the more sensitive is removal rate to the temperature 60 the obtained eact are in agreement with hoigne et al 1983 49 which states the activation energy required for the reaction of organic compounds such as phenolic compounds carboxylic acids and nitrogenous compounds with ozone is between 35 and 50 kj mol 1 to the best of our knowledge no reports of the activation energies for the temperature dependent rate constants of ozone steroid reactions exist these results are valuable specially during the critical periods of cold weather which biodegradation becomes very limited and the role of oxidation becomes more important for removal of such recalcitrant compounds accordingly the effect of temperature must be considered when evaluating the performance of ozone in water treatment plants subjected to large seasonal temperature variations 3 4 oxidation of hormones by ozone in real water matrices the effects of the water matrix on the kinetics of oxidation of hormones by ozone were studied during ozonation of natural filtered water and diluted filtered ww alkalinity is adjusted as described in ozonation experiments section effluent spiked with 10 3 μg l 1 of hormones in the presence of ρcba and or a radical scavenger tertbuoh and different ozone concentrations 2 mg l 1 for filtered water and 10 mg l 1 for diluted ww from oxidation experiments in real water matrices it was observed that ozone decay starts with a rapid decomposition of ozone due to the 30 and 49 initial demand of ozone in the natural water and ww effluent respectively figures s4 and s5 the immediate ozone demand was calculated as the difference between the applied ozone concentrations 2 and 10 mg l 1 and the initial concentration of ozone by assuming a pseudo first order reaction rate for ozone decomposition 54 initial ozone decay was followed by slower decay rates which fit with first order kinetics for both natural water and ww effluent inset of figures s4 and s5 kinetic rate constants obtained from oxidation of studied hormones in ultrapure water in presence of radical scavenger at ph 6 were used to predict the removal rates during ozonation of natural water and diluted ww effluent in presence of radical scavenger the determined rate constants were compared with predicted removal rates from oxidation of natural water and diluted ww effluent fig 3 a and b present the results of comparisons in natural water and ww effluent respectively for the five measured compounds in both types of water all removal rates were within the 95th prediction intervals fig 3a the data related to norethindrone and levonorgestrel were placed on the edge of regression bands of the 95th prediction intervals for which rapid removal during the first minutes of reaction reduced the accuracy of the observed data these findings indicate that the kinetic behavior of these compounds is highly predictable in different natural water conditions based on kinetic data from oxidation tests conducted in ultrapure water also the activation energies obtained in ultrapure water can be used to predict the reaction of steroids in natural waters and wastewaters the rct value can elucidate the relative importance of hydroxyl radicals on the oxidation of steroid hormones rct is also a key parameter when modeling the oxidation of micropollutants in natural waters when assuming that its value usually remains constant during the second phase of ozone decomposition 52 the values of rct was measured from the oxidation of natural filtered water and diluted wastewater using the slope of ln ρcba ρcba0 vs ozone exposure cto3 as demonstrated in figure s6 the rct value in the first phase of ozone decomposition 4 6 10 08 and 4 3 10 08 for natural water and wastewater is higher than the rct of the second phase 3 1 10 09 and 1 02 10 09 for natural water and wastewater the hydroxyl radical exposure ctoh was measured indirectly using rct and cto3 since there was no extra source of hydroxyl radicals such as hydrogen peroxide or using uv lamps to enhance ozone decomposition the ctoh values were very low ctoh10 12 and contribution of radicals in hormone oxidation was negligible consequently oxidation of steroids is governed by direct reaction with ozone precise estimation of rate constants for reaction of hormones with radicals becomes problematic at such low concentrations of radicals additionally no data was available on reaction rate constants of progestogens and testosterone with radicals therefore the contribution of radicals in hormone oxidation can be estimated by comparing the observed rate constants which contains both ko3 and koh with rate constants from direct reaction with ozone ko3 addition of radical scavenger provides the conditions to evaluate the effect of hydroxyl radical production through oxidation of natural organic matter by comparing with condition where no radical scavenger is added radical scavenger did not greatly modified the ozone decomposition rate in filtered water due to the low concentration of doc 2 8 mg l 1 and also lower contribution of hydroxyl radicals in ozone decomposition at that ph table 2 but reduced the decomposition of ozone in diluted wastewater effluent for about 27 percent the observed removal rates of steroids were compared to the fraction of compounds removed by ozone fig 4 the results of such comparison illustrated in fig 4a indicate the role of direct reaction of steroids with ozone specially testosterone progesterone and medroxyprogesterone with lower reaction rates testosterone was removed by 80 during the ozonation of natural filtered water in presence of radical scavenger and cto3 2 mg l 1 its removal rate increased only 1 when no radical scavenger was added in the oxidation reactor the 2 mg l 1 ozone exposure with no radical scavenger was enough to remove 2 5 and 3 5 log of norethindrone and levonorgestrel respectively after adding the radical scavenger the removal logs reduced to 1 4 and 2 log for norethindrone and levonorgestrel respectively direct reaction with ozone can consequently be considered as the main removal mechanism of testosterone progesterone and medroxyprogesterone as the most recalcitrant compounds among the studied steroids during natural water treatment the role of radicals becomes important during the oxidation of wastewater with higher loads of organic matter 11 5 mg l 1 as fig 4b shows steroids where removed more than 4 log with cto3 5 mg l 1 during ozonation of wwtp effluent at t 21 c when 50 mm of radical scavenger was added to the oxidation reactor the removal log reduced to 2 log for testosterone progesterone and medroxyprogesterone and 4 log for norethindrone the direct reaction of levonorgestrel and ozone could not be measured during oxidation of wwtp effluent because of rapid decomposition of this compound at the first minutes of reaction monitoring the residual concentration of levonorgestrel lod became difficult according to new information provided in this study if one wishes to use the ozonation potential to remove such micropollutants high ct values or the implementation of advanced oxidation processes aops using h2o2 and or uv are necessary to obtain sufficient removal of recalcitrant hormones or production of less harmful and more biodegradable by products application of aops can enhance ozone decomposition and produce more hydroxyl radicals which can unselectively oxidize ozone resistant compounds like testosterone incomplete removal of recalcitrant steroids in this study 1 log in natural water fig 4 a and necessity of modified treatment processes for complete removal of such compounds are in accordance with the previous observation on partial removal of other recalcitrant compounds such as anti inflammatory drug ibuprofen 9 6 m 1s 1 and anti anxiety agent diazepam 0 75 m 1s 1 43 since complete mineralization of selected compounds could not be reached with conventional doses of ozone used in water treatment processes further studies on the identification and quantification of potential oxidation byproducts will provide better perspective on the efficiency of removal of refractory steroids to ozone oxidation to date no standard regulations exist regarding the quantity of steroid hormones released in surface waters and their maximum allowable concentrations in drinking water the results obtained in this study confirm the persistence of recalcitrant steroids after ozonation at typical dosages applied by industry these relatively recalcitrant compounds could be used as indicator compounds for assessing the efficacy of wwtps and dwtps to reduce environmental risks and the possible health risks of human exposure to trace concentrations of steroid hormones 4 conclusion the main aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of ozone as powerful oxidant in water treatment processes for oxidation of steroid hormones the effects of temperature ph and natural organic matter were investigated the following conclusions can be drawn testosterone is moderately reactive towards ozone with rate constant of 590 0 13 m 1s 1 in ultrapure water in the same range of rate constant for progestogens 532 2593 m 1s 1 the effect of temperature on the performance of ozone in water treatment plants is significant in the range of water temperatures encountered by utilities the log removal of selected steroids increased 3 to 5 5 fold when the temperature increased from 5 to 35 c testosterone progesterone and medroxyprogesterone oxidation rates were more sensitive to temperature change as compared to levonorgestrel and norethindrone this fact confirms the importance of temperature on the potential of ozonation to oxidize recalcitrant steroids particularly during the cold weather the activation energies were calculated for the first time for ozone hormone reactions in ultrapure water at ph 6 and in presence of radical scavenger using the corresponding second order rate constants at different temperatures eact 30 39 kj mol 1 the oxidation constants were successfully predicted in natural filtered water and treated ww using established kinetic constants it is possible to adjust water treatment processes to ensure desired hormone removal from source waters the results of this study suggest that progestogens and testosterone will be removed by less than 1 log if typical ct values 2 and 5 mg l 1 at 21 c are applied during water treatment consequently high ct values or the implementation of advanced oxidation using h2o2 and or uv are necessary for obtaining sufficient removal of such ozone resisting compounds via indirect oxidation by radicals comparing the overall reaction of steroids with ozone and hydroxyl radicals direct reaction with ozone was found as governing removal mechanism for selected steroids with 97 removal with ozone for testosterone medroxyprogesterone and progesterone partial oxidation of progestogens and testosterone could lead to the formation of oxidation byproducts the identification and quantification of byproducts could help better understand the oxidation mechanisms involved and identify possible biological effects of such compounds especially when ozone is used for ww disinfection before discharge into surface waters acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge the nserc

14364,novel magnetic nanocomposite alginate beads are fabricated for the simultaneous removal of cationic anionic and organic pollutants in highly acidic water copper phosphate and toluene are used as representative cationic anionic and organic pollutants respectively the alginate beads were impregnated with a nanocomposite material composed of zeolites activated carbon layered double hydroxides and magnetic nanoparticles bound together by xanthan gum a 3 4 1 aspect ratio alginate nanocomposite xanthan gum is used for fabrication of the beads the beads show removal percentage for phosphate at 97 9 copper at 81 8 and toluene at 43 4 and adsorption capacities of 60 24 mg g 1 120 77 mg g 1 and 25 52 mg g 1 respectively isothermal studies show that the langmuir isotherm model is the governing equation for sorption pseudo second order model is the governing equation for the kinetics of sorption the sorption process is also spontaneous and exothermic this sorbent shows great potential to be used for simultaneous removal of cationic anionic and organic pollutants removal in water keywords beads langmuir freundlich gibbs energy nanocomposite 1 introduction wastewaters from industry and agriculture often anionic cationic and organic compounds such as nitrates phosphates phenols and heavy metals 1 which greatly pollute the water streams and reservoirs into which they are dumped ways of removing these pollutants have developed over the years which are i physical methods which are expensive and have a low efficiency 10 ii chemical methods which have a high maintenance cost and form toxic by products and iii biological methods which are slow and have been reported to have only 30 removal efficiency 2 7 adsorption methods are mostly used because they are very simple effective and economical hence the reason why they are currently considered to be very suitable for wastewater treatment 8 12 zeolites have often been used as adsorbents but because of powdered crystalline form they need to be entrapped in alginate beads for easy removal from the treated water 13 17 and in the process also enhancing the adsorption capacity in some recent studies it s shown that sorption capacity of the alginate beads greatly exceeds that of the actual sorbents entrapped in its matrix due to the presence of hydroxide and carboxylate groups 6 because of this calcium alginate beads have been studied not only concerning their ability to bind metal ions 7 9 but also as a composite membrane component in composite beads due to their ability to entrap other compounds in its matrix 18 nonetheless dry alginate beads used for heavy metal sorption are a rigid material that is not a highly porous structure thus the kinetics of sorption is somehow slow due to the low diffusion coefficient of the material 19 to achieve a high application potential for the alginate gel adsorbent impregnated alginate beads adsorbent were developed 20 21 choi and coworkers developed a new adsorbent alginate gel bead impregnated with zeolite and activated carbon for removal of mixed industrial contaminants 1 to remove anions from water layered double hydroxides ldh have been applied due to their unique anionic exchange properties 22 26 although ldh exist as naturally occurring minerals they are also relatively simple and economical to synthesize under laboratory conditions that can be scaled up the structure of ldhs is based on positively charged sheets or layers of the hydroxides and the positive charges are balanced by intercalation of anions in the hydrated interlayer regions preferably nitrates which can be easily exchanged 27 ldh have relatively weak interlayer bonding and because of that they are organic and inorganic anion adsorbents they also have a large surface area high anion exchange capability which competes with that of other anion exchange resins and they also have very good thermal stability 28 29 this makes ldh a promising adsorbent for the removal of anionic pollutants 25 26 30 another common adsorbent is activated carbon ac which has been used extensively on its own or in a composite for the adsorption of metals and organic pollutants this is due to its high degree of porosity an extensive surface area of about 500 2000 m2 g and a high degree of surface reactivity 31 39 since zeolites ldh and ac are in a powdered form they need a binding substance so that they do not leach out of the beads xanthan gum a natural polysaccharide that is a product of secretion by the bacterium xanthomonas campestris it is often used in the food industry as a binder and hence is applied as such in the composite beads moreover it also exhibits sorption properties towards metal ions which is an added advantage 40 alginate beads that are magnetic are easy to separate from water environmentally friendly and can be scaled up to remediate larger water reservoirs in a limited amount of time and can be regenerated 41 42 the beads are magnetized using magnetic nanoparticles mnps of iron oxide fe3o4 nanocrystals 43 44 for easy removal however their use in magnetic beads remains underutilized in this capacity 45 besides the mnps being used for easy removal of beads they have also shown to act in removal of metal ions from water 1 10 46 47 since 2003 researchers have tried to introduce new complex sorbents for the simultaneous removal of different kinds of pollutants but best multi sorbents which have been used so far do not remove anionic cationic and organic compounds simultaneously 48 50 in order to remove cationic anionic and organic pollutants the zeolites can be coated with layered double hydroxides with adsorb anions and activated carbon which can adsorb organic pollutants 23 28 29 51 and then impregnated in alginate beads therefore in this work novel magnetic nanopore composite beads are fabricated for the simultaneous removal of organic and inorganic pollutants in water the beads showed great sorption properties for the removal of cu2 p o 4 3 and toluene in water simultaneously 2 experimental section 2 1 materials all the reagents used were of analytical grade absolute ethanol iso propyl alcohol sodium

procedure was repeated for ten cycles 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterisation 3 1 1 morphology fig 1 shows the image of the magnetic nanocomposite beads the beads are roughly spherical with an average diameter of 3 mm the sem images fig 2 show the surface morphologies of the composite materials the zeolites fig 2a shows crystals that are not well formed this suggests that other components in the clay affect crystal formation the image for mnp fig 2b reveal that the samples consisted of nearly spherical nanosized particles the image for ldh fig 2c show typical ldh platelets with curved edges with most of the platelets being stacked on top of each other fig 2 d shows the homogeneous and relatively smooth surface of the ac fig 2 e shows the nanocomposite mixture revealing that the composite was well mixed 3 1 2 zeolites the ft ir spectra of zeolites in fig 3 shows adsorption bands in the region of 3400 3500 cm 1 corresponding to terminal silanol groups on the external surface of the zeolite crystals the adsorption bands at 823 1240 cm 1 are attributed to stretching and bending modes of si o or al o in zeolite framework i e the band at 1110 cm 1 is attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of internal tetrahedra and the band at 950 cm 1 is attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of external linkages 56 the xrd diffraction peaks on fig 4 a show that zeolite structure na8 alsio4 6 oh 2 2h2o is stable with the sum of reflection intensities peaks at 2θ of 14 12 110 24 51 211 31 8 310 35 00 222 and 43 64 330 which agree with that of treacy and higgins at collection of simulated xrd powder patterns for zeolites 57 60 3 1 3 characterisation of magnetic nanoparticles fe3o4 the characteristic adsorption bands observed in the ft ir spectrum at 547 89 and 469 34 cm 1 in spectrum of fe3o4 mpns are attributed to the fe o bonds i e fe2 o fe3 fe3 o and fe2 o bonds 44 53 61 as shown in fig 3 the xrd diffraction peaks on fig 4 b show peaks at 2θ of 36 36 44 100 54 510 57 09 62 78 and 74 34 which are attributed to the 311 400 422 511 440 and 662 crystallographic planes of face centred cubic fcc iron oxide nanocrystals respectively 53 the small signal evidenced at 2θ 44 6 could be due to a small amount of ferrite phase 110 plane card number 6 0696 whose formation occurs randomly during the synthesis procedure 53 3 1 4 characterisation of al zn ldh the ft ir spectrum of aluminium zinc ldh is shown in fig 3 the adsorption bands at 3404 71 cm 1 is attributed to the oh stretch 62 the xrd diffraction peaks on fig 4 c show basal peaks at 2θ of 11 840 23 400 34 710 and 39 240 which form a close to integer series making it possible to consider them basic 003 006 009 and 012 reflections of a hydrotalcite like structure respectively 63 the position of the basal peak at 11 840 is attributed to 003 peak indicating the basal reflection of an interlayer anion in ldh materials with that the distance between the two adjacent metal hydroxide sheets being about 0 76 nm 64 the non basal peaks for the 101 015 018 110 and 113 planes at higher 2θ values can be seen from the figure the first peak of the doublet close to a 2θ of 600 is due to the orientation from the 110 planes 65 70 3 1 5 characterization of magnetic nanocomposite the ft ir spectrum in fig 3 shows adsorption bands at 3369 cm 1 which is attributed to the oh stretch adsorption bands at 1367 cm 1 and 1633 cm 1 are attributed to the ch and cc in the activated charcoal adsorption bands at 823 1240 cm 1 are attributed to the stretching and bending modes of si o or al o in zeolite framework peaks at 547 89 cm 1 and 469 34 cm 1 in spectrum of fe3o4 mpns correspond to the fe o bonds this shows that the composite was successfully fabricated 44 53 65 the xrd diffraction peaks on fig 4 d show a broad peak at 2θ 15 30 due to the presence of an amorphous structure which is disorderly stacked up by carbon rings 66 the xrd diffraction peaks on fig 4 e shows that the nanocomposite was successfully fabricated with diffraction peaks that correspond to the zeolites magnetic iron oxide and layered double hydroxides 3 2 interaction mechanisms of composite and the cu2 p o 4 3 and toluene all the adsorbent materials have functional groups on their surfaces that interact with the adsorbates the mechanisms for adsorption are shown in scheme 1 the zeolite adsorbs the cu2 due to the availability of silanol groups as well as the ion exchange sites the alginate also adsorbs the cu2 due to the presence of the hydroxyl groups that can complex the metal ions the xanthan gum also has carboxylate groups and hydroxyl groups that can also adsorb cu2 by ion exchange and complexation the p o 4 3 ion are adsorbed into the basal spacing of the ldh in three mechanistic ways which are 1 electro static attraction of the p o 4 3 ions and the outer layer of the surface of the ldh which is positively charged and 2 ligand complexation and 3 anionic exchange between interlayer n o 3 ions and the p o 4 3 ion which can be called phosphate intercalation this has also been reported in previous studies 67 71 the toluene form weak van der waal forces with the surface of the ac 3 3 kinetic studies the fitting between experimental data and the model predicted values was expressed by the correlation coefficients r2 72 75 the average r2 values at different initial concentrations were 0 99 for cu2 0 98 for p o 4 3 and 0 98 for toluene with respect to the pseudo second order which suggests that the pseudo second order compared to 0 89 for cu2 0 60 for p o 4 3 and 0 96 for toluene with respect to the pseudo first order kinetics this shows that the pseudo second order is the governing kinetic model for cu2 p o 4 3 and toluene the curves for the kinetics are shown in fig 5 it is therefore deducted that the rate of chemical interactions between the sorbates and the sites of composite is the step that controls the overall kinetics of the process 65 furthermore the calculated qe qe calc is consistent with the experimental qe qe exp as shown in table 1 3 4 equilibrium and isotherm studies adsorption isotherm studies are best at explaining the fraction of sorbate molecules that are partitioned between liquid and solid phases at equilibrium 72 75 the langmuir isotherm model assumes that adsorption happens at specific homogeneous sites in the adsorbent by monolayer adsorption without the adsorbed molecules having any interactions amongst themselves in contrast to the langmuir the freundlich isotherm is purely empirical where 1 n is the measure of the intensity of adsorption and kf is an indicator of adsorption capacity 72 73 75 the values for the isotherms are shown in table 2 again the r2 values were used to see which model fits best the data the experimental data fit the langmuir isotherm which had average r2 values of 0 98 for cu2 0 99 for p o 4 3 and 0 93 for toluene better than the freundlich isotherm which had average r2 values of 0 85 for cu2 0 97 for p o 4 3 and 0 74 for toluene the validity of the langmuir isotherm suggests that the adsorption is a monolayer process and no further adsorption took place after saturation of this layer however it should be noted that the correlation coefficient of the fitting is not the only parameter that should determine the best fitting isotherm model 76 isotherm fitting curves are shown in fig 6 the initial concentration of 400 ppm had the highest percentage removal for all the sorbates with phosphate having the highest and copper with the lowest as shown in fig 7 q t increases as the initial concentration increases until it becomes constant the increase in q t with increase in initial concentration can be explained by the existence of a higher concentration gradient of sorbate which increases the diffusive contribution of the mass transfer process q t increases with increase in contact time until equilibrium is reached due to the prolonged interaction between the sorbate and sorbent thereby increasing the amount adsorbed nonetheless removal is faster in the initial minutes where equilibrium is reached at around 45 min of the process because of availability of more adsorption sites at the start of the sorption process and as the sites become used up rate of sorption decreases it is also important to note is that as the initial concentration increases more time is required for equilibrium to be reached this is possibly due to the fact that a higher concentration of adsorbate in the solution increases the electrostatic repulsion between molecules present in the medium increasing the diffusive resistance to mass transfer within the solution which results in a slower process 54 the equilibrium ce amount vs time showed that by increasing the initial concentration the amount of adsorbed sorbate increased this can be related to the initial concentration ranges and the maximum capacity of the beads this suggests that the ranges of sorbate initial concentrations which were used were very low respect to maximum capacity of the adsorbent thus sorption increases with the same rate as the initial concentration increases with a greater percentage removal by the beads table 3 and fig 3 also shows that after adsorption there was a presence of cu and p due to the adsorption of the cu2 p o 4 3 ions and an increase in the amount of carbon due the adsorption of toluene it is also apparent from fig 3 that after adsorption the intensity and position of peak at 1608 cm 1 was changed and the peak at 3404 cm 1 disappeared which demonstrated the involvement oh group in the adsorption process in the nanocomposite alginate beads after 10 cycles the beads started from cracks fig 3 which we assume were due to the agitation which we assume would not be the case if they are used in a column since they would be stationary and there won t be repeated smashing against each other which we see during the agitation process however the despite the cracks the surface morphology remained almost the same before and after adsorption as seen in the high resolution insets the bet surface area of the beads increased after adsorption from 349 65 m2g 1 to 465 40 m2g 1 due to the cracking that opened up the beads thus increasing the area 3 5 thermodynamic studies the results of the thermodynamics studies are shown in table 4 the negative values of δg show that the adsorption process was spontaneous for all species as the temperature increases δg increases as well indicating less driving force and hence slower adsorption capacity at higher temperatures the negative value of δh indicates that the adsorption process is exothermic this magnitude is related to adsorbate interactions with the adsorbent and rearrangement of the surface during the adsorption process enthalpy change data is used to differentiate physisorption and chemisorption generally the adsorption process is assigned to physisorption in nature when the δg value is in the range of 20 to 0 kj mol 1 and to chemisorption when the δg value ranges from 400 to 80 kj mol 1 54 77 78 the typical value for physisorption usually lies below 84 kj mol 1 hence it shows that the adsorption followed the physisorption process 54 76 77 finally the results of δs indicate increased randomness at the solid solute interface during the adsorption of phosphate this phenomenon was also observed by bonetto et al and zeng et al 54 77 3 6 breakthrough capacity breakthrough studies were performed and the breakthrough curves are shown in fig 8 a it can be seen that 150 200 and 250 ml can be passed through the beads without detecting toluene cu2 and p o 4 3 respectively the breakthrough capacities were calculated according and they were 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 mg g 1 for toluene cu2 and p o 4 3 respectively the exhaustive capacity was 6 0 6 5 and 7 0 mg g 1 for toluene cu2 and p o 4 3 respectively 3 7 desorption and regeneration studies any economical adsorbent should be able to be recycled through regeneration to minimize cost in this study desorption and regeneration studies were done to determine the recovery of the adsorbed species and also check the recyclability of the magnetic nanocomposite alginate beads it can be seen from fig 8 b d that the adsorption was reduced after 10 consecutive cycles from 43 4 to 22 0 81 8 to 59 5 and 97 9 to 81 4 for desorption from toluene cu2 and p o 4 3 respectively and the recovery was reduced from 41 4 to 20 0 79 0 to 57 0 and 96 3 to 79 3 for toluene cu2 and p o 4 3 respectively this shows that the magnetic nanocomposite alginate beads can be reused without any significant loss in adsorptive performance 4 conclusions the magnetic nanocomposite alginate beads were successfully fabricated for the simultaneous removal of mixtures of cationic anionic and organic pollutants in water under highly acidic water the beads showed greater affinity in the order p o 4 3 cu2 toluene the adsorption process fits the pseudo second order mechanism and the langmuir isotherm the adsorption process was spontaneous with a high entropy and the adsorption process showed that it was exothermic it can therefore be recommended that the adsorbent here synthesized can be used for simultaneous removal of cationic anionic and organic mixtures under highly acidic solution declaration of competing

14364,novel magnetic nanocomposite alginate beads are fabricated for the simultaneous removal of cationic anionic and organic pollutants in highly acidic water copper phosphate and toluene are used as representative cationic anionic and organic pollutants respectively the alginate beads were impregnated with a nanocomposite material composed of zeolites activated carbon layered double hydroxides and magnetic nanoparticles bound together by xanthan gum a 3 4 1 aspect ratio alginate nanocomposite xanthan gum is used for fabrication of the beads the beads show removal percentage for phosphate at 97 9 copper at 81 8 and toluene at 43 4 and adsorption capacities of 60 24 mg g 1 120 77 mg g 1 and 25 52 mg g 1 respectively isothermal studies show that the langmuir isotherm model is the governing equation for sorption pseudo second order model is the governing equation for the kinetics of sorption the sorption process is also spontaneous and exothermic this sorbent shows great potential to be used for simultaneous removal of cationic anionic and organic pollutants removal in water keywords beads langmuir freundlich gibbs energy nanocomposite 1 introduction wastewaters from industry and agriculture often anionic cationic and organic compounds such as nitrates phosphates phenols and heavy metals 1 which greatly pollute the water streams and reservoirs into which they are dumped ways of removing these pollutants have developed over the years which are i physical methods which are expensive and have a low efficiency 10 ii chemical methods which have a high maintenance cost and form toxic by products and iii biological methods which are slow and have been reported to have only 30 removal efficiency 2 7 adsorption methods are mostly used because they are very simple effective and economical hence the reason why they are currently considered to be very suitable for wastewater treatment 8 12 zeolites have often been used as adsorbents but because of powdered crystalline form they need to be entrapped in alginate beads for easy removal from the treated water 13 17 and in the process also enhancing the adsorption capacity in some recent studies it s shown that sorption capacity of the alginate beads greatly exceeds that of the actual sorbents entrapped in its matrix due to the presence of hydroxide and carboxylate groups 6 because of this calcium alginate beads have been studied not only concerning their ability to bind metal ions 7 9 but also as a composite membrane component in composite beads due to their ability to entrap other compounds in its matrix 18 nonetheless dry alginate beads used for heavy metal sorption are a rigid material that is not a highly porous structure thus the kinetics of sorption is somehow slow due to the low diffusion coefficient of the material 19 to achieve a high application potential for the alginate gel adsorbent impregnated alginate beads adsorbent were developed 20 21 choi and coworkers developed a new adsorbent alginate gel bead impregnated with zeolite and activated carbon for removal of mixed industrial contaminants 1 to remove anions from water layered double hydroxides ldh have been applied due to their unique anionic exchange properties 22 26 although ldh exist as naturally occurring minerals they are also relatively simple and economical to synthesize under laboratory conditions that can be scaled up the structure of ldhs is based on positively charged sheets or layers of the hydroxides and the positive charges are balanced by intercalation of anions in the hydrated interlayer regions preferably nitrates which can be easily exchanged 27 ldh have relatively weak interlayer bonding and because of that they are organic and inorganic anion adsorbents they also have a large surface area high anion exchange capability which competes with that of other anion exchange resins and they also have very good thermal stability 28 29 this makes ldh a promising adsorbent for the removal of anionic pollutants 25 26 30 another common adsorbent is activated carbon ac which has been used extensively on its own or in a composite for the adsorption of metals and organic pollutants this is due to its high degree of porosity an extensive surface area of about 500 2000 m2 g and a high degree of surface reactivity 31 39 since zeolites ldh and ac are in a powdered form they need a binding substance so that they do not leach out of the beads xanthan gum a natural polysaccharide that is a product of secretion by the bacterium xanthomonas campestris it is often used in the food industry as a binder and hence is applied as such in the composite beads moreover it also exhibits sorption properties towards metal ions which is an added advantage 40 alginate beads that are magnetic are easy to separate from water environmentally friendly and can be scaled up to remediate larger water reservoirs in a limited amount of time and can be regenerated 41 42 the beads are magnetized using magnetic nanoparticles mnps of iron oxide fe3o4 nanocrystals 43 44 for easy removal however their use in magnetic beads remains underutilized in this capacity 45 besides the mnps being used for easy removal of beads they have also shown to act in removal of metal ions from water 1 10 46 47 since 2003 researchers have tried to introduce new complex sorbents for the simultaneous removal of different kinds of pollutants but best multi sorbents which have been used so far do not remove anionic cationic and organic compounds simultaneously 48 50 in order to remove cationic anionic and organic pollutants the zeolites can be coated with layered double hydroxides with adsorb anions and activated carbon which can adsorb organic pollutants 23 28 29 51 and then impregnated in alginate beads therefore in this work novel magnetic nanopore composite beads are fabricated for the simultaneous removal of organic and inorganic pollutants in water the beads showed great sorption properties for the removal of cu2 p o 4 3 and toluene in water simultaneously 2 experimental section 2 1 materials all the reagents used were of analytical grade absolute ethanol iso propyl alcohol sodium

procedure was repeated for ten cycles 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterisation 3 1 1 morphology fig 1 shows the image of the magnetic nanocomposite beads the beads are roughly spherical with an average diameter of 3 mm the sem images fig 2 show the surface morphologies of the composite materials the zeolites fig 2a shows crystals that are not well formed this suggests that other components in the clay affect crystal formation the image for mnp fig 2b reveal that the samples consisted of nearly spherical nanosized particles the image for ldh fig 2c show typical ldh platelets with curved edges with most of the platelets being stacked on top of each other fig 2 d shows the homogeneous and relatively smooth surface of the ac fig 2 e shows the nanocomposite mixture revealing that the composite was well mixed 3 1 2 zeolites the ft ir spectra of zeolites in fig 3 shows adsorption bands in the region of 3400 3500 cm 1 corresponding to terminal silanol groups on the external surface of the zeolite crystals the adsorption bands at 823 1240 cm 1 are attributed to stretching and bending modes of si o or al o in zeolite framework i e the band at 1110 cm 1 is attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of internal tetrahedra and the band at 950 cm 1 is attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of external linkages 56 the xrd diffraction peaks on fig 4 a show that zeolite structure na8 alsio4 6 oh 2 2h2o is stable with the sum of reflection intensities peaks at 2θ of 14 12 110 24 51 211 31 8 310 35 00 222 and 43 64 330 which agree with that of treacy and higgins at collection of simulated xrd powder patterns for zeolites 57 60 3 1 3 characterisation of magnetic nanoparticles fe3o4 the characteristic adsorption bands observed in the ft ir spectrum at 547 89 and 469 34 cm 1 in spectrum of fe3o4 mpns are attributed to the fe o bonds i e fe2 o fe3 fe3 o and fe2 o bonds 44 53 61 as shown in fig 3 the xrd diffraction peaks on fig 4 b show peaks at 2θ of 36 36 44 100 54 510 57 09 62 78 and 74 34 which are attributed to the 311 400 422 511 440 and 662 crystallographic planes of face centred cubic fcc iron oxide nanocrystals respectively 53 the small signal evidenced at 2θ 44 6 could be due to a small amount of ferrite phase 110 plane card number 6 0696 whose formation occurs randomly during the synthesis procedure 53 3 1 4 characterisation of al zn ldh the ft ir spectrum of aluminium zinc ldh is shown in fig 3 the adsorption bands at 3404 71 cm 1 is attributed to the oh stretch 62 the xrd diffraction peaks on fig 4 c show basal peaks at 2θ of 11 840 23 400 34 710 and 39 240 which form a close to integer series making it possible to consider them basic 003 006 009 and 012 reflections of a hydrotalcite like structure respectively 63 the position of the basal peak at 11 840 is attributed to 003 peak indicating the basal reflection of an interlayer anion in ldh materials with that the distance between the two adjacent metal hydroxide sheets being about 0 76 nm 64 the non basal peaks for the 101 015 018 110 and 113 planes at higher 2θ values can be seen from the figure the first peak of the doublet close to a 2θ of 600 is due to the orientation from the 110 planes 65 70 3 1 5 characterization of magnetic nanocomposite the ft ir spectrum in fig 3 shows adsorption bands at 3369 cm 1 which is attributed to the oh stretch adsorption bands at 1367 cm 1 and 1633 cm 1 are attributed to the ch and cc in the activated charcoal adsorption bands at 823 1240 cm 1 are attributed to the stretching and bending modes of si o or al o in zeolite framework peaks at 547 89 cm 1 and 469 34 cm 1 in spectrum of fe3o4 mpns correspond to the fe o bonds this shows that the composite was successfully fabricated 44 53 65 the xrd diffraction peaks on fig 4 d show a broad peak at 2θ 15 30 due to the presence of an amorphous structure which is disorderly stacked up by carbon rings 66 the xrd diffraction peaks on fig 4 e shows that the nanocomposite was successfully fabricated with diffraction peaks that correspond to the zeolites magnetic iron oxide and layered double hydroxides 3 2 interaction mechanisms of composite and the cu2 p o 4 3 and toluene all the adsorbent materials have functional groups on their surfaces that interact with the adsorbates the mechanisms for adsorption are shown in scheme 1 the zeolite adsorbs the cu2 due to the availability of silanol groups as well as the ion exchange sites the alginate also adsorbs the cu2 due to the presence of the hydroxyl groups that can complex the metal ions the xanthan gum also has carboxylate groups and hydroxyl groups that can also adsorb cu2 by ion exchange and complexation the p o 4 3 ion are adsorbed into the basal spacing of the ldh in three mechanistic ways which are 1 electro static attraction of the p o 4 3 ions and the outer layer of the surface of the ldh which is positively charged and 2 ligand complexation and 3 anionic exchange between interlayer n o 3 ions and the p o 4 3 ion which can be called phosphate intercalation this has also been reported in previous studies 67 71 the toluene form weak van der waal forces with the surface of the ac 3 3 kinetic studies the fitting between experimental data and the model predicted values was expressed by the correlation coefficients r2 72 75 the average r2 values at different initial concentrations were 0 99 for cu2 0 98 for p o 4 3 and 0 98 for toluene with respect to the pseudo second order which suggests that the pseudo second order compared to 0 89 for cu2 0 60 for p o 4 3 and 0 96 for toluene with respect to the pseudo first order kinetics this shows that the pseudo second order is the governing kinetic model for cu2 p o 4 3 and toluene the curves for the kinetics are shown in fig 5 it is therefore deducted that the rate of chemical interactions between the sorbates and the sites of composite is the step that controls the overall kinetics of the process 65 furthermore the calculated qe qe calc is consistent with the experimental qe qe exp as shown in table 1 3 4 equilibrium and isotherm studies adsorption isotherm studies are best at explaining the fraction of sorbate molecules that are partitioned between liquid and solid phases at equilibrium 72 75 the langmuir isotherm model assumes that adsorption happens at specific homogeneous sites in the adsorbent by monolayer adsorption without the adsorbed molecules having any interactions amongst themselves in contrast to the langmuir the freundlich isotherm is purely empirical where 1 n is the measure of the intensity of adsorption and kf is an indicator of adsorption capacity 72 73 75 the values for the isotherms are shown in table 2 again the r2 values were used to see which model fits best the data the experimental data fit the langmuir isotherm which had average r2 values of 0 98 for cu2 0 99 for p o 4 3 and 0 93 for toluene better than the freundlich isotherm which had average r2 values of 0 85 for cu2 0 97 for p o 4 3 and 0 74 for toluene the validity of the langmuir isotherm suggests that the adsorption is a monolayer process and no further adsorption took place after saturation of this layer however it should be noted that the correlation coefficient of the fitting is not the only parameter that should determine the best fitting isotherm model 76 isotherm fitting curves are shown in fig 6 the initial concentration of 400 ppm had the highest percentage removal for all the sorbates with phosphate having the highest and copper with the lowest as shown in fig 7 q t increases as the initial concentration increases until it becomes constant the increase in q t with increase in initial concentration can be explained by the existence of a higher concentration gradient of sorbate which increases the diffusive contribution of the mass transfer process q t increases with increase in contact time until equilibrium is reached due to the prolonged interaction between the sorbate and sorbent thereby increasing the amount adsorbed nonetheless removal is faster in the initial minutes where equilibrium is reached at around 45 min of the process because of availability of more adsorption sites at the start of the sorption process and as the sites become used up rate of sorption decreases it is also important to note is that as the initial concentration increases more time is required for equilibrium to be reached this is possibly due to the fact that a higher concentration of adsorbate in the solution increases the electrostatic repulsion between molecules present in the medium increasing the diffusive resistance to mass transfer within the solution which results in a slower process 54 the equilibrium ce amount vs time showed that by increasing the initial concentration the amount of adsorbed sorbate increased this can be related to the initial concentration ranges and the maximum capacity of the beads this suggests that the ranges of sorbate initial concentrations which were used were very low respect to maximum capacity of the adsorbent thus sorption increases with the same rate as the initial concentration increases with a greater percentage removal by the beads table 3 and fig 3 also shows that after adsorption there was a presence of cu and p due to the adsorption of the cu2 p o 4 3 ions and an increase in the amount of carbon due the adsorption of toluene it is also apparent from fig 3 that after adsorption the intensity and position of peak at 1608 cm 1 was changed and the peak at 3404 cm 1 disappeared which demonstrated the involvement oh group in the adsorption process in the nanocomposite alginate beads after 10 cycles the beads started from cracks fig 3 which we assume were due to the agitation which we assume would not be the case if they are used in a column since they would be stationary and there won t be repeated smashing against each other which we see during the agitation process however the despite the cracks the surface morphology remained almost the same before and after adsorption as seen in the high resolution insets the bet surface area of the beads increased after adsorption from 349 65 m2g 1 to 465 40 m2g 1 due to the cracking that opened up the beads thus increasing the area 3 5 thermodynamic studies the results of the thermodynamics studies are shown in table 4 the negative values of δg show that the adsorption process was spontaneous for all species as the temperature increases δg increases as well indicating less driving force and hence slower adsorption capacity at higher temperatures the negative value of δh indicates that the adsorption process is exothermic this magnitude is related to adsorbate interactions with the adsorbent and rearrangement of the surface during the adsorption process enthalpy change data is used to differentiate physisorption and chemisorption generally the adsorption process is assigned to physisorption in nature when the δg value is in the range of 20 to 0 kj mol 1 and to chemisorption when the δg value ranges from 400 to 80 kj mol 1 54 77 78 the typical value for physisorption usually lies below 84 kj mol 1 hence it shows that the adsorption followed the physisorption process 54 76 77 finally the results of δs indicate increased randomness at the solid solute interface during the adsorption of phosphate this phenomenon was also observed by bonetto et al and zeng et al 54 77 3 6 breakthrough capacity breakthrough studies were performed and the breakthrough curves are shown in fig 8 a it can be seen that 150 200 and 250 ml can be passed through the beads without detecting toluene cu2 and p o 4 3 respectively the breakthrough capacities were calculated according and they were 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 mg g 1 for toluene cu2 and p o 4 3 respectively the exhaustive capacity was 6 0 6 5 and 7 0 mg g 1 for toluene cu2 and p o 4 3 respectively 3 7 desorption and regeneration studies any economical adsorbent should be able to be recycled through regeneration to minimize cost in this study desorption and regeneration studies were done to determine the recovery of the adsorbed species and also check the recyclability of the magnetic nanocomposite alginate beads it can be seen from fig 8 b d that the adsorption was reduced after 10 consecutive cycles from 43 4 to 22 0 81 8 to 59 5 and 97 9 to 81 4 for desorption from toluene cu2 and p o 4 3 respectively and the recovery was reduced from 41 4 to 20 0 79 0 to 57 0 and 96 3 to 79 3 for toluene cu2 and p o 4 3 respectively this shows that the magnetic nanocomposite alginate beads can be reused without any significant loss in adsorptive performance 4 conclusions the magnetic nanocomposite alginate beads were successfully fabricated for the simultaneous removal of mixtures of cationic anionic and organic pollutants in water under highly acidic water the beads showed greater affinity in the order p o 4 3 cu2 toluene the adsorption process fits the pseudo second order mechanism and the langmuir isotherm the adsorption process was spontaneous with a high entropy and the adsorption process showed that it was exothermic it can therefore be recommended that the adsorbent here synthesized can be used for simultaneous removal of cationic anionic and organic mixtures under highly acidic solution declaration of competing
