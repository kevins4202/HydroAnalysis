10430,we discussed the applicability of high resolution meteorological data simulated by the ncam weather research and forecasting ncam wrf model to investigate spatially distributed soil moisture deficits in site scale farmland areas a gridded soil water budget model was developed to utilize the 90 m ncam wrf meteorological data to predict soil moisture content smc at multiple depths the applicability of the ncam wrf climatic variables to predict smc was evaluated by comparing the smc estimates with in situ observations at the monitoring site we used the quantile mapping qm method to correct the biases of ncam wrf precipitation outputs the smc estimates derived from the newly developed soil water budget model showed a good agreement with observations and we proved that the bias corrected ncam wrf precipitation data could improve the predictability of the temporal evolution of smcs for characterizing agricultural drought during the crop growing season we presented a novel approach to estimate the magnitude duration and severity of agricultural drought events based on crop s critical pressure head we mapped the distribution of smc soil matric potential smp and drought severity at the 90 m resolution and the results showed that applying the ncam wrf climatic variables to the modeling of smc smp profiles can lead to drought characterization on site scale while accounting for the spatial variability of rainfall and other climatic variables keywords agricultural drought high resolution meteorological data soil matric potential soil moisture deficit quantile mapping 1 introduction drought can induce large scale crop decline because water availability severely constrains agricultural ecosystem productivity blum 1996 mishra and cherkauer 2010 and soil moisture is one of the determining variables of the water budget in agricultural areas and crop production hargreaves 1975 holzman et al 2014 with human induced global warming there is a strong expectation of a general increase in the severity of agricultural drought which reflects the soil moisture deficiency and directly related to the irrigation requirement dai 2013 tian et al 2018 trenberth et al 2014 it is thus critical to quantify and describe agricultural drought events of various magnitudes for sustainably managing water resources in the agricultural ecosystem over the last few decades a variety of studies attempted to understand the relationship between soil moisture and agricultural drought conditions using several drought indices narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 and sridhar et al 2008 developed agricultural drought indices such as soil moisture deficit index smdi evapotranspiration deficit index etdi and soil moisture index smi using the modeled soil moisture deficit and evapotranspiration deficit to evaluate the spatiotemporal variability of drought severity showing that the variations of root zone soil moisture and crop yields are highly correlated keshavarz et al 2014 developed soil wetness deficit index swdi and tried to map the spatial distribution of drought areas and intensity pointing out the role of vegetation in balancing soil moisture variations martínez fernández et al 2015 developed the soil water deficit index swdi using soil moisture observations this approach was based on the soil water thresholds that define plant water availability as a reference level of agricultural onset several other studies used model based soil moisture products to assess agricultural drought and develop a monitoring system these studies were typically performed on a continental global scale incorporating several drought indices such as soil moisture percentiles leading to an examination for the model products and comparisons between drought indices mo 2008 sheffield 2004 shukla et al 2011 soil moisture predictions derived from climate models has also been a viable tool to generate the standardized drought indices in operational use meng et al 2011 used the weather research and forecasting wrf model to examine the impact of the time dependent land surface controls on the land atmosphere interaction and capture the impact of different land surface condition on the drought severity zaitchik et al 2013 used nasa unified wrf nu wrf to simulate drought duration and severity while honoring seasonality at 4 km resolution this study found that local soil moisture feedback has the potential to concentrate precipitation in wet areas rather than in dry areas during summer drought months boulard et al 2017 used weather and research forecast wrf regional climate model rcm precipitation data which was corrected through the quantile mapping transformation to compute the soil moisture deficit at 8 km resolution zhang et al 2017 demonstrated a soil moisture based drought forecasting skill by combining satellite observations with a climate forecasting model cfsv2 for predictions one month ahead in recent years the development and use of remotely sensed rs surface soil moisture ssm has increased as the role of the ssm observations within agricultural drought monitoring bolten et al 2010 entekhabi et al 2010 martínez fernández et al 2016 yan et al 2006 monitoring of agricultural drought using rs data mainly relies on the spectral differences of crops under water stress due to water limitations yan et al 2006 in several cases ssm retrievals were assimilated to constrain boundary condition of land surface models lsm for correcting errors arising from the uncertainty of forcing data and infer root zone soil moisture information that can be used to characterize drought conditions bolten et al 2010 champagne et al 2015 han et al 2014 sadri et al 2018 although these studies showed the added benefit of using hydrologic climate models applied with rs products in monitoring agricultural drought events the resolutions of most analysis are however normally coarser than 1 km ranging from the order of a few to several km and thus it is not feasible to apply the products to consider the spatial variability of droughts on site scale farmlands the heterogeneity of spatially distributed crops and soil types in farmland areas also call for a drought analysis with an improved resolution capable of considering the heterogeneous farmland areas while a variety of drought indices have been developed utilized to monitor agricultural droughts and the resulting impact on crop yields moreover these indices have a limitation in modeling crop response to soil moisture deficit since they only relied on the soil moisture amount and temporal evolution holzman et al 2014 keshavarz et al 2014 martínez fernández et al 2016 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 scaini et al 2015 yang et al 2017 this gap can be addressed by incorporating critical pressure head represented in soil matric potential smp threshold identified per crop and its variations following daily evaporative demand reduction of water uptake due to water stress varies widely by crop species even under the same moisture deficit since drought tolerance of crop plants varies according to species feddes et al 1978 thus we used the critical pressure head at which crops start to reduce water extraction to determine if each crop experiences moisture deficit under given moisture conditions drought can be quantified and described in absolute terms trenberth et al 2014 and it is essential to quantify the severity of agricultural drought events of various magnitude to characterize the probability of occurrence byun and wilhite 1999 in this study we presented a novel approach to characterize agricultural drought events i e the magnitude duration and severity using the estimates of soil moisture deficit considering drought tolerance of crop plants at high spatial resolution we evaluated the applicability of ncam wrf weather research and forecasting meteorological data to estimate daily soil moisture deficit and drought severity in site scale farmland areas a grid based soil water budget model was developed and configured to be coupled with high resolution meteorological data ncam wrf model generated atmospheric forcing data at the 810 m resolution which was re gridded to a 90 m resolution to be used to force the soil water budget model for modeling of vertical soil moisture transfer infiltration spatially gridded meteorological forcing data were used to explicitly calculate soil moisture content smc at multiple depths and we used the smc profiles to estimate smp for drought characterization across ncam wrf model domain incorporation of the critical pressure head into the analysis of agricultural drought facilitated direct analysis of crops response to water limitation which was not possible with previous soil moisture based approach to drought characterization also the high resolution meteorological data allowed for considering the spatial variability of weather conditions over the model domain and thus the site scale drought analysis was available we organized this paper as follows section 2 describes the monitoring site for climate and soil moisture observation and dataset observational meteorological simulations geospatial section 3 shows the methods to elucidate the mechanism for the vertical transport of soil moisture applied with ncam wrf data and soil moisture deficit estimation based on the smp threshold section 4 presents the validation of the proposed approach and the effect of using high resolution data in the spatiotemporal analysis of agricultural drought events section 5 lists our conclusions of this study 2 site description and data 2 1 monitoring site south korea suffered a massive drought in 2016 across the gyeonggi province with an area of 10 172 km2 the drought raised the need for agricultural drought monitoring in the gyeonggi province region because of its massive impact on crop productivity to deepen the scientific understanding of the drought and monitoring site in gyeonggi province noegok ri jeomdong myeon 37 16 n 127 66 e yeoju si gyeonggi province south korea is selected for site level soil moisture and climate observations the site has a mean annual precipitation of 1013 mm and a mean annual temperature of 15 1 it covers an area of 3600 m2 70 of which is irrigated land the physical properties of the soil at the monitoring site are listed in table 2 the particle size distribution was determined based on the disturbed soil samples of the corresponding layer and all the soils were classified into one texture sandy clay loam scl also hydrologic properties i e smc at saturation field capacity and wilting point of the soil are in line with existing literature allen et al 1998 saxton and rawls 2006 2 2 observational data we measured smc in farmland areas with peach trees from 5 24 2016 to 10 30 2016 159 days using frequency domain reflectometry fdr sensors at multiple depths 10 cm 30 cm and 50 cm meteorological input variable needed to estimate soil water budget includes precipitation mm air temperature relative humidity wind speed ms 1 and net radiation mjm 2d 1 were collected daily from an automatic weather station aws installed at the monitoring site fig 1 a the modeled smc profiles at the monitoring site were evaluated against the smc observations at multiple depths 2 3 geospatial soil type and land use data geospatial soil type and land use are re gridded to a 90 m resolution to be able to fit the spatial resolution of a soil grid in the budget model a detailed soil texture map was obtained from the national institute of agricultural sciences nais and the land cover map 1 25 000 was from the korea ministry of environment me and those maps were re gridded at the 90 m resolution as well 2 4 simulated meteorological data from ncam wrf and model domain high resolution meteorological data is generated from the ncam wrf model coupled with a noah multiparameterization mp land surface model lsm niu et al 2011 this high resolution coupled modeling system is one axis of the land atmosphere modeling package lamp established at the national center for agro meteorology ncam in 2016 for assisting high resolution medium range meteorological data in agricultural and forest use the other axis of the lamp is an offline one dimensional version of the noah mp which has been optimized for different agricultural sites at the 1 km lateral resolution including the haenam site in korea lee et al 2016 the lamp was developed to determine the associations between various agricultural application models and to evaluate the complexity and heterogeneity of agricultural and forest areas previous research tells us that greater agreement between the resolutions of input data and land surface data leads to more accurate results skamarock et al 2005 we selected the gyeonggi province in korea as the center of the simulation domain for the ncam wrf model the resolutions of a grid cell of each nesting are 21870 m d01 7290 m d02 2430 m d03 810 m d04 270 m d05 and 90 m d06 fig 1 b the lamp can simulate retrospective and forecasted climatic variables and we used simulated precipitation net radiation wind speed relative humidity and temperature for the distributed modeling of vertical soil moisture 3 methods 3 1 bias correction of high resolution meteorological data from ncam wrf we first evaluated the predictive performance of ncam wrf modeled variables against climate observations to determine an optimal resolution for modeling of soil moisture deficit and drought severity the climate observations were monitored by 76 surface weather observation stations of the korea meteorological administration kma and 129 automatic weather stations aws our assessment for the ncam wrf model showed that the correlation between simulated and observed temperature data was higher than that of other meteorological variables the bias and rmse of temperature at 810 m resolution were the lowest among all the resolutions with values of 0 9 and 2 3 respectively the wind speed component was calculated to have the lowest correlation between model output and observations yielding r values lower than 0 54 when the resolution was 810 m however the wind speed had the lowest bias and rmse relative humidity also had the lowest bias and rmse at a resolution of 810 m table 1 given the statistical metrics shown in the d04 810 m resolution we selected the simulated meteorological variables modeled at 810 m resolution i e d04 model domain as atmospheric forcing input data for d04 model domain we used the probability of detection pod and equitable threat score ets metrics to evaluate the predictive skill of the occurrence magnitude of precipitation events at the 810 m lateral discretization the values of pod and ets ranged from 0 38 through 0 71 and from 0 2 through 0 39 respectively it is found that the pod and ets generally decline as the accumulative precipitation increases fig 2 the quantile mapping qm method is used for bias correction to improve the fitness of regional climate variables of the ncam wrf the performance of the qm method in reducing the biases of climate variables such as precipitation was evaluated boulard et al 2017 the performance of the qm method for downscaled rainfall data generated from a wrf regional climate model rcm was shown to be effective in reducing the biases of simulated precipitation data rainfall seasonality and inter annual variability in this study the qm method was used along with aws precipitation observations at the monitoring site 37 16 n 127 66 e the weibull distribution was used to establish the probabilistic distribution of precipitation observed from 5 1 2013 to 4 30 2016 1095 days while considering its performance in representing daily precipitation li et al 2013 the distribution s parameters were determined following the method of probability weighted moments the cumulative density function cdf of ncam wrf simulated precipitation was matched with the cdf derived from precipitation observations generating a function for bias correction according to the quantiles since water budget and soil moisture are most sensitive to rainfall events we corrected only the ncam wrf precipitation outputs and evaluated against precipitation observations 3 2 modeling of vertical soil moisture profiles we developed a grid based soil water budget model and used it to account for vertical soil moisture transfer infiltration along with the soil columns the budget model considers the three layered system of the unsaturated zone that encompasses the land surface 0 cm to root zone 60 cm the soil water budget is performed on each grid cell at a 90 m resolution so that one ncam wrf forcing grid applied to 81 soil grids 9 9 water budget components e g evapotranspiration runoff are calculated on a daily basis and we estimated daily variations of smc in each layer since we do not have crop geospatial data for the ncam wrf d04 model domain we applied two crops pepper and peach tree on the farmland grids in a random fashion and parameterized crop properties of crop coefficients and lengths of crop development stages per each crop allen et al 1998 ashcroft and taylor 1972 accordingly every farmland grid contained specified information of soil type land use and crop at 90 m resolution while we ran the noah mp model at 1 km resolution which is the highest lateral resolution currently supported in most lsms e g clm noah noah mp we still recognize that a 1 km discretization might be considered coarse for site scale drought characterization on farmland areas the 90 m discretization of geospatial data and drought analysis thus provides a basis for explicit representation of sub grid heterogeneity which lacks in the noah mp lsm embedded in the ncam wrf model each soil column was divided into three layers while honoring the total depth is equal to 60 cm fig 3 the following equations are used for modeling of vertical soil moisture profiles in the three soil layers eqs 1 4 in this study the following assumptions are made 1 the components of capillary rise upward fluxes in the unsaturated zone profile lateral exchanges between adjacent soil columns were neglected considering their relatively small values compared to vertical net infiltration in a humid climate 2 the portion of precipitation infiltrating into the soil from a storm event is equal to the volume of precipitation minus runoff 3 the soil water stores reach equilibrium instantaneously once soil water budget is complete on a daily basis nishat et al 2007 panigrahi and panda 2003 4 soil hydraulic properties are homogeneous within the root zone 0 60 cm accordingly the resulting equation for the first soil layer can be simplified eq 2 soil layer 1 1 d s 1 d t δ s 1 t p r t u p t h i t e t 1 t i f t 1 2 t r o t h o t 2 d s 1 d t

layer is set to be equivalent to the amount of the overflow of the contiguous upper soil layer accordingly the equations are newly defined to calculate the soil moisture redistribution among soil layers in soil layer 2 the amount of infiltration was calculated as shown in eq 3 3 i f t 1 2 t p r t r o t d r 1 t s o i l l a y e r 2 d s 2 d t δ s 2 t i f t 1 2 t e t 2 t p r t r o t d r 1 t d s 2

estimated the actual crop evapotranspiration by multiplying the crop coefficient k c and water stress coefficient k s allen et al 1998 also the soil conservation service scs curve number cn method was used to estimate the daily runoff borg and grimes 1986 developed a sine function using 135 reported field observations which can typically represent the time course for a rooting depth of approximately 48 crop species including peppers and peaches soil water extraction at different soil layers 1 2 and 3 is calculated with the time course of rooting depth eq 5 and its pattern is determined as shown in fig 4 5 r d r 0 5 0 5 s i n 3 03 t r 1 47 where rdr is the relative rooting depth dimensionless and tr is the relative time i e the ratio of the current day after planting to days to maturity dimensionless the total length of crop development and the maximum root depth i e 60 cm were parameterized to calculate rdr and tr on a daily basis so that soil water extraction by roots at each layer was represented for the crops pepper and peach tree allen et al 1998 li et al 1989 we assumed that crop root distribution follows the same pattern according to their phenological stages in this study peach trees are considered a perennial plant so that their root distribution is represented to be the maximum extent throughout the year while the root distribution of peppers as an annual crop is represented according to its phenological stages table 3 the van genuchten water retention formulation is used to come up with the relationship between the modeled smc and the unsaturated zone pressure head smp ψ eq 6 6 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n 1 1 n where θ is actual soil moisture content m3 m 3 θ s is saturated volumetric water content m3 m 3 θ r is residual volumetric water content m3 m 3 α is a parameter related to the inverse of air entry pressure head m 1 and n is a constant varied with the pore size distribution dimensionless šimůnek et al 2013 and since we assume a single porosity van genuchten model for the entire soil column the same values of α and n were applied to the three soil layers while an adjustment was done for θ s and θ r to reflect the range of fluctuations observed in smc field data a model was suggested by feddes et al 1978 addressing the ability of a crop s water extraction depending on the level of smp in the root zone eq 7 7 x z β z α ψ

t p is the potential transpiration cmd 1 3 3 estimation of drought severity using critical pressure head the critical pressure head is a function of evaporative demand water demand of the atmosphere sadras and milroy 1996 thompson et al 2007 and specifically the critical pressure heads are more negative under relatively lower evaporative demands fig 5 we presented one approach to defining agricultural drought events while accounting for the water stress of each crop under water limitations we considered if the modeled smp derived from the water retention curve eq 6 is lower than the critical pressure head of the corresponding crop then the soil moisture is in deficit in this study a linear variation is assumed between h3 high critical pressure head at high evaporative demand et0 5 mmd 1 and h3 low critical pressure head at low evaporative demand et0 1 mmd 1 considering the lack of empirical evidence of disentangling tp from eto for major crops plants in farmland areas e g pepper and peach tree we used the daily eto estimates instead as approximates of daily evaporative demand zheng et al 2017 eq 8 the critical pressure head values are documented in several studies ashcroft and taylor 1972 olsson and rose 1988 thompson et al 2007 wesseling 1991 and we used the critical pressure values as a threshold against the modeled smps for estimating daily soil moisture deficit eq 9 we note that changes in the critical pressure head values with soil depth were not considered 8 ψ c r i t i c a l h 3 h i g h i f e t 0 t 5 m m d 1 ψ c r i t i c a l h 3 l o w h 3 l o w h

characterize the spatial variability of droughts of various magnitudes byun and wilhite 1999 nam et al 2015 according to the run theory a drought can be characterized by its duration run length

drought event equation 10 and 11 sheffield and wood 2008 drought duration d is the time between the onset and end date of a drought d in particular drought onset was determined to be the day on which the soil matric potential is higher than the critical pressure head value in the growing season and the end date was determined to be the day prior to that on which the soil matric potential is lower

october 30 2016 159 days which is the growing season of typical farmland crops such as peppers and peaches the ncam wrf d04 model domain 810 m resolution covers an area of 2728 km2 the output meteorological variables were generated on an hourly basis providing hourly relative humidity wind speed maximum temperature minimum temperature average temperature net radiation and precipitation the ncam wrf hourly outputs were then averaged out daily to be used as input for modeling vertical soil moisture transfer on a daily time step we identified that the ncam wrf outputs model the spatial variability of the variables showing that regional difference of daily weather conditions during the simulation period fig 6 4 2 effect of bias corrected ncam wrf precipitation data on soil moisture modeling the aws precipitation observations from 1 1 2014 12 31 2015 at the study site were used to establish the correction function of the ncam wrf predictions range we used aws precipitation observations in 1 1 2016 12 31 2016 to validate the established correction function and bias corrected the ncam wrf precipitation data simulated for the period of 5 24 2016 10 30 2016 based on the correction function evaluation of the bias corrected ncam wrf precipitation data against aws precipitation observations showed an improved linear relationship r2 0 79 than that of the raw ncam wrf precipitation data r2 0 57 for the simulation period fig 7 the comparison showed that bias corrected ncam wrf precipitation data could be more advantageous as an input than the raw data in terms of improving the accuracy of soil moisture estimates before evaluating the effect of the bias corrected ncam wrf precipitation data on soil moisture modeling we first tested the predictive performance of the grid based soil water budget model developed and employed in this study by comparing simulated smc derived from the aws observation with corresponding smc observations we used the aws climatic observations i e precipitation wind speed air temperature relative humidity and solar radiation to calculate daily evapotranspiration et and estimate smc at multiple depths using the soil water budget model the total precipitation recorded at the study site was 781 mm during the simulation period at the site scale the products of multi depth soil moisture simulation 10 cm 30 cm and 50 cm agreed with observations with respective values of r2 0 65 rmse 3 07 mm for soil layer 1 0 20 cm depth r2 0 61 rmse 2 99 mm for soil layer 2 for soil layer 2 20 40 cm depth and r2 0 53 rmse 3 08 mm for soil layer 3 40 60 cm depth we found an overall good temporal agreement between the simulations and observations fig 8 a c thus we evaluated the applicability of ncam wrf modeled climatic variables on the modeling of vertical soil moisture transfer fig 9 a c show the comparison of simulated smcs with the ncam wrf raw data and ncam wrf bias corrected data by applying bias corrected ncam wrf precipitation data we found a higher level of agreement between simulations and observations than the results applied with the raw ncam wrf precipitation data for soil layer 1 the r2 and rmse improved from 0 30 to 0 51 and from 4 42 mm to 3 76 mm respectively for soil layer 2 the r2 and rmse improved from 0 13 to 0 47 and from 4 36 mm to 3 87 mm respectively for soil layer 3 the r2 and rmse improved from 0 08 to 0 52 and 4 38 mm to 3 54 mm respectively table 4 considering that the values of r2 of other tested 1 dimensional soil moisture models e g hydrus 1 d typically range from 0 3 to 0 6 depending on the quality of parameters and boundary forcing data chen et al 2014 crescimanno and garofalo 2005 wanders et al 2012 this level of matching encourages the use of bias corrected ncam wrf precipitation data in the modeling of vertical soil water modeling 4 3 spatiotemporal distribution of soil moisture deficit and drought severity fig 10 a shows the temporal variations of simulated smc in a specified crop and soil type conditions i e crop pepper soil type clay loam and fig 10 b is the modeled series of smp derived from the modeled smc the simulated smc shifted from lower bound 17 wilting point to upper bound 36 field capacity of clay loam soil we found that temporal trends in both smc and smp are in contrast as can be inferred from the van genuchten water retention curve the temporal evolution in smc and smp time series in the three soil layers showed that the deeper soil layer has smaller variations in their values also simulated critical pressure head the threshold for determining the onset or end of a drought showed that temporal variations of the smp threshold by daily evaporative demand are reflected in determining the amount of soil moisture deficits and agricultural drought events our simulations for mapping spatially distributed smc and smp over the ncam wrf d04 domain relied on the point based assessment figs 11 and 12 showed the spatial distribution of the smc and smp simulated at the last day of each month during the simulation period no farming areas nullified in the simulations are shown in brown for easier visual comparison against farming areas the values of smc ranged from 16 mm to 76 mm depending on the soil properties i e field capacity and wilting point of the corresponding grid considering the large scale pattern of soil moisture estimates we identified that the spatial variability of the climate variables and rainfall was considered in water budget calculation also the spatial pattern shown in smc distribution was preserved in the smp results indicating that the northeastern and southwestern parts of the d04 model domain experienced relatively more severe drought due to simulated weather conditions in the areas during the simulation period the findings of regional differences in smc and smp provided a basis for studying spatial variability of the severity of agricultural drought events of various magnitudes we note that this study lacks the verification of the modeled smp products accordingly the reliability of the simulated soil matric potential results and its spatiotemporal distributions has not been evaluated we accumulated the magnitude duration and severity of each individual drought that occurred during the simulation period while accounting for each crop s drought tolerance that can be represented by the smp threshold critical pressure head the cumulative magnitudes ranged from 526 2 6 327 1 mm and the range of the cumulative duration was from 31 to 115 days by grids indicating spatially varying drought severity mainly due to the regional differences in climate and rainfall forcing we derived drought severity distribution across the d04 model domain based on the estimated magnitudes and durations our approach for the drought severity which depends on the time varying smp thresholds and resulting crop water stress estimated the mean daily severity of drought ranging from 16 9 55 0 mm fig 13 the drought severity of the northeastern and southeastern parts of the d04 model domain which showed relatively high soil matric potential values was understood to have experienced more severe drought than other areas in the domain our results showed the application of ncam wrf meteorological outputs to soil moisture modeling could constitute an important step for site scale drought monitoring while accounting for differing regional controls such as soil type crop drought tolerance and climatic conditions we expect that this spatial information of drought severity can serve to inform a management plan to effectively prevent agricultural drought insofar as it helps to focus efforts or water resources on more urgent areas 5 summary and conclusions this study evaluated the applicability of high resolution meteorological data from the ncam wrf model on estimating the spatiotemporal distributions of soil moisture deficit and drought severity we utilized ncam wrf modeled outputs of relative humidity wind speed temperature maximum minimum average net radiation and precipitation and validated the qm transformation method in correcting the biases of the simulated precipitation data for modeling of vertical soil water transfer the simulated climatic variables showed its potential to be used in accounting for spatial variability of climate and rainfall to better understand spatially distributed smc smp profiles we specifically corrected the biases of simulated precipitation data through the qm transformation method we selected the weibull probabilistic distribution function as a pdf of daily precipitation and parameters were determined following probability weighted moments we found that the bias corrected precipitation simulations better match with the observations than the raw precipitation simulation also the soil moisture estimates derived from the bias corrected ncam wrf model output showed its better capability to capture the major precipitation events across the model domain because of the reduced biases in precipitation inputs these results provided the validity of using the developed soil water budget model to test the applicability of ncam wrf data to soil moisture modeling we found better predicted soil moisture estimates when the bias corrected ncar wrf precipitation data was applied that the raw precipitation data were used based on the temporal agreement of smc profiles we estimated the temporal evolution of smp using the van genuchten soil water retention curve the modeled smp was shown to be inversely proportional to their corresponding smc values we note that however no validation was performed for the modeled smp to substantiate the idea for high resolution monitoring of agricultural drought based on the smp threshold thus the lack of verification of simulated smp should be supplemented in future studies while demonstrating one approach to agricultural drought characterization that relies on the critical pressure heads we found that the temporal variations in daily evaporative demand were reflected in calculating drought severity for characterizing agricultural drought we defined drought conditions based on daily critical pressure head and analyzed the magnitude duration and severity in farming areas the results showed that the daily critical head pressure is uniquely determined according to the evaporative demand of the corresponding day moreover the integration of ncam wrf simulated data facilitated a novel analysis of the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture deficit drought severity at site scale farmlands which has not been explored in previous studies this allowed us to investigate the regional differences of precipitation and other climatic variables at the 90 m resolution while still incorporating realistic crop soil parameters the 90 m resolution mappings indicate that critical pressure head based drought analysis applied with high resolution meteorological data is one means of predicting drought on farmland areas that are critical to farmland water management practices our simulations of the magnitude and severity can be explicitly utilized to quantify the total irrigation requirement and daily averaged irrigation requirement respectively additional work is needed to use real crop geospatial data for mapping the spatiotemporal evolution of drought severity magnitude and understanding the temporal matching of each drought event in real system moreover efforts to characterize agricultural drought are limited mainly by uncertainty in the forcing data and thus further evaluation of the uncertainty embedded in other climatic variables such as net radiation air temperature

10430,we discussed the applicability of high resolution meteorological data simulated by the ncam weather research and forecasting ncam wrf model to investigate spatially distributed soil moisture deficits in site scale farmland areas a gridded soil water budget model was developed to utilize the 90 m ncam wrf meteorological data to predict soil moisture content smc at multiple depths the applicability of the ncam wrf climatic variables to predict smc was evaluated by comparing the smc estimates with in situ observations at the monitoring site we used the quantile mapping qm method to correct the biases of ncam wrf precipitation outputs the smc estimates derived from the newly developed soil water budget model showed a good agreement with observations and we proved that the bias corrected ncam wrf precipitation data could improve the predictability of the temporal evolution of smcs for characterizing agricultural drought during the crop growing season we presented a novel approach to estimate the magnitude duration and severity of agricultural drought events based on crop s critical pressure head we mapped the distribution of smc soil matric potential smp and drought severity at the 90 m resolution and the results showed that applying the ncam wrf climatic variables to the modeling of smc smp profiles can lead to drought characterization on site scale while accounting for the spatial variability of rainfall and other climatic variables keywords agricultural drought high resolution meteorological data soil matric potential soil moisture deficit quantile mapping 1 introduction drought can induce large scale crop decline because water availability severely constrains agricultural ecosystem productivity blum 1996 mishra and cherkauer 2010 and soil moisture is one of the determining variables of the water budget in agricultural areas and crop production hargreaves 1975 holzman et al 2014 with human induced global warming there is a strong expectation of a general increase in the severity of agricultural drought which reflects the soil moisture deficiency and directly related to the irrigation requirement dai 2013 tian et al 2018 trenberth et al 2014 it is thus critical to quantify and describe agricultural drought events of various magnitudes for sustainably managing water resources in the agricultural ecosystem over the last few decades a variety of studies attempted to understand the relationship between soil moisture and agricultural drought conditions using several drought indices narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 and sridhar et al 2008 developed agricultural drought indices such as soil moisture deficit index smdi evapotranspiration deficit index etdi and soil moisture index smi using the modeled soil moisture deficit and evapotranspiration deficit to evaluate the spatiotemporal variability of drought severity showing that the variations of root zone soil moisture and crop yields are highly correlated keshavarz et al 2014 developed soil wetness deficit index swdi and tried to map the spatial distribution of drought areas and intensity pointing out the role of vegetation in balancing soil moisture variations martínez fernández et al 2015 developed the soil water deficit index swdi using soil moisture observations this approach was based on the soil water thresholds that define plant water availability as a reference level of agricultural onset several other studies used model based soil moisture products to assess agricultural drought and develop a monitoring system these studies were typically performed on a continental global scale incorporating several drought indices such as soil moisture percentiles leading to an examination for the model products and comparisons between drought indices mo 2008 sheffield 2004 shukla et al 2011 soil moisture predictions derived from climate models has also been a viable tool to generate the standardized drought indices in operational use meng et al 2011 used the weather research and forecasting wrf model to examine the impact of the time dependent land surface controls on the land atmosphere interaction and capture the impact of different land surface condition on the drought severity zaitchik et al 2013 used nasa unified wrf nu wrf to simulate drought duration and severity while honoring seasonality at 4 km resolution this study found that local soil moisture feedback has the potential to concentrate precipitation in wet areas rather than in dry areas during summer drought months boulard et al 2017 used weather and research forecast wrf regional climate model rcm precipitation data which was corrected through the quantile mapping transformation to compute the soil moisture deficit at 8 km resolution zhang et al 2017 demonstrated a soil moisture based drought forecasting skill by combining satellite observations with a climate forecasting model cfsv2 for predictions one month ahead in recent years the development and use of remotely sensed rs surface soil moisture ssm has increased as the role of the ssm observations within agricultural drought monitoring bolten et al 2010 entekhabi et al 2010 martínez fernández et al 2016 yan et al 2006 monitoring of agricultural drought using rs data mainly relies on the spectral differences of crops under water stress due to water limitations yan et al 2006 in several cases ssm retrievals were assimilated to constrain boundary condition of land surface models lsm for correcting errors arising from the uncertainty of forcing data and infer root zone soil moisture information that can be used to characterize drought conditions bolten et al 2010 champagne et al 2015 han et al 2014 sadri et al 2018 although these studies showed the added benefit of using hydrologic climate models applied with rs products in monitoring agricultural drought events the resolutions of most analysis are however normally coarser than 1 km ranging from the order of a few to several km and thus it is not feasible to apply the products to consider the spatial variability of droughts on site scale farmlands the heterogeneity of spatially distributed crops and soil types in farmland areas also call for a drought analysis with an improved resolution capable of considering the heterogeneous farmland areas while a variety of drought indices have been developed utilized to monitor agricultural droughts and the resulting impact on crop yields moreover these indices have a limitation in modeling crop response to soil moisture deficit since they only relied on the soil moisture amount and temporal evolution holzman et al 2014 keshavarz et al 2014 martínez fernández et al 2016 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 scaini et al 2015 yang et al 2017 this gap can be addressed by incorporating critical pressure head represented in soil matric potential smp threshold identified per crop and its variations following daily evaporative demand reduction of water uptake due to water stress varies widely by crop species even under the same moisture deficit since drought tolerance of crop plants varies according to species feddes et al 1978 thus we used the critical pressure head at which crops start to reduce water extraction to determine if each crop experiences moisture deficit under given moisture conditions drought can be quantified and described in absolute terms trenberth et al 2014 and it is essential to quantify the severity of agricultural drought events of various magnitude to characterize the probability of occurrence byun and wilhite 1999 in this study we presented a novel approach to characterize agricultural drought events i e the magnitude duration and severity using the estimates of soil moisture deficit considering drought tolerance of crop plants at high spatial resolution we evaluated the applicability of ncam wrf weather research and forecasting meteorological data to estimate daily soil moisture deficit and drought severity in site scale farmland areas a grid based soil water budget model was developed and configured to be coupled with high resolution meteorological data ncam wrf model generated atmospheric forcing data at the 810 m resolution which was re gridded to a 90 m resolution to be used to force the soil water budget model for modeling of vertical soil moisture transfer infiltration spatially gridded meteorological forcing data were used to explicitly calculate soil moisture content smc at multiple depths and we used the smc profiles to estimate smp for drought characterization across ncam wrf model domain incorporation of the critical pressure head into the analysis of agricultural drought facilitated direct analysis of crops response to water limitation which was not possible with previous soil moisture based approach to drought characterization also the high resolution meteorological data allowed for considering the spatial variability of weather conditions over the model domain and thus the site scale drought analysis was available we organized this paper as follows section 2 describes the monitoring site for climate and soil moisture observation and dataset observational meteorological simulations geospatial section 3 shows the methods to elucidate the mechanism for the vertical transport of soil moisture applied with ncam wrf data and soil moisture deficit estimation based on the smp threshold section 4 presents the validation of the proposed approach and the effect of using high resolution data in the spatiotemporal analysis of agricultural drought events section 5 lists our conclusions of this study 2 site description and data 2 1 monitoring site south korea suffered a massive drought in 2016 across the gyeonggi province with an area of 10 172 km2 the drought raised the need for agricultural drought monitoring in the gyeonggi province region because of its massive impact on crop productivity to deepen the scientific understanding of the drought and monitoring site in gyeonggi province noegok ri jeomdong myeon 37 16 n 127 66 e yeoju si gyeonggi province south korea is selected for site level soil moisture and climate observations the site has a mean annual precipitation of 1013 mm and a mean annual temperature of 15 1 it covers an area of 3600 m2 70 of which is irrigated land the physical properties of the soil at the monitoring site are listed in table 2 the particle size distribution was determined based on the disturbed soil samples of the corresponding layer and all the soils were classified into one texture sandy clay loam scl also hydrologic properties i e smc at saturation field capacity and wilting point of the soil are in line with existing literature allen et al 1998 saxton and rawls 2006 2 2 observational data we measured smc in farmland areas with peach trees from 5 24 2016 to 10 30 2016 159 days using frequency domain reflectometry fdr sensors at multiple depths 10 cm 30 cm and 50 cm meteorological input variable needed to estimate soil water budget includes precipitation mm air temperature relative humidity wind speed ms 1 and net radiation mjm 2d 1 were collected daily from an automatic weather station aws installed at the monitoring site fig 1 a the modeled smc profiles at the monitoring site were evaluated against the smc observations at multiple depths 2 3 geospatial soil type and land use data geospatial soil type and land use are re gridded to a 90 m resolution to be able to fit the spatial resolution of a soil grid in the budget model a detailed soil texture map was obtained from the national institute of agricultural sciences nais and the land cover map 1 25 000 was from the korea ministry of environment me and those maps were re gridded at the 90 m resolution as well 2 4 simulated meteorological data from ncam wrf and model domain high resolution meteorological data is generated from the ncam wrf model coupled with a noah multiparameterization mp land surface model lsm niu et al 2011 this high resolution coupled modeling system is one axis of the land atmosphere modeling package lamp established at the national center for agro meteorology ncam in 2016 for assisting high resolution medium range meteorological data in agricultural and forest use the other axis of the lamp is an offline one dimensional version of the noah mp which has been optimized for different agricultural sites at the 1 km lateral resolution including the haenam site in korea lee et al 2016 the lamp was developed to determine the associations between various agricultural application models and to evaluate the complexity and heterogeneity of agricultural and forest areas previous research tells us that greater agreement between the resolutions of input data and land surface data leads to more accurate results skamarock et al 2005 we selected the gyeonggi province in korea as the center of the simulation domain for the ncam wrf model the resolutions of a grid cell of each nesting are 21870 m d01 7290 m d02 2430 m d03 810 m d04 270 m d05 and 90 m d06 fig 1 b the lamp can simulate retrospective and forecasted climatic variables and we used simulated precipitation net radiation wind speed relative humidity and temperature for the distributed modeling of vertical soil moisture 3 methods 3 1 bias correction of high resolution meteorological data from ncam wrf we first evaluated the predictive performance of ncam wrf modeled variables against climate observations to determine an optimal resolution for modeling of soil moisture deficit and drought severity the climate observations were monitored by 76 surface weather observation stations of the korea meteorological administration kma and 129 automatic weather stations aws our assessment for the ncam wrf model showed that the correlation between simulated and observed temperature data was higher than that of other meteorological variables the bias and rmse of temperature at 810 m resolution were the lowest among all the resolutions with values of 0 9 and 2 3 respectively the wind speed component was calculated to have the lowest correlation between model output and observations yielding r values lower than 0 54 when the resolution was 810 m however the wind speed had the lowest bias and rmse relative humidity also had the lowest bias and rmse at a resolution of 810 m table 1 given the statistical metrics shown in the d04 810 m resolution we selected the simulated meteorological variables modeled at 810 m resolution i e d04 model domain as atmospheric forcing input data for d04 model domain we used the probability of detection pod and equitable threat score ets metrics to evaluate the predictive skill of the occurrence magnitude of precipitation events at the 810 m lateral discretization the values of pod and ets ranged from 0 38 through 0 71 and from 0 2 through 0 39 respectively it is found that the pod and ets generally decline as the accumulative precipitation increases fig 2 the quantile mapping qm method is used for bias correction to improve the fitness of regional climate variables of the ncam wrf the performance of the qm method in reducing the biases of climate variables such as precipitation was evaluated boulard et al 2017 the performance of the qm method for downscaled rainfall data generated from a wrf regional climate model rcm was shown to be effective in reducing the biases of simulated precipitation data rainfall seasonality and inter annual variability in this study the qm method was used along with aws precipitation observations at the monitoring site 37 16 n 127 66 e the weibull distribution was used to establish the probabilistic distribution of precipitation observed from 5 1 2013 to 4 30 2016 1095 days while considering its performance in representing daily precipitation li et al 2013 the distribution s parameters were determined following the method of probability weighted moments the cumulative density function cdf of ncam wrf simulated precipitation was matched with the cdf derived from precipitation observations generating a function for bias correction according to the quantiles since water budget and soil moisture are most sensitive to rainfall events we corrected only the ncam wrf precipitation outputs and evaluated against precipitation observations 3 2 modeling of vertical soil moisture profiles we developed a grid based soil water budget model and used it to account for vertical soil moisture transfer infiltration along with the soil columns the budget model considers the three layered system of the unsaturated zone that encompasses the land surface 0 cm to root zone 60 cm the soil water budget is performed on each grid cell at a 90 m resolution so that one ncam wrf forcing grid applied to 81 soil grids 9 9 water budget components e g evapotranspiration runoff are calculated on a daily basis and we estimated daily variations of smc in each layer since we do not have crop geospatial data for the ncam wrf d04 model domain we applied two crops pepper and peach tree on the farmland grids in a random fashion and parameterized crop properties of crop coefficients and lengths of crop development stages per each crop allen et al 1998 ashcroft and taylor 1972 accordingly every farmland grid contained specified information of soil type land use and crop at 90 m resolution while we ran the noah mp model at 1 km resolution which is the highest lateral resolution currently supported in most lsms e g clm noah noah mp we still recognize that a 1 km discretization might be considered coarse for site scale drought characterization on farmland areas the 90 m discretization of geospatial data and drought analysis thus provides a basis for explicit representation of sub grid heterogeneity which lacks in the noah mp lsm embedded in the ncam wrf model each soil column was divided into three layers while honoring the total depth is equal to 60 cm fig 3 the following equations are used for modeling of vertical soil moisture profiles in the three soil layers eqs 1 4 in this study the following assumptions are made 1 the components of capillary rise upward fluxes in the unsaturated zone profile lateral exchanges between adjacent soil columns were neglected considering their relatively small values compared to vertical net infiltration in a humid climate 2 the portion of precipitation infiltrating into the soil from a storm event is equal to the volume of precipitation minus runoff 3 the soil water stores reach equilibrium instantaneously once soil water budget is complete on a daily basis nishat et al 2007 panigrahi and panda 2003 4 soil hydraulic properties are homogeneous within the root zone 0 60 cm accordingly the resulting equation for the first soil layer can be simplified eq 2 soil layer 1 1 d s 1 d t δ s 1 t p r t u p t h i t e t 1 t i f t 1 2 t r o t h o t 2 d s 1 d t

layer is set to be equivalent to the amount of the overflow of the contiguous upper soil layer accordingly the equations are newly defined to calculate the soil moisture redistribution among soil layers in soil layer 2 the amount of infiltration was calculated as shown in eq 3 3 i f t 1 2 t p r t r o t d r 1 t s o i l l a y e r 2 d s 2 d t δ s 2 t i f t 1 2 t e t 2 t p r t r o t d r 1 t d s 2

estimated the actual crop evapotranspiration by multiplying the crop coefficient k c and water stress coefficient k s allen et al 1998 also the soil conservation service scs curve number cn method was used to estimate the daily runoff borg and grimes 1986 developed a sine function using 135 reported field observations which can typically represent the time course for a rooting depth of approximately 48 crop species including peppers and peaches soil water extraction at different soil layers 1 2 and 3 is calculated with the time course of rooting depth eq 5 and its pattern is determined as shown in fig 4 5 r d r 0 5 0 5 s i n 3 03 t r 1 47 where rdr is the relative rooting depth dimensionless and tr is the relative time i e the ratio of the current day after planting to days to maturity dimensionless the total length of crop development and the maximum root depth i e 60 cm were parameterized to calculate rdr and tr on a daily basis so that soil water extraction by roots at each layer was represented for the crops pepper and peach tree allen et al 1998 li et al 1989 we assumed that crop root distribution follows the same pattern according to their phenological stages in this study peach trees are considered a perennial plant so that their root distribution is represented to be the maximum extent throughout the year while the root distribution of peppers as an annual crop is represented according to its phenological stages table 3 the van genuchten water retention formulation is used to come up with the relationship between the modeled smc and the unsaturated zone pressure head smp ψ eq 6 6 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n 1 1 n where θ is actual soil moisture content m3 m 3 θ s is saturated volumetric water content m3 m 3 θ r is residual volumetric water content m3 m 3 α is a parameter related to the inverse of air entry pressure head m 1 and n is a constant varied with the pore size distribution dimensionless šimůnek et al 2013 and since we assume a single porosity van genuchten model for the entire soil column the same values of α and n were applied to the three soil layers while an adjustment was done for θ s and θ r to reflect the range of fluctuations observed in smc field data a model was suggested by feddes et al 1978 addressing the ability of a crop s water extraction depending on the level of smp in the root zone eq 7 7 x z β z α ψ

t p is the potential transpiration cmd 1 3 3 estimation of drought severity using critical pressure head the critical pressure head is a function of evaporative demand water demand of the atmosphere sadras and milroy 1996 thompson et al 2007 and specifically the critical pressure heads are more negative under relatively lower evaporative demands fig 5 we presented one approach to defining agricultural drought events while accounting for the water stress of each crop under water limitations we considered if the modeled smp derived from the water retention curve eq 6 is lower than the critical pressure head of the corresponding crop then the soil moisture is in deficit in this study a linear variation is assumed between h3 high critical pressure head at high evaporative demand et0 5 mmd 1 and h3 low critical pressure head at low evaporative demand et0 1 mmd 1 considering the lack of empirical evidence of disentangling tp from eto for major crops plants in farmland areas e g pepper and peach tree we used the daily eto estimates instead as approximates of daily evaporative demand zheng et al 2017 eq 8 the critical pressure head values are documented in several studies ashcroft and taylor 1972 olsson and rose 1988 thompson et al 2007 wesseling 1991 and we used the critical pressure values as a threshold against the modeled smps for estimating daily soil moisture deficit eq 9 we note that changes in the critical pressure head values with soil depth were not considered 8 ψ c r i t i c a l h 3 h i g h i f e t 0 t 5 m m d 1 ψ c r i t i c a l h 3 l o w h 3 l o w h

characterize the spatial variability of droughts of various magnitudes byun and wilhite 1999 nam et al 2015 according to the run theory a drought can be characterized by its duration run length

drought event equation 10 and 11 sheffield and wood 2008 drought duration d is the time between the onset and end date of a drought d in particular drought onset was determined to be the day on which the soil matric potential is higher than the critical pressure head value in the growing season and the end date was determined to be the day prior to that on which the soil matric potential is lower

october 30 2016 159 days which is the growing season of typical farmland crops such as peppers and peaches the ncam wrf d04 model domain 810 m resolution covers an area of 2728 km2 the output meteorological variables were generated on an hourly basis providing hourly relative humidity wind speed maximum temperature minimum temperature average temperature net radiation and precipitation the ncam wrf hourly outputs were then averaged out daily to be used as input for modeling vertical soil moisture transfer on a daily time step we identified that the ncam wrf outputs model the spatial variability of the variables showing that regional difference of daily weather conditions during the simulation period fig 6 4 2 effect of bias corrected ncam wrf precipitation data on soil moisture modeling the aws precipitation observations from 1 1 2014 12 31 2015 at the study site were used to establish the correction function of the ncam wrf predictions range we used aws precipitation observations in 1 1 2016 12 31 2016 to validate the established correction function and bias corrected the ncam wrf precipitation data simulated for the period of 5 24 2016 10 30 2016 based on the correction function evaluation of the bias corrected ncam wrf precipitation data against aws precipitation observations showed an improved linear relationship r2 0 79 than that of the raw ncam wrf precipitation data r2 0 57 for the simulation period fig 7 the comparison showed that bias corrected ncam wrf precipitation data could be more advantageous as an input than the raw data in terms of improving the accuracy of soil moisture estimates before evaluating the effect of the bias corrected ncam wrf precipitation data on soil moisture modeling we first tested the predictive performance of the grid based soil water budget model developed and employed in this study by comparing simulated smc derived from the aws observation with corresponding smc observations we used the aws climatic observations i e precipitation wind speed air temperature relative humidity and solar radiation to calculate daily evapotranspiration et and estimate smc at multiple depths using the soil water budget model the total precipitation recorded at the study site was 781 mm during the simulation period at the site scale the products of multi depth soil moisture simulation 10 cm 30 cm and 50 cm agreed with observations with respective values of r2 0 65 rmse 3 07 mm for soil layer 1 0 20 cm depth r2 0 61 rmse 2 99 mm for soil layer 2 for soil layer 2 20 40 cm depth and r2 0 53 rmse 3 08 mm for soil layer 3 40 60 cm depth we found an overall good temporal agreement between the simulations and observations fig 8 a c thus we evaluated the applicability of ncam wrf modeled climatic variables on the modeling of vertical soil moisture transfer fig 9 a c show the comparison of simulated smcs with the ncam wrf raw data and ncam wrf bias corrected data by applying bias corrected ncam wrf precipitation data we found a higher level of agreement between simulations and observations than the results applied with the raw ncam wrf precipitation data for soil layer 1 the r2 and rmse improved from 0 30 to 0 51 and from 4 42 mm to 3 76 mm respectively for soil layer 2 the r2 and rmse improved from 0 13 to 0 47 and from 4 36 mm to 3 87 mm respectively for soil layer 3 the r2 and rmse improved from 0 08 to 0 52 and 4 38 mm to 3 54 mm respectively table 4 considering that the values of r2 of other tested 1 dimensional soil moisture models e g hydrus 1 d typically range from 0 3 to 0 6 depending on the quality of parameters and boundary forcing data chen et al 2014 crescimanno and garofalo 2005 wanders et al 2012 this level of matching encourages the use of bias corrected ncam wrf precipitation data in the modeling of vertical soil water modeling 4 3 spatiotemporal distribution of soil moisture deficit and drought severity fig 10 a shows the temporal variations of simulated smc in a specified crop and soil type conditions i e crop pepper soil type clay loam and fig 10 b is the modeled series of smp derived from the modeled smc the simulated smc shifted from lower bound 17 wilting point to upper bound 36 field capacity of clay loam soil we found that temporal trends in both smc and smp are in contrast as can be inferred from the van genuchten water retention curve the temporal evolution in smc and smp time series in the three soil layers showed that the deeper soil layer has smaller variations in their values also simulated critical pressure head the threshold for determining the onset or end of a drought showed that temporal variations of the smp threshold by daily evaporative demand are reflected in determining the amount of soil moisture deficits and agricultural drought events our simulations for mapping spatially distributed smc and smp over the ncam wrf d04 domain relied on the point based assessment figs 11 and 12 showed the spatial distribution of the smc and smp simulated at the last day of each month during the simulation period no farming areas nullified in the simulations are shown in brown for easier visual comparison against farming areas the values of smc ranged from 16 mm to 76 mm depending on the soil properties i e field capacity and wilting point of the corresponding grid considering the large scale pattern of soil moisture estimates we identified that the spatial variability of the climate variables and rainfall was considered in water budget calculation also the spatial pattern shown in smc distribution was preserved in the smp results indicating that the northeastern and southwestern parts of the d04 model domain experienced relatively more severe drought due to simulated weather conditions in the areas during the simulation period the findings of regional differences in smc and smp provided a basis for studying spatial variability of the severity of agricultural drought events of various magnitudes we note that this study lacks the verification of the modeled smp products accordingly the reliability of the simulated soil matric potential results and its spatiotemporal distributions has not been evaluated we accumulated the magnitude duration and severity of each individual drought that occurred during the simulation period while accounting for each crop s drought tolerance that can be represented by the smp threshold critical pressure head the cumulative magnitudes ranged from 526 2 6 327 1 mm and the range of the cumulative duration was from 31 to 115 days by grids indicating spatially varying drought severity mainly due to the regional differences in climate and rainfall forcing we derived drought severity distribution across the d04 model domain based on the estimated magnitudes and durations our approach for the drought severity which depends on the time varying smp thresholds and resulting crop water stress estimated the mean daily severity of drought ranging from 16 9 55 0 mm fig 13 the drought severity of the northeastern and southeastern parts of the d04 model domain which showed relatively high soil matric potential values was understood to have experienced more severe drought than other areas in the domain our results showed the application of ncam wrf meteorological outputs to soil moisture modeling could constitute an important step for site scale drought monitoring while accounting for differing regional controls such as soil type crop drought tolerance and climatic conditions we expect that this spatial information of drought severity can serve to inform a management plan to effectively prevent agricultural drought insofar as it helps to focus efforts or water resources on more urgent areas 5 summary and conclusions this study evaluated the applicability of high resolution meteorological data from the ncam wrf model on estimating the spatiotemporal distributions of soil moisture deficit and drought severity we utilized ncam wrf modeled outputs of relative humidity wind speed temperature maximum minimum average net radiation and precipitation and validated the qm transformation method in correcting the biases of the simulated precipitation data for modeling of vertical soil water transfer the simulated climatic variables showed its potential to be used in accounting for spatial variability of climate and rainfall to better understand spatially distributed smc smp profiles we specifically corrected the biases of simulated precipitation data through the qm transformation method we selected the weibull probabilistic distribution function as a pdf of daily precipitation and parameters were determined following probability weighted moments we found that the bias corrected precipitation simulations better match with the observations than the raw precipitation simulation also the soil moisture estimates derived from the bias corrected ncam wrf model output showed its better capability to capture the major precipitation events across the model domain because of the reduced biases in precipitation inputs these results provided the validity of using the developed soil water budget model to test the applicability of ncam wrf data to soil moisture modeling we found better predicted soil moisture estimates when the bias corrected ncar wrf precipitation data was applied that the raw precipitation data were used based on the temporal agreement of smc profiles we estimated the temporal evolution of smp using the van genuchten soil water retention curve the modeled smp was shown to be inversely proportional to their corresponding smc values we note that however no validation was performed for the modeled smp to substantiate the idea for high resolution monitoring of agricultural drought based on the smp threshold thus the lack of verification of simulated smp should be supplemented in future studies while demonstrating one approach to agricultural drought characterization that relies on the critical pressure heads we found that the temporal variations in daily evaporative demand were reflected in calculating drought severity for characterizing agricultural drought we defined drought conditions based on daily critical pressure head and analyzed the magnitude duration and severity in farming areas the results showed that the daily critical head pressure is uniquely determined according to the evaporative demand of the corresponding day moreover the integration of ncam wrf simulated data facilitated a novel analysis of the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture deficit drought severity at site scale farmlands which has not been explored in previous studies this allowed us to investigate the regional differences of precipitation and other climatic variables at the 90 m resolution while still incorporating realistic crop soil parameters the 90 m resolution mappings indicate that critical pressure head based drought analysis applied with high resolution meteorological data is one means of predicting drought on farmland areas that are critical to farmland water management practices our simulations of the magnitude and severity can be explicitly utilized to quantify the total irrigation requirement and daily averaged irrigation requirement respectively additional work is needed to use real crop geospatial data for mapping the spatiotemporal evolution of drought severity magnitude and understanding the temporal matching of each drought event in real system moreover efforts to characterize agricultural drought are limited mainly by uncertainty in the forcing data and thus further evaluation of the uncertainty embedded in other climatic variables such as net radiation air temperature will be necessary to substantiate the suitability of ncam wrf meteorological data for smc smp predictions and agricultural drought characterization author contribution minki hong sang hyun lee and jin

10431,jujube is an excellent fruit crop with important economic and ecological benefits in arid regions with the shortage of water resources quantifying the jujube tree growth response to irrigation is significant for improving water use efficiency wue and establishing adequate water management strategies however most studies on water management for jujube tree are based on statistical analysis of field trials to determine irrigation strategies and few studies focus on using crop growth simulation methods to quantitatively analyze the impact of water management on jujube growth and wue therefore the research aimed at evaluating the ability of a calibrated wofsot world food studies model to simulate seasonal jujube tree development dynamics and water movement and to quantitatively describe the influence of different irrigation treatments on yield evapotranspiration and wue simulated seasonal growth dynamics for total dry weight of stems leaves and fruits tagp and leaf area index lai agreed well with field measured values at each irrigation treatment in 2016 and 2017 showing r2 values from 0 92 to 0 98 for tagp 0 79 to 0 97 for lai with high accuracy 8 7 nrmse 20 5 for tagp 8 1 nrmse 21 1 for lai the calibrated model had also high global simulation performance of soil water balance process for all five irrigation treatments showing good agreement r2 0 78 and low error nrmse 6 6 simulated yield actual evapotranspiration e t a and wue in two orchards with different field capacity fc have also been confirmed to hold good agreement and high accuracy and their r2

describe the impact of irrigation strategies on jujube tree seasonal growth dynamics yield evapotranspiration and wue which may become a promising quantitative analysis method for the coupled effects of soil meteorology water management and jujube tree growth and decision making for irrigation strategies keywords wofost jujube grow simulation irrigation evapotranspiration water use efficiency 1 introduction jujube zizyphus jujube miller tree is a small deciduous tree of the rhamnaceae family coming from china its fruit is rich in carbohydrates reducing sugar vitamin c soluble and insoluble fibre protein mineral and phenolic compounds li et al 2007 showing important edible and medical value gao et al 2013 ji et al 2017 jujube tree is mainly cultivated in shandong hebei shanxi shaanxi henan provinces and xinjiang uygur autonomous region in china with a production of almost 7 360 000 tons every year among them xinjiang in arid regions accounts for almost 49 of the chinese jujube production national bureau of statistics 2018 because of its easy cultivation early fruit time and superior adaptability to arid environments galindo et al 2016 xinjiang has become the largest jujube planting base because of its abundant light and thermal resources however in this arid regions annual total rainfall is usually less than 100 mm with a large amount of evapotranspiration yao et al 2018 therefore jujube water requirements strongly replies on artificial irrigation analyzing the water requirements of jujube trees and improving water use efficiency are of great significance for increasing the jujube yield and saving water resources in arid regions in the past ten years research on water management of jujube trees has focused on the effects of drip irrigation on root distribution and soil properties ma et al 2013 mulching methods on water consumption and water saving potential sun et al 2012 canopy pruning on water use efficiency chen et al 2016 jin et al 2019 ma et al 2019 deficit irrigation on growth development soil properties and fruit water cui et al 2009 galindo et al 2016 liu et al 2019 vegetation cover on soil moisture and photosynthesis huang et al 2014 pan et al 2017 soil managements on surface runoff and soil water content wang et al 2015a and soil water effects ling et al 2017 water nitrogen coupling effects dai et al 2019 liu et al 2017 irrigation strategy optimization ye et al 2019 soil water and root distribution wang et al 2015b and so on in addition the weighted grey correlation model is used to optimize the water and nitrogen input wang et al 2015b hydrus model has also been tried to model the soil moisture distribution in the jujube root zone wang et al 2011 yao et al 2011 and analyze irrigation strategies wang and ma 2014 however most studies determine the irrigation strategies based on statistical analysis of field experimental data water management is usually only applicable to specific soils and meteorological environments statistical analysis method is not easy to achieve quantitative analysis and mechanism description on the impact of irrigation strategies on jujube growth development yield and water use efficiency wue crop growth models based on physiological and ecological principles use mathematical models to quantify crop growth processes affected by climate soil properties and agronomic management de wit et al 2019a in the past few decades several mature crop models such as wofost world food studies van diepen et al 1989 dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer jones et al 2003 epic environmental policy integrated climate williams et al 1989 stics multidisciplinary simulator for standard crops brisson et al 1998 apsim agricultural production systems simulator holzworth et al 2014 swap soil water atmosphere and plant kroes and supit 2011 aquacrop crop water productivity model steduto et al 2009 and cropsyst cropping systems simulation model stöckle et al 2003 have been developed and improved these models have their own characteristics and advantages and usually include modules such as phenology development carbon dioxide assimilation photosynthesis production respiration assimilation allocation and soil water cycle which are often used in the water transport simulation and use efficiency evaluation for field crops de wit et al 2019a however crop modelling is mainly developed in the literatures for annual crops including wheat maize rice soybean and cotton jones et al 2017 there are extremely few research reports on using crop growth modelling methods for water migration simulation and use efficiency evaluation of fruit crops crop modelling methods may provide a new means to quantitatively and mechanically analyze the coupled effects of orchard soil meteorology water management and fruit tree growth thus the objectives of this study are as follows i to calibrate crop input parameters of wofost model for water limited jujube growth simulation ii to evaluate the performance of the calibrated wofsot model to simulate seasonal jujube tree growth dynamics and soil water movement iii to quantitatively describe the response of yield actual evapotranspiration t r a and water use efficiency wue to different irrigation treatments 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site the proposed study was carried out in the city of alaer in southwestern china because of the relatively large and concentrated jujube planting areas this region represented ten small agro ecological zones in which around 45 515 ha of jujube orchards these agro ecological zones currently produced almost 16 of the annual national production of dry jujube fruit 2019 alaer statistical yearbook the climate in this area is typical of an arid warm temperate region the annual total precipitation is usually less than 100 mm the frost free period is between 180 and 224 days the average daily sunshine is about 15 h during main jujube growth season the annual average temperature ranges from 10 8 to 12 5 c the annual total evaporation is between 1876 and 2558 mm the soil type is sandy loam 2 2 field experiments design field experiments were conducted in two jujube orchards 81 13 2 e 40 34 45 n in 2016 and 2017 to calibrate water limited wofost simulation for jun jujube cultivar the jujube trees in two orchards were respectively planted in 2005 and 2009 with about 2500 trees per hectare the tree age of the two orchards had reached the age of high yield the pruning with small canopy permanent line shape and other agronomic management without irrigation of the two orchards were almost the same the soil parameters of the two orchards were different the field plots where the jujube tree grew evenly were chosen to carry out experiments the amount of fertilizer used referred to empirical values which usually had high yields in our experiments and local areas 375 kg ha 1 of pure nitrogen n 240 kg ha 1 of phosphorus pentoxide p2o5 and 300 kg ha 1 of potassium oxide k2o were fertilized into the soil in six times with drip irrigation five treatments including full irrigation with 375 mm d1 90 of full irrigation supply 338 mm d2 80 of full irrigation 300 mm d3 70 of full irrigation 263 mm d4 and 60 of full irrigation 225 mm d5 were designed for irrigation experiments during the main growth cycle with three replicates full irrigation amount d1 was the amount of irrigation widely used locally which was assumed to fully meet the growth and development needs of jujube trees during the main growing period the jujube tree was irrigated about 10 times during the main growth circle from early may to late august irrigation was performed separately in doy day of year 131 142 155 164 171 181 189 204 211 and 223 in two years 2 3 field data measurement and observation the data used in the study included calibration and verification data for water limited jujube growth simulation based on wofost model validation data for the evaluation of the simulated final yield e t a and wue in the first orchard fc 0 296 cm3 cm 3 all the following data were measured in the second orchard fc 0 194 cm3 cm 3 only the yield and evapotranspiration data were measured to verify the simulation performance of yield t r a transpiration rate and wue for orchards with different soil properties in each measurement three uniformly growing jujube trees in each irrigation treatment were selected to measure variables the measured and observed data were as follows phenology time emergence the time when the fifth leaf on the bud was unfolded flowering the time when the fruit began to develop and maturity dates the time when the dry weight of the fruit no longer increased were observed in order to calibrate phenology parameters and validate the simulated performance for phenology development time dry weight the dry matter weight of stems leaves and fruits were measured about ten times at each sub field experimental plot to calculate total dry matter weight tagp in order to calibrate conversion of assimilates into biomass and partitioning parameters and validate the simulated performance of aboveground biomass for each plot the stems leaves and fruits of three trees growing evenly were randomly selected and brought back to the laboratory to weigh after drying at 85 c to a constant weight canopy structure parameters leaf area index lai and extinction coefficient for diffuse visible light in the experimental areas were measured approximately ten times to calibrate specific leaf area parameters and get extinction coefficient for diffuse visible light and validate the performance of the simulated lai photosynthesis co2 assimilation parameters the li cor 6400xt meter li cor united states was employed to measure net photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance intercellular co2 concentration and transpiration rate then the light response curve of the net photosynthetic rate at the optimal development temperature was fitted to obtain maximum co2 assimilation rate and light use efficiency parameters in each measurement the photosynthesis parameters of the leaves in the upper middle and lower layers of the canopy 10 leaves in each layer were measured initial total dry weight tdwi initial buds and roots were measured and then summed to calculate tdwi soil moisture content the soil samples were brought back to the laboratory to measure the moisture content by drying method to calibrate water use parameters and validate the performance of the simulated water balance the average soil volume moisture content was measured before and after irrigation based on the soil moisture content per 20 cm 0 100 cm soil moisture content at field capacity and saturation was also measured before emergence yield the dry weight of all the fruits per plot were measured at harvest to evaluate the performance of the simulated yield actual evapotranspiration e t a and water use efficiency wue e t a were calculated by eq 1 dai et al 2019 in order to estimate the performance of the simulated e t a and wue 1 e t a p r u i d r δ s m where p r u i d r and δ s m represent precipitation underground water recharge irrigation amount deep infiltration runoff and differences in soil moisture content measured at emergence and harvest groundwater recharge and runoff in the experimental area hardly occurred so eq 1 was simplified as eq 2 2 e t a p r i d δ s m where deep infiltration d was measured using soil moisture sensors hobo h21 002 united states at 100 cm depth wue was calculated as eq 3 payero et al 2008 3 w u e y e t a where y represents dry fruit yield kg ha 1 and e t a represents actual evapotranspiration mm weather data meteorological data were automatically observed every 15 min using small weather stations observed meteorological data were converted to the meteorological driving data required by wofost model including daily maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation wind speed 2 m actual vapour pressure and precipitation the figs 1 2 and 3 showed the daily maximum and minimum temperatures daily total precipitation and irradiation from april to october in 2016 and 2017 respectively the daily average temperature during the growing period in both years ranged from 10 6 to 29 3 c the daily minimum and maximum temperatures showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing with a relatively large daily temperature difference the average of the maximum temperatures was basically the same in 2016 and 2017 the minimum average temperature in 2016 was 1 5 c higher than that of 2017 the study area was located on the edge of the desert with very little rainfall of less than 100 mm per year the water demand for jujube trees depended mainly on irrigation rainfall mainly occurred in summer the daily total radiation in the study area was strong and showed large fluctuations see fig 3 the average daily radiation from april to october in 2017 was also significantly higher than in 2016 which was usually helpful for photosynthesis 2 4 description of wofost model wofost is a mechanistic model that describes crop growth processes of phenology development light interception photosynthesis organs formation and development transpiration growth and maintenance respiration and partitioning of assimilates into different organs it also explains how these processes are affected by soil and meteorological conditions a schematic diagram of the links between model components in wofost is shown in fig 4 de wit et al 2019a specific mathematical descriptions and details can be referenced to existing studies de wit et al 2019a 2019b supit et al 1994 wofost describes the basic physiological processes of crops from emergence to maturity according to crop characteristics and environmental conditions weather and astro modules determine the intercepted light and phenological development stages the model simulates the dry matter accumulation of the plants under the influence of solar radiation temperature precipitation and crop characteristics in a day s step the total assimilation rate of the canopy is the basis of dry matter production which is calculated from the absorbed solar radiant energy and the effective leaf area a part of the assimilation product carbohydrates are consumed to maintain respiration the rest is converted to structural dry matter and some dry matter is consumed by growth respiration during the conversion process the produced dry matter is distributed in roots stems leaves and storage organs the partition coefficient varies with developmental stages dvs wofost calculates crop transpiration soil evaporation and open water evaporation separately transpiration is included in the wofost model and soil and water evaporation is entrusted to the soil moisture balance model de wit et al 2019b potential evapotranspiration of a crop e t p is the sum of potential transpiration t p and soil evaporation e p see eq 4 e t p is usually calculated referring to the penman monteith formula however the potential evapotranspiration of some crops may be higher than that calculated by penman monteith formula penman evapotranspiration should be multiplied by the crop factor therefore a correction factor the so called crop factor cfet is introduced into the model to account for this effect thereby calculating the maximum evapotranspiration of crops van diepen et al 1989 e t m see eq 5 the maximum transpiration rate t m can be calculated by eq 6 when the water supply is sufficient the actual transpiration rate t a is equal to t m payero et al 2008 when the water supply is insufficient the reduction factor r w s is used to modify t m to calculate t a see eq 7 the calculation of r w s is shown in eq 8 and 9 then the actual evapotranspiration e t a can be obtained 4 e t p t p e p 5 e t m c f e t e t p 6 t m e t m 1 e k g b l a i 7 t a r w s t m 8 r w s θ t θ w p θ w s θ w p 9 θ w s 1 ρ θ f c θ w p θ w p where t a represents the actual transpiration rate r w s is the reduction coefficient of water stress on transpiration rate t m is the maximum transpiration rate e t p is calculated according to the penman monteith formula cfet is the crop coefficient generally fixed at 1 value ranges from 0 9 to 1 2 k g b represents the extinction coefficient θ t represents soil moisture content sm θ w s represents sm at saturation θ w p represents the withered humidity ρ is the soil water consumption coefficient and θ f c is the field capacity 2 5 calibration of wofost model the initial input parameters of the wofost model mainly include meteorological soil and crop parameters in the research the meteorological parameters directly use the observed values of the weather station the soil parameters directly use the field measured values mainly including amtab soil water retention smw soil moisture content at wilting point smfcf soil moisture content at field capacity sm0 soil moisture content at saturation contab hydraulic conductivity k0 hydraulic conductivity of saturated soil sope maximum percolation rate root zone and ksub maximum percolation rate subsoil jujube crop parameters were calibrated for the water limited growth simulation based on full irrigation experiments d1 treatment in 2016 referring to an existing study todorovic et al 2009 the d2 d5 in 2016 and d1 d5 in 2017 experimental data were used to validate the simulation performance the calibration details of the wofost model was suggested in de wit and wolf de wit and wolf 2010 the detailed calibrated process for jujube growth simulation based on previous research was as follows first phenology development dates including emergence flowering and maturity dates were firstly calibrated on basis of accumulated effective temperature sum van diepen et al 1989 tbasem expressed the minimum threshold temperature at which jujube trees began to develop which was equal to 10 c sun 2019 teffmx expressed the maximum effective temperature at emergence ranging from 18 to 32 c given by wofost the observation results showed that jujube trees were sprouting normally so teffmx was set to 30 c in this study referring to the default value of most crops from wofost model temperature sum for emergence tsumem from emergence to flowering tsum1 and from flowering to maturity tsum2 were calibrated by calculating accumulated effective temperature sum and observing the dates at emergence flowering and maturity in 2016 and 2017 daily increase in temperature sum dtsmtb which is a function of average effective temperature can be calculated by the maximum suitable temperature 35 5 c wang et al 2002 and minimum development temperature 10 c sun 2019 tdwi was equal to the field measured value second for laiem lai at emergence the measured maximum value in all field experiments was less than 0 004 ha ha 1 so laiem was set to 0 004 ha ha 1 for calibrating maximum relative increase in lai rgrlai the measured maximum value was less than 0 05 so rgrlai was set to 0 05 specific leaf area slatb was calibrated based on the measured values and simulated lai and tagp span life span of leaves growing was corrected based on lai measured during the late growing season third for the calibration of co2 assimilation parameters the light response curves were fitted at the optimal low limit temperature of 19 5 c and the upper limit temperature of 35 5 c to obtain the initial maximum co2 assimilation rate amaxtb and light use efficiency for single leaf efftb then the extinction coefficient for diffuse visible light kdiftb amaxtb and efftb were corrected by the measured and simulated tagp and lai fourth the conversion of assimilates into biomass including efficiency of conversion into leaves cvl storage organs cvo roots cvr and stems cvs express growth respiration dry matter partitioning parameters including fraction of above ground dry matter to stems frtb storage organs fotb and leaves fltb which all describe the fraction as a function of the development stage these parameters were calibrated using measured and simulated dry matter weights of aboveground organs the maintenance respiration costs such as relative increase in respiration rate per 10 c temperature increase q10 relative maintenance respiration rate of leaves rml storage organs rmo roots rmr and stems rms can be estimated by measuring the quantities of proteins and minerals present in the biomass and on crop metabolic activity de wit et al 2019b relative death rate of stems rdrstb was set to 0 because stems of perennial jujube trees usually did not die during the main growth development period finally the measured soil moisture content was used to calibrate the correction factor of transpiration rate cfet and correction factor for crop water stress sensitivity depnr as well as fine tune initial rooting depth rdi maximum daily increase in rooting depth rri and maximum rooting depth rdmcr 2 6 evaluation of simulated performance coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and normalized root mean square error nrmse were used to evaluate the simulation performance r2 rmse and nrmse expresses the consistency relative error and absolute error between the measured and the simulated values respectively nrmse 10 indicates extremely high precision 10 nrmse 20 indicates high precision 20 nrmse 30 indicates medium precision and nrmse 30 indicates low precision huang et al 2017 in addition the ratio of performance to deviation rpd fleming et al 2017 was determined as additional evaluation of modelling utility for yield e t a and wue if rpd value is more than 2 which means that the model has good prediction ability and considered adequate for analytical purposes fleming et al 2017 their values were calculated by the following equations eq 10 13 10 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 11 r m s e i 1 n y i y i 2 n 12 n r m s e i 1 n y i y i 2 n y i 13 r p d s d r m s e where y i represents simulated value y i represents measured value y i is average value of the measured values and n is the amount of samples sd is the standard deviation of measured values 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration 3 1 1 calibrated main parameters the calibrated main jujube crop parameters are shown in table 1 the specific meaning of the parameters can be found in a previous study bai et al 2019 or de wit and wolf 2010 in this study the measured value of the tdwi parameter was 21 61 kg ha 1 and the field calibrated average value of the span parameters was equal to 50 days the input main soil parameters for the two orchards are also shown in table 1 which are derived from field measurements 3 1 2 calibration performance tagp and lai are important parameters to evaluate the growth dynamics of crops in the phenological development stages soil moisture content sm is a key indicator for evaluating the simulation accuracy of water transport and evapotranspiration de wit et al 2019b the simulated time series of tagp lai and sm based on calibrated data are expressed in fig 5 all three parameters showed good agreement between the measured and simulated values with a r2 of 0 98 for tagp 0 98 for lai and 0 90 for sm respectively the corrected model also indicated extremely high precision all nrmse 10 with rmse of 621 kg ha 1 0 08 m2 m 2 and 0 07 cm3 cm 3 for tagp lai and sm respectively 3 2 model validation and evaluation 3 2 1 performance of the simulated tagp and lai growth dynamics data obtained from four irrigation treatments in 2016 d2 d5 and five in 2017 d1 d5 in the orchard at fc 0 296 cm3 cm 3 were used for validating the performance of the simulated tagp and lai the simulated dynamics of tagp and lai at each irrigation treatment were first verified see table 2 all r2 values of the simulated tagp growth dynamics were above 0 92 indicating that the simulated values well agreed with measured values nrmse ranged from 8 7 to 20 5 with high simulation accuracy and the simulated error was between 629 and 1122 kg ha 1 the calibrated model had also high simulation performance of the lai growth dynamics with r2 above 0 79 nrmse ranging from 8 1 to 17 8 except d5 in 2017 with a simulation error between 0 11 and 0 19 m2 m 2 considering both indicators of consistency and accuracy the simulated performance of d4 and d5 treatments were slightly lower than that of d1 d2 and d3 treatments of the same year the simulated tagp and lai for d1 to d3 showed r2 values greater than 0 94 better agreement nrmse from 8 1 to 16 8 higher accuracy the performance of the simulated tagp and lai decreased slightly when water stress increased the reason may be that wofost model assumes that leaf dying rate may be accelerated due to drought stress and the death rate is calculated by using maximum relative death rate of leaves due to water stress dry matter weight of the leaves and reduction factor for transpiration de wit et al 2019b however the maximum dead rate parameter of leaves was calibrated in d1 treatment close to full irrigation may not express the effect of extreme drought stress on leaf dying rate therefore the simulation accuracy of lai decreased with less irrigation thereby leading to a decrease in the simulation accuracy of photosynthesis rate and tagp 3 2 2 performance of the simulated soil water balance based on observed data from the orchard at fc 0 296 cm3 cm 3 the water balance performance was evaluated using the overall performance of all treatments and the local performance of each treatment for the simulated soil moisture content sm the proposed method showed the positive overall performance with high r2 values of 0 78 and 0 88 with low nrmse values of 6 6 and 5 0 in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig 6 the rmses between the measured and simulated values were also relatively small with 0 015 and 0 012 cm3 cm 3 in 2016 and 2017 respectively the local performance at each irrigation treatment is shown in table 3 r2 of the simulated sm was between 0 29 and 0 75 nrmse range was between 4 1 to 9 4 and the error was between 0 010 and 0 020 cm3 cm 3 among them the consistency and accuracy of d5 treatment in 2017 was lower than that of other treatments the reason may be that the lower lai simulation performance had led to an increase in the simulation error of actual jujube transpiration although the agreement index of sm simulation was slightly lower the local simulation accuracy for different treatments was high with nrmse 10 suppose that calibrating the maximum leaf dying rate parameters in different irrigation treatments is expected to improve the simulation accuracy of lai tagp and sm in addition swap soil water atmosphere plant model kroes and supit 2011 that uses a multi layer method to simulate the flow of water and solutes in the soil is promising to improve the accuracy of soil water balance simulation 3 2 3 performance of the simulated final yield e t a and wue measured final yield e t a and wue for all the treatments in two orchards fc 0 296 and 0 194 cm3 cm 3 respectively were also used to evaluate the simulation performance the scatter plots of the simulated final yield e t a and wue versus measured values are shown in fig 7 the simulated yield e t a and wue well agreed with measured results with r2 ranging from 0 62 to 0 93 nrmse of simulated three indicators was between 3 6 and 10 4 showing high accuracy rmse was equal to 525 kg ha 1 15 7 mm and 0 15 kg m 3 at fc 0 296 cm3 cm 3 641 kg ha 1 25 8 mm and 0 14 kg m 3 at fc 0 194 cm3 cm 3 for final yield e t a and wue respectively showing small absolute error all rpd values were greater than 2 except simulated e t a at fc 0 194 cm3 cm 3 which also showed that the model had good simulated ability and considered adequate for analyzing the effects of irrigation on yield e t a and wue fleming et al 2017 the results also showed that the performance of the simulated yield and e t a at fc 0 296 cm3 cm 3 were higher than that of fc 0 194 cm3 cm 3 with higher r2 and rpd values and with lower rmse and nrmse however the performance of the simulated wue at fc 0 296 cm3 cm 3 was lower than that of fc 0 194 cm3 cm 3 which mainly depended on the error distribution of yield and e t a simulation 3 3 effect of irrigation on simulated evapotranspiration the simulated time series of actual transpiration rate t r a for different irrigation treatments during the growth cycle in 2016 and 2017 are shown in fig 8 in the initial development stage from emergence to around doy 150 the smaller canopy resulted in lower t r a and the soil moisture of different treatments could meet the water requirement for jujube growth therefore the t r a values of all treatments almost overlapped as the canopy leaf area index increased the potential transpiration rate rose up the t r a was determined based on the maximum transpiration rate and taking into account shortage or excess of the moisture content in the root zone van diepen et al 1989 the t r a increased with increasing irrigation volume up to a point under drought stress conditions the t r a in 2016 was higher than that in 2017 in the same treatment responding to the impact of higher temperatures in 2016 on jujube tree transpiration fig 9 showed the change in simulated cumulative jujube evapotranspiration e t a and the maximum evapotranspiration e t m for each treatment in 2016 and 2017 the e t m in 2016 509 mm was higher than that in 2017 457 mm during the growth cycle the reason may be that the average daily temperature in 2016 was almost 0 8 c higher than 2017 resulting in greater evapotranspiration e t a increased with irrigation up to a value where irrigation became excessive in 2016 the e t a gradually increased from d5 to d1 and e t a from d1 treatment was closer to e t m however the curves of d1 and d2 in 2017 almost coincided indicating that e t a of d1 and d2 in 2017 were almost the same irrigation water use efficiency cannot be obviously improved from increasing irrigation volume in d2 to d1 treatment the simulated seasonal e t a and e t a e t m ratios for the different treatments were shown in table 4 in 2016 seasonal e t a for all treatments averaged 462 mm and ranged from 407 to 499 mm the e t a e t m ratio averaged 0 90 and ranged from 0 76 to 0 98 in 2017 average e t a was 415 mm and ranged from 361 to 445 mm the e t a e t m ratios averaged 0 90 and ranged from 0 75 to 0 97 the simulation showed drier soil caused a lower e t a and e t a e t m in the same growing season in short the proposed model well reflected the effects of irrigation and meteorological information on jujube evapotranspiration in different years 3 4 effect of irrigation on yield and wue fig 10 shows the change in the measured yield and wue of d1 to d5 treatments in 2016 and 2017 yield showed a downward trend as the amount of irrigation decreasesd wue also decreased with less irrigation except d2 treatment in 2017 yield and wue of d1 and d2 treatments in both years were not significantly different p 0 05 which showed that increasing the irrigation amount from d2 to d1 can t significantly increase the yield and water use efficiency although the yield of d2 treatment was lower than that of d1 treatment in 2017 the water use efficiency was higher the critical maximum irrigation amount may change dynamically according to the weather and crop growth in different years compared with other treatments d3 treatment had a significant impact on yield p 0 05 the impact of irrigation from d4 to d5 treatments on yield in 2016 was significant p 0 05 but it was not significant in 2017 p 0 05 the reason may be that the evapotranspiration in 2017 was less than that in 2016 resulting in a lower water stress coefficient for jujube trees and the impact of extreme drought on yield was also less than in 2016 the detailed simulated and measured yield and wue are shown in table 5 irrigation significantly affected yields in both years especially from d5 to d2 measured and simulated average yields were higher in 2017 than in 2016 with increment of 1774 kg ha 1 for simulation and 1684 for measurement the main reason may be that the higher average temperature in 2016 resulted in 12 days shorter phenology development time than 2017 especially the shorter fruit development time bai et al 2020 therefore the total biomass accumulation was less and the yield was reduced simulated yields ranged from 3645 to 6873 in 2016 5003 to 8725 kg ha 1 in 2017 showing relatively large variability with irrigation difference which showed almost the same effect of irrigation on the measured yield from 2978 to 7102 kg ha 1 in 2016 and 4378 to 9112 kg ha 1 in 2017 the wue simulated and measured in 2016 was also significantly smaller than in 2017 because evapotranspiration in 2016 was greater and yield was lower simulated wue also showed large variability with irrigation treatments which was consistent with the measured wue in response to irrigation treatments the measured and simulated results also showed that d2 treatment had higher irrigation water utilization efficiency iwue in 2016 and 2017 with a simulated value of 1 53 and 2 11 measured value of 1 57 and 2 22 respectively existing studies have shown that the water use efficiency of dried jujube is 0 41 to 0 67 and the yield is 2474 to 3545 kg ha 1 sun et al 2012 however the highest wue simulated in this study in 2016 and 2017 are 1 38 and 1 96 respectively which is about 3 times of the above values the reason may be that the simulated yield in this study is about 3 times that of the above study other research expresses the wue of fresh jujube fruit yield ranges from 2 55 to 3 69 dai et al 2019 in our study the highest wue of dry jujube fruit yield converted into fresh weight water content 25 is 1 84 in 2016 and 2 61 in 2017 which are slightly lower than the above values the reason may be that the experiments are carried out in xinjiang arid area with higher temperature and radiation which lead to a large amount of evapotranspiration yao et al 2018 therefore the wue value may be lower in addition variety differences and agronomic management such as pruning jin et al 2019 may result in differences in wue in short the model well simulates the effects of irrigation on yield and wue in different years furthermore a full irrigation volume does not necessarily achieve the highest irrigation water use efficiency iwue yield irrigation it is recommended to maintain the balance of yield and iwue in arid and semi arid areas to ensure the sustainable use of agricultural water 3 5 effect of irrigation on simulated drought stress conditions the days and intensity with drought stress were determined according to the ratio of daily actual to maximum transpiration rate simulated fig 11 showed that days with drought stress also increased with decreasing irrigation water each year stress days per treatment in 2016 were higher than the same treatment in 2017 due to the higher evapotranspiration the decline rate of the simulated yield from d1 to d2 in 2016 was higher than that in 2017 due to more days with drought stress the measured yield also showed the same downward trend from 7102 to 6747 kg ha 1 in 2016 and 9112 to 9078 kg ha 1 in 2017 table 5 the model well reflected the effect of drought stress caused by different irrigation treatments on the final yield the occurrence time with drought stress in different treatments are shown in fig 12 early in the growing season doy 150 all treatments suffered from drought stress due to large amounts of bare soil evaporation and insufficient spring irrigation after that the earlier the drought stress occurred with the lower irrigation amount in short the calibrated model responded well the time and days with water stress to irrigation treatments which can provide analytical tools for making irrigation schedules 3 6 uncertainty of model input parameters when running the wofost model for water limited crop growth simulation the uncertainty of input parameters meteorological driving data and the simplification of the simulation process may affect the simulated performance huang et al 2019 the initial crop dry weight tdwi strongly affects the initial growth rate of the crop for fruit crops differences in planting density and tree age may lead to the uncertainty of input tdwi which may affect the growth rate of the initial lai and maximum lai de wit et al 2012 thereby affecting the accuracy of growth development and evapotranspiration simulation although the span parameter that determines leaf senescence rate and time mainly depends on crop genetics this parameter is also affected by factors such as drought nutritional stress diseases and pests and crop management huang et al 2015b however the wofost model cannot simulate the influence of these factors on span curnel et al 2011 in our study span is equal to the measured average value of 50 days however the actual measured span in two orchards are between 40 and 60 days due to drought stress the leaf senescence rate may be accelerated and span should be lower with the increase of the drought stress strength therefore the simulated results for yield and wue when d1 to d5 treatments were set to different span input values with span 60 for d1 55 for d2 50 for d3 45 for d4 and 40 for d5 which was based on calibrated values of different treatments were also tested see fig 13 after adjusting the span values according to the irrigation amount the performance indicators of the simulated yield and wue were improved r2 and rpd of simulated versus measured yields were increased to 0 96 and 4 9 and wue rose to 0 91 and 3 3 respectively rmse and nrmse were decreased to 391 kg ha 1 and 6 3 for yield 0 12 kg m 3 and 8 2 for wue respectively in short when the proposed model is applied to different jujube orchards tdwi parameter should be input a variable values determined by tree age and planting density and span parameter should be set to different calibrated values taking into account water stress strength in addition the remote sensing assimilation method can be recommended to calibrate tdwi and span parameters de wit et al 2012 huang et al 2015a b zhuo et al 2019 3 7 consideration of model improvement in this research the two orchards were pruned into the same tree shape the influence of tree shape on simulation results was not considered in practice different pruning modes affect jujube evapotranspiration rate and yield jin et al 2019 the main reason is that pruning leads to differences in the distribution of canopy light energy interception which in turn leads to differences in the accumulation of biomass in the process of co2 assimilation therefore it is recommended to adjust the extinction coefficient for diffuse visible light kdiftb parameter when the proposed method is applied to differently pruned jujube orchards furthermore the canopy effective leaf area index pai m2 m 2 affects the accuracy of jujube photosynthesis and transpiration calculation the vertical distribution of pai in the crop canopy is dynamically changing during the phenological development period diepenbrock 2000 the p a i of crops is usually concentrated at the bottom of the canopy at the emergence stage the top at the mature stage and evenly distributed at the flowering stage gilardelli et al 2016 quantifying the temporal and spatial distribution of p a i in jujube tree canopy and responding it into the model is expected to improve the simulation accuracy of moisture transfer and jujube tree growth a proposed solution is to refine the canopy to 10 20 depths a cumulative distribution function of kumaraswamy kumaraswamy 1980 can be employed to obtain the pai fraction in different canopies thereby calculating p a i in the different canopy layers and total p a i p a i i can be calculated as eq 14 at different phenology development stages dvs γ and δ values are piecewise fitted as a function of dvs 14 p a i i 1 1 x i γ δ p a i i is the ratio of the intercepted p a i of the i th layer to the p a i of the top canopy x i is the percentage of the canopy layers if the canopy is divided into 20 layers x i 0 05 at the top layer and x i 1 00 at the bottom layer γ and δ can be determined according to the p a i of each layer and the p a i at the top of the canopy actually observed at different growth stages γ and δ values should be set to different values at different phenology development stages 4 conclusions studies have confirmed that the crop growth model has great potential to simulate the growth dynamics of jujube trees under water limited conditions with good agreement 0 92 r2 0 98 for tagp 0 79 r2 0 97 for lai and high accuracy 8 7 nrmse 20 5 for tagp 8 1 nrmse 21 1 for lai the corrected model also expresses high simulation performance for soil water balance process showing high consistency index r2 0 78 and low error nrmse 6 6 between simulated and measured soil moisture content simulated yield e t a and wue in two orchards with different fc soils show good simulation performance with r2 0 86 0 62 0 85 and nrmse 10 5 8 9 4 respectively the model also responds well to the effects of irrigation on evapotranspiration yield wue and water stress conditions of jujube tree in summary the proposed method can accurately simulate seasonal jujube tree growth dynamics and soil water movement and quantitatively describe the impact of irrigation strategies on yield e t a and wue which may become a promising quantitative analysis method for the coupled effects of soil meteorology water management and jujube tree growth and decision making for irrigation strategies the effect of pruning mode on crop parameters and simulation results will be worthy of attention in addition further research on the optimization of crop and soil input parameters at the regional scale based on remote sensing assimilation methods is expected to improve the applicability of the proposed model

10431,jujube is an excellent fruit crop with important economic and ecological benefits in arid regions with the shortage of water resources quantifying the jujube tree growth response to irrigation is significant for improving water use efficiency wue and establishing adequate water management strategies however most studies on water management for jujube tree are based on statistical analysis of field trials to determine irrigation strategies and few studies focus on using crop growth simulation methods to quantitatively analyze the impact of water management on jujube growth and wue therefore the research aimed at evaluating the ability of a calibrated wofsot world food studies model to simulate seasonal jujube tree development dynamics and water movement and to quantitatively describe the influence of different irrigation treatments on yield evapotranspiration and wue simulated seasonal growth dynamics for total dry weight of stems leaves and fruits tagp and leaf area index lai agreed well with field measured values at each irrigation treatment in 2016 and 2017 showing r2 values from 0 92 to 0 98 for tagp 0 79 to 0 97 for lai with high accuracy 8 7 nrmse 20 5 for tagp 8 1 nrmse 21 1 for lai the calibrated model had also high global simulation performance of soil water balance process for all five irrigation treatments showing good agreement r2 0 78 and low

describe the impact of irrigation strategies on jujube tree seasonal growth dynamics yield evapotranspiration and wue which may become a promising quantitative analysis method for the coupled effects of soil meteorology water management and jujube tree growth and decision making for irrigation strategies keywords wofost jujube grow simulation irrigation evapotranspiration water use efficiency 1 introduction jujube zizyphus jujube miller tree is a small deciduous tree of the rhamnaceae family coming from china its fruit is rich in carbohydrates reducing sugar vitamin c soluble and insoluble fibre protein mineral and phenolic compounds li et al 2007 showing important edible and medical value gao et al 2013 ji et al 2017 jujube tree is mainly cultivated in shandong hebei shanxi shaanxi henan provinces and xinjiang uygur autonomous region in china with a production of almost 7 360 000 tons every year among them xinjiang in arid regions accounts for almost 49 of the chinese jujube production national bureau of statistics 2018 because of its easy cultivation early fruit time and superior adaptability to arid environments galindo et al 2016 xinjiang has become the largest jujube planting base because of its abundant light and thermal resources however in this arid regions annual total rainfall is usually less than 100 mm with a large amount of evapotranspiration yao et al 2018 therefore jujube water requirements strongly replies on artificial irrigation analyzing the water requirements of jujube trees and improving water use efficiency are of great significance for increasing the jujube yield and saving water resources in arid regions in the past ten years research on water management of jujube trees has focused on the effects of drip irrigation on root distribution and soil properties ma et al 2013 mulching methods on water consumption and water saving potential sun et al 2012 canopy pruning on water use efficiency chen et al 2016 jin et al 2019 ma et al 2019 deficit irrigation on growth development soil properties and fruit water cui et al 2009 galindo et al 2016 liu et al 2019 vegetation cover on soil moisture and photosynthesis huang et al 2014 pan et al 2017 soil managements on surface runoff and soil water content wang et al 2015a and soil water effects ling et al 2017 water nitrogen coupling effects dai et al 2019 liu et al 2017 irrigation strategy optimization ye et al 2019 soil water and root distribution wang et al 2015b and so on in addition the weighted grey correlation model is used to optimize the water and nitrogen input wang et al 2015b hydrus model has also been tried to model the soil moisture distribution in the jujube root zone wang et al 2011 yao et al 2011 and analyze irrigation strategies wang and ma 2014 however most studies determine the irrigation strategies based on statistical analysis of field experimental data water management is usually only applicable to specific soils and meteorological environments statistical analysis method is not easy to achieve quantitative analysis and mechanism description on the impact of irrigation strategies on jujube growth development yield and water use efficiency wue crop growth models based on physiological and ecological principles use mathematical models to quantify crop growth processes affected by climate soil properties and agronomic management de wit et al 2019a in the past few decades several mature crop models such as wofost world food studies van diepen et al 1989 dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer jones

2003 have been developed and improved these models have their own characteristics and advantages and usually include modules such as phenology development carbon dioxide assimilation photosynthesis production respiration assimilation allocation and soil water cycle which are often used in the water transport simulation and use efficiency evaluation for field crops de wit et al 2019a however crop modelling is mainly developed in the literatures for annual crops including wheat maize rice soybean and cotton jones et al 2017 there are extremely few research reports on using crop growth modelling methods for water migration simulation and use efficiency evaluation of fruit crops crop modelling methods may provide a new means to quantitatively and mechanically analyze the coupled effects of orchard soil meteorology water management and fruit tree growth thus the objectives of this study are as follows i to calibrate crop input parameters of wofost model for water limited jujube growth simulation ii to evaluate the performance of the calibrated wofsot model to simulate seasonal jujube tree growth dynamics and soil water movement iii to quantitatively describe the response of yield actual evapotranspiration t r a and water use efficiency wue to different irrigation treatments 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site the proposed study was carried out in the city of alaer in southwestern china because of the relatively large and concentrated jujube planting areas this region represented ten small agro ecological zones in which around 45 515 ha of jujube orchards these agro ecological zones currently produced almost 16 of the annual national production of dry jujube fruit 2019 alaer statistical yearbook the climate in this area is typical of an arid warm temperate region the annual total precipitation is usually less than 100 mm the frost free period is between 180 and 224 days the average daily sunshine is about 15 h during main jujube growth season the annual average temperature ranges from 10 8 to 12 5 c the annual total evaporation is between 1876 and 2558 mm the soil type is sandy loam 2 2 field experiments design field experiments were conducted in two jujube orchards 81 13 2 e 40 34 45 n in 2016 and 2017 to calibrate water limited wofost simulation for jun jujube cultivar the jujube trees in two orchards were respectively planted in 2005 and 2009 with about 2500 trees per hectare the tree age of the two orchards had reached the age of high yield the pruning with small canopy permanent line shape and other agronomic management without irrigation of the two orchards were almost the same the soil parameters of the two orchards were different the field plots where the jujube tree grew evenly were chosen to carry out experiments the amount of fertilizer used referred to empirical values which usually had high yields in our experiments and local areas 375 kg ha 1 of pure nitrogen n 240 kg ha 1 of phosphorus pentoxide p2o5 and 300 kg ha 1 of potassium oxide k2o were fertilized into the soil in six times with drip irrigation five treatments including full irrigation with 375 mm d1 90 of full irrigation supply 338 mm d2 80 of full irrigation 300 mm d3 70 of full irrigation 263 mm d4 and 60 of full irrigation 225 mm d5 were designed for irrigation experiments during the main growth cycle with three replicates full irrigation amount d1 was the amount of irrigation widely used locally which was assumed to fully meet the growth and development needs of jujube trees during the main growing period the jujube tree was irrigated about 10 times during the main growth circle from early may to late august irrigation was performed separately in doy day of year 131 142 155 164 171 181 189 204 211 and 223 in two years 2 3 field data measurement and observation the data used in the study included calibration and verification data for water limited jujube growth simulation based on wofost model validation data for the evaluation of the simulated final yield e t a and wue in the first orchard fc 0 296 cm3 cm 3 all the following data were measured in the second orchard fc 0 194 cm3 cm 3 only the yield and evapotranspiration data were measured to verify the simulation performance of yield t r a transpiration rate and wue for orchards with different soil properties in each measurement three uniformly growing jujube trees in each irrigation treatment were selected to measure variables the measured and observed data were as follows phenology time emergence the time when the fifth leaf on the bud was unfolded flowering the time when the fruit began to develop and maturity dates the time when the dry weight of the fruit no longer increased were observed in order to calibrate phenology parameters and validate the simulated performance for phenology development time dry weight the dry matter weight of stems leaves and fruits were measured about ten times at each sub field experimental plot to calculate total dry matter weight tagp in order to calibrate conversion of assimilates into biomass and partitioning parameters and validate the simulated performance of aboveground biomass for each plot the stems leaves and fruits of three trees growing evenly were randomly selected and brought back to the laboratory to weigh after drying at 85 c to a constant weight canopy structure parameters leaf area index lai and extinction coefficient for diffuse visible light in the experimental areas were measured approximately ten times to calibrate specific leaf area parameters and get extinction coefficient for diffuse visible light and validate the performance of the simulated lai photosynthesis co2 assimilation parameters the li cor 6400xt meter li cor united states was employed to measure net photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance intercellular co2 concentration and transpiration rate then the light response curve of the net photosynthetic rate at the optimal development temperature was fitted to obtain maximum co2 assimilation rate and light use efficiency parameters in each measurement the photosynthesis parameters of the leaves in the upper middle and lower layers of the canopy 10 leaves in each layer were measured initial total dry weight tdwi initial buds and roots were measured and then summed to calculate tdwi soil moisture content the soil samples were brought back to the laboratory to measure the moisture content by drying method to calibrate water use parameters and validate the performance of the simulated water balance the average soil volume moisture content was measured before and after irrigation based on the soil moisture content per 20 cm 0 100 cm soil moisture content at field capacity and saturation was also measured before emergence yield the dry weight of all the fruits per plot were measured at harvest to evaluate the performance of the simulated yield actual evapotranspiration e t a and water use efficiency wue e t a were calculated by eq 1 dai et al 2019 in order to estimate the performance of the simulated e t a and wue 1 e t a p r u i d r δ s m where p r u i d r and δ s m represent precipitation underground water recharge irrigation amount deep infiltration runoff and differences in soil moisture content measured at emergence and harvest groundwater recharge and runoff in the experimental area hardly occurred so eq 1 was simplified as eq 2 2 e t a p r i d δ s m where deep infiltration d was measured using soil moisture sensors hobo h21 002 united states at 100 cm depth wue was calculated as eq 3 payero et al 2008 3 w u e y e t a where y represents dry fruit yield kg ha 1 and e t a represents actual evapotranspiration mm weather data meteorological data were automatically observed every 15 min using small weather stations observed meteorological data were converted to the meteorological driving data required by wofost model including daily maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation wind speed 2 m actual vapour pressure and precipitation the figs 1 2 and 3 showed the daily maximum and minimum temperatures daily total precipitation and irradiation from april to october in 2016 and 2017 respectively the daily average temperature during the growing period in both years ranged from 10 6 to 29 3 c the daily minimum and maximum temperatures showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing with a relatively large daily temperature difference the average of the maximum temperatures was basically the same in 2016 and 2017 the minimum average temperature in 2016 was 1 5 c higher than that of 2017 the study area was located on the edge of the desert with very little rainfall of less than 100 mm per year the water demand for jujube trees depended mainly on irrigation rainfall mainly occurred in summer the daily total radiation in the study area was strong and showed large fluctuations see fig 3 the average daily radiation from april to october in 2017 was also significantly higher than in 2016 which was usually helpful for photosynthesis 2 4 description of wofost model wofost is a mechanistic model that describes crop growth processes of phenology development light interception photosynthesis organs formation and development transpiration growth and maintenance respiration and partitioning of assimilates into different organs it also explains how these processes are affected by soil and meteorological conditions a schematic diagram of the links between model components in wofost is shown in fig 4 de wit et al 2019a specific mathematical descriptions and details can be referenced to existing studies de wit et al 2019a 2019b supit et al 1994 wofost describes the basic physiological processes of crops from emergence to maturity according to crop characteristics and environmental conditions weather and astro modules determine the intercepted light and phenological development stages the model simulates the dry matter accumulation of the plants under the influence of solar radiation temperature precipitation and crop characteristics in a day s step the total assimilation rate of the canopy is the basis of dry matter production which is calculated from the absorbed solar radiant energy and the effective leaf area a part of the assimilation product carbohydrates are consumed to maintain respiration the rest is converted to structural dry matter and some dry matter is consumed by growth respiration during the conversion process the produced dry matter is distributed in roots stems leaves and storage organs the partition coefficient varies with developmental stages dvs wofost calculates crop transpiration soil evaporation and open water evaporation separately transpiration is included in the wofost model and soil and water evaporation is entrusted to the soil moisture balance model de wit et al 2019b potential evapotranspiration of a crop e t p is the sum of potential transpiration t p and soil evaporation e p see eq 4 e t p is usually calculated referring to the penman monteith formula however the potential evapotranspiration of some crops may be higher than that calculated by penman monteith formula penman evapotranspiration should be multiplied by the crop factor therefore a correction factor the so called crop factor cfet is introduced into the model to account for this effect thereby calculating the maximum evapotranspiration of crops van diepen et al 1989 e t m see eq 5 the maximum transpiration rate t m can be calculated by eq 6 when the water supply is sufficient the actual transpiration rate t a is equal to t m payero et al 2008 when the water supply is insufficient the reduction factor r w s is used to modify t m to calculate t a see eq 7 the calculation of r w s is shown in eq 8 and 9 then the actual evapotranspiration e t a can be obtained 4 e t p t p e p 5 e t m c f e t e t p 6 t m e t m 1 e k g b l a i 7 t a r w s t m 8 r w s θ t θ w p θ w s θ w p 9 θ w s 1 ρ θ f c θ w p θ w p where t a represents the actual transpiration rate r w s is the reduction coefficient of water stress on transpiration rate t m is the maximum transpiration rate e t p is calculated according to the penman monteith formula cfet is the crop coefficient generally fixed at 1 value ranges from 0 9 to 1 2 k g b represents the extinction coefficient θ t represents soil moisture content sm θ w s represents sm at saturation θ w p represents the withered humidity ρ is the soil water consumption coefficient and θ f c is the field capacity 2 5 calibration of wofost model the initial input parameters of the wofost model mainly include meteorological soil and crop parameters in the research the meteorological parameters directly use the observed values of the weather station the soil parameters directly use the field measured values mainly including amtab soil water retention smw soil moisture content at wilting point smfcf soil moisture content at field capacity sm0 soil moisture content at saturation contab hydraulic conductivity k0 hydraulic conductivity of saturated soil sope maximum percolation rate root zone and ksub maximum percolation rate subsoil jujube crop parameters were calibrated for the water limited growth simulation based on full irrigation experiments d1 treatment in 2016 referring to an existing study todorovic et al 2009 the d2 d5 in 2016 and d1 d5 in 2017 experimental data were used to validate the simulation performance the calibration details of the wofost model was suggested in de wit and wolf de wit and wolf 2010 the detailed calibrated process for jujube growth simulation based on previous research was as follows first phenology development dates including emergence flowering and maturity dates were firstly calibrated on basis of accumulated effective temperature sum van diepen et al 1989 tbasem expressed the minimum threshold temperature at which jujube trees began to develop which was equal to 10 c sun 2019 teffmx expressed the maximum effective temperature at emergence ranging from 18 to 32 c given by wofost the observation results showed that jujube trees were sprouting normally so teffmx was set to 30 c in this study referring to the default value of most crops from wofost model temperature sum for emergence tsumem from emergence to flowering tsum1 and from flowering to maturity tsum2 were calibrated by calculating accumulated effective temperature sum and observing the dates at emergence flowering and maturity in 2016 and 2017 daily increase in temperature sum dtsmtb which is a function of average effective temperature can be calculated by the maximum suitable temperature 35 5 c wang et al 2002 and minimum development temperature 10 c sun 2019 tdwi was equal to the field measured value second for laiem lai at emergence the measured maximum value in all field experiments was less than 0 004 ha ha 1 so laiem was set to 0 004 ha ha 1 for calibrating maximum relative increase in lai rgrlai the measured maximum value was less than 0 05 so rgrlai was set to 0 05 specific leaf area slatb was calibrated based on the measured values and simulated lai and tagp span life span of leaves growing was corrected based on lai measured during the late growing season third for the calibration of co2 assimilation parameters the light response curves were fitted at the optimal low limit temperature of 19 5 c and the upper limit temperature of 35 5 c to obtain the initial maximum co2 assimilation rate amaxtb and light use efficiency for single leaf efftb then the extinction coefficient for diffuse visible light kdiftb amaxtb and efftb were corrected by the measured and simulated tagp and lai fourth the conversion of assimilates into biomass including efficiency of conversion into leaves cvl storage organs cvo roots cvr and stems cvs express growth respiration dry matter partitioning parameters including fraction of above ground dry matter to stems frtb storage organs fotb and leaves fltb which all describe the fraction as a function of the development stage these parameters were calibrated using measured and simulated dry matter weights of aboveground organs the maintenance respiration costs such as relative increase in respiration rate per 10 c temperature increase q10 relative maintenance respiration rate of leaves rml storage organs rmo roots rmr and stems rms can be estimated by measuring the quantities of proteins and minerals present in the biomass and on crop metabolic activity de wit et al 2019b relative death rate of stems rdrstb was set to 0 because stems of perennial jujube trees usually did not die during the main growth development period finally the measured soil moisture content was used to calibrate the correction factor of transpiration rate cfet and correction factor for crop water stress sensitivity depnr as well as fine tune initial rooting depth rdi maximum daily increase in rooting depth rri and maximum rooting depth rdmcr 2 6 evaluation of simulated performance coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and normalized root mean square error nrmse were used to evaluate the simulation performance r2 rmse and nrmse expresses the consistency relative error and absolute error between the measured and the simulated values respectively nrmse 10 indicates extremely high precision 10 nrmse 20 indicates high precision 20 nrmse 30 indicates medium precision and nrmse 30 indicates low precision huang et al 2017 in addition the ratio of performance to deviation rpd fleming et al 2017 was determined as additional evaluation of modelling utility for yield e t a and wue if rpd value is more than 2 which means that the model has good prediction ability and considered adequate for analytical purposes fleming et al 2017 their values were calculated by the following equations eq 10 13 10 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 11 r m s e i 1 n y i y i 2 n 12 n r m s e i 1 n y i y i

of measured values 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration 3 1 1 calibrated main parameters the calibrated main jujube crop parameters are shown in table 1 the specific meaning of the parameters can be found in a previous study bai et al 2019 or de wit and wolf 2010 in this study the measured value of the tdwi parameter was 21 61 kg ha 1 and the field calibrated average value of the span parameters was equal to 50 days the input main soil parameters for the two orchards are also shown in table 1 which are derived from field measurements 3 1 2 calibration performance tagp and lai are important parameters to evaluate the growth dynamics of crops in the phenological development stages soil moisture content sm is a key indicator for evaluating the simulation accuracy of water transport and evapotranspiration de wit et al 2019b the simulated time series of tagp lai and sm based on calibrated data are expressed in fig 5 all three parameters showed good agreement between the measured and simulated values with a r2 of 0 98 for tagp 0 98 for lai and 0 90 for sm respectively the corrected model also indicated extremely high precision all nrmse 10 with rmse of 621 kg ha 1 0 08 m2 m 2 and 0 07 cm3 cm 3 for tagp lai and sm respectively 3 2 model validation and evaluation 3 2 1 performance of the simulated tagp and lai growth dynamics data obtained from four irrigation treatments in 2016 d2 d5 and five in 2017 d1 d5 in the orchard at fc 0 296 cm3 cm 3 were used for validating the performance of the simulated tagp and lai the simulated dynamics of tagp and lai at each irrigation treatment were first verified see table 2 all r2 values of the simulated tagp growth dynamics were above 0 92 indicating that the simulated values well agreed with measured values nrmse ranged from 8 7 to 20 5 with high simulation accuracy and the simulated error was between 629 and 1122 kg ha 1 the calibrated model had also high simulation performance of the lai growth dynamics with r2 above 0 79 nrmse ranging from 8 1 to 17 8 except d5 in 2017 with a simulation error between 0 11 and 0 19 m2 m 2 considering both indicators of consistency and accuracy the simulated performance of d4 and d5 treatments were slightly lower than that of d1 d2 and d3 treatments of the same year the simulated tagp and lai for d1 to d3 showed r2 values greater than 0 94 better agreement nrmse from 8 1 to 16 8 higher accuracy the performance of the simulated tagp and lai decreased slightly when water stress increased the reason may be that wofost model assumes that leaf dying rate may be accelerated due to drought stress and the death rate is calculated by using maximum relative death rate of leaves due to water stress dry matter weight of the leaves and reduction factor for transpiration de wit et al 2019b however the maximum dead rate parameter of leaves was calibrated in d1 treatment close to full irrigation may not express the effect of extreme drought stress on leaf dying rate therefore the simulation accuracy of lai decreased with less irrigation thereby leading to a decrease in the simulation accuracy of photosynthesis rate and tagp 3 2 2 performance of the simulated soil water balance based on observed data from the orchard at fc 0 296 cm3 cm 3 the water balance performance was evaluated using the overall performance of all treatments and the local performance of each treatment for the simulated soil moisture content sm the proposed method showed the positive overall performance with high r2 values of 0 78 and 0 88 with low nrmse values of 6 6 and 5 0 in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig 6 the rmses between the measured and simulated values were also relatively small with 0 015 and 0 012 cm3 cm 3 in 2016 and 2017 respectively the local performance at each irrigation treatment is shown in table 3 r2 of the simulated sm was between 0 29 and 0 75 nrmse range was between 4 1 to 9 4 and the error was between 0 010 and 0 020 cm3 cm 3 among them the consistency and accuracy of d5 treatment in 2017 was lower than that of other treatments the reason may be that the lower lai simulation performance had led to an increase in the simulation error of actual jujube transpiration although the agreement index of sm simulation was slightly lower the local simulation accuracy for different treatments was high with nrmse 10 suppose that calibrating the maximum leaf dying rate parameters in different irrigation treatments is expected to improve the simulation accuracy of lai tagp and sm in addition swap soil water atmosphere plant model kroes and supit 2011 that uses a multi layer method to simulate the flow of water and solutes in the soil is promising to improve the accuracy of soil water balance simulation 3 2 3 performance of the simulated final yield e t a and wue measured final yield e t a and wue for all the treatments in two orchards fc 0 296 and 0 194 cm3 cm 3 respectively were also used to evaluate the simulation performance the scatter plots of the simulated final yield e t a and wue versus measured values are shown in fig 7 the simulated yield e t a and wue well agreed with measured results with r2 ranging from 0 62 to 0 93 nrmse of simulated three indicators was between 3 6 and 10 4 showing high accuracy rmse was equal to 525 kg ha 1 15 7 mm and 0 15 kg m 3 at fc 0 296 cm3 cm 3 641 kg ha 1 25 8 mm and 0 14 kg m 3 at fc 0 194 cm3 cm 3 for final yield e t a and wue respectively showing small absolute error all rpd values were greater than 2 except simulated e t a at fc 0 194 cm3 cm 3 which also showed that the model had good simulated ability and considered adequate for analyzing the effects of irrigation on yield e t a and wue fleming et al 2017 the results also showed that the performance of the simulated yield and e t a at fc 0 296 cm3 cm 3 were higher than that of fc 0 194 cm3 cm 3 with higher r2 and rpd values and with lower rmse and nrmse however the performance of the simulated wue at fc 0 296 cm3 cm 3 was lower than that of fc 0 194 cm3 cm 3 which mainly depended on the error distribution of yield and e t a simulation 3 3 effect of irrigation on simulated evapotranspiration the simulated time series of actual transpiration rate t r a for different irrigation treatments during the growth cycle in 2016 and 2017 are shown in fig 8 in the initial development stage from emergence to around doy 150 the smaller canopy resulted in lower t r a and the soil moisture of different treatments could meet the water requirement for jujube growth therefore the t r a values of all treatments almost overlapped as the canopy leaf area index increased the potential transpiration rate rose up the t r a was determined based on the maximum transpiration rate and taking into account shortage or excess of the moisture content in the root zone van diepen et al 1989 the t r a increased with increasing irrigation volume up to a point under drought stress conditions the t r a in 2016 was higher than that in 2017 in the same treatment responding to the impact of higher temperatures in 2016 on jujube tree transpiration fig 9 showed the change in simulated cumulative jujube evapotranspiration e t a and the maximum evapotranspiration e t m for each treatment in 2016 and 2017 the e t m in 2016 509 mm was higher than that in 2017 457 mm during the growth cycle the reason may be that the average daily temperature in 2016 was almost 0 8 c higher than 2017 resulting in greater evapotranspiration e t a increased with irrigation up to a value where irrigation became excessive in 2016 the e t a gradually increased from d5 to d1 and e t a from d1 treatment was closer to e t m however the curves of d1 and d2 in 2017 almost coincided indicating that e t a of d1 and d2 in 2017 were almost the same irrigation water use efficiency cannot be obviously improved from increasing irrigation volume in d2 to d1 treatment the simulated seasonal e t a and e t a e t m ratios for the different treatments were shown in table 4 in 2016 seasonal e t a for all treatments averaged 462 mm and ranged from 407 to 499 mm the e t a e t m ratio averaged 0 90 and ranged from 0 76 to 0 98 in 2017 average e t a was 415 mm and ranged from 361 to 445 mm the e t a e t m ratios averaged 0 90 and ranged from 0 75 to 0 97 the simulation showed drier soil caused a lower e t a and e t a e t m in the same growing season in short the proposed model well reflected the effects of irrigation and meteorological information on jujube evapotranspiration in different years 3 4 effect of irrigation on yield and wue fig 10 shows the change in the measured yield and wue of d1 to d5 treatments in 2016 and 2017 yield showed a downward trend as the amount of irrigation decreasesd wue also decreased with less irrigation except d2 treatment in 2017 yield and wue of d1 and d2 treatments in both years were not significantly different p 0 05 which showed that increasing the irrigation amount from d2 to d1 can t significantly increase the yield and water use efficiency although the yield of d2 treatment was lower than that of d1 treatment in 2017 the water use efficiency was higher the critical maximum irrigation amount may change dynamically according to the weather and crop growth in different years compared with other treatments d3 treatment had a significant impact on yield p 0 05 the impact of irrigation from d4 to d5 treatments on yield in 2016 was significant p 0 05 but it was not significant in 2017 p 0 05 the reason may be that the evapotranspiration in 2017 was less than that in 2016 resulting in a lower water stress coefficient for jujube trees and the impact of extreme drought on yield was also less than in 2016 the detailed simulated and measured yield and wue are shown in table 5 irrigation significantly affected yields in both years especially from d5 to d2 measured and simulated average yields were higher in 2017 than in 2016 with increment of 1774 kg ha 1 for simulation and 1684 for measurement the main reason may be that the higher average temperature in 2016 resulted in 12 days shorter phenology development time than 2017 especially the shorter fruit development time bai et al 2020 therefore the total biomass accumulation was less and the yield was reduced simulated yields ranged from 3645 to 6873 in 2016 5003 to 8725 kg ha 1 in 2017 showing relatively large variability with irrigation difference which showed almost the same effect of irrigation on the measured yield from 2978 to 7102 kg ha 1 in 2016 and 4378 to 9112 kg ha 1 in 2017 the wue simulated and measured in 2016 was also significantly smaller than in 2017 because evapotranspiration in 2016 was greater and yield was lower simulated wue also showed large variability with irrigation treatments which was consistent with the measured wue in response to irrigation treatments the measured and simulated results also showed that d2 treatment had higher irrigation water utilization efficiency iwue in 2016 and 2017 with a simulated value of 1 53 and 2 11 measured value of 1 57 and 2 22 respectively existing studies have shown that the water use efficiency of dried jujube is 0 41 to 0 67 and the yield is 2474 to 3545 kg ha 1 sun et al 2012 however the highest wue simulated in this study in 2016 and 2017 are 1 38 and 1 96 respectively which is about 3 times of the above values the reason may be that the simulated yield in this study is about 3 times that of the above study other research expresses the wue of fresh jujube fruit yield ranges from 2 55 to 3 69 dai et al 2019 in our study the highest wue of dry jujube fruit yield converted into fresh weight water content 25 is 1 84 in 2016 and 2 61 in 2017 which are slightly lower than the above values the reason may be that the experiments are carried out in xinjiang arid area with higher temperature and radiation which lead to a large amount of evapotranspiration yao et al 2018 therefore the wue value may be lower in addition variety differences and agronomic management such as pruning jin et al 2019 may result in differences in wue in short the model well simulates the effects of irrigation on yield and wue in different years furthermore a full irrigation volume does not necessarily achieve the highest irrigation water use efficiency iwue yield irrigation it is recommended to maintain the balance of yield and iwue in arid and semi arid areas to ensure the sustainable use of agricultural water 3 5 effect of irrigation on simulated drought stress conditions the days and intensity with drought stress were determined according to the ratio of daily actual to maximum transpiration rate simulated fig 11 showed that days with drought stress also increased with decreasing irrigation water each year stress days per treatment in 2016 were higher than the same treatment in 2017 due to the higher evapotranspiration the decline rate of the simulated yield from d1 to d2 in 2016 was higher than that in 2017 due to more days with drought stress the measured yield also showed the same downward trend from 7102 to 6747 kg ha 1 in 2016 and 9112 to 9078 kg ha 1 in 2017 table 5 the model well reflected the effect of drought stress caused by different irrigation treatments on the final yield the occurrence time with drought stress in different treatments are shown in fig 12 early in the growing season doy 150 all treatments suffered from drought stress due to large amounts of bare soil evaporation and insufficient spring irrigation after that the earlier the drought stress occurred with the lower irrigation amount in short the calibrated model responded well the time and days with water stress to irrigation treatments which can provide analytical tools for making irrigation schedules 3 6 uncertainty of model input parameters when running the wofost model for water limited crop growth simulation the uncertainty of input parameters meteorological driving data and the simplification of the simulation process may affect the simulated performance huang et al 2019 the initial crop dry weight tdwi strongly affects the initial growth rate of the crop for fruit crops differences in planting density and tree age may lead to the uncertainty of input tdwi which may affect the growth rate of the initial lai and maximum lai de wit et al 2012 thereby affecting the accuracy of growth development and evapotranspiration simulation although the span parameter that determines leaf senescence rate and time mainly depends on crop genetics this parameter is also affected by factors such as drought nutritional stress diseases and pests and crop management huang et al 2015b however the wofost model cannot simulate the influence of these factors on span curnel et al 2011 in our study span is equal to the measured average value of 50 days however the actual measured span in two orchards are between 40 and 60 days due to drought stress the leaf senescence rate may be accelerated and span should be lower with the increase of the drought stress strength therefore the simulated results for yield and wue when d1 to d5 treatments were set to different span input values with span 60 for d1 55 for d2 50 for d3 45 for d4 and 40 for d5 which was based on calibrated values of different treatments were also tested see fig 13 after adjusting the span values according to the irrigation amount the performance indicators of the simulated yield and wue were improved r2 and rpd of simulated versus measured yields were increased to 0 96 and 4 9 and wue rose to 0 91 and 3 3 respectively rmse and nrmse were decreased to 391 kg ha 1 and 6 3 for yield 0 12 kg m 3 and 8 2 for wue respectively in short when the proposed model is applied to different jujube orchards tdwi parameter should be input a variable values determined by tree age and planting density and span parameter should be set to different calibrated values taking into account water stress strength in addition the remote sensing assimilation method can be recommended to calibrate tdwi and span parameters de wit et al 2012 huang et al 2015a b zhuo et al 2019 3 7 consideration of model improvement in this research the two orchards were pruned into the same tree shape the influence of tree shape on simulation results was not considered in practice different pruning modes affect jujube evapotranspiration rate and yield jin et al 2019 the main reason is that pruning leads to differences in the distribution of canopy light energy interception which in turn leads to differences in the accumulation of biomass in the process of co2 assimilation therefore it is recommended to adjust the extinction coefficient for diffuse visible light kdiftb parameter when the proposed method is applied to differently pruned jujube orchards furthermore the canopy effective leaf area index pai m2 m 2 affects the accuracy of jujube photosynthesis and transpiration calculation the vertical distribution of pai in the crop canopy is dynamically changing during the phenological development period diepenbrock 2000 the p a i of crops is usually concentrated at the bottom of the canopy at the emergence stage the top at the mature stage and evenly distributed at the flowering stage gilardelli et al 2016 quantifying the temporal and spatial distribution of p a i in jujube tree canopy and responding it into the model is expected to improve the simulation accuracy of moisture transfer and jujube tree growth a proposed solution is to refine the canopy to 10 20 depths a cumulative distribution function of kumaraswamy kumaraswamy 1980 can be employed to obtain the pai fraction in different canopies thereby calculating p a i in the different canopy layers and total p a i p a i i can be calculated as eq 14 at different phenology development stages dvs γ and δ values are piecewise fitted as a function of dvs 14 p a i i 1 1 x i γ δ p a i i is the ratio of the intercepted p a i of the i th layer to the p a i of the top canopy x i is the percentage of the canopy layers if the canopy is divided into 20 layers x i 0 05 at the top layer and x i 1 00 at the bottom layer γ and δ can be determined according to the p a i of each layer and the p a i at the top of the canopy actually observed at different growth stages γ and δ values should be set to different values at different phenology development stages 4 conclusions studies have confirmed that the crop growth model has great potential to simulate the growth dynamics of jujube trees under water limited conditions with good agreement 0 92 r2 0 98 for tagp 0 79 r2 0 97 for lai and high accuracy 8 7 nrmse 20 5 for tagp 8 1 nrmse 21 1 for lai the corrected model also expresses high simulation performance for soil water balance process showing high consistency index r2 0 78 and low error nrmse 6 6 between simulated and measured soil moisture content simulated yield e t a and wue in two orchards with different fc soils show good simulation performance with r2 0 86 0 62 0 85 and nrmse 10 5 8 9 4 respectively the model also responds well to the effects of irrigation on evapotranspiration yield wue and water stress conditions of jujube tree in summary the proposed method can accurately simulate seasonal jujube tree growth dynamics and soil water movement and quantitatively describe the impact of irrigation strategies on yield e t a and wue which may become a promising quantitative analysis method for the coupled effects of soil meteorology water management and jujube tree growth and decision making for irrigation strategies the effect of pruning mode on crop parameters and simulation results will be worthy of attention in addition further research on the optimization of crop and soil input parameters at the regional scale based on remote sensing assimilation methods is expected to improve the applicability of the proposed model

10432,the frequency and severity of droughts and heat stresses are becoming a threat to crop production and food security in arid and semi arid regions worldwide to ameliorate both stresses simultaneously micro sprinkler systems are being proposed and their performance is investigated here for gray jujube trees planted in an arid region the experiments focused on the effects of different levels of micro sprinkler irrigation amounts on air temperature relative humidity vapor pressure deficit leaf level physiological processes yield and quality of the fruit the experiment was carried out over a two year period in a jujube orchard consisting of three micro sprinkler irrigation levels that spray water at 2 mm d 1 t1 4 mm d 1 t2 6 mm d 1 t3 and the control at the flowering to fruit set stage within the canopy volume the application of micro sprinkler cooling system was shown to decrease air temperature by 1 to 3 and enhance air relative humidity by 11 17 when compared with the control the associated decrease in air temperature and increases in air relative humidity reduced the vapor pressure deficit vpd from 3 kpa to 2 kpa the measured vpd reduction across treatments explained much of the measured differences in physiological responses net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate stomatal conductance and water use efficiency at the leaf scale the aforementioned physiological improvements increased the quantity and quality of the jujube fruit the study adds to the growing literature that supports the use of micro sprinklers as a cooling system to ameliorate the negative effects of droughts and heat under extreme heat stress conditions keywords evaporative cooling micro sprinkler irrigation physiological responses vapor pressure deficit yield 1 introduction that extreme events such as drought and heat stresses are increasing in severity and frequency as measured by the number and anomalies above long term mean values is not in dispute diffenbaugh et al 2017 ortiz et al 2008 however tracking the consequences of such increases on crop production and quality and ways to ameliorate adverse consequences remains a subject of debate and active research from a micro climatic perspective increases in air temperature ta leads to increases in the saturation vapor pressure es as predicted by the clausius clayperon equation elevated es increases the vapor pressure deficit vpd and leads to reductions in leaf level stomatal conductance kaushal and wani 2016 oren et al 1999 such reductions in stomatal conductance reduce photosynthesis and subsequent crop productivity as well as carbohydrate mainly sucrose production and loading likewise droughts undoubtedly cause negative impacts on yield of many crops such as maize wheat rice and soybean fahad et al 2017 siebers et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 when coupled with temperature stresses drought will create a cascading set of interactions on plant growth that override much of the positive impacts of projected elevated atmospheric co2 thereby diminishing growth and yield of plants hatfield and prueger 2011 siebers et al 2017 evaporative cooling can be effective in reducing elevated ta stresses and ameliorating drought stresses on crops micro sprinkler cooling systems scheduled to apply water near the soil surface during the warmest period of plant growth can be used to enhance evaporative cooling caravia et al 2017 deligios et al 2019 evans 2004 the amounts of water applied can be small as it is not intended to wet the rooting zone but to increase evaporative cooling and reduce vpd of the microclimate around crops the effectiveness of such cooling systems has been explored in many studies worldwide and for many crop types including grapes caravia et al 2017 apples evans 2004 green et al 2014 iglesias et al 2005 mupambi et al 2017 winter wheat liu and kang 2006a and strawberries chesness and braud 1970 gude et al 2018 broadly the aforementioned studies support the overall benefits of micro sprinkler cooling with some exceptions caravia et al 2017 indicated that a sprinkler cooling system can effectively reduce the canopy air temperature of vines by 2 5 c when ta in a control exceeded 38 c other studies also report that evaporative cooling is a supplementary irrigation strategy and can contribute to improved yield and quality of crops for example liu and kang 2006a reported that the yield of winter wheat under micro sprinkler irrigation was improved by some 290 kg ha 1 when compared to that of non sprinkled field moreover a 3 year study iglesias et al 2005 found that fruit firmness fruit size and soluble solid were all increased when using micro sprinkler irrigation however other studies parchomchuk and meheriuk 1996 showed that cooling reduced soluble solids concentration and reported no effects on fruit size firmness and redness therefore the combined benefits of such evaporative cooling on yield and quality of different crops planted across differing climatic regimes is needed to inform future food and water management issues and motivates the work here jujube ziziphus jujube mill originated in china and has a long history of cultivation gao et al 2013 liu et al 2014 liu et al 2019a the crop is used to harvest fruits that have medicinal and nutritional value gao et al 2013 jiang et al 2007 li et al 2007 jujube is commonly grown in semi arid and arid regions where drought and heat stresses are likely to intensify more than 30 of china s jujube production originates in the xinjiang province where the output of jujube reached 3 6 million tons in 2018 statistics bureau of xinjiang uygur autonomous region 2019 located in the hinterland of eurasia xinjiang is about 2 200 kilometers from the sea and experiences minor rainfall high evaporative demand and high ta liu et al 2019b zhang et al 2012 due to the unique natural conditions in xinjiang where the maximum air temperatures and annual rainfall amount are 41 and 150 mm respectively heat and drought are undoubtedly the two most important stresses in the growth and productivity of jujube hence jujube production under such arid conditions make it ideal for exploring the benefits of micro sprinkler evaporative cooling on the quality and quantity of fruits the compass of this work using gray jujube trees as a case study the objectives are to investigate 1 the changes in ta air relative humidity and vpd when applying micro sprinkler irrigation with differing amounts of water 2 the effects of evaporative cooling on daily changes in net leaf photosynthetic rate p n transpiration rate t r and stomatal conductance g s at the leaf scale during the flowering to fruit stage 3 the responses of both crop yield and fruit quality to such water management 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was carried out over a 2 year period april 2017 to november 2018 in the oasis region latitude 37 47 n longitude 84 08 e altitude 1307 m located in qiemo county in south xinjiang province northwest of china the site has a continental arid climate with mean annual precipitation and potential evaporation measured using a standard pan of 18 mm and 2824 mm respectively the soil bulk density on a mass basis field capacity and soil wilting coefficient in the top 80 cm are approximately 1 5 g cm 3 0 22 cm3 cm 3 and 0 04 cm3 cm 3 respectively the soil is classified as sand usda and is composed of 87 sand 9 silt and 4 clay the water table is below 2 2 m and does not contribute to any natural replenishment of the rooting zone the orchard was established in 2010 where gray jujube trees zizyphus jujuba mill were planted 1 0 m apart along rows spaced 3 0 m apart the 2 m tall gray jujube were irrigated by a 16 mm flexible drip tube installed 0 4 m away from the tree rows 0 8 m between drip tapes on the soil surface the emitters on the drip tape were spaced 0 3 m apart and the drip discharge was 3 2 l h 1 manufacturer stated coefficient of variation 5 the jujube rooting system is mainly distributed within the top 60 cm soil layer the drip irrigation system delivers 50 mm of water depth when the mean soil moisture in a control plot later described and labeled ck was lower than 60 of the field capacity the total drip irrigation amounts were 600 mm in 2017 and 550 mm in 2018 for all experimental plots 2 2 experimental design the aforementioned drip irrigation system was complemented by a micro sprinkler cooling system operating from 21 june to 10 july 20 days in both years during this period daily potential evaporation was 15 mm and coincides with the flowering to fruit set stage of jujube trees to test the effectiveness of the micro sprinkler cooling system an experimental design consisting of 12 plots within the gray jujube orchard is implemented each plot was 500 m2 10 m wide and 50 m long with 6 0 m spacing between them fig 1 all micro sprinkler irrigation treatments were replicated three times with the experimental plots arranged in a completely randomized design that include four treatments these four treatments were 1 2 mm d 1 t1 2 with 4 mm d 1 t2 3 with 6 mm d 1 t3 and 4 without micro sprinkler irrigation ck and the duration of three micro sprinkler irrigation treatments was 10 min 20 min and 30 min respectively the micro sprinklers were installed in the middle of the gray jujube trees within the plant row and their installation height was 0 5 m above the soil surface each micro sprinkler has a flow rate of 18 l h 1 at 0 2 mpa operating pressure and a wetted diameter of about 1 4 m operating twice a day 12 00 and 18 00 with half of the daily irrigation amount all treatments were given identical applications of fertilization pruning and insecticides 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 temperature and relative humidity the air temperature and relative humidity were recorded every half hour by a digital temperature humidity recorder sensor lite5032p rh fourtec israel the sensors were installed within ventilated shelters so as to minimize direct radiative load at different heights above the ground 25 cm 75 cm 125 cm and 175 cm the mean mean maximum and mean minimum of air temperature and relative humidity were calculated during micro sprinkler irrigation events and are presented in table 1 for completeness 2 3 2 leaf gas exchange the p n t r and gs were measured using a photosynthesis system li 6400xt li cor usa during the micro sprinkler irrigation treatment three sunlit and healthy leaves of three representative gray jujube trees under the same treatment were randomly selected for gas exchange measurements the leaves were measured during gmt 09 00 am 20 00 pm july 1 in both 2017 and 2018 including before 11 00 and 17 00 and after 13 00 and 19 00 the application of micro sprinkler irrigation events 2 3 3 fruit yield and quality three trees per replica per treatment were harvested by hand and weighed using an electronic scale in november sixty fruits per replicate were randomly sampled and the single fruit weight was measured the quality of gray jujube as quantified by its acidity soluble solids sugar and vitamin content were measured the sugar content was determined with the lane eynon s method the acid content was measured with a naoh titration method the vitamin c content was measured using the 2 6 dichloroindophenol titration method and the soluble solids were measured with a direct reading in a abbe refractometer 2waj shanghai csoif co ltd china these analyses were conducted in triplicate for each treatment 2 4 statistical analysis the statistical product and service solutions spss 20 0 international business machines corporation ibm usa was used to analyze the data the differences among treatments were compared using one way analyses of variance anova and a significant difference test duncan s multiple range test at a significance level of p0 05 was used 3 result 3 1 air temperature and relative humidity changes as shown in table 1 the ta and relative humidity are statistically different between the treatments at all heights within the canopy volume over the entire experiment duration the application of the micro sprinkler cooling system reduced air temperature and enhanced relative humidity among the treatments especially within the lower canopy air space 0 100 cm compared with the mean air temperature under ck treatment for all heights air temperatures for t1 t2 and t3 treatments declined by 2 3 2 6 and 3 2 in 2017 respectively and 1 2 2 1 and 1 8 in 2018 in addition results in 2017 and 2018 indicated the micro sprinkler irrigation increased the mean relative humidity about 11 17 at all heights in the following further details about the effects of water additions on each level above the soil surface are discussed at the 50 cm height mean air temperature for t1 t2 and t3 treatment was lower than ck by 2 9 3 7 and 4 4 in 2017 respectively and 1 7 3 7 and 5 0 in 2018 respectively moreover the application of the micro sprinkler cooling system significantly increased the mean air relative humidity and values of t1 t2 and t3 were higher by 9 12 9 4 10 1 and 7 5 8 1 than ck respectively at the 100 cm height results from the years 2017 and 2018 indicated that using the micro sprinkler cooling system lead to declining mean maximum air temperature although only t3 had significant difference with ck in addition the application of micro sprinkler cooling system significantly increased mean minimum relative humidity in 2017 at the 150 cm height the micro sprinkler irrigation still had some minor effect on the mean air temperature but all treatments did not experience significant differences in 2018 while there were significant differences between t1 t2 and ck in 2017 however no significant difference in mean relative humidity between treatments were found both in 2017 and 2018 at the 200 cm height the application of micro sprinkler cooling system reduced air temperature and enhanced air relative humidity but those alterations were not statistically significant different between treatments the air temperature and relative humidity of treatments were significantly different between the three periods labelled before during and after the micro sprinkler irrigation table 2 for the before period there was no significant differences in air temperature and relative humidity between all treatments in both years furthermore mean air temperature in 2018 were lower more than those in 2017 before the micro sprinkler irrigation however mean air temperature decreased by 0 1 1 7 and relative humidity was enhanced by around 1 7 for the during irrigation period these amplitude changes were correlated with the amounts of micro sprinkler irrigation the two years results indicated that only the mean air temperature of t3 are deemed significantly different from ck in 2017 during irrigation period but t2 and t3 were significantly reduced by 0 7 and 1 1 in 2018 when compared with ck besides the micro sprinkler irrigation had significant effect on increasing mean relative humidity of t2 and t3 both in 2017 and 2018 during the irrigation period after the irrigation period the mean air temperature of t2 and t3 were lower by 2 5 when compared to ck but micro sprinkler irrigation did not change mean air temperature of t1 and t2 significantly in both years moreover the mean relative humidity of t1 t2 and t3 with micro sprinkler irrigation was higher than that of control and these had significant differences as compared with ck except for t1 in 2017 the relative humidity of t2 significantly rose by 11 and 6 in 2017 and 2018 when compared with ck in the after irrigation period the changes of air temperature and relative humidity is similar in the after irrigation period leading to a reduced vpd described later 3 2 net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate and stomatal conductance as shown in fig 2 p n t r and g s experienced large increases from 9 00 am to 11 00 am in all treatments a comparison among all treatments revealed no significant differences for p n t r and g s before the application of the micro sprinkler cooling system moreover the difference of the maximum conductance transpiration and photosynthesis between the control reported here and a longer term record reported elsewhere for gray jujube liu et al 2019a is less than 15 this latter comparison with ck adds confidence that the short term measurements reported here are not anomalous periods and reflect expected values of leaf gas exchange micro sprinkler irrigation at the flowering to fruit set stage had the effect of increasing p n and g s and declining t r for the two years the corresponding changes in air temperature and relative humidity listed in table 3 in the three phases before during and after the micro sprinkler irrigation are reported when the gas exchange measurements were collected for the two years p n t r and g s of all treatments decreased sharply after 13 00 and the p n of t2 and t3 was still higher than that of the control at 15 00 especially in 2017 this pattern was not found in t r and g s that exhibited no significant differences between the treatments moreover the p n t r and g s of all treatment was enhanced after 15 00 in both years and those of t1 t2 and t3 treatments were similar to ck at 17 00 3 3 yield and fruit quality the two year results indicated that the application of the micro sprinkler cooling system significantly increased soluble sugar and soluble solid but resulted in a decline in organic acid table 4 the soluble sugar following the micro sprinkler irrigation treatments were enhanced 2 7 6 5 in 2017 and 2 4 3 in 2018 compared to the ck the organic acid of t2 and t3 treatments were significantly decreased by 16 8 in 2017 and 11 7 in 2018 respectively while that of the t2 treatment was similar to that of ck therefore the sugar acid ratio of t1 t2 and t3 treatments were significantly enhanced by 12 32 and 15 in 2017 respectively but only t2 and t3 were significantly increased by 20 and 15 in 2018 however there was no significant difference in the vitamin c and single fruit weight variables as shown in table 4 the results over two years indicated that the yields of t2 and t3 treatments were significantly enhanced in 2017 but that of t3 represented a minor increase with no significant difference in 2018 when compared to the control additionally the yield of t2 was highest each year which was 6687 kg hm 2 in 2017 and 6748 kg hm 2 in 2018 moreover the total fruits of t2 and t3 were significantly higher in both years 4 discussion it has been argued that abiotic stresses cause cellular damage in plant species leading to metabolic changes growth retardation oxidative stress and cell death lesk et al 2016 they also cause morphological physiological biochemical and molecular changes that adversely affect plant development and yield nahar et al 2015 siebers et al 2017 evaporative cooling systems are one option to ameliorate against the dangers of drought and heat stresses for this reason the discussion is structured in 3 sub sections the first discusses how micro sprinkler cooling affects the crop microclimate over multiple irrigation events and compares the findings here with literature values the second discusses how fruit quality and quantity are impacted by multiple micro sprinkler irrigation events the third discussed the impact of micro sprinkler cooling on short term leaf gas exchange so as to provide a causal link between micro climatic changes fruit quality and quantity and photosynthesis as well as leaf level water use efficiency during a critical stage of jujube fruiting because the driving force for water transport can be substantially reduced at low vpd the focus of the leaf gas exchange discussion is precisely on the role of vpd zhang et al 2017 that photosynthesis also changes with micro irrigation was already shown for maize urrego pereira et al 2013c apple mupambi et al 2017 alfalfa urrego pereira et al 2013a and grass ferlan et al 2016 wagle and kakani 2014 however urrego pereira et al 2013a reported sprinkler irrigation increased alfalfa net photosynthesis while decreased maize net photosynthesis hence there remains some debate in the literature about how micro sprinkler irrigation impacts leaf gas exchange a valid objection to the third sub section is that the leaf gas exchange measurements are conducted over a 1 day period during flowering to fruit set stage experiencing micro sprinkler irrigation but repeated across years treatments and replicas it is to be noted that these leaf gas exchange measurements are not intended for water or carbon balance analysis they are only intended to show how micro sprinkler irrigation alters vpd which controls much of the leaf gas exchange when maintaining the same foliage amounts nutritional and root zone soil moisture status over a short period because of the multiple treatments and replicas per treatment the vpd range covered here is significant and sufficient to draw conclusions about how micro sprinkler irrigation impacts the micro climate leaf photosynthesis and subsequent fruit quality and quantity 4 1 effects of micro sprinkler cooling on crop micro climate as shown in table 5 alterations in ta and rh because of micro sprinkler usage was similar to that observed by prior studies caravia et al 2017 cavero et al 2009 deligios et al 2019 iglesias et al 2005 liu and kang 2006a liu and kang 2006b urrego pereira et al 2013c urrego pereira et al 2013a urrego pereira et al 2013b as reported by urrego pereira et al 2013c their study found micro sprinkler irrigation decreased air temperature by 1 8 2 1 vpd by 0 53 0 61 kpa and transpiration rate by 0 22 0 28 mm h 1 and indicated the changes of microclimatic and physiological effects higher in drier and warmer days this confirmed the initial conjecture that evaporative cooling from micro sprinkler irrigation can decrease air temperature and vpd thereby improving crop micro climate the micro climatic changes cause less water to be transpired by the leaf and minimize the reduction of stomatal conductance avoiding a higher leaf temperature and reduction in photosynthesis hatfield and prueger 2015 the discussion next asks to what extent reductions in vpd alone explain the measured patterns in leaf gas exchange 4 2 effects of micro sprinkler cooling on fruit quality and yield the application of micro sprinkler cooling system increased soluble sugar and soluble solid in 2017 and 2018 which agrees with the results of iglesias et al 2005 mupambi et al 2017 and caravia et al 2017 because high temperature stress affects photosynthetic activity in source tissues it subsequently reduces the supply of soluble sugars to sink tissues röth et al 2015 the two year results here showed that organic acid of gray jujube fruit was reduced by the micro sprinkler irrigation resulting in enhanced sugar to acid ratio in contrast iglesias et al 2005 indicated that titratable acidity did not appear to be consistently affected by evaporative cooling in general the productivity and fruit quality results of this study are in agreement with those reported in other studies table 5 that have positive effects on crops such as tomato zhang et al 2017 globe artichoke deligios et al 2019 and grape caravia et al 2017 when applying a micro sprinkler cooling system the two year results here showed that the yield significantly increased 1 87 7 35 when compared to the control 4 3 effects of micro sprinkler cooling on short term leaf gas exchange micro sprinkler application is expected to reduce vpd mainly by decreasing air temperature and increasing air relative humidity within the canopy air space the conjecture to be explored here is that reductions in vpd alone caused by spraying explain much of the observed patterns in the leaf gas exchange measurements across the three treatments a counter argument to this assertion is that spraying increases the soil moisture content thereby alleviating water stress instead of reducing vpd during the period of evaporative cooling in both years the maximum amount of spraying water was 6 mm day 1 compared to the total amount of evaporation about 15 mm day 1 at the flowering to fruit set stage and considering the water lost due to wind drift and direct evaporation the root zone soil moisture content is not likely to change appreciably therefore the focus here is on the direct effects of micro sprinkler cooling on the micro climate with particular attention to vpd by definition vpd es t a 1 rh where es is the saturation vapor pressure kpa t a is the air temperature c and rh is the air relative humidity according to the clausius clapeyron equation or an approximated version of it lawrence 2005 es can be related to t a using the august roche magnus formula given by 1 e s t a a e x p b t a t a c where a 0 611 kpa b 17 502 and c 249 97 c gaylon and john 1998 hence vpd can be determined from 2 v p d 0 611 e x p 17 502 t a t a 249 97 1 r h as expected vpd decreases with decreasing t a and increasing rh both are outcomes of the use of micro sprinkler irrigation here the relations between vpd and irrigation amounts is featured in fig 3 for both years which shows a consistent decline in vpd when comparing the control and t2 but minor reductions in vpd when comparing t2 and t3 these results agree with micro climatic measurements carried out in a maize commercial plot irrigated with a center pivot sprinkler irrigation system huesca spain see urrego pereira et al 2013c and in two adjacent greenhouses at an experimental station of the northwest agriculture and forestry university shaanxi china see zhang et al 2017 accepting this empirical link between micro sprinkler irrigation amounts and vpd we now explore the main conjecture that vpd differences between the three treatments and the control explain to a large degree the measured patterns in leaf level pn tr and gs fig 3 provides empirical support that vpd variations across the three treatments explain reductions in t r and increases in p n and g s for the 2 years the discussion next demonstrates that the observed reductions in t r and the increases in p n and g s can be reasonably explained by reductions in vpd from a physiological argument the explanation is anchored to optimal stomatal control theories and their links between the carbon and water economies of plants to illustrate the use of optimality theory it is assumed that boundary layer conductance is small and that the leaves are reasonably coupled to the atmosphere so that t r can be approximated by 3 t r 1 6 g s vpd it has been shown in a number of studies that gs g sref 1 m ln vpd where g sref is a reference conductance defined for high photosynthetically active radiation par and well watered soil moisture conditions corresponding to vpd 1 kpa and m 0 5 0 6 has been determined empirically oren et al 1999 this representation of gs was also shown to be compatible with stomatal optimization theories when m 0 5 as described elsewhere katul et al 2009 and is used here as a surrogate for these expressions using a first order taylor series expansion the relative variations in t r can be estimated from the relative variations in stomatal conductance and vpd as 4 d t r t r d g s g s d v p d v p d 1 φ v p d 1 d v p d v p d where φ vpd ln vpd m 1 similar expressions for can be derived for φ vpd when using stomatal optimization theories the derivation in equation 4 purposely ignores changes in g sref that would have occurred due to the effects of micro sprinkler irrigation on par soil moisture and air temperature across treatments relative to changes in vpd hence equation 4 encodes only the signature of micro sprinkler irrigation on gas exchange via a vpd effect that includes the effects of reduced ta and increased rh however equation 4 ignores the direct effect of ta on gs fig 4 suggests that gs and tr patterns are well reproduced by vpd only variations due to the treatments when setting m 0 4 instead of 0 5 for all treatments and the 2 years record that differed in overall par precipitation and other changes in climatic conditions in fig 4 the fitted variables shown in fig 3 for each treatment wa and year were used when evaluating relative changes dvpd vpd dg s g s dt r t r and dp n p n all differences in fig 4 are computed between the reference and the 3 treatments in fig 3 using the regression curves as smoothers of the data the agreement in fig 4 is congruent with the finding that vpd is a significant driver explaining changes in t r and other gas exchange variables naturally a reduction in gsref due soil moisture stress may also explain reductions in m from 0 5 to 0 4 but the consistency of m 0 4 across leaf gas exchange variables irrigation treatment and years suggests that vpd is the primary variable at minimum this argument can be further explored using pn mass transfer of co2 between the atmosphere and leaves can also be approximated by 5 p n gs c a 1 c i c a where c a and c i are ambient and intercellular atmospheric co2 concentration respectively the approximation in equation 5 now ignores both mesophyll and boundary layer conductances for simplicity for rubisco limited photosynthesis expected under high par and current c a levels stomatal optimization theories katul et al 2009 predict that c i c a 1 1 6λ c a 1 2 vpd 1 2 where λ is known as the marginal water use efficiency linked to the lagrange multiplier of the optimality argument measuring the cost of losing water in carbon units when ignoring changes in λ expected to be significant for water stressed conditions and inserting this expression into equation 5 yields 6 d p n p n d g s g s 4 v p d 1 2 d v p d v p d 1 φ v p d 4 v p d 1 2 d v p d v p d the result in equation 6 indicates that relative changes in pn can also be described by relative changes in vpd the results in fig 4 generalize the findings that the change of pn gs and tr were significantly correlated with vpd regardless of variations in air temperature and relative humidity it is to be noted that the maximum carboxylation capacity linking pn to ci directly varies with temperature however the signature of this variation appears in equation 5 via a temperature dependency of gs and c i c a the direct effects of reduced ta on gs was small compared to the vpd effect to assess whether similar reasoning applies to c i c a is now explored using the water use efficiency of leaves modifications of the flux based water use efficiency of leaves wue l p n t r due to sprinkler irrigation is given from the definitions in equations 3 and 5 as 7 w u e l g s c a c i 1 6 g s v p d c a 1 6 v p d 1 c i c a c a 1 6 v p d 1 6 λ c a 1 2 v p d 1 2 λ c a 1 6 1 2 v p d 1 2 where λ can vary with leaf water potential and hence soil moisture as discussed elsewhere manzoni et al 2011 at constant atmospheric co2 concentration wue l is linearly related to vpd 1 2 the measured relation between wue l and vpd 1 2 was well supported by the experiments here with a slope of 3 76 4 89 fig 5 hence fig 5 further supports predictions from stomatal optimization theories equation 7 for the dependency of c i c a on vpd and less so on air temperature the findings in fig 5 are also interesting in their own right because they suggest that reductions in vpd due to micro sprinkler irrigation also increase leaf level water use efficiency similarly zhao et al 2012 used the cupid model to indicate that the sprinkler irrigation could improve water use efficiency by 5 as may be anticipated vpd alone may not explain all aspects of stress on crops and is intended here to be used only as a null model given the known physiological responses of plants heat stress may cause negative effects on overall growth and development of plants the major phase being damage in reproductive growth fahad et al 2017 siebers et al 2017 pollination is one of the most sensitive phenological stages to temperature extremes across all species and during this developmental stage temperature extremes adversely affect pollen production hatfield and prueger 2015 as noted by prior studies lu et al 2010 gray jujube were classified as morning blooming and cross pollination type and the longevity of single flower was only about 33 h the high ta is one of the major causes of sterility that disturbs pollen shedding and decreases viability of pollen grains resulting in decreased number of germinated pollen grains on a stigma satake and yoshida 1978 a mild stress at anthesis or grain filling phase can substantially reduce the crop yield fahad et al 2017 jujube fruit development can also be affected by weather and pollination conditions low air humidity can cause gray jujube fruit to fall off and the fruit physiological sunburn disease can seriously affect the yield of gray jujube when air temperature exceeds 40 in fact it has been reported hatfield and prueger 2015 that exposure of plants to high ta at the onset of the reproductive stage has a major adverse impact on fruit or grain production across all species in crops photosynthetic rate increases contribute to yield or more biomass production and soluble sugar content through enhancement of phloem loading fig 6 is consistent with the findings that leaf level increases in pn do increase both yield and soluble sugar as mentioned earlier p n is higher when vpd decreases yield and soluble sugar content appear to increase with reduced vpd even though many other factors are known to impact such relations changes in photosynthesis will also impact shoot growth leaf area and number of inflorescence a topic better kept for future research 5 conclusions the two year experiments here on gray jujube confirm that micro sprinkler irrigation affects micro climate leaf gas exchange plant growth and to a lesser extent fruit quality especially with 4 mm d 1 micro sprinkler irrigation at the flowering to fruit set stage specifically the experiments demonstrate the following 1 the application of micro sprinkler cooling system effectively reduced vpd by decreasing air temperature and enhancing air relative humidity 2 the reductions in vpd alone appear to explain the observed patterns in short term leaf gas exchange measurements 3 the predictions from a leaf level stomatal optimization theory that mechanistically links variations in vpd to net photosynthetic rate p n transpiration rate t r and stomatal conductance g s also agree with measured gas exchange responses when micro sprinkler irrigation induced changes to vpd 4 the dependency of water use efficiency of leaves wue l on vpd predicted from stomatal optimization theory was also well reproduced by the gas exchange measurements here the work showed that micro sprinkler irrigation application increases water use efficiency a major benefit to water management in arid regions naturally reduced vpd was shown to reduce t r and future work will explore water savings associated with this reduction vis à vis water needs by the plants to be delivered through conventional irrigation 5 at the whole canopy level and integrated over the growing season changes in yield and soluble sugar appear to increase with leaf level increases in pn attributed to reductions in vpd over all micro sprinkler cooling can be appropriate to mitigate heat stresses in arid and semi arid regions the work here showed the prominent yet under appreciated role of vapor pressure deficit in such mitigation declaration of competing interest the authors report

10432,the frequency and severity of droughts and heat stresses are becoming a threat to crop production and food security in arid and semi arid regions worldwide to ameliorate both stresses simultaneously micro sprinkler systems are being proposed and their performance is investigated here for gray jujube trees planted in an arid region the experiments focused on the effects of different levels of micro sprinkler irrigation amounts on air temperature relative humidity vapor pressure deficit leaf level physiological processes yield and quality of the fruit the experiment was carried out over a two year period in a jujube orchard consisting of three micro sprinkler irrigation levels that spray water at 2 mm d 1 t1 4 mm d 1 t2 6 mm d 1 t3 and the control at the flowering to fruit set stage within the canopy volume the application of micro sprinkler cooling system was shown to decrease air temperature by 1 to 3 and enhance air relative humidity by 11 17 when compared with the control the associated decrease in air temperature and increases in air relative humidity reduced the vapor pressure deficit vpd from 3 kpa to 2 kpa the measured vpd reduction across treatments explained much of the measured differences in physiological responses net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate stomatal conductance and water use efficiency at the leaf scale the aforementioned physiological improvements increased the quantity and quality of the jujube fruit the study adds to the growing literature that supports the use of micro sprinklers as a cooling system to ameliorate the negative effects of droughts and heat under extreme heat stress conditions keywords evaporative cooling micro sprinkler irrigation physiological responses vapor pressure deficit yield 1 introduction that extreme events such as drought and heat stresses are increasing in severity and frequency as measured by the number and anomalies above long term mean values is not in dispute diffenbaugh et al 2017 ortiz et al 2008 however tracking the consequences of such increases on crop production and quality and ways to ameliorate adverse consequences remains a subject of debate and active research from a micro climatic perspective increases in air temperature ta leads to increases in the saturation vapor pressure es as predicted by the clausius clayperon equation elevated es increases the vapor pressure deficit vpd and leads to reductions in leaf level stomatal conductance kaushal and wani 2016 oren et al 1999 such reductions in stomatal conductance reduce photosynthesis and subsequent crop productivity as well as carbohydrate mainly sucrose production and loading likewise droughts undoubtedly cause negative impacts on yield of many crops such as maize wheat rice and soybean fahad et al 2017 siebers et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 when coupled with temperature stresses drought will create a cascading set of interactions on plant growth that override much of the positive impacts of projected elevated atmospheric co2 thereby diminishing growth and yield of plants hatfield and prueger 2011 siebers et al 2017 evaporative cooling can be effective in reducing elevated ta stresses and ameliorating drought stresses on crops micro sprinkler cooling systems scheduled to apply water near the soil surface during the warmest period of plant growth can be used to enhance evaporative cooling caravia et al 2017 deligios et al 2019 evans 2004 the amounts of water applied can be small as it is not intended to wet the rooting zone but to increase evaporative cooling and reduce vpd of the microclimate around crops the effectiveness of such cooling systems has been explored in many studies worldwide and for many crop types including grapes caravia et al 2017 apples evans 2004 green et al 2014 iglesias et al 2005 mupambi et al 2017 winter wheat liu and kang 2006a and strawberries chesness and braud 1970 gude et al 2018 broadly the aforementioned studies support the overall benefits of micro sprinkler cooling with some exceptions caravia et al 2017 indicated that a sprinkler cooling system can effectively reduce the canopy air temperature of vines by 2 5 c when ta in a control exceeded 38 c other studies also report that evaporative cooling is a supplementary irrigation strategy and can contribute to improved yield and quality of crops for example liu and kang 2006a reported that the yield of winter wheat under micro sprinkler irrigation was improved by some 290 kg ha 1 when compared to that of non sprinkled field moreover a 3 year study iglesias et al 2005 found that fruit firmness fruit size and soluble solid were all increased when using micro sprinkler irrigation however other studies parchomchuk and meheriuk 1996 showed that cooling reduced soluble solids concentration and reported no effects on fruit size firmness and redness therefore the combined benefits of such evaporative cooling on yield and quality of different crops planted across differing climatic regimes is needed to inform future food and water management issues and motivates the work here jujube ziziphus jujube mill originated in china and has a long history of cultivation gao et al 2013 liu et al 2014 liu et al 2019a the crop is used to harvest fruits that have medicinal and nutritional value gao et al 2013 jiang et al 2007 li et al 2007 jujube is commonly grown in semi arid and arid regions where drought and heat stresses are likely to intensify more than 30 of china s jujube production originates in the xinjiang province where the output of jujube reached 3 6 million tons in 2018 statistics bureau of xinjiang uygur autonomous region 2019 located in the hinterland of eurasia xinjiang is about 2 200 kilometers from the sea and experiences minor rainfall high evaporative demand and high ta liu et al 2019b zhang et al 2012 due to the unique natural conditions in xinjiang where the maximum air temperatures and annual rainfall amount are 41 and 150 mm respectively heat and drought are undoubtedly the two most important stresses in the growth and productivity of jujube hence jujube production under such arid conditions make it ideal for exploring the benefits of micro sprinkler evaporative cooling on the quality and quantity of fruits the compass of this work using gray jujube trees as a case study the objectives are to investigate 1 the changes in ta air relative humidity and vpd when applying micro sprinkler irrigation with differing amounts of water 2 the effects of evaporative cooling on daily changes in net leaf photosynthetic rate p n transpiration rate t r and stomatal conductance g s at the leaf scale during the flowering to fruit stage 3 the responses of both crop yield and fruit quality to such water management 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was carried out over a 2 year period april 2017 to november 2018 in the oasis region latitude 37 47 n longitude 84 08 e altitude 1307 m located in qiemo county in south xinjiang province northwest of china the site has a continental arid climate with mean annual precipitation and potential evaporation measured using a standard pan of 18 mm and 2824 mm respectively the soil bulk density on a mass basis field capacity and soil wilting coefficient in the top 80 cm are approximately 1 5 g cm 3 0 22 cm3 cm 3 and 0 04 cm3 cm 3 respectively the soil is classified as sand usda and is composed of 87 sand 9 silt and 4 clay the water table is below 2 2 m and does not contribute to any natural replenishment of the rooting zone the orchard was established in 2010 where gray jujube trees zizyphus jujuba mill were planted 1 0 m apart along rows spaced 3 0 m apart the 2 m tall gray jujube were irrigated by a 16 mm flexible drip tube installed 0 4 m away from the tree rows 0 8 m between drip tapes on the soil surface the emitters on the drip tape were spaced 0 3 m apart and the drip discharge was 3 2 l h 1 manufacturer stated coefficient of variation 5 the jujube rooting system is mainly distributed within the top 60 cm soil layer the drip irrigation system delivers 50 mm of water depth when the mean soil moisture in a control plot later described and labeled ck was lower than 60 of the field capacity the total drip irrigation amounts were 600 mm in 2017 and 550 mm in 2018 for all experimental plots 2 2 experimental design the aforementioned drip irrigation system was complemented by a micro sprinkler cooling system operating from 21 june to 10 july 20 days in both years during this period daily potential evaporation was 15 mm and coincides with the flowering to fruit set stage of jujube trees to test the effectiveness of the micro sprinkler cooling system an experimental design consisting of 12 plots within the gray jujube orchard is implemented each plot was 500 m2 10 m wide and 50 m long with 6 0 m spacing between them fig 1 all micro sprinkler irrigation treatments were replicated three times with the experimental plots arranged in a completely randomized design that include four treatments these four treatments were 1 2 mm d 1 t1 2 with 4 mm d 1 t2 3 with 6 mm d 1 t3 and 4 without micro sprinkler irrigation ck and the duration of three micro sprinkler irrigation treatments was 10 min 20 min and 30 min respectively the micro sprinklers were installed in the middle of the gray jujube trees within the plant row and their installation height was 0 5 m above the soil surface each micro sprinkler has a flow rate of 18 l h 1 at 0 2 mpa operating pressure and a wetted diameter of about 1 4 m operating twice a day 12 00 and 18 00 with half of the daily irrigation amount all treatments were given identical applications of fertilization pruning and insecticides 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 temperature and relative humidity the air temperature and relative humidity were recorded every half hour by a digital temperature humidity recorder sensor lite5032p rh fourtec israel the sensors were installed within ventilated shelters so as to minimize direct radiative load at different heights above the ground 25 cm 75 cm 125 cm and 175 cm the mean mean maximum and mean minimum of air temperature and relative humidity were calculated during micro sprinkler irrigation events and are presented in table 1 for completeness 2 3 2 leaf gas exchange the p n t r and gs were measured using a photosynthesis system li 6400xt li cor usa during the micro sprinkler irrigation treatment three sunlit and healthy leaves of three representative gray jujube trees under the same treatment were randomly selected for gas exchange measurements the leaves were measured during gmt 09 00 am 20 00 pm july 1 in both 2017 and 2018 including before 11 00 and 17 00 and after 13 00 and 19 00 the application of micro sprinkler irrigation events 2 3 3 fruit yield and quality three trees per replica per treatment were harvested by hand and weighed using an electronic scale in november sixty fruits per replicate were randomly sampled and the single fruit weight was measured the quality of gray jujube as quantified by its acidity soluble solids sugar and vitamin content were measured the sugar content was determined with the lane eynon s method the acid content was measured with a naoh titration method the vitamin c content was measured using the 2 6 dichloroindophenol titration method and the soluble solids were measured with a direct reading in a abbe refractometer 2waj shanghai csoif co ltd china these analyses were conducted in triplicate for each treatment 2 4 statistical analysis the statistical product and service solutions spss 20 0 international business machines corporation ibm usa was used to analyze the data the differences among treatments were compared using one way analyses of variance anova and a significant difference test duncan s multiple range test at a significance level of p0 05 was used 3 result 3 1 air temperature and relative humidity changes as shown in table 1 the ta and relative humidity are statistically different between the treatments at all heights within the canopy volume over the entire experiment duration the application of the micro sprinkler cooling system reduced air temperature and enhanced relative humidity among the treatments especially within the lower canopy air space 0 100 cm compared with the mean air temperature under ck treatment for all heights air temperatures for t1 t2 and t3 treatments declined by 2 3 2 6 and 3 2 in 2017 respectively and 1 2 2 1 and 1 8 in 2018 in addition results in 2017 and 2018 indicated the micro sprinkler irrigation increased the mean relative humidity about 11 17 at all heights in the following further details about the effects of water additions on each level above the soil surface are discussed at the 50 cm height mean air temperature for t1 t2 and t3 treatment was lower than ck by 2 9 3 7 and 4 4 in 2017 respectively and 1 7 3 7 and 5 0 in 2018 respectively moreover the application of the micro sprinkler cooling system significantly increased the mean air relative humidity and values of t1 t2 and t3 were higher by 9 12 9 4 10 1 and 7 5 8 1 than ck respectively at the 100 cm height results from the years 2017 and 2018 indicated that using the micro sprinkler cooling system lead to declining mean maximum air temperature although only t3 had significant difference with ck in addition the application of micro sprinkler cooling system significantly increased mean minimum relative humidity in 2017 at the 150 cm height the micro sprinkler irrigation still had some minor effect on the mean air temperature but all treatments did not experience significant differences in 2018 while there were significant differences between t1 t2 and ck in 2017 however no significant difference in mean relative humidity between treatments were found both in 2017 and 2018 at the 200 cm height the application of micro sprinkler cooling system reduced air temperature and enhanced air relative humidity but those alterations were not statistically significant different between treatments the air temperature and relative humidity of treatments were significantly different between the three periods labelled before during and after the micro sprinkler irrigation table 2 for the before period there was no significant differences in air temperature and relative humidity between all treatments in both years furthermore mean air temperature in 2018 were lower more than those in 2017 before the micro sprinkler irrigation however mean air temperature decreased by 0 1 1 7 and relative humidity was enhanced by around 1 7 for the during irrigation period these amplitude changes were correlated with the amounts of micro sprinkler irrigation the two years results indicated that only the mean air temperature of t3 are deemed significantly different from ck in 2017 during irrigation period but t2 and t3 were significantly reduced by 0 7 and 1 1 in 2018 when compared with ck besides the micro sprinkler irrigation had significant effect on increasing mean relative humidity of t2 and t3 both in 2017 and 2018 during the irrigation period after the irrigation period the mean air temperature of t2 and t3 were lower by 2 5 when compared to ck but micro sprinkler irrigation did not change mean air temperature of t1 and t2 significantly in both years moreover the mean relative humidity of t1 t2 and t3 with micro sprinkler irrigation was higher than that of control and these had significant differences as compared with ck except for t1 in 2017 the relative humidity of t2 significantly rose by 11 and 6 in 2017 and 2018 when compared with ck in the after irrigation period the changes of air temperature and relative humidity is similar in the after irrigation period leading to a reduced vpd described later 3 2 net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate and stomatal conductance as shown in fig 2 p n t r and g s experienced large increases from 9 00 am to 11 00 am in all treatments a comparison among all treatments revealed no significant differences for p n t r and g s before the application of the micro sprinkler cooling system moreover the difference of the maximum conductance transpiration and photosynthesis between the control reported here and a longer term record reported elsewhere for gray jujube liu et al 2019a is less than 15 this latter comparison with ck adds confidence that the short term measurements reported here are not anomalous periods and reflect expected values of leaf gas exchange micro sprinkler irrigation at the flowering to fruit set stage had the effect of increasing p n and g s and declining t r for the two years the corresponding changes in air temperature and relative humidity listed in table 3 in the three phases before during and after the micro sprinkler irrigation are reported when the gas exchange measurements were collected for the two years p n t r and g s of all treatments decreased sharply after 13 00 and the p n of t2 and t3 was still higher than that of the control at 15 00 especially in 2017 this pattern was not found in t r and g s that exhibited no significant differences between the treatments moreover the p n t r and g s of all treatment was enhanced after 15 00 in both years and those of t1 t2 and t3 treatments were similar to ck at 17 00 3 3 yield and fruit quality the two year results indicated that the application of the micro sprinkler cooling system significantly increased soluble sugar and soluble solid but resulted in a decline in organic acid table 4 the soluble sugar following the micro sprinkler irrigation treatments were enhanced 2 7 6 5 in 2017 and 2 4 3 in 2018 compared to the ck the organic acid of t2 and t3 treatments were significantly decreased by 16 8 in 2017 and 11 7 in 2018 respectively while that of the t2 treatment was similar to that of ck therefore the sugar acid ratio of t1 t2 and t3 treatments were significantly enhanced by 12 32 and 15 in 2017 respectively but only t2 and t3 were significantly increased by 20 and 15 in 2018 however there was no significant difference in the vitamin c and single fruit weight variables as shown in table 4 the results over two years indicated that the yields of t2 and t3 treatments were significantly enhanced in 2017 but that of t3 represented a minor increase with no significant difference in 2018 when compared to the control additionally the yield of t2 was highest each year which was 6687 kg hm 2 in 2017 and 6748 kg hm 2 in 2018 moreover the total fruits of t2 and t3 were significantly higher in both years 4 discussion it has been argued that abiotic stresses cause cellular damage in plant species leading to metabolic changes growth retardation oxidative stress and cell death lesk et al 2016 they also cause morphological physiological biochemical and molecular changes that adversely affect plant development and yield nahar et al 2015 siebers et al 2017 evaporative cooling systems are one option to ameliorate against the dangers of drought and heat stresses for this reason the discussion is structured in 3 sub sections the first discusses how micro sprinkler cooling affects the crop microclimate over multiple irrigation events and compares the findings here with literature values the second discusses how fruit quality and quantity are impacted by multiple micro sprinkler irrigation events the third discussed the impact of micro sprinkler cooling on short term leaf gas exchange so as to provide a causal link between micro climatic changes fruit quality and quantity and photosynthesis as well as leaf level water use efficiency during a critical stage of jujube fruiting because the driving force for water transport can be substantially reduced at low vpd the focus of the leaf gas exchange discussion is precisely on the role of vpd zhang et al 2017 that photosynthesis also changes with micro irrigation was already shown for maize urrego pereira et al 2013c apple mupambi et al 2017 alfalfa urrego pereira et al 2013a and grass ferlan et al 2016 wagle and kakani 2014 however urrego pereira et al 2013a reported sprinkler irrigation increased alfalfa net photosynthesis while decreased maize net photosynthesis hence there remains some debate in the literature about how micro sprinkler irrigation impacts leaf gas exchange a valid objection to the third sub section is that the leaf gas exchange measurements are conducted over a 1 day period during flowering to fruit set stage experiencing micro sprinkler irrigation but repeated across years treatments and replicas it is to be noted that these leaf gas exchange measurements are not intended for water or carbon balance analysis they are only intended to show how micro sprinkler irrigation alters vpd which controls much of the leaf gas exchange when maintaining the same foliage amounts nutritional and root zone soil moisture status over a short period because of the multiple treatments and replicas per treatment the vpd range covered here is significant and sufficient to draw conclusions about how micro sprinkler irrigation impacts the micro climate leaf photosynthesis and subsequent fruit quality and quantity 4 1 effects of micro sprinkler cooling on crop micro climate as shown in table 5 alterations in ta and rh because of micro sprinkler usage was similar to that observed by prior studies caravia et al 2017 cavero et al 2009 deligios et al 2019 iglesias et al 2005 liu and kang 2006a liu and kang 2006b urrego pereira et al 2013c urrego pereira et al 2013a urrego pereira et al 2013b as reported by urrego pereira et al 2013c their study found micro sprinkler irrigation decreased air temperature by 1 8 2 1 vpd by 0 53 0 61 kpa and transpiration rate by 0 22 0 28 mm h 1 and indicated the changes of microclimatic and physiological effects higher in drier and warmer days this confirmed the initial conjecture that evaporative cooling from micro sprinkler irrigation can decrease air temperature and vpd thereby improving crop micro climate the micro climatic changes cause less water to be transpired by the leaf and minimize the reduction of stomatal conductance avoiding a higher leaf temperature and reduction in photosynthesis hatfield and prueger 2015 the discussion next asks to what extent reductions in vpd alone explain the measured patterns in leaf gas exchange 4 2 effects of micro sprinkler cooling on fruit quality and yield the application of micro sprinkler cooling system increased soluble sugar and soluble solid in 2017 and 2018 which agrees with the results of iglesias et al 2005 mupambi et al 2017 and caravia et al 2017 because high temperature stress affects photosynthetic activity in source tissues it subsequently reduces the supply of soluble sugars to sink tissues röth et al 2015 the two year results here showed that organic acid of gray jujube fruit was reduced by the micro sprinkler irrigation resulting in enhanced sugar to acid ratio in contrast iglesias et al 2005 indicated that titratable acidity did not appear to be consistently affected by evaporative cooling in general the productivity and fruit quality results of this study are in agreement with those reported in other studies table 5 that have positive effects on crops such as tomato zhang et al 2017 globe artichoke deligios et al 2019 and grape caravia et al 2017 when applying a micro sprinkler cooling system the two year results here showed that the yield significantly increased 1 87 7 35 when compared to the control 4 3 effects of micro sprinkler cooling on short term leaf gas exchange micro sprinkler application is expected to reduce vpd mainly by decreasing air temperature and increasing air relative humidity within the canopy air space the conjecture to be explored here is that reductions in vpd alone caused by spraying explain much of the observed patterns in the leaf gas exchange measurements across the three treatments a counter argument to this assertion is that spraying increases the soil moisture content thereby alleviating water stress instead of reducing vpd during the period of evaporative cooling in both years the maximum amount of spraying water was 6 mm day 1 compared to the total amount of evaporation about 15 mm day 1 at the flowering to fruit set stage and considering the water lost due to wind drift and direct evaporation the root zone soil moisture content is not likely to change appreciably therefore the focus here is on the direct effects of micro sprinkler cooling on the micro climate with particular attention to vpd by definition vpd es t a 1 rh where es is the saturation vapor pressure kpa t a is the air temperature c and rh is the air relative humidity according to the clausius clapeyron equation or an approximated version of it lawrence 2005 es can be related to t a using the august roche magnus formula given by 1 e s t a a e x p b t a t a c where a 0 611 kpa b 17 502 and c 249 97 c gaylon and john 1998 hence vpd can be determined from 2 v p d 0 611 e x p 17 502 t a t a 249 97 1 r h as expected vpd decreases with decreasing t a and increasing rh both are outcomes of the use of micro sprinkler irrigation here the relations between vpd and irrigation amounts is featured in fig 3 for both years which shows a consistent decline in vpd when comparing the control and t2 but minor reductions in vpd when comparing t2 and t3 these results agree with micro climatic measurements carried out in a maize commercial plot irrigated with a center pivot sprinkler irrigation system huesca spain see urrego pereira et al 2013c and in two adjacent greenhouses at an experimental station of the northwest agriculture and forestry university shaanxi china see zhang et al 2017 accepting this empirical link between micro sprinkler irrigation amounts and vpd we now explore the main conjecture that vpd differences between the three treatments and the control explain to a large degree the measured patterns in leaf level pn tr and gs fig 3 provides empirical support that vpd variations across the three treatments explain reductions in t r and increases in p n and g s for the 2 years the discussion next demonstrates that the observed reductions in t r and the increases in p n and g s can be reasonably explained by reductions in vpd from a physiological argument the explanation is anchored to optimal stomatal control theories and their links between the carbon and water economies of plants to illustrate the use of optimality theory it is assumed that boundary layer conductance is small and that the leaves are reasonably coupled to the atmosphere so that t r can be approximated by 3 t r 1 6 g s vpd it has been shown in a number of studies that gs g sref 1 m ln vpd where g sref is a reference conductance defined for high photosynthetically active radiation par and well watered soil moisture conditions corresponding to vpd 1 kpa and m 0 5 0 6 has been determined empirically oren et al 1999 this representation of gs was also shown to be compatible with stomatal optimization theories when m 0 5 as described elsewhere katul et al 2009 and is used here as a surrogate for these expressions using a first order taylor series expansion the relative variations in t r can be estimated from the relative variations in stomatal conductance and vpd as 4 d t r t r d g s g s d v p d v p d 1 φ v p d 1 d v p d v p d where φ vpd ln vpd m 1 similar expressions for can be derived for φ vpd when using stomatal optimization theories the derivation in equation 4 purposely ignores changes in g sref that would have occurred due to the effects of micro sprinkler irrigation on par soil moisture and air temperature across treatments relative to changes in vpd hence equation 4 encodes only the signature of micro sprinkler irrigation on gas exchange via a vpd effect that includes the effects of reduced ta and increased rh however equation 4 ignores the direct effect of ta on gs fig 4 suggests that gs and tr patterns are well reproduced by vpd only variations due to the treatments when setting m 0 4 instead of 0 5 for all treatments and the 2 years record that differed in overall par precipitation and other changes in climatic conditions in fig 4 the fitted variables shown in fig 3 for each treatment wa and year were used when evaluating relative changes dvpd vpd dg s g s dt r t r and dp n p n all differences in fig 4 are computed between the reference and the 3 treatments in fig 3 using the regression curves as smoothers of the data the agreement in fig 4 is congruent with the finding that vpd is a significant driver explaining changes in t r and other gas exchange variables naturally a reduction in gsref due soil moisture stress may also explain reductions in m from 0 5 to 0 4 but the consistency of m 0 4 across leaf gas exchange variables irrigation treatment and years suggests that vpd is the primary variable at minimum this argument can be further explored using pn mass transfer of co2 between the atmosphere and leaves can also be approximated by 5 p n gs c a 1 c i c a where c a and c i are ambient and intercellular atmospheric co2 concentration respectively the approximation in equation 5 now ignores both mesophyll and boundary layer conductances for simplicity for rubisco limited photosynthesis expected under high par and current c a levels stomatal optimization theories katul et al 2009 predict that c i c a 1 1 6λ c a 1 2 vpd 1 2 where λ is known as the marginal water use efficiency linked to the lagrange multiplier of the optimality argument measuring the cost of losing water in carbon units when ignoring changes in λ expected to be significant for water stressed conditions and inserting this expression into equation 5 yields 6 d p n p n d g s g s 4 v p d 1 2 d v p d v p d 1 φ v p d 4 v p d 1 2 d v p d v p d the result in equation 6 indicates that relative changes in pn can also be described by relative changes in vpd the results in fig 4 generalize the findings that the change of pn gs and tr were significantly correlated with vpd regardless of variations in air temperature and relative humidity it is to be noted that the maximum carboxylation capacity linking pn to ci directly varies with temperature however the signature of this variation appears in equation 5 via a temperature dependency of gs and c i c a the direct effects of reduced ta on gs was small compared to the vpd effect to assess whether similar reasoning applies to c i c a is now explored using the water use efficiency of leaves modifications of the flux based water use efficiency of leaves wue l p n t r due to sprinkler irrigation is given from the definitions in equations 3 and 5 as 7 w u e l g s c a c i 1 6 g s v p d c a 1 6 v p d 1 c i c a c a 1 6 v p d 1 6 λ c a 1 2 v p d 1 2 λ c a 1 6 1 2 v p d 1 2 where λ can vary with leaf water potential and hence soil moisture as discussed elsewhere manzoni et al 2011 at constant atmospheric co2 concentration wue l is linearly related to vpd 1 2 the measured relation between wue l and vpd 1 2 was well supported by the experiments here with a slope of 3 76 4 89 fig 5 hence fig 5 further supports predictions from stomatal optimization theories equation 7 for the dependency of c i c a on vpd and less so on air temperature the findings in fig 5 are also interesting in their own right because they suggest that reductions in vpd due to micro sprinkler irrigation also increase leaf level water use efficiency similarly zhao et al 2012 used the cupid model to indicate that the sprinkler irrigation could improve water use efficiency by 5 as may be anticipated vpd alone may not explain all aspects of stress on crops and is intended here to be used only as a null model given the known physiological responses of plants heat stress may cause negative effects on overall growth and development of plants the major phase being damage in reproductive growth fahad et al 2017 siebers et al 2017 pollination is one of the most sensitive phenological stages to temperature extremes across all species and during this developmental stage temperature extremes adversely affect pollen production hatfield and prueger 2015 as noted by prior studies lu et al 2010 gray jujube were classified as morning blooming and cross pollination type and the longevity of single flower was only about 33 h the high ta is one of the major causes of sterility that disturbs pollen shedding and decreases viability of pollen grains resulting in decreased number of germinated pollen grains on a stigma satake and yoshida 1978 a mild stress at anthesis or grain filling phase can substantially reduce the crop yield fahad et al 2017 jujube fruit development can also be affected by weather and pollination conditions low air humidity can cause gray jujube fruit to fall off and the fruit physiological sunburn disease can seriously affect the yield of gray jujube when air temperature exceeds 40 in fact it has been reported hatfield and prueger 2015 that exposure of plants to high ta at the onset of the reproductive stage has a major adverse impact on fruit or grain production across all species in crops photosynthetic rate increases contribute to yield or more biomass production and soluble sugar content through enhancement of phloem loading fig 6 is consistent with the findings that leaf level increases in pn do increase both yield and soluble sugar as mentioned earlier p n is higher when vpd decreases yield and soluble sugar content appear to increase with reduced vpd even though many other factors are known to impact such relations changes in photosynthesis will also impact shoot growth leaf area and number of inflorescence a topic better kept for future research 5 conclusions the two year experiments here on gray jujube confirm that micro sprinkler irrigation affects micro climate leaf gas exchange plant growth and to a lesser extent fruit quality especially with 4 mm d 1 micro sprinkler irrigation at the flowering to fruit set stage specifically the experiments demonstrate the following 1 the application of micro sprinkler cooling system effectively reduced vpd by decreasing air temperature and enhancing air relative humidity 2 the reductions in vpd alone appear to explain the observed patterns in short term leaf gas exchange measurements 3 the predictions from a leaf level stomatal optimization theory that mechanistically links variations in vpd to net photosynthetic rate p n transpiration rate t r and stomatal conductance g s also agree with measured gas exchange responses when micro sprinkler irrigation induced changes to vpd 4 the dependency of water use efficiency of leaves wue l on vpd predicted from stomatal optimization theory was also well reproduced by the gas exchange measurements here the work showed that micro sprinkler irrigation application increases water use efficiency a major benefit to water management in arid regions naturally reduced vpd was shown to reduce t r and future work will explore water savings associated with this reduction vis à vis water needs by the plants to be delivered through conventional irrigation 5 at the whole canopy level and integrated over the growing season changes in yield and soluble sugar appear to increase with leaf level increases in pn attributed to reductions in vpd over all micro sprinkler cooling can be appropriate to mitigate heat stresses in arid and semi arid regions the work here showed the prominent yet under appreciated role of vapor pressure deficit in such mitigation declaration of competing interest the authors report

10433,phosphorus p is an essential element for crop production drip irrigation di system mainly because of its high precision allows effective application of water soluble p fertilizers however consecutive input of p fertilizer would react with ions in the water source especially when using the saline water containing high concentration of ions consequently the integration of p fertilizer and saline water results in more complicated and serious di emitter clogging which may damage the whole irrigation system therefore an in situ field study was conducted to study the impacts of saline water concentrations 2 g l 1 and 4 g l 1 and water soluble p fertilizer types urea phosphate up and mono potassium phosphate mkp on di system performance the results indicated that both up and mkp application aggravated the emitter clogging process and decreased the system discharge variation ratio dra and christiansen coefficient of uniformity cu by 2 62 11 7 and 1 89 7 94 respectively up treatments performed better than mkp treatments in anti clogging abilities as it increased the di system dra 4 81 5 78 and cu 2 98 3 59 besides the impacts were significantly enhanced by higher water salinity the system performance indicators were closely related to the chemical precipitations inside emitters especially the relative contents and variations of the primary components carbonates quartz and silicates up performed better than mkp mainly because it lowered water ph and thus significantly reduced precipitation overall clogging parameters dra and cu clogging substances and the components of fertigation treatments all showed positive linear correlations with controlled treatments that without fertilizer applied ck 2 and ck 4 the slopes of the fitting curves and significance

in drip emitters mikkelsen 1989 enciso medina et al 2007 as p fertilizer contains hpo4 2 that would react with ca2 and mg2 which form insoluble cahpo4 or mghpo4 precipitates mikkelsen 1989 and lead to drip irrigation clogging liu et al 2017 previous studies haynes 1985 hopkins et al 2010 found that the emitter clogging characteristics were extensively varied with different fertilizer types mikkelsen 1989 experimentally indicated that acidic p fertilizer mainly urea phosphate up may effectively mitigate the emitter clogging issue on the other hand the rate of emitter clogging was also greatly associated with water quality characteristics nakayama and bucks 1991 li et al 2019 moreover the widespread saline water is increasingly being accepted as an alternative water resource for

in serious clogging issues dehghanisanij et al 2007 li et al 2019 especially when combined with fertilizer application the inter reaction between p fertilizer and appreciable concentrations of ca2 or mg2 in the water source zhou et al 2018 as well as poor p fertilizer management peragón et al 2017 triggered the chemical precipitation in drip irrigation system so far no study had explicitly described the coupling mechanism of p fertilizers and saline water on drip irrigation clogging yet therefore an in situ field experiment was conducted to 1 study the impacts of p fertilizer along with saline water on clogging characteristics of drip irrigation emitters 2 explore the dynamic variation of chemical precipitations accumulated in drip irrigation emitters 3 compare the effects of salinity level of irrigation water and fertilizer types on the clogging process 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and drip irrigation emitters used the field experiment was conducted at

water soluble p fertilizers were applied urea phosphate up mono potassium phosphate mkp with the fertilizer concentration of 0 2 g l 1 those treatments without fertilizer were regarded as the controlled treatments ck six treatments in total are summarized in table 1 stirring devices were used in fertilizer tanks to maintain the constant concentration during system operation by the end of experiment the total quantity of applied p was 44 7 kg in each treatment which was equivalent to 837 kg ha 1 when 9000 m long drip irrigation lateral were laid per hectare irrigation water ph and temperature measurements were done every day at 10 00 a m using thermometer type o 264wt range 10 300 manufacturer dretec japan and summarized in fig s1 supplementary materials the other water quality

satisfy six treatments mentioned above each testing unit consisted four layers each of which was using one type of non pressure compensating drip irrigation emitter these four types of emitters were treated as replications and their geometrical parameters are presented in table 3 in this experiment 15 m long and 16 mm internal diameter drip irrigation laterals containing 45 emitters each were used each type of emitter was facilitated with eight laterals sampling the clogging substances at different operating hours a homogeneous filtration system consisting the grit chamber sand filter

single emitter s tested outflow to its initial outflow the clogging percentages were then assigned to a predetermined range and the number of emitters within different percentage ranges was then tabulated giving the proportion of emitters within each range the clogging categories were classified as no clogging 95 slight clogging 80 95 partial clogging 50 80 severe clogging 20 50 and complete

operation were taken respectively to analyze the clogging substances in drip irrigation emitters at each sampling event twelve emitters from each treatment were cut out randomly from the front middle and end parts of laterals a high precision electronic weight balance accuracy 10 4 g was used to weigh the emitter samples and then placed in the zip lock bags hereafter 20 ml deionized water was added to remove the clogging substances using an ultrasonic cleaner manufacturer chaowei type gvs 10 l working rate of power 240 w frequency 60 hz to obtain the dry clogging substances emitter samples were treated in ultrasonic cleaners for 60 min at a constant temperature 60 c the emitters dry clogging substances were then analyzed by the x ray diffractometer manufacture bruker germany type d8

while the increased percentages for cu were 2 41 4 62 and 5 39 7 94 the significance analysis table s1 supplementary materials showed that the water salinity and fertilizer types had significant effects on di system dra and cu p 0 05 meanwhile significant differences for dra and cu among the majority of treatments were observed except the cu between up 4 and mkp 4 treatments table 4 p 0 05 even though positive linear correlations were found between ck and fertigation treatments in both dra and cu r2 0 93 fig 2 both up and mkp treatments accelerated the clogging process comparing with ck characterized by the larger slopes 1 of the fitting curves meanwhile the fitting curves slopes of the 4 g l 1 treatments were larger than the 2 g l 1 treatments which indicated that saline water concentrations had larger impacts on clogging parameters than the fertilizer type treatments 3 2 clogging distribution characteristics along drip irrigation laterals to determine the dynamic variations of emitter clogging distribution along the drip irrigation laterals outflows of each single emitter were collected nine times collectively during the operating period fig s3 supplementary materials the accumulative percentage of emitter clogging distributions in each treatment are illustrated in table 5 the clogging distribution in each treatment demonstrated the similar distribution characteristics as higher at the end followed by middle and front parts of drip irrigation laterals slight clogging usually occurred at first when the system operated for 48 60 h during the whole operation process partial and severe clogging occupied larger portions among different clogging degrees in average the severe and complete clogging continuously increased with the accumulated operating of the drip irrigation system at the end of the experiment comparing to ck 2 the percentages of severe clogging were increased by 0 67 3 11 and 4 44 13 5 and the complete clogging were 0 67 2 00 and 0 67 2 22 for up 2 and mkp 2 treatments respectively as well as under the ck 4 severe clogging was comparatively increased by 0 44 7 5 and 1 11 12 6 while complete clogging was by 0 67 2 44 and 5 78 8 89 to up 4 and mkp 4 respectively besides the overall clogging of the 4 g l 1 treatments were obviously more serious than the 2 g l 1 treatments 3 3 clogging substance quantities and mineral components according to the statistical analysis the water salinity and fertilizer types had significant effects on dw p 0 05 table s1 supplementary materials the positive linear correlations of clogging substances dry weights among different treatments are displayed in fig 3 r2 0 95 although significant differences were obtained among different treatments table 6 by comparing the up and mkp fertilizer treatments the emitter clogging substances dry weight in ck 2 were decreased by 12 1 29 1 and 26 7 39 2 while under ck 4 were decreased by 4 98 7 53 and 17 9 22 0 respectively the fitting curve slopes were in accordance with those of the clogging parameters so that more clogging substances accumulated resulted in more serious emitter clogging degrees the components of the clogging substances were characterized then using xrd diffraction the variations of mineral components in each treatment are presented in fig 4 taking e1 as the example and the others are summarized in fig s4 in the supplementary materials as it can be seen from the figures the basic mineral components observed from xrd were carbonates caco3 camg co3 2 quartz sio2 muscovite k mg al 2 04 si3 34al0 66 o10 oh 2 chlorite mg al 6 si al 4o10 oh 8 and limited quantities of other minerals including hydrotalcite mg6al2 co3 oh 16 4 h2o anorthite caal2si2o8 and hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3 oh 3 4 dynamic variations of mineral components the primary mineral components mentioned in preliminary section carbonates quartz and silicates among different treatments were further analyzed all the three mineral components presented a positive linear correlation fig 5 although three components all showed positive linear correlations among treatments involved which was the same as the clogging substances dry weights quartz contents did not vary significantly among different treatments table 6 p 0 05 the significant differences of the clogging substances dry weights mainly resulted from the carbonates and silicate contents table 6 p 0 05 comparing the treatment ck 2 the contents of carbonates in up 2 and mkp 2 increased by 14 9 22 0 and 8 06 30 5 while those of silicates were 3 85 46 4 and 4 62 57 6 respectively meanwhile comparing those under the ck 4 the treatments of up 4 and mkp 4 increased by 3 44 13 9 and 10 7 13 1 carbonates 4 10 19 0 quartz and 10 9 19 1 silicates respectively 4 discussion the excessive p application appears to be the main cause of excessive accumulated soil p concentration macdonald et al 2011 limited p mineral reserves and effective p management in agriculture withers et al 2014 mai et al 2018 remains a concern worldwide drip irrigation directly transports p with water to the root zone wang et al 2017 which increases p use efficiency keng et al 1979 however the most commonly used p fertilizers are slightly soluble and incompatible with the irrigation water mohammad et al 2004 causing precipitation and clogging of drip irrigation system especially when using the saline water xiao et al 2020 studying the effects of p fertilizer types on emitter clogging process and the mechanism between the saline water and p fertilizer would be benifical to increase irrigation uniformity and thus reduces the applied p worldwide every year in agriculture using drip irrigation technology lopez bucio et al 2000 4 1 correlations between single emitter s clogging degrees and drip irrigation discharge ratio variation and christiansen coefficient of uniformity previous studies revealed that partial or complete clogged emitters along the drip irrigation laterals drastically affect the system hydraulic performance application uniformity and reducing crop production bralts et al 1982 nakayama and bucks 1981 oliveira et al 2019 meanwhile partial clogging is more regular than complete clogging ravina et al 1992 puig bargués et al 2010 however their applied water types water quality characteristics and clogging degree were not identical to further quantify the correlations between clogging degrees and drip irrigation system performance more specific this study intended to draw the correlation at different clogging degrees as no clogging slight clogging partial clogging severe clogging and complete clogging pei et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 the related results were performed summarized in fig s5 supplementary materials and table 7 both the partial clogging and severe clogging emitters presented significant correlations with dra and cu this was mainly due to the portions of them were relatively largest in average table 5 which provided the majority of outflow values to calculate dra and cu meanwhile the no clogging and complete clogging emitters offered the extreme outflow values when calculating dra and cu and thus they were also significantly correlated only the slight clogging emitters did not have significant correlation with neither dra nor cu 4 2 influence of p on primary mineral components inside emitter in this study the overall findings indicated that the clogging substances and the three types of primary mineral components involved in each treatment were significantly affected by both water salinity level and fertilizer types table s1 supplementary materials however the interactions of water salinity level and fertilizer types merely showed significant impacts on the content of quartz without those of carbonates and silicates the results were similar with the findings obtained by li et al 2019 this can be attributed to comparatively large amount of ca2 mg2 hco3 co3 2 and so4 2 in saline water that easily leads to the precipitation tayel et al 2013 hao et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 stated that phosphates po4 3 would interact with ca2 mg2 fe3 and al3 those present in irrigation water and increased the formation of caco3 the results revealed that the carbonates in clogging substance comparatively increased with p applied up fertilizer performed better than mkp fertilizer because up fertilizer tended to reduce the ph of irrigation water yang et al 2019 while mkp acted as buffer solution which comparatively did not affect irrigation water ph value zhou et al 2018 in addition mkp fertilizer containing potassium hydride kh2 which is very reactive compound and phosphates po4 3 on the other hand fine sediment particles in water source would pass through the filter individually and transport with the water flow niu et al 2013 the flocculation of fine sediment particles is an important reason for the rapidly rising of quartz and silicate contents in emitters but the inactive quartz was not significantly affected by neither water salinity nor fertilizer type while silicate contents on the contrary although a couple of meaningful findings were acquired from present study however there are still some issues that need to be investigated in the future 1 for more comprehensive water and phosphorus fertilizer integration suitability research needs to carry out further research on different types of fertilizers and different irrigation water salinity gradients 2 as the irrigation water temperature and ph are the two important factors needs to further investigate the universality of these results and more suitable operating mode of phosphate fertilizer and saline water integrated application using drip irrigation 5 conclusions the following main conclusions were drawn from present study 1 applying up and mkp fertilizers in saline water drip irrigation system makes clogging issue more serious compared to ck dra of up and mkp treatments decreased by 2 62 6 71 and 7 43 11 7 while those for cu were 1 89 4 88 and 5 39 8 47 respectively this was closely related to the clogging distribution characteristics of the single emitters along drip irrigation laterals 2 the accumulated clogging substances and their primary mineral components carbonates quartz and silicates significantly increased after applying p fertilizer p 0 05 up treatments performed relatively better than mkp treatments as it decreased irrigation water ph and thus controlled the formation of carbonates and silicates to some extent 3 clogging parameters dra and cu clogging substances contents and their components of each treatment all showed positive linear correlations with those of the ck treatment p 0 05 irrigation water salinity had larger impact on emitter clogging process

10433,phosphorus p is an essential element for crop production drip irrigation di system mainly because of its high precision allows effective application of water soluble p fertilizers however consecutive input of p fertilizer would react with ions in the water source especially when using the saline water containing high concentration of ions consequently the integration of p fertilizer and saline water results in more complicated and serious di emitter clogging which may damage the whole irrigation system therefore an in situ field study was conducted to study the impacts of saline water concentrations 2 g l 1 and 4 g l 1 and water soluble p fertilizer types urea phosphate up and mono potassium phosphate mkp on di system performance the results indicated that both up and mkp application aggravated the emitter clogging process and decreased the system discharge variation ratio dra and christiansen coefficient of uniformity cu by 2 62 11 7 and 1 89 7 94 respectively up treatments performed better than mkp treatments in anti clogging abilities as it increased the di system dra 4 81 5 78 and cu 2 98 3 59 besides the impacts were significantly enhanced by higher water salinity the system performance indicators were closely related to the chemical precipitations inside emitters especially the relative contents and variations of the primary components carbonates quartz and silicates up performed better than mkp mainly because it lowered water ph and thus significantly reduced precipitation overall clogging parameters dra and cu clogging substances and the components of fertigation treatments all showed positive linear correlations with controlled treatments that without fertilizer applied ck 2 and ck 4 the slopes of the fitting curves and significance analysis results combined demonstrated that the water salinity had larger impact on emitter clogging process than fertilizer types present study offered references to fertilizer application using saline water to maintain drip irrigation system s benefits keywords phosphate fertigation saline water irrigation chemical precipitations drip irrigation system 1 introduction phosphorus p is important for plant growth plant metabolism and energy transformation zohar et al 2010 resulting in total p concentration between 0 1 0 5 of a plant s dry weight liu et al 2015 bhattacharya 2019 however the physical process including absorption desorption and precipitation dissolution schneider et al 2019 made p fertilizer immobile such as ca p fe p mg p ai p and lowered the efficiency of p fertilizer as 25 available for plant uptake uzokwe et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 the continuous excessive application of p fertilizer results in eutrophication and accumulates in soils álvarez et al 2018 and potential risks in aquatic environments sharpley et al 2015 smith et al 2015 drip irrigation with outstanding advantage in greater precision has improved the efficiency and availability of water soluble p fertilizers by supplying it along with water to the crop root zones through enclosed irrigation lines keng et al 1979 bacon and davey 1989 li et al 2019 minimizing nutrient leaching groundwater contamination and non point source pollution lombi et al 2005 however drip fertigation combined application of liquid fertilizer and irrigation water may lead to the chemical precipitation in drip emitters mikkelsen 1989 enciso medina et al 2007 as p fertilizer contains hpo4 2 that would react with ca2 and mg2 which form insoluble cahpo4 or mghpo4 precipitates mikkelsen 1989 and lead to drip irrigation clogging liu et al 2017 previous studies haynes 1985 hopkins et al 2010 found that the emitter clogging characteristics were extensively varied with different fertilizer types mikkelsen 1989 experimentally indicated that acidic p fertilizer mainly urea phosphate up may effectively mitigate the emitter clogging issue on the other hand the rate of emitter clogging was also greatly associated with water quality characteristics nakayama and bucks 1991 li et al 2019 moreover the widespread saline water is increasingly being accepted as an alternative water resource for irrigation chen et al 2009 jalali et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 saline water containing high concentration of cations such as fe2 mn2 ca2 mg2 and anions such as co3 2 po4 3 so4 2 sio3 2 oh often resulted in serious clogging issues dehghanisanij et al 2007 li et al 2019 especially when combined with fertilizer application the inter reaction between p fertilizer and appreciable concentrations of ca2 or mg2 in the water source zhou et al 2018 as well as poor p fertilizer management peragón et al 2017 triggered the chemical precipitation in drip irrigation system so far no study had explicitly described the coupling mechanism of p fertilizers and saline water on drip irrigation clogging yet therefore an in situ field experiment was conducted to 1 study the impacts of p fertilizer along with saline water on clogging characteristics of drip irrigation emitters 2 explore the dynamic variation of chemical precipitations accumulated in drip irrigation emitters 3 compare the effects of salinity level of irrigation water and fertilizer types on the clogging process 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and drip irrigation emitters used the field experiment was conducted at the irrigation experimental station located at bayinaoer arid area inner mongolia china 106 98 e 40 39 n with an altitude of 1072 m the average daily temperature during the experiment ranged from 38 7 c to 26 3 c the study was conducted utilizing saline water having total dissolved salts tds concentrations of 2 g l 1 and 4 g l 1 water directly transported from local saline lakes and two types of water soluble p fertilizers were applied urea phosphate up mono potassium phosphate mkp with the fertilizer concentration of 0 2 g l 1 those treatments without fertilizer were regarded as the controlled treatments ck six treatments in total are summarized in table 1 stirring devices were used in fertilizer tanks to maintain the constant concentration during system operation by the end of experiment the total quantity of applied p was 44 7 kg in each treatment which was equivalent to 837 kg ha 1 when 9000 m long drip irrigation lateral were laid per hectare irrigation water ph and temperature measurements were done every day at 10 00 a m using thermometer type o 264wt range 10 300 manufacturer dretec japan and summarized in fig s1 supplementary materials the other water quality parameters were sampled after each 100 h of system operation during experiment and the average standard deviation values are presented in table 2 six separate testing units fig 1 were applied to satisfy six treatments mentioned above each testing unit consisted four layers each of which was using one type of non pressure compensating drip irrigation emitter these four types of emitters were treated as replications and their geometrical parameters are presented in table 3 in this experiment 15 m long and 16 mm internal diameter drip irrigation laterals containing 45 emitters each were used each type of emitter was facilitated with eight laterals sampling the clogging substances at different operating hours a homogeneous filtration system consisting the grit chamber sand filter media filtering size 0 9 1 3 mm disc filter 105 μm and screen filters 120 μm were used at the system head the testing system was operated 432 h in total on the daily basis of 8 h per day 8 00 a m 12 00 p m 2 00 p m 6 00 p m from july 25th to september 30th 2018 the emitter outflow was collected after each 48 h of system operation at a constant working pressure of 0 1 mpa for each layer the time span for outflow measurements were set up as 5 min per sample a high precision electronic balance benpu suzhou china 2204n 10 4 g accuracy was used to weight the outflows collected in the buckets 2 2 drip laterals hydraulic performance assessment the discharge ratio variation dra and christiansen coefficient of uniformity cu allows evaluating the emitter outflow variations along the drip irrigation laterals liu et al 2019 and were computed with the following equations 1 d r a i n q i t q i 0 n 100 2 q t i 1 n q i t n 3 c u 100 1 i 1 n q i t q t n q t whereas q i 0 is the emitter initial outflow of the no i emitter l h 1 q i t is the no i emitter outflow tested at the sampling time t l h 1 q t is average outﬂow of emitters along the lateral at the sampling time t l h 1 and n is the total number of emitters along the lateral 2 3 characteristics of the single emitter clogging distribution emitter clogging distribution characteristics were assessed based on the ratio of the single emitter s tested outflow to its initial outflow the clogging percentages were then assigned to a predetermined range and the number of emitters within different percentage ranges was then tabulated giving the proportion of emitters within each range the clogging categories were classified as no clogging 95 slight clogging 80 95 partial clogging 50 80 severe clogging 20 50 and complete clogging 20 pei et al 2014 2 4 clogging substances sampling and evaluation during the experiment a total of eight sampling events at 96 h 144 h 192 h 240 h 288 h 336 h 384 h and 432 h of system operation were taken respectively to analyze the clogging substances in drip irrigation emitters at each sampling event twelve emitters from each treatment were cut out randomly from the front middle and end parts of laterals a high precision electronic weight balance accuracy 10 4 g was used to weigh the emitter samples and then placed in the zip lock bags hereafter 20 ml deionized water was added to remove the clogging substances using an ultrasonic cleaner manufacturer chaowei type gvs 10 l working rate of power 240 w frequency 60 hz to obtain the dry clogging substances emitter samples were treated in ultrasonic cleaners for 60 min at a constant temperature 60 c the emitters dry clogging substances were then analyzed by the x ray diffractometer manufacture bruker germany type d8 advance to get polycrystalline diffraction patterns the diffractometer worked with voltage of 40 kv and electric current of 40 ma cu was applied as the target and the wave length was 1 5406 å then the patterns were analyzed by the topas bruker corp software to obtain the mineral contents and components of the clogging substances 2 5 statistical analysis data were subjected to statistical analysis using spss ver 19 0 ibm usa the significance of the independent variable was determined at p 0 05 paired t test was applied to determine significant difference among treatments the differences of clogging parameters dra and cu dw and mineral components among water salinity fertilizer types emitter structures and their interactions were determined using the multiple factor analysis of variance anova linear regression model analysis was used to investigate the potential main effects of treatments verma et al 2015 3 results and analysis 3 1 drip irrigation lateral hydraulic performance dra and cu of the drip irrigation systems under different treatments demonstrated a decedent trend with the accumulated system operation which indicated various degrees of clogging occurred during the operation period in the preliminary stage dra and cu reduction was observed with nonlinear gradual trend afterwards they both started accelerated linear reduction with the increase in system operation fig s2 supplementary materials overall the emitter clogging was becoming worse after fertigation at the end of system operation dra of up 2 and mkp 2 decreased by 2 62 6 71 and 7 43 11 7 comparing to those of ck 2 while their cu reduced by 1 89 4 88 and 5 57 8 47 respectively similar trend was obtained in ck 4 as its dra was 2 83 4 86 and 8 59 10 6 larger than those of up 4 and mkp 4 respectively while the increased percentages for cu were 2 41 4 62 and 5 39 7 94 the significance analysis table s1 supplementary materials showed that the water salinity and fertilizer types had significant effects on di system dra and cu p 0 05 meanwhile significant differences for dra and cu among the majority of treatments were observed except the cu between up 4 and mkp 4 treatments table 4 p 0 05 even though positive linear correlations were found between ck and fertigation treatments in both dra and cu r2 0 93 fig 2 both up and mkp treatments accelerated the clogging process comparing with ck characterized by the larger slopes 1 of the fitting curves meanwhile the fitting curves slopes of the 4 g l 1 treatments were larger than the 2 g l 1 treatments which indicated that saline water concentrations had larger impacts on clogging parameters than the fertilizer type treatments 3 2 clogging distribution characteristics along drip irrigation laterals to determine the dynamic variations of emitter clogging distribution along the drip irrigation laterals outflows of each single emitter were collected nine times collectively during the operating period fig s3 supplementary materials the accumulative percentage of emitter clogging distributions in each treatment are illustrated in table 5 the clogging distribution in each treatment demonstrated the similar distribution characteristics as higher at the end followed by middle and front parts of drip irrigation laterals slight clogging usually occurred at first when the system operated for 48 60 h during the whole operation process partial and severe clogging occupied larger portions among different clogging degrees in average the severe and complete clogging continuously increased with the accumulated operating of the drip irrigation system at the end of the experiment comparing to ck 2 the percentages of severe clogging were increased by 0 67 3 11 and 4 44 13 5 and the complete clogging were 0 67 2 00 and 0 67 2 22 for up 2 and mkp 2 treatments respectively as well as under the ck 4 severe clogging was comparatively increased by 0 44 7 5 and 1 11 12 6 while complete clogging was by 0 67 2 44 and 5 78 8 89 to up 4 and mkp 4 respectively besides the overall clogging of the 4 g l 1 treatments were obviously more serious than the 2 g l 1 treatments 3 3 clogging substance quantities and mineral components according to the statistical analysis the water salinity and fertilizer types had significant effects on dw p 0 05 table s1 supplementary materials the positive linear correlations of clogging substances dry weights among different treatments are displayed in fig 3 r2 0 95 although significant differences were obtained among different treatments table 6 by comparing the up and mkp fertilizer treatments the emitter clogging substances dry weight in ck 2 were decreased by 12 1 29 1 and 26 7 39 2 while under ck 4 were decreased by 4 98 7 53 and 17 9 22 0 respectively the fitting curve slopes were in accordance with those of the clogging parameters so that more clogging substances accumulated resulted in more serious emitter clogging degrees the components of the clogging substances were characterized then using xrd diffraction the variations of mineral components in each treatment are presented in fig 4 taking e1 as the example and the others are summarized in fig s4 in the supplementary materials as it can be seen from the figures the basic mineral components observed from xrd were carbonates caco3 camg co3 2 quartz sio2 muscovite k mg al 2 04 si3 34al0

variations of mineral components the primary mineral components mentioned in preliminary section carbonates quartz and silicates among different treatments were further analyzed all the three mineral components presented a positive linear correlation fig 5 although three components all showed positive linear correlations among treatments involved which was the same as the clogging substances dry weights quartz contents did not vary significantly among different treatments table 6 p 0 05 the significant differences of the clogging substances dry weights mainly resulted from the carbonates and silicate contents table 6 p 0 05 comparing the treatment ck 2 the contents of carbonates in up 2 and mkp 2 increased by 14 9 22 0 and 8 06 30 5 while those of silicates were 3 85 46 4 and 4 62 57 6 respectively meanwhile comparing those under the ck 4 the treatments of up 4 and mkp 4 increased by 3 44 13 9 and 10 7 13 1 carbonates 4 10 19 0 quartz and 10 9 19 1 silicates respectively 4 discussion the excessive p application appears to be the main cause of excessive accumulated soil p concentration macdonald et al 2011 limited p mineral reserves and effective p management in agriculture withers et al 2014 mai et al 2018 remains a concern worldwide drip irrigation directly transports p with water to the root zone wang et al 2017 which increases p use efficiency keng et al 1979 however the most commonly used p fertilizers are slightly soluble and incompatible with the irrigation water mohammad et al 2004 causing precipitation and clogging of drip irrigation system especially when using the saline water xiao et al 2020 studying the effects of p fertilizer types on emitter clogging process and the mechanism between the saline water and p fertilizer would be benifical to increase irrigation uniformity and thus reduces the applied p worldwide every year in agriculture using drip irrigation technology lopez bucio et al 2000 4 1 correlations between single emitter s clogging degrees and drip irrigation discharge ratio variation and christiansen coefficient of uniformity previous studies revealed that partial or complete clogged emitters along the drip irrigation laterals drastically affect the system hydraulic performance application uniformity and reducing crop production bralts et al 1982 nakayama and bucks 1981 oliveira et al 2019 meanwhile partial clogging is more regular than complete clogging ravina et al 1992 puig bargués et al 2010 however their applied water types water quality characteristics and clogging degree were not identical to further quantify the correlations between clogging degrees and drip irrigation system performance more specific this study intended to draw the correlation at different clogging degrees as no clogging slight clogging partial clogging severe clogging and complete clogging pei et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 the related results were performed summarized in fig s5 supplementary materials and table 7 both the partial clogging and severe clogging emitters presented significant correlations with dra and cu this was mainly due to the portions of them were relatively largest in average table 5 which provided the majority of outflow values to calculate dra and cu meanwhile the no clogging and complete clogging emitters offered the extreme outflow values when calculating dra and cu and thus they were also significantly correlated only the slight clogging emitters did not have significant correlation with neither dra nor cu 4 2 influence of p on primary mineral components inside emitter in this study the overall findings indicated that the clogging substances and the three types of primary mineral components involved in each treatment were significantly affected by both water salinity level and fertilizer types table s1 supplementary materials however the interactions of water salinity level and fertilizer types merely showed significant impacts on the content of quartz without those of carbonates and silicates the results were similar with the findings obtained by li et al 2019 this can be attributed to comparatively large amount of ca2 mg2 hco3 co3 2 and so4 2 in saline water that easily leads to the precipitation tayel et al 2013 hao et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 stated that phosphates po4 3 would interact with ca2 mg2 fe3 and al3 those present in irrigation water and increased the formation of caco3 the results revealed that the carbonates in clogging substance comparatively increased with p applied up fertilizer performed better than mkp fertilizer because up fertilizer tended to reduce the ph of irrigation water yang et al 2019 while mkp acted as buffer solution which comparatively did not affect irrigation water ph value zhou et al 2018 in addition mkp fertilizer containing potassium hydride kh2 which is very reactive compound and phosphates po4 3 on the other hand fine sediment particles in water source would pass through the filter individually and transport with the water flow niu et al 2013 the flocculation of fine sediment particles is an important reason for the rapidly rising of quartz and silicate contents in emitters but the inactive quartz was not significantly affected by neither water salinity nor fertilizer type while silicate contents on the contrary although a couple of meaningful findings were acquired from present study however there are still some issues that need to be investigated in the future 1 for more comprehensive water and phosphorus fertilizer integration suitability research needs to carry out further research on different types of fertilizers and different irrigation water salinity gradients 2 as the irrigation water temperature and ph are the two important factors needs to further investigate the universality of these results and more suitable operating mode of phosphate fertilizer and saline water integrated application using drip irrigation 5 conclusions the following main conclusions were drawn from present study 1 applying up and mkp fertilizers in saline water drip irrigation system makes clogging issue more serious compared to ck dra of up and mkp treatments decreased by 2 62 6 71

proposed method and model can provide a valuable tool to evaluate and promote the coordination between the agricultural economy water quality safety and sustainable development of local agricultural water resources keywords carrying capacity fuzzy comprehensive evaluation dempster shafer evidence theory structure optimization water quality characteristics of water requirement 1 introduction with the development of the economy and society in recent years the dramatic changes in water consumption and pollutant discharge year after year force necessitate consideration of the issues of utilization and allocation of agricultural water resources wang et al 2019 in the area of water shortage the problem and stress from water resources on economic development has become increasingly clear and even threatens the economic and social development region especially in arid and semi arid areas the problem of water resources has become a bottleneck restricting social development the analysis and evaluation of water resource carrying capacity wrcc can provide decision support for the sustainable utilization of water resources and play an important role in solving contradictions in regional water resources and promoting social and economic development zhu et al 2010 wang et al 2018 in addition in most countries agricultural water accounts for the highest proportion among water use industries namely domestic water industrial water agricultural water and ecological water however the utilization rate and the comprehensive benefits of agricultural water resources are generally low and the contradiction between supply and demand is prominent meng et al 2018 research on the combination of wrcc and optimal allocation is still lacking and practical implementation of the conclusions is difficult agricultural water resource carrying capacity awrcc can be used to evaluate the utilization and development potential of water resources thus it is of significance to carry out the combination of evaluation of awrcc and the study of agricultrural water resource optimization in areas of water shortage determining the awrcc is a typical task in the area of sustainable agricultural development and awrcc is a subcategory of wrcc wrcc is defined as the maximum exploitable scale of regional water resources that guarantees a good water ecological environment system which depends on many factors such as regional natural environment water resources economic structure and technology level zhang et al 2019a 2019b shi and qu 1992 rational evaluation of wrcc can provide decision support for sustainable utilization of water resources and sustainable development of regional societies si et al 2013 zhang et al 2019a 2019b wrcc is most often evaluated by a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model which analyzes the influencing factors of the research area wang et al 2010 in this model selecting the valid indicators and determining appropriate weights of these indicators are two important steps to conduct overall evaluation first the representative indicators should be carefully selected for example chen and wu 2014 used principal component analysis pca to extract three principal components from 13 indicators that affect the wrcc to evaluate the wrcc of southern jiangsu from 2002 to 2012 li et al 2011selected six indicators that can reflect the water resources quantity and quality and used the analysis hierarchy process ahp to determine the weight of indicators and evaluated the wrcc of erhai basin from the perspective of science integrity the combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis and the feasibility principle wang et al 2004 have put forward four categories i e comparability equilibrium efficiency and limitation including 16 evaluation indicators too many indicators may lead to low efficiency while too few may lead to loss of complete information the criteria used to select the indicators are very important for the objectivity and accuracy in the follow up analysis song et al 2011 at present too many selection of carrying capacity evaluation indicators leads to complex calculation and information overlap or too few indicators leads to inaccurate evaluation in this paper the pca method is improved to select evaluation indicators considering the correlation between indicators the importance of indicators in the principal components and the contribution rate of principal components so as to obtain a more comprehensive and appropriate evaluation index simultaneously it is very important to determinate the weight for the indicators in a scientific manner at present ahp and the entropy weight method ewm are commonly used to calculate the weight the former is based on expert scoring and the results are realistic however to a large extent it is dependent on the experience of the person who evaluates the data wang et al 2018 the latter determines the weight according to the size of indicator variability and reflects the nature of the data itself but it is difficult to completely reflect the importance of each indicator wu et al 2017 it is important to objectively handle the differences between indicators which are dependent on the experience of individuals both methods have advantages and disadvantages it is better to combine these two methods to obtain comprehensive weights which can not only avoid possible contradictions but also make up for their shortcomings pathak et al 2017 dempster shafer evidence theory d s evidence theory has performed well in multi attribute data fusion and is widely used in information fusion expert system and decision analysis zhao et al 2020 hu et al 2019 applied d s evidence theory to comprehensively analyze the effects of different emission reduction strategies from the perspective of the public government managers researchers experts and other subjects therefore this paper introduces d s evidence theory to determine the comprehensive weight combining the advantages of the two weight methods so as to achieve the more reasonable weight the existing agricultural optimization models mainly focus on either crop structure or water quantity or both with the objective of maximizing economic benefits aljanabi et al 2018 developed an agricultural irrigation reclaimed wastewater allocation optimization model to maximize the net benefit ghasemi et al 2016 presented a novel approach to cropping patterns and water allocation optimization at the farm level peng et al 2018 took the total amount of agricultural water consumption and irrigation water intake as constraints and adopted the threshold value of agricultural development area under the measures of optimizing irrigation system and adjusting planting structure ou et al 2013 built a decomposition and coordination model with the objective of maximizing total crop yield in irrigation areas and combined improved a real coding genetic algorithm with a decomposing and coordinating iterative algorithm to solve the model however the establishment logic and assessment index of the model are not clear and there is no quantitative analysis combined with the status of the research area in the models also the current models may not fully consider the characteristics of crop water demand and the objectives and constraints are often related to the total irrigation water without the parameter of period it is possible that the total amount of irrigation water is large and the economic benefit is great but the monthly irrigation water is insufficient or even cut off agriculture is generally divided into five industrial categories planting animal husbandry forestry fishery and sideline however the relevant studies have mainly focused on the economic benefits of planting animal husbandry is the second largest water user in agriculture yet its economic benefits cannot be ignored coordinated development of the crop and livestock industry is an important aspect to promote the structural reform of agricultural supply side yu et al 2017 constructed a multi objective linear programming model aiming at the imbalance development of the crop and livestock structure in daxinganling agricultural reclamation in addition the joint operation model of water quantity and quality aims to reduce the pollution discharge to the water source in the downstream of yang river but it lacks the consideration of the ability of self purification of a river in the study of water quantity optimization the modeling scale is usually year or the water sensitive coefficients is the same in the whole growth period which may simplify the computation but results in low precision and even the extreme situation of imbalanced water supply therefore how to appropriately allocate the agricultural water and make the full use of the limited water resources are the problems that this study aims to solve in the yang river basin the water consumption and pollution of the forestry fishery and sideline industries are small therefore they were not included in his study which focuses on crops and livestock in this work we select the model decision variables by combining the awrcc focusing on the growth characteristics of crops and livestock the water quality model is based on the concentration of water quality factors rather than the total amount of emissions this study attempts to propose an awrcc evaluation method and joint optimization model of water quantity and quality to evaluate the situation of agricultural water resources and optimize agricultural planting raising structure and irrigation water allocation also fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is adopted in awrcc evaluation to obtain comprehensive evaluation indicators and the corresponding weight which can 1 consider the relationship between the indicators such as relativity and individual contribution rate 2 determine the stable and sensitive subjective weight of indicators 3 obtain the comprehensive weight of evaluation indicators considering subjective and objective factors 4 provide a reference for the evaluation of the awrcc additionally the planting raising structure optimization and joint optimization of water quantity and quality are considered to achieve optimal allocation of water resources in one framework that can 1 establish an agricultural water resources model by a novelly introduced awrcc evaluation from the perspective of optimization 2 consider the ability of the river to self purify 3 avoid on imbalanced water supply on the concept of characteristics of water requirement for crops and livestock then both the awrcc evaluation and optimal allocation model of water resources were applied to a real problem in the yang river basin a typical water shortage and polluted region in china to verify its validity overall the study results evaluate the awrcc and optimize agricultural planting raising structure and water allocation this study provides insight into agricultural structure planning and water resources utilization in areas that have water shortages and pollution with coordinated and sustainable development between the environment and the economy 2 evaluation of awrcc by the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method synthesizes many indicators that affect water resources by using the fuzzy membership calculation and then obtains the specific values to evaluate the level of awrcc the steps are as follows step 1 selection of evaluation indicators awrcc is affected by many factors each factor is an indicator and all factors consist of a set of indicators generally the important indicators are selected by experience or the specific method such as pca let u i represents the selected evaluation indicator where i 1 2 m then the evaluation indicator set u is expressed as 1 u u 1 u 2 u m step 2 determination of weight of the indicators the importance of each evaluation expressed by weight is different let wi represents the weight of u i where i 1 2 m then the evaluation weight set w is expressed and meets certain conditions as follows 2a w w 1 w 2 w m 2b i 1 m w i 1 0 w i 1 step 3 classification of the evaluation level the status of the evaluation object is divided into several levels let vj represents the evaluation level where j 1 2 n usually n equals a number between 3 and 5 then the indicator level set v is expressed as 3 v v 1 v 2 v n step 4 establishment of the fuzzy membership matrix let rij represent the membership of ui belonging to vj then a fuzzy membership matrix r that maps from u to v can be obtained zhang and ma 2015a and expressed as 4 r r 11 r 12 r 1 n r 21 r 22 r 2 n r m 1 r m 2 r m n step 5 calculation of the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation matrix let bj represent a comprehensive membership of all evaluation indicators to the level vj according to r and w the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation matrix can be obtained as follows 5 b w r w 1 w 2 w m r 11 r 12 r 1 n r 21 r 22 r 2 n r m 1 r m 2 r m n b 1 b 2 b n step 6 calculation of the comprehensive evaluation value let gj represent the evaluation score of each level where j 1 2 n then the comprehensive evaluation value is obtained as follows 6 s a w r c c j 1 n g i b j finally the s a w r c c of the evaluation object can be calculated then the awrcc level can be evaluated according to the corresponding level of s 3 optimal modeling of water resources the optimal models of agricultural water resources in the existing research mainly focus on water allocation on an annual or monthly basis cui et al 2018 aljanabi et al 2018 as well as annual agricultural structural adjustment ou et al 2013 generally the model is established to determine the maximum agricultural economic benefits through the appropriate allocation of water resources the objective function is as follows 7a b e n e f i t s i n c o m e cost 7b i n c o m e i 1 i z 1 z p i z s

livestock s in subarea i in the model the area of crops s i z and the number of livestock n i s can be constant or variable as a constant the planting and raising structure are fixed to that t the model can avoid problems with optimal adjustment of these terms meanwhile the unit water allocation amount of the crop q i z and livestock q i s can be allocated in the scale of month or year since the water allocation amount will be affected by water requirement and rainfall the monthly agricultural irrigation plan can provide more efficient guidance involving the more complex problem solving the constraints of the model are water supply and demand constraints crop planting area constraints livestock number constraints and water quality constraints 1 water production function 8a y i z q i

all the decision variables must be nonnegative 4 data and methods 4 1 study area and problem statement the yang river is 278 km long and has a catchment area of approximately 16 000 km2 according to the outline of beijing tianjin hebei coordinated development plan the yang river basin area of zhangjiakou will build a green agricultural and sideline product base of beijing tianjin which has higher requirements for clean water production and ecological environment safety the main stream of the yang river is located in zhangjiakou and is 106 km and flows through the following ten subareas districts of zhangjiakou shangyi huaian wanquan chongli qiaodong qiaoxi xuanhua xiahuayuan huailai and zhuolu fig 1 these ten subareas are the research scope of the paper however with the development of production and climate change the contradiction between supply and demand is intensifying in the basin there are two major problems 1 water shortage the basin is precariously short of water where the water resource per capita is only 399 m3 less than one fifth of that in china moreover the runoff has a noticeable seasonal variation in that the volume in july and august accounts for 28 of the annual total the agricultural water consumption in zhangjiakou accounts for about 72 87 of the total therefore it is necessary to find an optimal allocation of agriculture water resources 2 serious water pollution the regional economy of the yang river basin is dominated by traditional planting and animal husbandry the methods of agricultural planning are not very advanced a large amount of fertilizer and pesticide is not utilized efficiently thus large amounts of livestock manure flow into the water source in the downstream portion of the yang river along with rainwater and irrigation water as a result the problem of pollution in the basin is becoming increasingly serious leading to poor water quality indexes such as ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and chemical oxygen demand cod in the assessment section of yang river basin which threatens the safety of water supply and ecological environment in the region and downstream therefore it is necessary to evaluate the status of local agriculture based on awrcc and take corresponding measures to improve the situation of agricultural water resources in the yang river basin the limited agricultural water resources should be allocated efficiently so as to realize the scientific and sustainable development of the local economy and water environment 4 2 framework the technical framework of the proposed methodology is shown in fig 2 as demonstrated the methodology consists of two major components 1 first an improved pca is proposed to select the awrcc evaluation indicators rationally then the paper introduces ahp to obtain the subjective weight of evaluation indicators and improves the entropy weight method to obtain the more objective weight of evaluation indicator furthermore d s evidence theory is introduced to combine subjective and objective weights to obtain the comprehensive weights of the indicators finally the evaluation results of awrcc are obtained through membership calculation 2 based on the evaluation results of the awrcc the optimization model is established on the premise of meeting the constraints of water quantity and quality then taking into account the water requirement characteristics this paper proposes a water allocation method based on the characteristics of water requirement in whole growth period of crops and livestock in the model the measures of reducing the pollution from the sources and purifying river by supplementary water are introduced to improve the water quality thus to maximize agricultural economic benefits and to meet water quality standard are two aspects to be traded off finally our proposed methods are realized by the two major components in 1 and 2 4 3 data sources and parameter determination the data are mainly from the zhangjiakou statistical yearbook 2006 2016 zhangjiakou water resources bulletin 2006 2016 zhangjiakou environment bulletin 2014 and guanting reservoir ecological security investigation and evaluation report 2014 in equations 7 11 where i 1 2 10 represents shangyi district huaian district huailai district zhuolu district wanquan district chongli district qiaodong district qiaoxi district xuanhua district and xiahuayuan district respectively z 1 2 6 represents grain beans tubers oilseeds vegetables and fruits s 1 2 represents large livestock and small livestock t is the index of month where t 1 2 12 represents the month the water production functions of crops and livestock in each subarea are obtained by fitting based on the statistics 2006 2016 taking shangyi district as an example some data are shown in table 1 also the agricultural water consumption in 2014 is 43 649 million m³ of which the total water consumption of crops and livestock is 42847 71 million m³ the monthly flow rate of the yang river is 0 344 0 434 m s and the degradation coefficient of cod and nh3 n are 0 06 0 15 d 1 and 0 06 0 17 d 1 respectively 4 4 selection of the awrcc evaluation indicator based on improved pca one of the key points of the awrcc evaluation is to select the reasonable evaluation indicators there are too many variables influence factors in the agriculture system such as ratio of irrigated farmland utilization rate of agricultural water resources and water utilization coefficient of canal system which contain certain information related to the situation of water resources and probably have mutual overlaps or correlations in order to make the evaluation index system concise and effective it is necessary to avoid the repetition of index information and select a small number of representative indicators pca is used to exclude overlapping information with less loss as possible hu et al 2015 find principal components in form of the function of the variables and choose the variables with the largest load coefficient in each principal component as the evaluation indicators 4 4 1 selection of evaluation indicator by pca the implementation steps of pca are as follows 1 standardize the initial evaluation indicators to eliminate the dimensional influence of each evaluation indicator value as follows 12 u i j u i j u j s j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m where n is the sample index m is the total number of evaluation indicators u i j and u i j are the original value and standardized value of the j th evaluation indicator of the i th sample and u j and s j are the sample mean value and sample standard deviation of the j th indicator respectively 2 calculate the correlation coefficient matrix r r i j m m and select t pairs of indicators with extremely significant correlation the element r i j reflects the degree of correlation between each indicator by equation 13 13 r i j k 1 m u k i u i u k j u j k 1 m u k i u i 2 u k i u j 2 i j 1 2 m 3 obtain the eigenvalues λ 1 λ 2 λ m in descending order by solving the characteristic equation r λ e 0 and then calculate the contribution rate δ 1 δ 2 δ m and cumulative contribution rate δ 1 δ 2 δ m by equations 14a and 14b finally choose the principal components 1 y 2 y p p m whose cumulative contribution rates are more than 85 zhang et al 2015 14a δ i λ i i 1 m λ i i 1 2 m 14b δ i i 1 i δ i i 1 2 m 4 the eigenvector corresponding to the selected eigenvalue λ 1 λ 2 λ p is the factor load l i j of each principal component which reflects the influence degree of evaluation indicator x i j on principal component the relationship between the principal component y 1 y 2 y p and the evaluation indicator u 1 u 2 u m is represented as 15 y 1 l 11 u 1 l 12 u 2 l 1 m u m y 2 l 21 u 1 l 22 u 2 l 2 m u m y p l p 1 u 1 l p 2 u 2 l p m u m 5 select the representatives of each principal component with the largest absolute value of factor load as the indicators for the comprehensive evaluation 4 4 2 selection of evaluation indicator by the improved pca the traditional pca is used to selecting the representative of each principal component separately however it does not consider the status of the indicator in other principal components thus it is prone to lose the important information when the load coefficients are approximate to each other to deal with this the paper proposes an improved pca for selecting the evaluation indicators of awrcc which takes the correlation of the indicators the importance of indicators to the principal components and the contribution rate of principal components into consideration the previous steps are the same as those in the procedure steps 1 to 4 in the section 4 4 1 and then the improvement is carried out in the following steps 1 calculate the proportion of the i th variable in the j th principal component 16 α i j l i j i 1 m l i j i 1 2 m j 1 2 p 2 calculate the comprehensive score of the m th variable among the n principal components 17 s c i j 1 p α i j δ j i 1 2 m j 1 2 p 3 sort the comprehensive scores s c i of all variables in descending order for t pairs of indicators with extremely significant correlation procedure 1 in the section 4 4 1 eliminate the t t t duplicate indicators with the smaller score of each pair from m indicators u 1 u 2 u m then set the remaining m m t indicators u u 1 u 2 u m as the evaluation indicators of awrcc step 1 in the section 2 4 5 determining weight of awrcc evaluation indicators based on d s evidence theory taking into account both subjective and objective factors this paper now introduces the d s evidence theory to determine the comprehensive weight of evaluation indicators by combining the weights calculated by the methods of ahp and improved ewm 4 5 1 calculation of weight by ahp a 5 scale analysis hierarchy process ahp is adopted li et al 2019a in the paper the method overcomes the problem of the 9 scale method which needs more information and requires higher judgment on the importance of each indicator it also makes up for the disadvantages of the 3 scale method in judging loss of information consistency and accumulative superiority the traditional ahp requires consistency verification if it is not consistent some mathematical methods are used to adjust the judgment matrix which inevitably makes the problem more complicated the problems can be solved through constructing the consistency matrix supposing the anti symmetric matrix a and its optimal transfer matrix b then the completely consistent matrix of a can be obtained by a eb where a can retain the information of a to the greatest extent and meet requirements of consistency li et al 2019a 2019b the specific steps are as follows supposing that the a has element in the i th row and j th column as a i j then the element b i j in the i th row and j th column of the optimal transfer matrix b can ben calculated as 18 b i j 1 m k 1 m a i k a k j the element a i j in the i th row and j th column of the consistency matrix a is 19 a i j e b i j the characteristic vector w corresponding to the characteristic root λ of a satisfies a w λ w select the eigenvector corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue of a as w max and normalize w max to obtain the weight value w i a h p of the indicator i 4 5 2 calculation of weight by the improved entropy weight method the entropy weight method ewm determines the objective weight according to the variability of the indicator which can reflect the characteristic of the data itself generally the smaller the information entropy of the indicator is the greater the variation degree of the indicator is the more information it can provide namely the greater the role it can play in the comprehensive evaluation and the greater the weight the entropy weight method is as follows muzhikov et al 2018 1 the entropy of indicator is calculated as follows 20 e i 1 ln n i 1 m p j i ln p j i where ei is the entropy of the i th indicator i 1 2 3 m m is the total number of indicators j 1 2 3 n n is the total number of samples p j i is the probability of the j th sample in terms of the i th indicator 2 the weight of indicators of entropy weight method is calculated as follows 21 w e i 1 e i m i 1 m e i where w e i is the weight of the i th indicator in equation 21 when the indicator entropy value e i 1 the entropy weight method will cause the multiple change of w e i even if there is a small change between e i therefore shi 2019 improved entropy weight method model as follows 22 w e i i 1 m e i 1 2 e i i 1 m i 1 m e i 1 2 e i the model can solve the problems of the traditional entropy weight method in the case of e i 1 however the difference between entropy weights is small when the difference between entropy values is large for example if the entropy values are 0 999 0 998 0 001 and 0 002 then entropy weights can be calculated and are the following 0 1253 0 1255 0 3748 and 0 3745 it is found that the entropy weight of entropy 0 001 is not much greater than that of entropy 0 999 in order to solve this problem this paper further improves equation 23 as shown below 23 w i e w m w e i i 1 m e i 1 2 e i τ i 1 m i 1 m e i 1 2 e i τ where w i e w m is the weight value of the indicator and τ is the constant the larger the constant τ is the closer the solution is to the solution of equation 21 it is assumed to be 0 5 in order to verify the effectiveness of the improved method take four variables as examples and set four different entropy changes in the first case c1 slight change e i 1 0 999 0 998 0 997 0 996 in the second case c2 moderate entropy change e i 2 0 888 0 777 0 666 0 555 in the third case c3 when the entropy approaches 0 the slight change e i 3 0 004 0 003 0 002 0 001 in the fourth case the maximum change of entropy e i 4 0 999 0 998 0 001 0 002 the weights of four variables calculated by three entropy weight methods traditional ewm the improved ewm in muzhikov et al 2018 and the proposed ewm in the paper in four cases c1 c4 were compared as shown in table 2 it can be seen that in the case of c1 where ex 1 and the case of c3 where ex 0 the difference between entropy weights is small when the entropy values are close which indicates the traditional ewm is less stable specially in the case of c4 where the difference in entropy values is great the entropy weights corresponding to entropy values of 0 001 and 0 002 are much larger than those of 0 999 and 0 998 which indicates the improved ewm is more sensitive also in the case of c2 the difference between entropy weights is also moderate where the difference between the entropy values is moderate consequently it shows that the improved ewm can stably and sensitively determine the weight of evaluation indicators which verifies the method in this paper is reasonable and effective 4 5 3 combined determination of weighting based on d s evidence theory using the ahp and the improved ewm the subjective and objective weight of evaluation indicators are obtained both methods have advantages and disadvantages the ahp is based on expert scoring and the results are realistic but it depends on individual experience the ewm can determine the weight considering the degree of indicator variability and reflect the nature of the data itself but it is difficult to reflect the importance of each indicator completely consequently the paper will apply d s evidence theory to determine the comprehensive weight the probability assignment of evidence theory is represented by the basic probability assignment function pu et al 2016 suppose that the set of all possible decisions of a problem is the θ which is called a recognition frame and its elements are mutually exclusive the set 2θ represents all possible proposition sets containing all subsets of the θ definition 1 the set function m of θ 2θ 0 1 meets the following requirements 24a m ϕ 0 24b a θ m a 1 where m is the basic probability assignment function and it reflects the probability of proposition in the specific condition definition 2 let θ be the recognition frame and m 2θ 0 1 be the basic probability assignment function on θ 25 bel a b a m b a θ the defined function bel 2θ 0 1 is a reliability function on θ two or more independent confidence functions can be combined using the d s synthesis rule a new confidence function is obtained by calculating the orthogonal based on the confidence levels of different evidence sources definition 3 let bel1 and bel2 be the two reliability functions on the same recognition frame θ then the corresponding basic probability assignment functions are m1 and m2 and the focal elements are b i and c j respectively the d s composition rule is 26a m a m 1 m 2 θ 0 θ ϕ 1 1 k b i c j m 1 b i m 2 c j θ ϕ 26b 1 k b i c j ϕ m 1 b i m 2 c j where m a is the fusion of m1 and m2 k is the conflict degree of evidence the greater the k the greater the conflict degree the term 1 k is used to avoid assigning non zero probability to the normalization factor of empty set in this paper the ahp and the improved ewm are treated as two reliability functions the subjective w i a h p and objective w i e w m weights of evaluation indicators is treated as the basic probability assignment functions m1 and m2 the focus elements b i and c j are the evaluation indicators u u 1 u 2 u m and the comprehensive weight reset confidence function can be obtained through the d s evidence theory the probability assignment function m is the comprehensive weight value corresponding to evaluation indicator the comprehensive weights of the indicators take the subjective opinions of the experts and the objective influence of the indicator data into consideration which is more reasonable and is represented as w w 1 w 2 w m step 2 in section 2 4 6 selecting decision variables for the water resources allocation model based on evaluation of awrcc in order to establish the model for agricultural water resources considering the real situation the paper introduces the evaluation of awrcc to help determine the decision variables of the optimization model 4 6 1 selection of evaluation indicators according to the calculation steps in section 4 4 evaluation indicators are selected in order to avoid omitting important indicators 15 evaluation indicators shown in table 3 are selected based on literature research huan et al 2014 zhang and ma 2015a the process of selecting indicators is performed to develop agriculture that adheres to the principle of sustainable development in yang river basin following the procedures 1 4 in section 4 4 1 spss software is applied to calculate the correlation coefficients for the 15 indicators and their correlation coefficient matrix r r i j 15 15 table a1 in appendix a and six principal components y 1 y 2 y 6 are chosen of which cumulative contribution rate is 87 598 85 the contribution rate δ 1 δ 2 δ 6 and factor loading l 15 6 are calculated table a2 in appendix a the improved pca is performed on the indicators following the procedures 1 3 in section 4 4 2 the proportions of each indicator in terms of six principal components can be calculated by equation 16 table a3 in appendix a consequently the comprehensive score s c i can be calculated by equation 17 and sorted table a4 in appendix a finally the indicator with the largest load factor coefficient u u 1 u 2 u 9 can be selected as the evaluation indicators of awrcc for contrast the results of the traditional and improved pca are compared in table 4 the evaluation indicators selected by the proposed method are more than those selected by the traditional method although the traditional pca selected fewer indicators the computational complexity is reduced however the indicators of u 6 u 8 and u 15 have low correlation with the selected indicators and are the key factors affecting water quality and quantity which cannot be ignored huan et al 2014 zhang and ma 2015a in addition u5 u4 and u14 can be replaced with u 3 u 9 and u13 since they are indicator pairs of highly significant correlation therefore the results of the proposed method retain the indicators u 7 and u 10 or the alternative indicators u 5 u 4 u 14 u 3 u 9 u 13 and have not missed the important indicators u 6 u 8 and u 15 it shows the better performance which not only eliminates some redundant indicators but also avoids the disadvantages of too few indicators which may not enough to contain most of the indicator information 4 6 2 calculation of the weight of each indicators the evaluation indicators u u 1 u 1 u 9 are finally selected in section 4 6 1 therefore weight of evaluation indicators w w 1 w 1 w 9 is calculated based on w i a h p and w i e w m according to the section 4 5 3 the calculation data of w i e w m and w i a h p are shown in step 2 in appendix i table 5 is the evaluation indicator and the weight u w among nine indicators u 7 irrigation water per unit area u 8 water consumption per ten thousand cny of agricultural output value u 9 water use rate of ecological environment and u 10 annual per capita water resources have great influence on agricultural water resources in the yang river basin however u 9 and u 10 are mainly macro control at the government level which are less affected by water resources allocation therefore the optimal allocation of water resources should focus on u 7 and u 8 which are affected by structure and water allocation of crops and livestock in the maximizing of benefits given the limited water consumption and consequently the water resources allocation optimization model is established considering adjustment of planting and raising structure in the next section after detemining the evaluation indicator and the weight u w combined with the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation procedures in the section 2 the remaining steps 3 4 and 5 can be implemented to complete the evaluation s a w r c c of the awrcc in the yang river basin these results are shown in steps 3 6 in appendix i 4 7 optimization of planting raising structure and water allocation considering water quality requirement 4 7 1 agricultural structure optimization model establishment with water quality constraint according to the analysis in section 4 6 water allocation and structure adjustment of crops and livestock are issued in the model moreover the model is in the scale of month since the water allocation monthly can provide more efficient guidance simultaneously the problem of water environment pollution is becoming more and more serious and the requirement of water quality from the water source in the downstream of the yang river in view of the current situation of water pollution this paper further studies the optimal allocation of water quality and quantity on a monthly basis to realize the maximum agricultural economic benefits the objective function in section 3 is as follows 27a i n c o m e i 1 i z 1 z p i z s i z y i z q i z t i 1 i s 1 s n i s f i s q i s t 27b cost i 1 i η i z 1 z u i z s

the unit water allocation amount of the livestock s in subarea i m3 head s i z is the planting area of the crop z in subarea i hm2 n i s is the number of the livestock s in subarea i head the water quality is a constraint in the model there are mainly two methods to meet the requirement of water quality excluding the biochemical methods one is to reduce pollutants discharged into the river zhang et al 2014 chen et al 2019 and the other is to supplement water to the river bai et al 2017 the former method is direct but the regulating ability is limited the effect of the latter method is clear but it would consume irrigation water in order to meet the water quality requirement effectively this paper proposed to reduce pollutants discharged into the river and supplement water flowing to the river in the model the function of water allocation and pollutant is considered and the variable of the supplementary water is introduced to control the water quality thus it is to realize the tradeoff between maximizing agricultural economic benefits and meeting water quality standard the constraints of the model are mainly water supply and demand constraints crop planting area constraints livestock number constraints and water quality constraints 1 water production function 28a y q i z t a i z t 1 t q i z t e p i z t 2 b i z t 1 t q i z t e p i z t c i z 28b f q i s t b i s t 1 t q i s

concentration and target concentration of the water quality of assessment section in month t mg l w t is the total amount of discharged pollutants from the water for domestic and industrial use g wag r t is the amount of discharged pollutants from the agricultural use g q 0 is the initial flow m3 s l is the distance from sewage outlet to section m k t is the water quality degradation coefficient u t is the flow velocity m s φ i z and φ i s are the amount of pollutants per unit water of the crop z and livestock s in the subarea i respectively then the research model is built with the consideration of the objective and constraints it contains many decision variables containing areas number and water consumption of different crops and livestock in the subareas and particularly nonlinear objective function and constraints 4 7 2 water allocation based on the characteristics of water requirement in growth period in equation 28a the water production function describes the relationship between the yield of crops and the water consumption for simplification purposes the total water consumption during the growth period is chosen to calculate the yield without consideration to the characteristics of crop water demand regardless of the irrigation process given the water consumption imbalanced water supply may occur when pursuing economic benefits that is few months are allocated too much or too little water extremely the water allocation of individual month is very small and is even zero in order to satisfy the constraints such as water quality in this condition the yield calculated by the annual amount of water is not appropriate resulting in inaccurate economic benefits actually crops and livestock have different growth periods even for the same crop and livestock the water requirement and effective rainfall in different districts may be different in addition the effect of water shortage on crop yield is different in the stages of growth period which is expressed by the water sensitivity coefficient during periods of water shortage the larger the sensitivity coefficient the greater the yield reduction cui et al 2018 therefore this paper proposes a water allocation method based on the characteristics of water requirement in the whole growth period in particular the different water sensitivity coefficient is considered in terms of different crops and livestock in different districts irrigation water for crops can be allocated according to the monthly water requirement effective rainfall and water sensitive coefficient the water requirement is the water volume consumed for crop growth and effective rainfall is a supplement for water consumption the water sensitive coefficient reflects the impact of water shortage on the yield given the total water quantity the different irrigation water of each month during the year leads to different yield of crops it is assumed that the annual water allocation is q i z and so the monthly water allocation is 31a q i z t 0 e p i z t d i z t d i z t e p i z t λ i z t t 1 t λ i z t d i z t e p i z t q i z e p i z t d i z t 31b q i z t 1 t q i z t where q i z t is the unit water allocation amount of the crop z in month t in subarea i m3 hm2 d i z t and e p i z t are respectively the monthly water requirement and effective rainfall of the crop z in month t in subarea i m3 hm2 λ i z t is the water sensitive coefficient of the crop z in month t in subarea i according to equation 31 the water can be allocated evenly to each month and the condition of water shortage in each month is homologous which can effectively avoid imbalanced water supply based on this the impact of water shortage on the yield is considered by introducing the variable λ i z t also the dimension of the original problem is reduced and the computational cost is decreased similarly the growth water for the livestock can be allocated according to the monthly water requirement and the water sensitive coefficient it is assumed that the annual water allocation is q i s and the monthly water allocation is 32a q i s t d i s t λ i s t t 1 t d i s t λ i s t q i s 32b q i s t 1 t q i s t where q i s t is the unit water allocation amount of the livestock s in month t in subarea i m3 head d i s t is the monthly water requirement of the livestock s in month t in subarea i m3 hm2 λ i s t is the water sensitive coefficient of the livestock s in month t in subarea i consequently the model can be converted into monthly from annually by replacing q i z t and q i s t with q i z and q i s by equation 31 and 32 it can not only avoid the imbalance water allocation but also reduce the dimension of decision variables 5 results and discussion 5 1 optimization of agricultural planting and raising structure 5 1 1 analysis of optimization models in this paper the experiment runs on the platform with intel core i3 4 gb ram and 240 g hard disk and the model is implemented by matlab optimization toolbox table 6 shows the results of m1 m2 and m3 compared to the actual value m0 m1 represents the model with fixed agricultural structure m2 represents the model with adjustable agricultural structure but with an insensitivity coefficient and m3 represents the model with adjustable agricultural structure and a sensitivity coefficient that is proposed in the paper in the case of m1 the agricultural structure cannot be adjusted and the decision variables are water allocation monthly for crops and livestock excluding planting area and number of livestock in the cases of m2 and m3 the agricultural structure can be optimized and the decision variables are water allocation monthly for crops and livestock planting area and number of livestock the difference between m2 and m3 is whether the effect of water shortage on the monthly yield of crop and livestock is the same for m2 it is the same while for m3 it is different it can be seen from table 6 that compared with m0 the other three cases reduce the agricultural water allocation and improve agricultural economic benefits more importantly the water quality of the assessment section in the downstream of the yang river can meet the standard in the cases of m1 m2 and m3 which showed that optimization of water allocation and measure of water supplement are effective m2 and m3 obtained more economic benefits than m1 owing to adjusting the agricultural structure considering the different sensitivity of monthly water shortage the result of m3 has been more precise than that of m2 compared with the actual case m0 the optimal model m3 in this paper has reduced the agricultural water allocation from 4 28 to 4 14 billion m3 by 3 35 and increased the economic benefits from 136 404 to 152 726 billion cyn by 11 97 which shows that our proposal has superior performance than the other cases the results of the monthly concentration of cod and nh3 n of the assessment section in the downstream are shown in fig 3 the monthly concentration of nh3 n and cod can meet the water quality requirements of nh3 n 1 mg l and cod 20 mg l after optimization 5 1 2 results of planting raising structure and water allocation table 7 is the optimization results of m3 including the planting area of crops and livestock number and the annual water allocation of crops and livestock of each subarea in the yang river basin the annual water allocation can be allocated to month according to equations 31 and 32 then six crops in shangyi district are taken as an example the unit water allocation and the total unit water allocation monthly are shown in fig 4 the water allocation of crops and livestock in different subareas has the similar trend six crops have different growth periods and the peak of total unit water allocation monthly is mainly in june july and august after optimization the planting area and livestock number of the total ten subareas was maintained at 31944 hm2 and 213892 head respectively whereas proportions of crops and livestock respectively are shown in fig 5 combined with table 8 the results mainly increase the area of tubers and vegetables with high benefits and the number of large livestock and they decrease the area of oilseeds and grain with the low benefits as well as fruits with high pollutants and beans with low benefits table 8 shows the change of area number and water quantity of crops and livestock between m0 and m3 the planting areas of vegetables and tubers with high benefits have the larger increments between them the benefit and emission of tubers are less than that of vegetables also the increment of tubers is lightly larger than that of vegetables due to the consideration of water quality factor the vegetables tubers and large livestock will be given priority to allocate the water in order to improve the yield of water per unit water due to the limited water and the water consumption of oilseeds with high pollutant will be decreased to reduce the amount of pollutants to the river in livestock the water consumption of large livestock and small livestock are increased to promote benefits therefore the changes of area number and water quantity of crops and livestock are basically positively correlated with the benefits of unit area the results showed that the agricultural structure is being adjusted in the direction of increasing crops and livestock with high benefits while decreasing planting with low benefits or high pollutants as for livestock the number of large livestock of high benefit increased while that of small livestock decreased lightly 5 1 3 analysis of awrcc before and after optimization the awrcc of m1 m2 and m3 after optimization are calculated and the comparison of the evaluation scores of awrcc of subareas in the yang river basin is shown in fig 6 the changes of awrcc in the original situation m0 and optimizing the modeling with the fixed m1 or adjustable planting raising structure m2 and m3 are shown in fig 6 through the optimal allocation of water resources the awrcc has been improved from 0 297 to 0 302 while in the mode of adjustable planting raising structure the awrcc has the larger increment from 0 297 to 0 306 which indicates that the optimization of agricultural planting raising structure and water allocation are conducive to improving the awrcc which fully verifies the effectiveness of the model although it can be calculated more precisely considering crop production sensitivity coefficient its improvement effect of awrcc is not very noticeable in the case of m3 due to the limited agricultural resources 8 subareas increased while 2 subareas decreased as a whole the level of 10 subareas which the comprehensive evaluation value belong to has fallen between the saturated and the transition state and has been improved therefore the awrcc in yang river basin is improved and the whole subareas are improved which fully verifies the effectiveness of the model in order to further explore the method to improve of awrcc it is necessary to observe the relation between the indicators and awrcc as shown in table 9 only u 7 u 8 and u 13 among the indicators u 3 u 6 u 7 u 8 u 9 u 10 u 12 u 13 u 15 u3 changed before and after optimization and the remaining indicators did not vary because of independent of water resources allocation moreover among these three indicators u 13 indicator has little influence on awrcc due to its small variation and small weight therefore awrcc is mainly affected by u 7 and u 8 1 in table 9 u 7 u 8 and the awrcc increase in huailai qiaoxi xiahuayuan districts u 7 and u 8 decrease while the awrcc increase in huaian district zhuolu district wangquan district chongli district and xuanhua district and u 7 and u 8 increase while the awrcc decrease in qiaodong district and shangyi district it can be found that u 7 and u 8 always increase or decrease simultaneously however u 7 is the positive indicator while u 8 is negative which leads to the reverse variation of the corresponding level the awrcc is the comprehensive evaluation results of u 7 or u 8 and does not entirely depend on either of them for example in both huailai district and shangyi district u 7 increases while u 8 decreases however in huailai district the awrcc increase and in shangyi district the awrcc decreases 2 huailai district qiaoxi district and xiahuayuan district are affected by the indicator u 7 they reduce the crop unit water allocation and area of crops with low benefit grain beans and oilseeds and have little change in output value without pollution pressure the awrcc of the remaining seven subareas was affected by u 8 which reduced or increased the unit water allocation and area of crops with high benefits potato vegetables and fruits and the pollution pressure had a great impact on the output value 5 2 discussion the water allocation model is constructed by combining the evaluation of awrcc which makes the optimization objective clear and appropriate it provides a framework to model and evaluate agriculture water allocation fig 7 shows the rate of variation of water quantity area number and output value of subareas before and after optimization m0 and m3 1 awrcc is mainly related to water quantity area number and output value the output value of the crops and livestock corresponds to the target of the model and the water quantity and area number correspond to the decision variables of the model after optimization the trend of varying in these decision variables is consistent on the whole where the range of area is the smallest and that of output value is the largest it is found that the water quantity and planting area of fruits increase consistently such as zhuolu district and shangyi district however it also found that the water quantity of grain decreases while the area increases in huai an district and xuanhua district 2 the water allocation model optimizes the water quantity of quality with the aim of obtaining the maximization of benefits and realizing the trade off between benefits and pollutant of the crops and livestock furthermore the water allocation model sets the concentration of pollution as the constraint rather than the total amount of emissions therefore both the reduction of pollution discharge from the source and ability of the river to self purify can help alleviate the status of pollution discharge u 13 increased in the ten subareas which indicates that the total amount of cod in all subarea increased but the concentration decreased and could meet the constraint of cod however it has little impact on awrcc because of its small weight 3 according to the results of awrcc the discharge determines the increase or decrease of water quantity and the subareas requiring extensive emission reduction such as zhuolu district and chongli district with a large proportion of fruits vegetables and oilseeds of high emission will reduce the water quantity in a whole however the subareas requiring light emission reduction such as qiaodong district and qiaoxi district will increase the proportion and water quantity of crops with high benefits 4 the structure of crops affects the increment of output value it is difficult to promote the awrcc in the districts which have the high proportion of fruits vegetables and tubers with high benefits for example qiaodong district 21 98 shangyi district 7 47 and xiahuayuan district 5 43 have the largest increment in areas of these three crops and the corresponding decrement or increment of the awrcc are the largest or smallest 2 79 0 17 0 03 exceptionally the awrcc increased slightly 1 64 in qiaoxi district where the vegetable area increased by 11 86 however the area of oilseeds with heavy pollution is reduced by 7 67 simultaneously which has played a positive role in promoting awrcc 5 3 conclusions in this paper the evaluation of awrcc and agricultural structural optimization in the yang river basin are studied the improved pca is proposed to select the evaluation indicators solving the problems of complex calculation process due to too many evaluation indicators and missing the information due to too few indicators considering the instability and insensitivity of the traditional ewm the ewm is adapted furthermore the d s evidence theory is applied to obtain the comprehensive indicators weight in the real case study of the yang river basin the results showed that the comprehensive evaluation of awrcc in the yang river basin is improved from 0 2975 and 0 3059 combining the evaluation of awrcc the paper established a model to optimize the planting raising structure and water allocation to meet the requirement of monthly water quality the paper take one year as the allocation period and implement the optimization on water allocation and agricultural structure to maximize the agricultural benefits of ten subareas in the yang river basin the method of water allocation based on the characteristics of water requirement of crops and livestock in growth period is proposed which not only avoid imbalance water allocation but also reduce dimensionality in addition the idea of combing the method of alleviating the pollutant discharge with the method of replenishing water is applied based on current situation of water resources development and utilization in the yang river basin finally the proposed water allocation model is realized the results showed that agricultural structure is being adjusted in the direction of increasing those crops and livestock with high benefits while decreasing planting with low benefits or high pollutant as for livestock the number of large livestock of high benefit increased while that of small livestock decreased slightly therefore high benefits low pollutant are valuable to obtain a rational agricultural structure which can not only alleviate the ecological pressure but also obtain high economic benefits and ultimately lead to the virtuous circle of society economy and ecology and sound development in conclusion the optimization agricultural structure considering water quality combining the evaluation of the awrcc can help promote the awrcc and the local economy realize scientific and sustainable utilization of agriculture water resources and development in the yang river basin declaration of competing interest the

10434,the serious shortage of water resources and the progressive deterioration of downstream water environments restrict development of the agricultural economy it is necessary to study the optimization method of water allocation from the perspective of sustainable development considering the real situation of agricultural production and water quality first an improved principal component analysis that considers the importance of indicators to the principal components is performed to select evaluation indicators and the entropy weight method is modified to stably and sensitively determine the weight of the evaluation indicators moreover dempster shafer evidence theory is proposed to obtain the comprehensive weight of the evaluation indicators taking into account both subjective and objective factors second the model to optimize the planting raising structure and regulate water quantity and quality is established by combining the evaluation of agricultural water resource carrying capacity awrcc a method of water allocation based on the characteristics of water requirement of crops and livestock is put forward which can not only avoid imbalanced water supply but also reduce the dimensions of the model finally our proposed method of optimal allocation of agricultural water resources is applied to the yang river basin the evaluation results show that the awrcc of the subareas fall between the saturated and the transition state during the years included in this study the optimization results show that the monthly concentration of ammonia nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand can meet the requirement of water quality of less than 1 mg l and 20 mg l respectively meanwhile economic benefits are increased and the awrcc is improved in conclusion the proposed method and model can provide a valuable tool to evaluate and promote the coordination between the agricultural economy water quality safety and sustainable development of local agricultural water resources keywords carrying capacity fuzzy comprehensive evaluation dempster shafer evidence theory structure optimization water quality characteristics of water requirement 1 introduction with the development of the economy and society in recent years the dramatic changes in water consumption and pollutant discharge year after year force necessitate consideration of the issues of utilization and allocation of agricultural water resources wang et al 2019 in the area of water shortage the problem and stress from water resources on economic development has become increasingly clear and even threatens the economic and social development region especially in arid and semi arid areas the problem of water resources has become a bottleneck restricting social development the analysis and evaluation of water resource carrying capacity wrcc can provide decision support for the sustainable utilization of water resources and play an important role in solving contradictions in regional water resources and promoting social and economic development zhu et al 2010 wang et al 2018 in addition in most countries agricultural water accounts for the highest proportion among water use industries namely domestic water industrial water agricultural water and ecological water however the utilization rate and the comprehensive benefits of agricultural water resources are generally low and the contradiction between supply and demand is prominent meng et al 2018 research on the combination of wrcc and optimal allocation is still lacking and practical implementation of the conclusions is difficult agricultural water resource carrying capacity awrcc can be used to evaluate the utilization and development potential of water resources thus it is of significance to carry out the combination of evaluation of awrcc and the study of agricultrural water resource optimization in areas of water shortage determining the awrcc is a typical task in the area of sustainable agricultural development and awrcc is a subcategory of wrcc wrcc is defined as the maximum exploitable scale of regional water resources that guarantees a good water ecological environment system which depends on many factors such as regional natural environment water resources economic structure and technology level zhang et al 2019a 2019b shi and qu 1992 rational evaluation of wrcc can provide decision support for sustainable utilization of water resources and sustainable development of regional societies si et al 2013 zhang et al 2019a 2019b wrcc is most often evaluated by a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model which analyzes the influencing factors of the research area wang et al 2010 in this model selecting the valid indicators and determining appropriate weights of these indicators are two important steps to conduct overall evaluation first the representative indicators should be carefully selected for example chen and wu 2014 used principal component analysis pca to extract three principal components from 13 indicators that affect the wrcc to evaluate the wrcc of southern jiangsu from 2002 to 2012 li et al 2011selected six indicators that can reflect the water resources quantity and quality and used the analysis hierarchy process ahp to determine the weight of indicators and evaluated the wrcc of erhai basin from the perspective of science integrity the combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis and the feasibility principle wang et al 2004 have put forward four categories i e comparability equilibrium efficiency and limitation including 16 evaluation indicators too many indicators may lead to low efficiency while too few may lead to loss of complete information the criteria used to select the indicators are very important for the objectivity and accuracy in the follow up analysis song et al 2011 at present too many selection of carrying capacity evaluation indicators leads to complex calculation and information overlap or too few indicators leads to inaccurate evaluation in this paper the pca method is improved to select evaluation indicators considering the correlation between indicators the importance of indicators in the principal components and the contribution rate of principal components so as to obtain a more comprehensive and appropriate evaluation index simultaneously it is very important to determinate the weight for the indicators in a scientific manner at present ahp and the entropy weight method ewm are commonly used to calculate the weight the former is based on expert scoring and the results are realistic however to a large extent it is dependent on the experience of the person who evaluates the data wang et al 2018 the latter determines the weight according to the size of indicator variability and reflects the nature of the data itself but it is difficult to completely reflect the importance of each indicator wu et al 2017 it is important to objectively handle the differences between indicators which are dependent on the experience of individuals both methods have advantages and disadvantages it is better to combine these two methods to obtain comprehensive weights which can not only avoid possible contradictions but also make up for their shortcomings pathak et al 2017 dempster shafer evidence theory d s evidence theory has performed well in multi attribute data fusion and is widely used in information fusion expert system and decision analysis zhao et al 2020 hu et al 2019 applied d s evidence theory to comprehensively analyze the effects of different emission reduction strategies from the perspective of the public government managers researchers experts and other subjects therefore this paper introduces d s evidence theory to determine the comprehensive weight combining the advantages of the two weight methods so as to achieve the more reasonable weight the existing agricultural optimization models mainly focus on either crop structure or water quantity or both with the objective of maximizing economic benefits aljanabi et al 2018 developed an agricultural irrigation reclaimed wastewater allocation optimization model to maximize the net benefit ghasemi et al 2016 presented a novel approach to cropping patterns and water allocation optimization at the farm level peng et al 2018 took the total amount of agricultural water consumption and irrigation water intake as constraints and adopted the threshold value of agricultural development area under the measures of optimizing irrigation system and adjusting planting structure ou et al 2013 built a decomposition and coordination model with the objective of maximizing total crop yield in irrigation areas and combined improved a real coding genetic algorithm with a decomposing and coordinating iterative algorithm to solve the model however the establishment logic and assessment index of the model are not clear and there is no quantitative analysis combined with the status of the research area in the models also the current models may not fully consider the characteristics of crop water demand and the objectives and constraints are often related to the total irrigation water without the parameter of period it is possible that the total amount of irrigation water is large and the economic benefit is great but the monthly irrigation water is insufficient or even cut off agriculture is generally divided into five industrial categories planting animal husbandry forestry fishery and sideline however the relevant studies have mainly focused on the economic benefits of planting animal husbandry is the second largest water user in agriculture yet its economic benefits cannot be ignored coordinated development of the crop and livestock industry is an important aspect to promote the structural reform of agricultural supply side yu et al 2017 constructed a multi objective linear programming model aiming at the imbalance development of the crop and livestock structure in daxinganling agricultural reclamation in addition the joint operation model of water quantity and quality aims to reduce the pollution discharge to the water source in the downstream of yang river but it lacks the consideration of the ability of self purification of a river in the study of water quantity optimization the modeling scale is usually year or the water sensitive coefficients is the same in the whole growth period which may simplify the computation but results in low precision and even the extreme situation of imbalanced water supply therefore how to appropriately allocate the agricultural water and make the full use of the limited water resources are the problems that this study aims to solve in the yang river basin the water consumption and pollution of the forestry fishery and sideline industries are small therefore they were not included in his study which focuses on crops and livestock in this work we select the model decision variables by combining the awrcc focusing on the growth characteristics of crops and livestock the water quality model is based on the concentration of water quality factors rather than the total amount of emissions this study attempts to propose an awrcc evaluation method and joint optimization model of water quantity and quality to evaluate the situation of agricultural water resources and optimize agricultural planting raising structure and irrigation water allocation also fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is adopted in awrcc evaluation to obtain comprehensive evaluation indicators and the corresponding weight which can 1 consider the relationship between the indicators such as relativity and individual contribution rate 2 determine the stable and sensitive subjective weight of indicators 3 obtain the comprehensive weight of evaluation indicators considering subjective and objective factors 4 provide a reference for the evaluation of the awrcc additionally the planting raising structure optimization and joint optimization of water quantity and quality are considered to achieve optimal allocation of water resources in one framework that can 1 establish an agricultural water resources model by a novelly introduced awrcc evaluation from the perspective of optimization 2 consider the ability of the river to self purify 3 avoid on imbalanced water supply on the concept of characteristics of water requirement for crops and livestock then both the awrcc evaluation and optimal allocation model of water resources were applied to a real problem in the yang river basin a typical water shortage and polluted region in china to verify its validity overall the study results evaluate the awrcc and optimize agricultural planting raising structure and water allocation this study provides insight into agricultural structure planning and water resources utilization in areas that have water shortages and pollution with coordinated and sustainable development between the environment and the economy 2 evaluation of awrcc by the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method synthesizes many indicators that affect water resources by using the fuzzy membership calculation and then obtains the specific values to evaluate the level of awrcc the steps are as follows step 1 selection of evaluation indicators awrcc is affected by many factors each factor is an indicator and all factors consist of a set of indicators generally the important indicators are selected by experience or the specific method such as pca let u i represents the selected evaluation indicator where i 1 2 m then the evaluation indicator set u is expressed as 1 u u 1 u 2 u m step 2 determination of weight of the indicators the importance of each evaluation expressed by weight is different let wi represents the weight of u i where i 1 2 m then the evaluation weight set w is expressed and meets certain conditions as follows 2a w w 1 w 2 w m 2b i 1 m w i 1 0 w i 1 step 3 classification of the evaluation level the status of the evaluation object is divided into several levels let vj represents the evaluation level where j 1 2 n usually n equals a number between 3 and 5 then the indicator level set v is expressed as 3 v v 1 v 2 v n step 4 establishment of the fuzzy membership matrix let rij represent the membership of ui belonging to vj then a fuzzy membership matrix r that maps from u to v can be obtained zhang and ma 2015a and expressed as 4 r r 11 r 12 r 1 n r 21 r 22 r 2 n r m 1 r m 2 r m n step 5 calculation of the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation matrix let bj represent a comprehensive membership of all evaluation indicators to the level vj according to r and w the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation matrix can be obtained as follows 5 b w r w 1 w 2 w m r 11 r 12 r 1 n r 21 r 22 r 2 n r m 1 r m 2 r m n b 1 b 2 b n step 6 calculation of the comprehensive evaluation value let gj represent the evaluation score of each level where j 1 2 n then the comprehensive evaluation value is obtained as follows 6 s a w r c c j 1 n g i b j finally the s a w r c c of the evaluation object can be calculated then the awrcc level can be evaluated according to the corresponding level of s 3 optimal modeling of water resources the optimal models of agricultural water resources in the existing research mainly focus on water allocation on an annual or monthly basis cui et al 2018 aljanabi et al 2018 as well as annual agricultural structural adjustment ou et al 2013 generally the model is established to determine the maximum agricultural economic benefits through the appropriate allocation of water resources the objective function is as follows 7a b e n e f i t s i n c o m e cost 7b i n c o m e i 1 i z 1 z p i z s

the irrigation coefficient of subarea i y i z is the water production function of the crop z during the whole growth period in subarea i and f i s is the aquatic product value function of the livestock s in subarea i in the model the area of crops s i z and the number of livestock n i s can be constant or variable as a constant the planting and raising structure are fixed to that t the model can avoid problems with optimal adjustment of these terms meanwhile the unit water allocation amount of the crop q i z and livestock q i s can be allocated in the scale of month or year since the water allocation amount will be affected by water requirement and rainfall the monthly agricultural irrigation plan can provide more efficient guidance involving the more complex problem solving the constraints of the model are water supply and demand constraints crop planting area constraints livestock number constraints and water quality constraints 1 water production function 8a y i z q i

all the decision variables must be nonnegative 4 data and methods 4 1 study area and problem statement the yang river is 278 km long and has a catchment area of approximately 16 000 km2 according to the outline of beijing tianjin hebei coordinated development plan the yang river basin area of zhangjiakou will build a green agricultural and sideline product base of beijing tianjin which has higher requirements for clean water production and ecological environment safety the main stream of the yang river is located in zhangjiakou and is 106 km and flows through the following ten subareas districts of zhangjiakou shangyi huaian wanquan chongli qiaodong qiaoxi xuanhua xiahuayuan huailai and zhuolu fig 1 these ten subareas are the research scope of the paper however with the development of production and climate change the contradiction between supply and demand is intensifying in the basin there are two major problems 1 water shortage the basin is precariously short of water where the water resource per capita is only 399 m3 less than one fifth of that in china moreover the runoff has a noticeable seasonal variation in that the volume in july and august accounts for 28 of the annual total the agricultural water consumption in zhangjiakou accounts for about 72 87 of the total therefore it is necessary to find an optimal allocation of agriculture water resources 2 serious water pollution the regional economy of the yang river basin is dominated by traditional planting and animal husbandry the methods of agricultural planning are not very advanced a large amount of fertilizer and pesticide is not utilized efficiently thus large amounts of livestock manure flow into the water source in the downstream portion of the yang river along with rainwater and irrigation water as a result the problem of pollution in the basin is becoming increasingly serious leading to poor water quality indexes such as ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and chemical oxygen demand cod in the assessment section of yang river basin which threatens the safety of water supply and ecological environment in the region and downstream therefore it is necessary to evaluate the status of local agriculture based on awrcc and take corresponding measures to improve the situation of agricultural water resources in the yang river basin the limited agricultural water resources should be allocated efficiently so as to realize the scientific and sustainable development of the local economy and water environment 4 2 framework the technical framework of the proposed methodology is shown in fig 2 as demonstrated the methodology consists of two major components 1 first an improved pca is proposed to select the awrcc evaluation indicators rationally then the paper introduces ahp to obtain the subjective weight of evaluation indicators and improves the entropy weight method to obtain the more objective weight of evaluation indicator furthermore d s evidence theory is introduced to combine subjective and objective weights to obtain the comprehensive weights of the indicators finally the evaluation results of awrcc are obtained through membership calculation 2 based on the evaluation results of the awrcc the optimization model is established on the premise of meeting the constraints of water quantity and quality then taking into account the water requirement characteristics this paper proposes a water allocation method based on the characteristics of water requirement in whole growth period of crops and livestock in the model the measures of reducing the pollution from the sources and purifying river by supplementary water are introduced to improve the water quality thus to maximize agricultural economic benefits and to meet water quality standard are two aspects to be traded off finally our proposed methods are realized by the two major components in 1 and 2 4 3 data sources and parameter determination the data are mainly from the zhangjiakou statistical yearbook 2006 2016 zhangjiakou water resources bulletin 2006 2016 zhangjiakou environment bulletin 2014 and guanting reservoir ecological security investigation and evaluation report 2014 in equations 7 11 where i 1 2 10 represents shangyi district huaian district huailai district zhuolu district wanquan district chongli district qiaodong district qiaoxi district xuanhua district and xiahuayuan district respectively z 1 2 6 represents grain beans tubers oilseeds vegetables and fruits s 1 2 represents large livestock and small livestock t is the index of month where t 1 2 12 represents the month the water production functions of crops and livestock in each subarea are obtained by fitting based on the statistics 2006 2016 taking shangyi district as an example some data are shown in table 1 also the agricultural water consumption in 2014 is 43 649 million m³ of which the total water consumption of crops and livestock is 42847 71 million m³ the monthly flow rate of the yang river is 0 344 0 434 m s and the degradation coefficient of cod and nh3 n are 0 06 0 15 d 1 and 0 06 0 17 d 1 respectively 4 4 selection of the awrcc evaluation indicator based on improved pca one of the key points of the awrcc evaluation is to select the reasonable evaluation indicators there are too many variables influence factors in the agriculture system such as ratio of irrigated farmland utilization rate of agricultural water resources and water utilization coefficient of canal system which contain certain information related to the situation of water resources and probably have mutual overlaps or correlations in order to make the evaluation index system concise and effective it is necessary to avoid the repetition of index information and select a small number of representative indicators pca is used to exclude overlapping information with less loss as possible hu et al 2015 find principal components in form of the function of the variables and choose the variables with the largest load coefficient in each principal component as the evaluation indicators 4 4 1 selection of evaluation indicator by pca the implementation steps of pca are as follows 1 standardize the initial evaluation indicators to eliminate the dimensional influence of each evaluation indicator value as follows 12 u i j u i j u j s j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m where n is the sample index m is the total number of evaluation indicators u i j and u i j are the original value and standardized value of the j th evaluation indicator of the i th sample and u j and s j are the sample mean value and sample standard deviation of the j th indicator respectively 2 calculate the correlation coefficient matrix r r i j m m and select t pairs of indicators with extremely significant correlation the element r i j reflects the degree of correlation between each indicator by equation 13 13 r i j k 1 m u k i u i u k j u j k 1 m u k i u i 2 u k i u j 2 i j 1 2 m 3 obtain the eigenvalues λ 1 λ 2 λ m in descending order by solving the characteristic equation r λ e 0 and then calculate the contribution rate δ 1 δ 2 δ m and cumulative contribution rate δ 1 δ 2 δ m by equations 14a and 14b finally choose the principal components 1 y 2 y p p m whose cumulative contribution rates are more than 85 zhang et al 2015 14a δ i λ i i 1 m λ i i 1 2 m 14b δ i i 1 i δ i i 1 2 m 4 the eigenvector corresponding to the selected eigenvalue λ 1 λ 2 λ p is the factor load l i j of each principal component which reflects the influence degree of evaluation indicator x i j on principal component the relationship between the principal component y 1 y 2 y p and the evaluation indicator u 1 u 2 u m is represented as 15 y 1 l 11 u 1 l 12 u 2 l 1 m u m y 2 l 21 u 1 l 22 u 2 l 2 m u m y p l p 1 u 1 l p 2 u 2 l p m u m 5 select the representatives of each principal component with the largest absolute value of factor load as the indicators for the comprehensive evaluation 4 4 2 selection of evaluation indicator by the improved pca the traditional pca is used to selecting the representative of each principal component separately however it does not consider the status of the indicator in other principal components thus it is prone to lose the important information when the load coefficients are approximate to each other to deal with this the paper proposes an improved pca for selecting the evaluation indicators of awrcc which takes the correlation of the indicators the importance of indicators to the principal components and the contribution rate of principal components into consideration the previous steps are the same as those in the procedure steps 1 to 4 in the section 4 4 1 and then the improvement is carried out in the following steps 1 calculate the proportion of the i th variable in the j th principal component 16 α i j l i j i 1 m l i j i 1 2 m j 1 2 p 2 calculate the comprehensive score of the m th variable among the n principal components 17 s c i j 1 p α i j δ j i 1 2 m j 1 2 p 3 sort the comprehensive scores s c i of all variables in descending order for t pairs of indicators with extremely significant correlation procedure 1 in the section 4 4 1 eliminate the t t t duplicate indicators with the smaller score of each pair from m indicators u 1 u 2 u m then set the remaining m m t indicators u u 1 u 2 u m as the evaluation indicators of awrcc step 1 in the section 2 4 5 determining weight of awrcc evaluation indicators based on d s evidence theory taking into account both subjective and objective factors this paper now introduces the d s evidence theory to determine the comprehensive weight of evaluation indicators by combining the weights calculated by the methods of ahp and improved ewm 4 5 1 calculation of weight by ahp a 5 scale analysis hierarchy process ahp is adopted li et al 2019a in the paper the method overcomes the problem of the 9 scale method which needs more information and requires higher judgment on the importance of each indicator it also makes up for the disadvantages of the 3 scale method in judging loss of information consistency and accumulative superiority the traditional ahp requires consistency verification if it is not consistent some mathematical methods are used to adjust the judgment matrix which inevitably makes the problem more complicated the problems can be solved through constructing the consistency matrix supposing the anti symmetric matrix a and its optimal transfer matrix b then the completely consistent matrix of a can be obtained by a eb where a can retain the information of a to the greatest extent and meet requirements of consistency li et al 2019a 2019b the specific steps are as follows supposing that the a has element in the i th row and j th column as a i j then the element b i j in the i th row and j th column of the optimal transfer matrix b can ben calculated as 18 b i j 1 m k 1 m a i k a k j the element a i j in the i th row and j th column of the consistency matrix a is 19 a i j e b i j the characteristic vector w corresponding to the characteristic root λ of a satisfies a w λ w select the eigenvector corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue of a as w max and normalize w max to obtain the weight value w i a h p of the indicator i 4 5 2 calculation of weight by the improved entropy weight method the entropy weight method ewm determines the objective weight according to the variability of the indicator which can reflect the characteristic of the data itself generally the smaller the information entropy of the indicator is the greater the variation degree of the indicator is the more information it can provide namely the greater the role it can play in the comprehensive evaluation and the greater the weight the entropy weight method is as follows muzhikov et al 2018 1 the entropy of indicator is calculated as follows 20 e i 1 ln n i 1 m p j i ln p j i where ei is the entropy of the i th indicator i 1 2 3 m m is the total number of indicators j 1 2 3 n n is the total number of samples p j i is the probability of the j th sample in terms of the i th indicator 2 the weight of indicators of entropy weight method is calculated as follows 21 w e i 1 e i m i 1 m e i where w e i is the weight of the i th indicator in equation 21 when the indicator entropy value e i 1 the entropy weight method will cause the multiple change of w e i even if there is a small change between e i therefore shi 2019 improved entropy weight method model as follows 22 w e i i 1 m e i 1 2 e i i 1 m i 1 m e i 1 2 e i the model can solve the problems of the traditional entropy weight method in the case of e i 1 however the difference between entropy weights is small when the difference between entropy values is large for example if the entropy values are 0 999 0 998 0 001 and 0 002 then entropy weights can be calculated and are the following 0 1253 0 1255 0 3748 and 0 3745 it is found that the entropy weight of entropy 0 001 is not much greater than that of entropy 0 999 in order to solve this problem this paper further improves equation 23 as shown below 23 w i e w m w e i i 1 m e i 1 2 e i τ i 1 m i 1 m e i 1 2 e i τ where w i e w m is the weight value of the indicator and τ is the constant the larger the constant τ is the closer the solution is to the solution of equation 21 it is assumed to be 0 5 in order to verify the effectiveness of the improved method take four variables as examples and set four different entropy changes in the first case c1 slight change e i 1 0 999 0 998 0 997 0 996 in the second case c2 moderate entropy change e i 2 0 888 0 777 0 666 0 555 in the third case c3 when the entropy approaches 0 the slight change e i 3 0 004 0 003 0 002 0 001 in the fourth case the maximum change of entropy e i 4 0 999 0 998 0 001 0 002 the weights of four variables calculated by three entropy weight methods traditional ewm the improved ewm in muzhikov et al 2018 and the proposed ewm in the paper in four cases c1 c4 were compared as shown in table 2 it can be seen that in the case of c1 where ex 1 and the case of c3 where ex 0 the difference between entropy weights is small when the entropy values are close which indicates the traditional ewm is less stable specially in the case of c4 where the difference in entropy values is great the entropy weights corresponding to entropy values of 0 001 and 0 002 are much larger than those of 0 999 and 0 998 which indicates the improved ewm is more sensitive also in the case of c2 the difference between entropy weights is also moderate where the difference between the entropy values is moderate consequently it shows that the improved ewm can stably and sensitively determine the weight of evaluation indicators which verifies the method in this paper is reasonable and effective 4 5 3 combined determination of weighting based on d s evidence theory using the ahp and the improved ewm the subjective and objective weight of evaluation indicators are obtained both methods have advantages and disadvantages the ahp is based on expert scoring and the results are realistic but it depends on individual experience the ewm can determine the weight considering the degree of indicator variability and reflect the nature of the data itself but it is difficult to reflect the importance of each indicator completely consequently the paper will apply d s evidence theory to determine the comprehensive weight the probability assignment of evidence theory is represented by the basic probability assignment function pu et al 2016 suppose that the set of all possible decisions of a problem is the θ which is called a recognition frame and its elements are mutually exclusive the set 2θ represents all possible proposition sets containing all subsets of the θ definition 1 the set function m of θ 2θ 0 1 meets the following requirements 24a m ϕ 0 24b a θ m a 1 where m is the basic probability assignment function and it reflects the probability of proposition in the specific condition definition 2 let θ be the recognition frame and m 2θ 0 1 be the basic probability assignment function on θ 25 bel a b a m b a θ the defined function bel 2θ 0 1 is a reliability function on θ two or more independent confidence functions can be combined using the d s synthesis rule a new confidence function is obtained by calculating the orthogonal based on the confidence levels of different evidence sources definition 3 let bel1 and bel2 be the two reliability functions on the same recognition frame θ then the corresponding basic probability assignment functions are m1 and m2 and the focal elements are b i and c j respectively the d s composition rule is 26a m a m 1 m 2 θ 0 θ ϕ 1 1 k b i c j m 1 b i m 2 c j θ ϕ 26b 1 k b i c j ϕ m 1 b i m 2 c j where m a is the fusion of m1 and m2 k is the conflict degree of evidence the greater the k the greater the conflict degree the term 1 k is used to avoid assigning non zero probability to the normalization factor of empty set in this paper the ahp and the improved ewm are treated as two reliability functions the subjective w i a h p and objective w i e w m weights of evaluation indicators is treated as the basic probability assignment functions m1 and m2 the focus elements b i and c j are the evaluation indicators u u 1 u 2 u m and the comprehensive weight reset confidence function can be obtained through the d s evidence theory the probability assignment function m is the comprehensive weight value corresponding to evaluation indicator the comprehensive weights of the indicators take the subjective opinions of the experts and the objective influence of the indicator data into consideration which is more reasonable and is represented as w w 1 w 2 w m step 2 in section 2 4 6 selecting decision variables for the water resources allocation model based on evaluation of awrcc in order to establish the model for agricultural water resources considering the real situation the paper introduces the evaluation of awrcc to help determine the decision variables of the optimization model 4 6 1 selection of evaluation indicators according to the calculation steps in section 4 4 evaluation indicators are selected in order to avoid omitting important indicators 15 evaluation indicators shown in table 3 are selected based on literature research huan et al 2014 zhang and ma 2015a the process of selecting indicators is performed to develop agriculture that adheres to the principle of sustainable development in yang river basin following the procedures 1 4 in section 4 4 1 spss software is applied to calculate the correlation coefficients for the 15 indicators and their correlation coefficient matrix r r i j 15 15 table a1 in appendix a and six principal components y 1 y 2 y 6 are chosen of which cumulative contribution rate is 87 598 85 the contribution rate δ 1 δ 2 δ 6 and factor loading l 15 6 are calculated table a2 in appendix a the improved pca is performed on the indicators following the procedures 1 3 in section 4 4 2 the proportions of each indicator in terms of six principal components can be calculated by equation 16 table a3 in appendix a consequently the comprehensive score s c i can be calculated by equation 17 and sorted table a4 in appendix a finally the indicator with the largest load factor coefficient u u 1 u 2 u 9 can be selected as the evaluation indicators of awrcc for contrast the results of the traditional and improved pca are compared in table 4 the evaluation indicators selected by the proposed method are more than those selected by the traditional method although the traditional pca selected fewer indicators the computational complexity is reduced however the indicators of u 6 u 8 and u 15 have low correlation with the selected indicators and are the key factors affecting water quality and quantity which cannot be ignored huan et al 2014 zhang and ma 2015a in addition u5 u4 and u14 can be replaced with u 3 u 9 and u13 since they are indicator pairs of highly significant correlation therefore the results of the proposed method retain the indicators u 7 and u 10 or the alternative indicators u 5 u 4 u 14 u 3 u 9 u 13 and have not missed the important indicators u 6 u 8 and u 15 it shows the better performance which not only eliminates some redundant indicators but also avoids the disadvantages of too few indicators which may not enough to contain most of the indicator information 4 6 2 calculation of the weight of each indicators the evaluation indicators u u 1 u 1 u 9 are finally selected in section 4 6 1 therefore weight of evaluation indicators w w 1 w 1 w 9 is calculated based on w i a h p and w i e w m according to the section 4 5 3 the calculation data of w i e w m and w i a h p are shown in step 2 in appendix i table 5 is the evaluation indicator and the weight u w among nine indicators u 7 irrigation water per unit area u 8 water consumption per ten thousand cny of agricultural output value u 9 water use rate of ecological environment and u 10 annual per capita water resources have great influence on agricultural water resources in the yang river basin however u 9 and u 10 are mainly macro control at the government level which are less affected by water resources allocation therefore the optimal allocation of water resources should focus on u 7 and u 8 which are affected by structure and water allocation of crops and livestock in the maximizing of benefits given the limited water consumption and consequently the water resources allocation optimization model is established considering adjustment of planting and raising structure in the next section after detemining the evaluation indicator and the weight u w combined with the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation procedures in the section 2 the remaining steps 3 4 and 5 can be implemented to complete the evaluation s a w r c c of the awrcc in the yang river basin these results are shown in steps 3 6 in appendix i 4 7 optimization of planting raising structure and water allocation considering water quality requirement 4 7 1 agricultural structure optimization model establishment with water quality constraint according to the analysis in section 4 6 water allocation and structure adjustment of crops and livestock are issued in the model moreover the model is in the scale of month since the water allocation monthly can provide more efficient guidance simultaneously the problem of water environment pollution is becoming more and more serious and the requirement of water quality from the water source in the downstream of the yang river in view of the current situation of water pollution this paper further studies the optimal allocation of water quality and quantity on a monthly basis to realize the maximum agricultural economic benefits the objective function in section 3 is as follows 27a i n c o m e i 1 i z 1 z p i z s i z y i z q i z t i 1 i s 1 s n i s f i s q i s t 27b cost i 1 i η i z 1 z u i z s i z t 1 t q i z t i 1 i z 1 z c i z s i z i 1 i s 1 s u i s n i s t 1 t q i s t i 1 i z 1 z c i s n i s where q i z t is the unit water allocation amount of the crop z in subarea i m3 hm2 q i s t is the unit water allocation amount of the livestock s in subarea i m3 head s i z is the planting area of the crop z in subarea i hm2 n i s is the number of the livestock s in subarea i head the water quality is a constraint in the model there are mainly two methods to meet the requirement of water quality excluding the biochemical methods one is to reduce pollutants discharged into the river zhang et al 2014 chen et al 2019 and the other is to supplement water to the river bai et al 2017 the former method is direct but the regulating ability is limited the effect of the latter method is clear but it would consume irrigation water in order to meet the water quality requirement effectively this paper proposed to reduce pollutants discharged into the river and supplement water flowing to the river in the model the function of water allocation and pollutant is considered and the variable of the supplementary water is introduced to control the water quality thus it is to realize the tradeoff between maximizing agricultural economic benefits and meeting water quality standard the constraints of the model are mainly water supply and demand constraints crop planting area constraints livestock number constraints and water quality constraints 1 water production function 28a y q i z t a i z t 1 t q i z t e p i z t 2 b i z t 1 t q i z t e p i z t c i z 28b f q i s t b i s t 1 t q i s

t is the flow velocity m s φ i z and φ i s are the amount of pollutants per unit water of the crop z and livestock s in the subarea i respectively then the research model is built with the consideration of the objective and constraints it contains many decision variables containing areas number and water consumption of different crops and livestock in the subareas and particularly nonlinear objective function and constraints 4 7 2 water allocation based on the characteristics of water requirement in growth period in equation 28a the water production function describes the relationship between the yield of crops and the water consumption for simplification purposes the total water consumption during the growth period is chosen to calculate the yield without consideration to the characteristics of crop water demand regardless of the irrigation process given the water consumption imbalanced water supply may occur when pursuing economic benefits that is few months are allocated too much or too little water extremely the water allocation of individual month is very small and is even zero in order to satisfy the constraints such as water quality in this condition the yield calculated by the annual amount of water is not appropriate resulting in inaccurate economic benefits actually crops and livestock have different growth periods even for the same crop and livestock the water requirement and effective rainfall in different districts may be different in addition the effect of water shortage on crop yield is different in the stages of growth period which is expressed by the water sensitivity coefficient during periods of water shortage the larger the sensitivity coefficient the greater the yield reduction cui et al 2018 therefore this paper proposes a water allocation method based on the characteristics of water requirement in the whole growth period in particular the different water sensitivity coefficient is considered in terms of different crops and livestock in different districts irrigation water for crops can be allocated according to the monthly water requirement effective rainfall and water sensitive coefficient the water requirement is the water volume consumed for crop growth and effective rainfall is a supplement for water consumption the water sensitive coefficient reflects the impact of water shortage on the yield given the total water quantity the different irrigation water of each month during the year leads to different yield of crops it is assumed that the annual water allocation is q i z and so the monthly water allocation is 31a q i z t 0 e p i z t d i z t d i z t e p i z t λ i z t t 1 t λ i z t d i z t e p i z t q i z e p i z t d i z t 31b q i z t 1 t q i z t where q i z t is the unit water allocation amount of the crop z in month t in subarea i m3 hm2 d i z t and e p i z t are respectively the monthly water requirement and effective rainfall of the crop z in month t in subarea i m3 hm2 λ i z t is the water sensitive coefficient of the crop z in month t in subarea i according to equation 31 the water can be allocated evenly to each month and the condition of water shortage in each month is homologous which can effectively avoid imbalanced water supply based on this the impact of water shortage on the yield is considered by introducing the variable λ i z t also the dimension of the original problem is reduced and the computational cost is decreased similarly the growth water for the livestock can be allocated according to the monthly water requirement and the water sensitive coefficient it is assumed that the annual water allocation is q i s and the monthly water allocation is 32a q i s t d i s t λ i s t t 1 t d i s t λ i s t q i s 32b q i s t 1 t q i s t where q i s t is the unit water allocation amount of the livestock s in month t in subarea i m3 head d i s t is the monthly water requirement of the livestock s in month t in subarea i m3 hm2 λ i s t is the water sensitive coefficient of the livestock s in month t in subarea i consequently the model can be converted into monthly from annually by replacing q i z t and q i s t with q i z and q i s by equation 31 and 32 it can not only avoid the imbalance water allocation but also reduce the dimension of decision variables 5 results and discussion 5 1 optimization of agricultural planting and raising structure 5 1 1 analysis of optimization models in this paper the experiment runs on the platform with intel core i3 4 gb ram and 240 g hard disk and the model is implemented by matlab optimization toolbox table 6 shows the results of m1 m2 and m3 compared to the actual value m0 m1 represents the model with fixed agricultural structure m2 represents the model with adjustable agricultural structure but with an insensitivity coefficient and m3 represents the model with adjustable agricultural structure and a sensitivity coefficient that is proposed in the paper in the case of m1 the agricultural structure cannot be adjusted and the decision variables are water allocation monthly for crops and livestock excluding planting area and number of livestock in the cases of m2 and m3 the agricultural structure can be optimized and the decision variables are water allocation monthly for crops and livestock planting area and number of livestock the difference between m2 and m3 is whether the effect of water shortage on the monthly yield of crop and livestock is the same for m2 it is the same while for m3 it is different it can be seen from table 6 that compared with m0 the other three cases reduce the agricultural water allocation and improve agricultural economic benefits more importantly the water quality of the assessment section in the downstream of the yang river can meet the standard in the cases of m1 m2 and m3 which showed that optimization of water allocation and measure of water supplement are effective m2 and m3 obtained more economic benefits than m1 owing to adjusting the agricultural structure considering the different sensitivity of monthly water shortage the result of m3 has been more precise than that of m2 compared with the actual case m0 the optimal model m3 in this paper has reduced the agricultural water allocation from 4 28 to 4 14 billion m3 by 3 35 and increased the economic benefits from 136 404 to 152 726 billion cyn by 11 97 which shows that our proposal has superior performance than the other cases the results of the monthly concentration of cod and nh3 n of the assessment section in the downstream are shown in fig 3 the monthly concentration of nh3 n and cod can meet the water quality requirements of nh3 n 1 mg l and cod 20 mg l after optimization 5 1 2 results of planting raising structure and water allocation table 7 is the optimization results of m3 including the planting area of crops and livestock number and the annual water allocation of crops and livestock of each subarea in the yang river basin the annual water allocation can be allocated to month according to equations 31 and 32 then six crops in shangyi district are taken as an example the unit water allocation and the total unit water allocation monthly are shown in fig 4 the water allocation of crops and livestock in different subareas has the similar trend six crops have different growth periods and the peak of total unit water allocation monthly is mainly in june july and august after optimization the planting area and livestock number of the total ten subareas was maintained at 31944 hm2 and 213892 head respectively whereas proportions of crops and livestock respectively are shown in fig 5 combined with table 8 the results mainly increase the area of tubers and vegetables with high benefits and the number of large livestock and they decrease the area of oilseeds and grain with the low benefits as well as fruits with high pollutants and beans with low benefits table 8 shows the change of area number and water quantity of crops and livestock between m0 and m3 the planting areas of vegetables and tubers with high benefits have the larger increments between them the benefit and emission of tubers are less than that of vegetables also the increment of tubers is lightly larger than that of vegetables due to the consideration of water quality factor the vegetables tubers and large livestock will be given priority to allocate the water in order to improve the yield of water per unit water due to the limited water and the water consumption of oilseeds with high pollutant will be decreased to reduce the amount of pollutants to the river in livestock the water consumption of large livestock and small livestock are increased to promote benefits therefore the changes of area number and water quantity of crops and livestock are basically positively correlated with the benefits of unit area the results showed that the agricultural structure is being adjusted in the direction of increasing crops and livestock with high benefits while decreasing planting with low benefits or high pollutants as for livestock the number of large livestock of high benefit increased while that of small livestock decreased lightly 5 1 3 analysis of awrcc before and after optimization the awrcc of m1 m2 and m3 after optimization are calculated and the comparison of the evaluation scores of awrcc of subareas in the yang river basin is shown in fig 6 the changes of awrcc in the original situation m0 and optimizing the modeling with the fixed m1 or adjustable planting raising structure m2 and m3 are shown in fig 6 through the optimal allocation of water resources the awrcc has been improved from 0 297 to 0 302 while in the mode of adjustable planting raising structure the awrcc has the larger increment from 0 297 to 0 306 which indicates that the optimization of agricultural planting raising structure and water allocation are conducive to improving the awrcc which fully verifies the effectiveness of the model although it can be calculated more precisely considering crop production sensitivity coefficient its improvement effect of awrcc is not very noticeable in the case of m3 due to the limited agricultural resources 8 subareas increased while 2 subareas decreased as a whole the level of 10 subareas which the comprehensive evaluation value belong to has fallen between the saturated and the transition state and has been improved therefore the awrcc in yang river basin is improved and the whole subareas are improved which fully verifies the effectiveness of the model in order to further explore the method to improve of awrcc it is necessary to observe the relation between the indicators and awrcc as shown in table 9 only u 7 u 8 and u 13 among the indicators u 3 u 6 u 7 u 8 u 9 u 10 u 12 u 13 u 15 u3 changed before and after optimization and the remaining indicators did not vary because of independent of water resources allocation moreover among these three indicators u 13 indicator has little influence on awrcc due to its small variation and small weight therefore awrcc is mainly affected by u 7 and u 8 1 in table 9 u 7 u 8 and the awrcc increase in huailai qiaoxi xiahuayuan districts u 7 and u 8 decrease while the awrcc increase in huaian district zhuolu district wangquan district chongli district and xuanhua district and u 7 and u 8 increase while the awrcc decrease in qiaodong district and shangyi district it can be found that u 7 and u 8 always increase or decrease simultaneously however u 7 is the positive indicator while u 8 is negative which leads to the reverse variation of the corresponding level the awrcc is the comprehensive evaluation results of u 7 or u 8 and does not entirely depend on either of them for example in both huailai district and shangyi district u 7 increases while u 8 decreases however in huailai district the awrcc increase and in shangyi district the awrcc decreases 2 huailai district qiaoxi district and xiahuayuan district are affected by the indicator u 7 they reduce the crop unit water allocation and area of crops with low benefit grain beans and oilseeds and have little change in output value without pollution pressure the awrcc of the remaining seven subareas was affected by u 8 which reduced or increased the unit water allocation and area of crops with high benefits potato vegetables and fruits and the pollution pressure had a great impact on the output value 5 2 discussion the water allocation model is constructed by combining the evaluation of awrcc which makes the optimization objective clear and appropriate it provides a framework to model and evaluate agriculture water allocation fig 7 shows the rate of variation of water quantity area number and output value of subareas before and after optimization m0 and m3 1 awrcc is mainly related to water quantity area number and output value the output value of the crops and livestock corresponds to the target of the model and the water quantity and area number correspond to the decision variables of the model after optimization the trend of varying in these decision variables is consistent on the whole where the range of area is the smallest and that of output value is the largest it is found that the water quantity and planting area of fruits increase consistently such as zhuolu district and shangyi district however it also found that the water quantity of grain decreases while the area increases in huai an district and xuanhua district 2 the water allocation model optimizes the water quantity of quality with the aim of obtaining the maximization of benefits and realizing the trade off between benefits and pollutant of the crops and livestock furthermore the water allocation model sets the concentration of pollution as the constraint rather than the total amount of emissions therefore both the reduction of pollution discharge from the source and ability of the river to self purify can help alleviate the status of pollution discharge u 13 increased in the ten subareas which indicates that the total amount of cod in all subarea increased but the concentration decreased and could meet the constraint of cod however it has little impact on awrcc because of its small weight 3 according to the results of awrcc the discharge determines the increase or decrease of water quantity and the subareas requiring extensive emission reduction such as zhuolu district and chongli district with a large proportion of fruits vegetables and oilseeds of high emission will reduce the water quantity in a whole however the subareas requiring light emission reduction such as qiaodong district and qiaoxi district will increase the proportion and water quantity of crops with high benefits 4 the structure of crops affects the increment of output value it is difficult to promote the awrcc in the districts which have the high proportion of fruits vegetables and tubers with high benefits for example qiaodong district 21 98 shangyi district 7 47 and xiahuayuan district 5 43 have the largest increment in areas of these three crops and the corresponding decrement or increment of the awrcc are the largest or smallest 2 79 0 17 0 03 exceptionally the awrcc increased slightly 1 64 in qiaoxi district where the vegetable area increased by 11 86 however the area of oilseeds with heavy pollution is reduced by 7 67 simultaneously which has played a positive role in promoting awrcc 5 3 conclusions in this paper the evaluation of awrcc and agricultural structural optimization in the yang river basin are studied the improved pca is proposed to select the evaluation indicators solving the problems of complex calculation process due to too many evaluation indicators and missing the information due to too few indicators considering the instability and insensitivity of the traditional ewm the ewm is adapted furthermore the d s evidence theory is applied to obtain the comprehensive indicators weight in the real case study of the yang river basin the results showed that the comprehensive evaluation of awrcc in the yang river basin is improved from 0 2975 and 0 3059 combining the evaluation of awrcc the paper established a model to optimize the planting raising structure and water allocation to meet the requirement of monthly water quality the paper take one year as the allocation period and implement the optimization on water allocation and agricultural structure to maximize the agricultural benefits of ten subareas in the yang river basin the method of water allocation based on the characteristics of water requirement of crops and livestock in growth period is proposed which not only avoid imbalance water allocation but also reduce dimensionality in addition the idea of combing the method of alleviating the pollutant discharge with the method of replenishing water is applied based on current situation of water resources development and utilization in the yang river basin finally the proposed water allocation model is realized the results showed that agricultural structure is being adjusted in the direction of increasing those crops and livestock with high benefits while decreasing planting with low benefits or high pollutant as for livestock the number of large livestock of high benefit increased while that of small livestock decreased slightly therefore high benefits low pollutant are valuable to obtain a rational agricultural structure which can not only alleviate the ecological pressure but also obtain high economic benefits and ultimately lead to the virtuous circle of society economy and ecology and sound development in conclusion the optimization agricultural structure considering water quality combining the evaluation of the awrcc can help promote the awrcc and the local economy realize scientific and sustainable utilization of agriculture water resources and development in the yang river basin declaration of competing interest the
