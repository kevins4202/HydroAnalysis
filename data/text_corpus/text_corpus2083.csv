10415,water scarcity is everywhere and more prominent in arid and semi arid regions moreover water allocation for irrigation is hit by other economic sectors for low per capita profit it is inevitable to extend higher efficient irrigations to replace conventional border irrigation a three year field experiment was conducted to examine the effects of different irrigation methods on maize s water use and economics in the hetao irrigation district of china taking 525 mm border irrigation as the control furrow and drip irrigations at three water levels were implemented furrow irrigation included 100 450 mm 80 360 mm and 60 270 mm of the recommended level while three threshold values of soil matric potential 10 kpa 30 kpa and 50 kpa were used to trigger drip irrigation the grain yield etc water consumption for the whole growing season etcs water consumption during a special growth stage and water productivity were affected significantly by the irrigation methods and water levels the average etc of border furrow and drip irrigations was 537 4 mm 401 8 514 4 mm and 306 6 496 2 mm for different levels respectively on average 10 of the irrigation water was lost through deep percolation under border irrigation while 10 5 29 0 mm of groundwater contributed to etc under drip irrigation with 50 kpa the higher kwc water consumption coefficient was observed in r3 r6 milk maturity stages under drip than border and furrow irrigations the lower ky yield response factor of drip 0 68 than furrow 0 82 indicated the lesser reduction in yield induced by the decreased etc under drip irrigation the 360 mm furrow irrigation obtained a comparable grain yield and net profit with the control but reduced water application by 31 drip irrigation at 30 kpa enhanced yield by 15 increased net profit by 23 and reduced water application by 57 thus drip irrigation at 30 kpa is recommended as the priority to replace border irrigation for maize production in the study area if drip irrigation is unavailable a 360 mm furrow irrigation is also an alternative to reduce water application without compromising benefit keywords the hetao irrigation district border irrigation furrow irrigation drip irrigation crop water consumption crop water production function 1 introduction water critical for agricultural production plays an important role in global food security according to the latest report the word bank 2020 more than 20 of the global cultivated lands are under irrigation and contribute to 40 of the global total food production as the unit land under irrigated agriculture is about two times more productive than that under rainfed agriculture about 70 of the total freshwater withdrawn from the groundwater and watercourses is used in agriculture 20 in industry and 10 in domestic applications and is continued to increase to keep up with the food demand of the growing global population however with changing climate and greater demand water scarcity became a global phenomenon and affecting every economic sector as the highest consumer of water agricultural irrigation yet has the lower return per unit of water than other economic sectors this has been putting an enormous pressure on the agricultural sectors and forcing them to be higher efficient in their water use for more crop per drop monaghan et al 2013 this is more critical in semi arid and arid regions as water scarcity along with other associated problems including soil salinity pose the most critical abiotic constraint in food production minhas et al 2020 while the traditionally used irrigation methods such as flood irrigation exhibit the lowest water use efficiency wue numerous high efficient irrigation methods including furrow and drip irrigations have been developed modified and applied to increase irrigation wue throughout the world for example furrow irrigation is an improved fine surface irrigation where the ridge tillage could help water infiltration and root development and reduce deep percolation resulting in an improved wue benjamin et al 1994 kang et al 2000a xu and li 2007 the furrow irrigation combined with ridge mulched with plastic film has been widely used in arid and semi arid regions of northwest china li and gong 2002 hu et al 2014 ali et al 2019 moreover drip irrigation is an advanced irrigation technology developed rapidly in the past decades mulched drip irrigation bringing together advantages of plastic film mulching and drip irrigation has obvious superiority in reduction of water application and salt regulation by diminishing evaporation and applying water precisely mulched drip irrigation is playing critical roles in agricultural production in arid and semi arid regions globally shrivastava et al 1994 amayreh and al abed 2005 wang et al 2011 2014 like other arid areas around the world the hetao irrigation district hid located in the arid upstream region of the yellow river northwest china has been suffering from water scarcity the hid is the largest artesian irrigation area in asia and one of the top three large irrigation districts in china its total land area is 1 19 106 ha of which 0 57 106 ha is the irrigated arable land with large water allocation 4 5 109 m3 annually from the yellow river most practiced irrigation methods in this region are wild flooding basin and border irrigations causing the low wue along with over irrigation this also resulted in the rising groundwater table and its consequent soil salinization problems further impacting the agricultural production systems yang et al 2016 for example excessive irrigation water has already affected as high as 70 of the arable lands with salinity at varying degrees liu et al 2016 meanwhile the water allocation from the yellow river to the hid has been cut down in recent years through government s regulation to allocate more water to the downstream regions qu et al 2015 thus the contradiction between the reduced water availability and increased salinization must be resolved urgently for the sustainable development of the agricultural production system in the hid with other possible changes with smaller impacts fundamental changes in irrigation management such as implementation of high efficient irrigation methods has been identified as the tipping point to sustain the agricultural system in this region however to date these high efficient irrigations have not received enough attention for acceptance and application in the hid due partially i to the availability of the relatively abundant water resources from the yellow river ii to the lack of awareness of water saving among the local growers iii to the lack of practical irrigation strategies and the relatively higher upfront inputs for the high efficient irrigation methods in recent years a more flexible water allocation policy was advocated in the hid shao et al 2009 and the government s support for farmers to adopt the high efficient irrigation technologies has been increasing year by year followed by a series of encouraging policies and measures xu 2018 all these facts would provide necessity and more opportunity for extension of high efficient irrigation methods hence it is essential to promote public awareness on water saving by presenting the water production and economic benefits of various irrigation methods however the feasibility and economic benefits of these high efficient irrigation methods in the hid have not been studied spring maize is the second most important crop in the hid with a sown area of around 3 4 105 ha li et al 2014 border irrigation is the most widely adopted practice for maize production while researches are ongoing to examine the feasibility of furrow and drip irrigations for example dong and his colleagues demonstrated the feasibility of furrow irrigation in the hid by analyzing the hydrothermal condition in soil and its effects on maize growth dong et al 2018 li et al 2019 as for drip irrigation the earlier study paid attention to the processing tomato with higher economic benefits zhang et al 2017 based on the water heat salt distribution in soil profile sun et al 2017 recommended that drip irrigation in crop growing season should be combined with flooding irrigation in the fallow season named as autumn irrigation locally to leach accumulated salts meanwhile they also reported that the detailed irrigation schedules need further investigation to quantify the impacts of frost freeze phenomenon and particular hydrogeological condition in the hid similarly mao et al 2017 2018 recommended an autumn irrigation once every two years to control soil salinity in the root zone using modeling approach these studies provided a partial theoretical preference for the possible adoption of furrow or drip irrigation however the previous studies were concerned primarily with the water and salt regulation and crop responses under a single irrigation method miao et al 2015 2018 liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 dong et al 2018 qi et al 2018 while a thorough comparison of high efficient irrigation methods over conventional border irrigation could provide information on the water use crop responses and even economic benefits we hypothesized that the high efficient irrigation methods combined with an optimum and applicable scheduling could not only increase the grain yield and water productivity but also improve economic and social benefits by contributing to growers net profit and reducing water application the overall objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of high efficient irrigation methods and their economic benefits on maize production in the hid the specific objectives were i to study maize water consumption characteristics and yield responses to different irrigation methods border furrow drip and water levels ii to analyze the economic benefits of maize production under different irrigation methods iii to optimize the irrigation scheduling for revamping field water management in the hid ultimately the expected goals would contribute to the extension of high efficient irrigation techniques and increasing resilience of crop production to water scarcity 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a three year field experiment was conducted during maize growing seasons april september in 2016 2018 at the shuguang experimental station latitude 40 46 n longitude 107 24 e elevation 1039 m in the hid bayannur of inner mongolia china fig 1 the dominant climate of the study area is temperate continental arid with average annual precipitation of 135 mm and annual evaporation of 2350 mm the study area is characterized by full sunshine throughout the year and a large temperature difference between day and night the cumulative sunshine hours are 3200 annually and about 135 150 days are frost free per year developed from the alluvial material of the yellow river the studied soil had a distinct layered structure a sandy layer appeared at 60 90 cm depth below surface the 0 30 cm soil had a mild salinity with ece electrical conductivity of saturated extract of 7 1 ds m 1 and ph of 8 5 table 1 average organic matter content was 7 3 g kg 1 total nitrogen was 105 4 mg kg 1 available phosphorus was 55 8 mg kg 1 and available potassium was 120 5 mg kg 1 for the topsoil in general the studied soil had a low organic carbon but relatively rich in potassium conforming general soil nutrients characteristics in arid regions of northwest china wang et al 1993 the layered physical and chemical properties of soil in the 0 120 cm profile are listed in table 1 the groundwater table was within the range of 2 3 m below surface which fluctuated over time caused by the flooding irrigation of surrounding farmlands fig 2 after maize harvest the studied field was flood irrigated using the yellow river water in the early november of every year 2 2 agronomic practices the cultivar ximeng no 6 the most commonly cropped hybrid in the hid was planted in a pattern of one film with two row crops fig 3 the transparent plastic film was 8 μm thick polyethylene and 90 cm in width the narrow row mulched by the film was 30 cm and the wide row between two films was 70 cm in width for the furrow irrigation a 60 cm wide ridge was prepared and mulched for planting maize in two rows with a 20 cm deep furrow fig 3b for drip irrigation the drip lines ø 16 mm with an emitter spacing of 30 cm and a discharge of 2 5 l h 1 at an operating pressure of 0 1 mpa were positioned at the center of narrow rows fig 3c maize seeds were sown immediately after mulching at a sowing depth of 5 cm and a spacing of 30 cm the specific sowing dates were april 27 of 2016 april 28 of 2017 and april 29 of 2018 and the corresponding harvesting dates were september 9 of 2016 september 8 of 2017 and september 10 of 2018 respectively 2 3 experimental design a randomized complete block split plot design was used for the three year field experiment the field was divided into three main sectors and assigned with three irrigation methods i e border bi furrow fi and drip di irrigations sub sectors were created for water application levels following conventional practice bi with only one water level of 525 mm was applied as the control miao et al 2018 three water levels high h medium m and low l were randomly nested within fi and di sectors the three water levels for fi were determined as 100 450 mm fi h 80 360 mm fi m and 60 270 mm fi l of the recommended level dong et al 2018 different water levels for di were implemented by controlling different threshold values of soil matric potential smp at the 20 cm depth beneath drip emitter fig 3 10 kpa di h 30 kpa di m and 50 kpa di l totally seven treatments with three replicates 21 plots were included which were conducted in the same field during the studied three seasons each plot was 15 m in length and 4 m in width with eight row of maize planted the plots were separated by 15 cm hight ridges all around with 2 m interval between plots under the same irrigation method and 5 m interval between different methods to reduce the water lateral infiltration among treatments for the timeliness and maneuverability of irrigation irrigation water was pumped from groundwater where the salinity was around 1 8 ds m 1 and ph value 7 7 with little variation over time 2 4 fertilization and field management before sowing the base fertilizer was broadcasted uniformly followed by the rotary tillage considering the relative rich potassium the base fertilizer included 163 kg ha 1 urea 420 kg ha 1 diammonium phosphate and 90 kg ha 1 potassium sulfate additional topdressing 326 kg ha 1 urea was applied during the growing seasons for all treatments as for bi and fi the topdressing was applied through broadcasting followed by the irrigation at the grain filling stage for di the topdressing was applied through fertigation system with the irrigation events following local and common practices field management measures also included regular weeding and of pesticide application to control insects 2 5 observation and calculations 2 5 1 soil moisture and potential after calibration tdr soil moisture probes trime pico64 imko germany were installed at the center of rows to measure soil moisture fig 3 soil volumetric water contents were measured every 20 cm depth down to 120 cm with a 15 day interval during the maize s growing seasons the average soil water content cm3 cm 3 and water storage mm of root zone were calculated by spatially weighed mean method fig 3 the smp used to trigger drip irrigation was measured by a tensiometer which was installed at 20 cm depth below the drip emitter fig 3c and read at 8 00 am and 3 00 pm daily additionally the root zone was defined as 0 100 cm depth below surface in order to calculate the water flux at the lower boundary the soil water potentials at 90 cm and 110 cm depths were monitored at 30 min interval using mps 6 water potential sensors and em50 data loggers meter group inc wa usa fig 3 2 5 2 evaporation rainfall and crop water consumption a weather station hobo h21 001 onset usa and a 20 cm diameter evaporation pan were installed in a grass yard within 100 m of the experimental field the daily pan evaporation ep was measured at 8 00 am crop water consumption was determined by the water balance equation 1 e t c p i δ

production materials and field management seed fertilizer pesticide sowing and harvesting labor etc the variable expenses were the irrigation costs that varied with irrigation methods and water levels including the depreciation of the irrigation systems water usage fee and its related labor etc all the expenses were valued at the local market prices in the corresponding growing season and given the promise of the availability of field water supply whenever needed the well water pump and main water pipe had been equipped 2 6 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was performed among

135 mm respectively fig 4 compared with the average rainfall of 92 mm during the same period in 1990 2010 zhou and feng 2020 2017 was a dry year and 2016 and 2018 were the wet years the evaporation in the beginning of the growing season early may was higher and the maximum rate of daily ep reached around 15 mm fig 4 the cumulative ep was 852 mm 899 mm and 814 mm in growing seasons of 2016 2017 and 2018 creating the evaporation rainfall ratios of 6 9 24 3 and 6 0 respectively fig 4 in this study the 525 mm bi was applied for three times at the v12 12 leaf stage r1 silking stage and r5 dent stage stages table 2 for fi four irrigation events were applied at the v6 6 leaf stage vt tasseling stage r3 milk stage and r5 stages with the total irrigation of 450 mm 360 mm and 270 mm for fi h fi m and fi l respectively table 2 during the v6 r5 stages di was triggered once the designated threshold value was reached and 10 20 mm water was applied for one time the irrigation times and cumulative amounts of di differed markedly in different years among the three years the irrigation amount of 2017 dry year for a same smp level was always higher than those of 2016 and 2018 table 2 3 2 crop water consumption assessing water savings in agriculture requires analyzing the fate of the water applied to the crop fernández et al 2020 it was reported that the maize root could penetrate as deep as 150 200 cm below the surface steduto et al 2012 considering the fluctuating groundwater table of 2 3 m below surface fig 3 the contribution of groundwater to the crop water use could not be ignored the positive value of q under bi indicated that the deep percolation occurred and its volume was larger than capillary rise of groundwater on average about 10 of the irrigation water 44 9 58 9 mm under bi infiltrated through root layer to recharge groundwater table 3 however the negative q values were observed under the fi l and di l with the smaller water applied this implied that the capillary rise of groundwater dominated the water flux at the deeper layer a significant volume of groundwater was contributed to the root zone of crop taking di l as an example it was estimated 10 5 29 0 mm of groundwater contributed to the crop s water uptake annually table 3 during the wet years of 2016 and 2018 the water storages of root zone under bi fi h and di h were larger than those before sowing δs was negative table 3 while in the dry year of 2017 δs were positive for all treatments except di h showing a decrease in water storage after harvest relative to that before sowing the average etc of bi was 537 4 mm over the three seasons the corresponding values were 514 4 mm 446 3 mm and 401 8 mm for fi h fi m and fi l respectively and 496 2 mm 371 4 mm and 306 6 mm for di h di m and di l respectively this implies that etc increased with the increasing irrigation water levels within the studied scope of our experiment considering the actual sampling date and maize growth stages etc was divided into four stages v0 v6 v10 sowing to 6 leaf or10 leaf stages v6 v10 vt 6 leaf or 10 leaf to tasseling stages vt r3 r4 tasseling to milk or dough stages and r3 r4 r6 milk or dough to maturity stages in all treatments the biggest kwc was always obtained in v6 v10 vt stages which should be caused by the vigorously vegetative growth and the longest duration 47 49 days fig 5 the irrigation methods and water levels significantly affected the kwc p 0 05 wherein the highest kwc 55 was recorded under bi in 2017 among the three seasons the di especially with high and medium water levels always showed the higher kwc in r3 r6 stages than bi and fi 3 3 grain yield and harvest index the grain yield was affected significantly p 0 05 by irrigation methods and water levels fig 6 for the same irrigation method grain yield increased with the increasing water levels the di h produced the highest grain yield on average 16 0 t ha 1 among all the treatments while the lowest on average 10 6 t ha 1 was recorded in di l the average grain yields of fi were 14 4 t ha 1 13 3 t ha 1 and 11 4 t ha 1 respectively for three water levels from high to low the grain yield of bi was on average 13 2 t ha 1 within the studied periods in the dry 2017 the grain yields of bi and fi were lower than those in 2016 and 2018 however no decrease was observed under di in 2017 except di l these different responses suggest that di should be more conducive to producing higher crop yields in the drought stress climate relative to bi and fi the hi reflects the transfer efficiency of assimilation from the straw to grain the irrigation methods had a significant impact on hi the higher hi were observed for di h and di m than other treatments particularly in the dry season of 2017 fig 6 indicating that di with smp 30 kpa could promote the transfer of assimilation and subsequently increase grain yield 3 4 water productivity the wpc and wpi were affected significantly p 0 05 by the irrigation methods and water levels table 4 the three year average wpc of bi was 2 46 kg m 3 significantly lower than those of fi 2 79 2 98 kg m 3 and di 3 23 4 12 kg m 3 among the three water levels under the same irrigation method the highest wpc was always observed under the medium water level moreover wpi showed a sequence of di fi bi and a significant increasing trend with the decreasing water levels p 0 05 table 4 the grain yield etc relationships showed variations between fi and di fig 7 it is well known that with the progressively increasing water supply crop yield increases first reaches the peak value the potential yield for a specific growing condition and then decreases due to the possible waterlogging stress and hypoxia conditions steduto et al 2012 under di the grain yield etc relationship confirmed to this quadratic production functions r2 0 85 p 0 01 with the maximum yield of 16 t ha 1 observed at the etc of 460 mm approximately fig 7 but as for fi the relationship between grain yield and etc was linear r2 0 79 p 0 01 which indicated that the potential maximum yield might not be reached under fi in this study if water supplies could be further increased a possible increase in grain yield could be observed additionally the grain yield produced by di was higher than fi with a same etc consumed fig 7 eq 8 where relative yield reduction was related to the corresponding relative reduction in water consumption proposed by doorenbos and kassam 1979 was used widely for a broad range of applications steduto et al 2012 in the equation ky is a yield response factor representing the specific sensitivity to water deficits the effect of a reduction in water consumption on yield losses doorenbos and kassam 1979 in this study the ky was 0 82 and 0 68 respectively for fi and di fig 8 the lower ky of di indicated a lesser reduction in yield induced by the decreased etc this again proved that di was more conducive to producing higher crop yields under the potential drought stress condition than fi 3 5 economic profit the water productivity approach alone is not enough to identify the best option for irrigation fernández et al 2020 hence the economic profit must be considered first the grower s revenue is closely related to the price of the agricultural products the corn price in inner mongolia increased gradually in 2016 2018 from 1 631 cny t 1 1 761 cny t 1 to 1 810 cny t 1 as shown in the real time data from the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of china with corn prices rising in the studied three years the grower s income increased steadily among different treatments the highest average annual income 27 806 cny ha 1 was obtained from the di h and the lowest 18 256 cny ha 1 from the di l due to a substantial reduction in grain yield table 5 the same expenses for different irrigations mainly included seed fertilizer pesticide and other agricultural production materials as well as labor cost of sowing and harvesting table 5 compared with bi the total expenditure of fi was increased by the increased cost of tillage before sowing while more input was recorded for the irrigation systems in di the main differences in expenses among different irrigation methods were mainly caused by irrigation management table 5 generally the fi h increased the net profit by 13 with reduction in water application of 14 over bi the fi m levelled in net profit with bi but reduced irrigation water by 31 meanwhile the net profits of di h and di m increased by 29 and 23 with irrigation water reduced by 19 and 57 correspondingly table 5 4 discussion 4 1 crop water use under different irrigation methods following local practice the studied field was flood irrigated after the harvest every year to leach the accumulated salt during the growing season and to replenish the soil water availability for the following spring crops liu et al 2017 as a result the soil moisture was in good condition when sowing table 1 which could meet the crop s emergence and water requirement at the seedling stage therefore the first irrigation generally occurred at least after a month of sowing as surface irrigations bi and fi s application efficiencies water flow wetting pattern irrigation distribution uniformity etc can be influenced by the plot size layout and land slopes and impact crop s growth and yield subsequently xu and li 2007 nie et al 2012 in this study a land levelling was conducted before sowing and the plot size was 4 m 15 m additionally samples were collected from the middle of the plots to reduce the variations in soil moisture and plant growth resulted from the advance of water flow our results showed that about 10 of applied water was lost through deep percolation in bi table 3 this was consistent with the previous studies in the same region miao et al 2015 2018 however the fi with high and medium water levels reduced irrigation water substantially with no reduction or even increase in grain yield resulting in a higher water productivity table 4 this could be attributed to the fact that the water flow in fi created an additional lateral infiltration due to the ridge furrow tillage systems resulting in the reduced deep percolation benjamin et al 1994 xu and li 2007 moreover although the net profit from fi m was very close to bi fi m reduced irrigation water by 31 over the latter this conclusion is consistent with the previous findings in other areas for example a previous study conducted for safflower production in a semi arid area of iran reported that fi dominantly reduced applied irrigation water by 30 2 against only a 13 reduction in safflower seed yield which was not statistically significant with other treatments shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2016 di applies water slowly to the plant root zone resulting in little water loss through surface runoff or deep percolation and improving water productivity table 4 for the production and distribution of dry matter in maize it is well known that the grain at the final harvest constituted 65 80 of the dry matter accumulated after flowering allison and watson 1966 this means that the photosynthetic assimilation after flowering is the main source of corn grain yield formation and determines the grain yield to a large extent the drip fertigation with characteristics of low amount and high frequency especially with high water level is beneficial to provide a suitable soil water and nutrients environment in root zone at the later growing stages subsequently improve the grain filling and yield formation jha et al 2019 meanwhile the lowest grain and straw yield was also reported by di l with smp threshold of 50 kpa the fact that the total resistance in the soil plant system increases with decreasing soil water potential leading to reduced photosynthesis and growth leach 1980 may explain this reduced yield additionally somewhat reduction in etc under deficit irrigation may not necessarily result in the significant decrease in crop yield kang et al 2000b liang et al 2002 du et al 2015 our results also indicated that the etc was reduced largely under fi and di relative to bi but the high and medium water levels of the former two increased the grain yield resulting in the improved water productivity table 4 the contribution of groundwater to the water uptake by roots could not be ignored when comparing the effects of various irrigation methods in shallow groundwater regions du et al 2015 as for the hid generally flood irrigation recharges groundwater while drip irrigation extracts water from shallow groundwater gao et al 2017 wang et al 2018 our study found that an estimated 44 9 58 9 mm of irrigation water recharged groundwater through deep percolation under bi and 10 5 29 0 mm of groundwater contributed to the etc under di l table 3 it is widely accepted that if the depth to the groundwater table is shallow less than about 3 m and the soil is fine textured capillary rise can contribute a significant volume of water to the rootzone of the crop bos et al 2009 however the groundwater contribution 10 5 29 0 mm under di l in our study was lower than that of previous study 86 mm in the same area reported by wang et al 2018 this difference might be ascribed to the occurrence of a sandy layer in our study which could interrupt the capillary porosity of soil profile and reduce the height of the capillary rise the yield response factor ky represents the effect of a reduction in water consumption on yield losses and captures the essence of the complex linkages between production and water use by a crop involving many biological physical and chemical processes doorenbos and kassam 1979 as stated above the lower ky proves that di is more conducive to producing higher crop yields under the potential drought stress it should also be noted that both ky values obtained by fi 0 82 and di 0 68 were less than the value 1 25 proposed by fao paper 66 steduto et al 2012 this might be related to the values of ymax selected in this study the actual maximum grain yield during the experimental three years which should be lower than the potential yield determined by breed characteristics due to the existing limited fertilization and field management steduto et al 2012 also reported that maize with ky 1 was very sensitive to water deficit with proportional larger yield reductions however our results ky 1 indicate that maize is a relatively stronger drought resistance crop which is also proved by other study that the cereal crops including maize are moderately drought tolerant crops university of würzburg 2018 this discrepancy should be partially attributed to the variations in crop variety characteristics and its planting environments additionally with the advancement of breeding technology the emergence of more drought tolerant varieties changed the drought tolerant threshold values of crops obtained decades ago nuccio et al 2018 according to the changes of kwc among different growth stages the water should be reasonably allocated to the key growth stages of crop allen et al 1998 in our study the higher kwc observed in the r3 r6 stages under di indicates that di should help expand the grain filling duration to consequently produce higher grain yield this result was different from the previous studies which showed that although the etc under di was lower than that under bi the daily average water consumption under di was nearly equal to that under bi the reduction in etc under di was primarily caused by the shorter growth days qin et al 2016 wang et al 2020 it was reported that this might be because mulched drip irrigation could provide better water salt and nutrition environment in root zone and accelerate crop growth and advance maize maturity fan et al 2017 4 2 economic profits of different irrigation methods our results showed switching bi to fi or di could substantially reduce irrigation water application and increase water productivity fereres et al 2017 and fernández et al 2020 stated that water productivity is a simple indicator when the analysis of agricultural water use is made however the local hydrological context must be considered to state whether any reduction in water use actually constitutes water savings that can be used elsewhere perry 2011 in other words the economic return of irrigation often involves more than the value of crop yield ali et al 2007 above all the reduction in irrigation water permits the expansion of irrigation area du et al 2015 importantly the ecological and social benefits resulted from the re allocation of water resources should also be considered pereira et al 2002 specifically the farm level economic consequence of switching from bi to higher efficient irrigations fi or di is that it will increase the net profit for the local growers the off farm external economic consequence is that it will reduce agricultural water use making more water resources available for other local industries or even for other areas in any cases not just the policy makers the growers also should be informed about direct and indirect consequences so that they could motivate themselves to adopt the optional irrigation methods and thus the economic efficiency at the farm and regional levels could be optimized matović et al 2016 sinha et al 2017 the substantial increase in net profit and reduction in water application under di h and di m indicate di is a higher efficient irrigation method over bi and even fi in both yield and economic aspects our field experiment concentrated on the effect of water management so the fertilizers were applied at the same rate among different treatments in order to eliminate the confounding effects of other factors influencing maize s growth however considering the advantages of drip fertigation where fertilizers are applied along with irrigation water to minimize nutrient leaching and to increase fertilizer use efficiency bar yosef 1999 fertilizer could be reduced by 30 ng kee kwong et al 1999 in this context the net profit of di with a proper fertigation strategy should be much higher otherwise it should be stated that the groundwater was used for irrigation in this study rather than the yellow river water the latter has considerable sediment concentration resulting in an increased cost of water filtration for di in that case the net profit of di should be reevaluated besides the economic benefit the utilization of groundwater on one hand could lower the shallow groundwater table to mitigate the salinity buildup in root zone on the other hand the overexploitation of groundwater would break the existing eco hydrological balance at the basin scale and thereby impact the whole agroecological environment thus considering where and how much area could di with groundwater be adopted in the hid and how di could be combined with the flooding autumn irrigation to leach salt out of root zone mao et al 2018 should be given priority in future research to provide predication and verification 5 conclusion a three year field experiment showed that the crop water consumption and economic profit were affected significantly by the irrigation methods and water levels on average 10 of applied water was lost through deep percolation under bi and it was estimated that 10 5 29 0 mm of groundwater contributed to the root zone for water uptake by plants under di with smp threshold value of 50 kpa with 360 mm water level the fi achieved a comparable grain yield and net profit as the control while reduced irrigation water application by 31 on average in the studied three years the di with the smp thresholds of 10 kpa and 30 kpa increased the grain yield and net profit significantly improved water productivity substantially and also reduced water application by 19 and 57 respectively given these results it is suggested that the growers should choose the appropriate higher efficient irrigation at field level to replace the conventional bi according to the local conditions in the areas with relatively scarce surface water and where the local growers have a high acceptance of high efficient irrigation di with smp 30 kpa is recommended while in the areas with relatively abundant surface water and where di is not available or accepted by the growers the fi with 360 mm water is also an alternative to replace bi these findings could provide technical reference for the extension of high efficient irrigation technologies and also provide theoretical basis for

10415,water scarcity is everywhere and more prominent in arid and semi arid regions moreover water allocation for irrigation is hit by other economic sectors for low per capita profit it is inevitable to extend higher efficient irrigations to replace conventional border irrigation a three year field experiment was conducted to examine the effects of different irrigation methods on maize s water use and economics in the hetao irrigation district of china taking 525 mm border irrigation as the control furrow and drip irrigations at three water levels were implemented furrow irrigation included 100 450 mm 80 360 mm and 60 270 mm of the recommended level while three threshold values of soil matric potential 10 kpa 30 kpa and 50 kpa were used to trigger drip irrigation the grain yield etc water consumption for the whole growing season etcs water consumption during a special growth stage and water productivity were affected significantly by the irrigation methods and water levels the average etc of border furrow and drip irrigations was 537 4 mm 401 8 514 4 mm and 306 6 496 2 mm for different levels respectively on average 10 of the irrigation water was lost through deep percolation under border irrigation while 10 5 29 0 mm of groundwater contributed to etc under drip irrigation with 50 kpa the higher kwc water consumption coefficient was observed in r3 r6 milk maturity stages under drip than border and furrow irrigations the lower ky yield response factor of drip 0 68 than furrow 0 82 indicated the lesser reduction in yield induced by the decreased etc under drip irrigation the 360 mm furrow irrigation obtained a comparable grain yield and net profit with the control but reduced water application by 31 drip irrigation at 30 kpa enhanced yield by 15 increased net profit by 23 and reduced water application by 57 thus drip irrigation at 30 kpa is recommended as the priority to replace border irrigation for maize production in the study area if drip irrigation is unavailable a 360 mm furrow irrigation is also an alternative to reduce water application without compromising benefit keywords the hetao irrigation district border irrigation furrow irrigation drip irrigation crop water consumption crop water production function 1 introduction water critical for agricultural production plays an important role in global food security according to the latest report the word bank 2020 more than 20 of the global cultivated lands are under irrigation and contribute to 40 of the global total food production as the unit land under irrigated agriculture is about two times more productive than that under rainfed agriculture about 70 of the total freshwater withdrawn from the groundwater and watercourses is used in agriculture 20 in industry and 10 in domestic applications and is continued to increase to keep up with the food demand of the growing global population however with changing climate and greater demand water scarcity became a global phenomenon and affecting every economic sector as the highest consumer of water agricultural irrigation yet has the lower return per unit of water than other economic sectors this has been putting an enormous pressure on the agricultural sectors and forcing them to be higher efficient in their water use for more crop per drop monaghan et al 2013 this is more critical in semi arid and arid regions as water scarcity along with other associated problems including soil salinity pose the most critical abiotic constraint in food production minhas et al 2020 while the traditionally used irrigation methods such as flood irrigation exhibit the lowest water use efficiency wue numerous high efficient irrigation methods including furrow and drip irrigations have been developed modified and applied to increase irrigation wue throughout the world for example furrow irrigation is an improved fine surface irrigation where the ridge tillage could help water infiltration and root development and reduce deep percolation resulting in an improved wue benjamin et al 1994 kang et al 2000a xu and li 2007 the furrow irrigation combined with ridge mulched with plastic film has been widely used in arid and semi arid regions of northwest china li and gong 2002 hu et al 2014 ali et al 2019 moreover drip irrigation is an advanced irrigation technology developed rapidly in the past decades mulched drip irrigation bringing together advantages of plastic film mulching and drip irrigation has obvious superiority in reduction of water application and salt regulation by diminishing evaporation and applying water precisely mulched drip irrigation is playing critical roles in agricultural production in arid and semi arid regions globally shrivastava et al 1994 amayreh and al abed 2005 wang et al 2011 2014 like other arid areas around the world the hetao irrigation district hid located in the arid upstream region of the yellow river northwest china has been suffering from water scarcity the hid is the largest artesian irrigation area in asia and one of the top three large irrigation districts in china its total land area is 1 19 106 ha of which 0 57 106 ha is the irrigated arable land with large water allocation 4 5 109 m3 annually from the yellow river most practiced irrigation methods in this region are wild flooding basin and border irrigations causing the low wue along with over irrigation this also resulted in the rising groundwater table and its consequent soil salinization problems further impacting the agricultural production systems yang et al 2016 for example excessive irrigation water has already affected as high as 70 of the arable lands with salinity at varying degrees liu et al 2016 meanwhile the water allocation from the yellow river to the hid has been cut down in recent years through government s regulation to allocate more water to the downstream regions qu et al 2015 thus the contradiction between the reduced water availability and increased salinization must be resolved urgently for the sustainable development of the agricultural production system in the hid with other possible changes with smaller impacts fundamental changes in irrigation management such as implementation of high efficient irrigation methods has been identified as the tipping point to sustain the agricultural system in this region however to date these high efficient irrigations have not received enough attention for acceptance and application in the hid due partially i to the availability of the relatively abundant water resources from the yellow river ii to the lack of awareness of water saving among the local growers iii to the lack of practical irrigation strategies and the relatively higher upfront inputs for the high efficient irrigation methods in recent years a more flexible water allocation policy was advocated in the hid shao et al 2009 and the government s support for farmers to adopt the high efficient irrigation technologies has been increasing year by year followed by a series of encouraging policies and measures xu 2018 all these facts would provide necessity and more opportunity for extension of high efficient irrigation methods hence it is essential to promote public awareness on water saving by presenting the water production and economic benefits of various irrigation methods however the feasibility and economic benefits of these high efficient irrigation methods in the hid have not been studied spring maize is the second most important crop in the hid with a sown area of around 3 4 105 ha li et al 2014 border irrigation is the most widely adopted practice for maize production while researches are ongoing to examine the feasibility of furrow and drip irrigations for example dong and his colleagues demonstrated the feasibility of furrow irrigation in the hid by analyzing the hydrothermal condition in soil and its effects on maize growth dong et al 2018 li et al 2019 as for drip irrigation the earlier study paid attention to the processing tomato with higher economic benefits zhang et al 2017 based on the water heat salt distribution in soil profile sun et al 2017 recommended that drip irrigation in crop growing season should be combined with flooding irrigation in the fallow season named as autumn irrigation locally to leach accumulated salts meanwhile they also reported that the detailed irrigation schedules need further investigation to quantify the impacts of frost freeze phenomenon and particular hydrogeological condition in the hid similarly mao et al 2017 2018 recommended an autumn irrigation once every two years to control soil salinity in the root zone using modeling approach these studies provided a partial theoretical preference for the possible adoption of furrow or drip irrigation however the previous studies were concerned primarily with the water and salt regulation and crop responses under a single irrigation method miao et al 2015 2018 liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 dong et al 2018 qi et al 2018 while a thorough comparison of high efficient irrigation methods over conventional border irrigation could provide information on the water use crop responses and even economic benefits we hypothesized that the high efficient irrigation methods combined with an optimum and applicable scheduling could not only increase the grain yield and water productivity but also improve economic and social benefits by contributing to growers net profit and reducing water application the overall objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of high efficient irrigation methods and their economic benefits on maize production in the hid the specific objectives were i to study maize water consumption characteristics and yield responses to different irrigation methods border furrow drip and water levels ii to analyze the economic benefits of maize production under different irrigation methods iii to optimize the irrigation scheduling for revamping field water management in the hid ultimately the expected goals would contribute to the extension of high efficient irrigation techniques and increasing resilience of crop production to water scarcity 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a three year field experiment was conducted during maize growing seasons april september in 2016 2018 at the shuguang experimental station latitude 40 46 n longitude 107 24 e elevation 1039 m in the hid bayannur of inner mongolia china fig 1 the dominant climate of the study area is temperate continental arid with average annual precipitation of 135 mm and annual evaporation of 2350 mm the study area is characterized by full sunshine throughout the year and a large temperature difference between day and night the cumulative sunshine hours are 3200 annually and about 135 150 days are frost free per year developed from the alluvial material of the yellow river the studied soil had a distinct layered structure a sandy layer appeared at 60 90 cm depth below surface the 0 30 cm soil had a mild salinity with ece electrical conductivity of saturated extract of 7 1 ds m 1 and ph of 8 5 table 1 average organic matter content was 7 3 g kg 1 total nitrogen was 105 4 mg kg 1 available phosphorus was 55 8 mg kg 1 and available potassium was 120 5 mg kg 1 for the topsoil in general the studied soil had a low organic carbon but relatively rich in potassium conforming general soil nutrients characteristics in arid regions of northwest china wang et al 1993 the layered physical and chemical properties of soil in the 0 120 cm profile are listed in table 1 the groundwater table was within the range of 2 3 m below surface which fluctuated over time caused by the flooding irrigation of surrounding farmlands fig 2 after maize harvest the studied field was flood irrigated using the yellow river water in the early november of every year 2 2 agronomic practices the cultivar ximeng no 6 the most commonly cropped hybrid in the hid was planted in a pattern of one film with two row crops fig 3 the transparent plastic film was 8 μm thick polyethylene and 90 cm in width the narrow row mulched by the film was 30 cm and the wide row between two films was 70 cm in width for the furrow irrigation a 60 cm wide ridge was prepared and mulched for planting maize in two rows with a 20 cm deep furrow fig 3b for drip irrigation the drip lines ø 16 mm with an emitter spacing of 30 cm and a discharge of 2 5 l h 1 at an operating pressure of 0 1 mpa were positioned at the center of narrow rows fig 3c maize seeds were sown immediately after mulching at a sowing depth of 5 cm and a spacing of 30 cm the specific sowing dates were april 27 of 2016 april 28 of 2017 and april 29 of 2018 and the corresponding harvesting dates were september 9 of 2016 september 8 of 2017 and september 10 of 2018 respectively 2 3 experimental design a randomized complete block split plot design was used for the three year field experiment the field was divided into three main sectors and assigned with three irrigation methods i e border bi furrow fi and drip di irrigations sub sectors were created for water application levels following conventional practice bi with only one water level of 525 mm was applied as the control miao et al 2018 three water levels high h medium m and low l were randomly nested within fi and di sectors the three water levels for fi were determined as 100 450 mm fi h 80 360 mm fi m and 60 270 mm fi l of the recommended level dong et al 2018 different water levels for di were implemented by controlling different threshold values of soil matric potential smp at the 20 cm depth beneath drip emitter fig 3 10 kpa di h 30 kpa di m and 50 kpa di l totally seven treatments with three replicates 21 plots were included which were conducted in the same field during the studied three seasons each plot was 15 m in length and 4 m in width with eight row of maize planted the plots were separated by 15 cm hight ridges all around with 2 m interval between plots under the same irrigation method and 5 m interval between different methods to reduce the water lateral infiltration among treatments for the timeliness and maneuverability of irrigation irrigation water was pumped from groundwater where the salinity was around 1 8 ds m 1 and ph value 7 7 with little variation over time 2 4 fertilization and field management before sowing the base fertilizer was broadcasted uniformly followed by the rotary tillage considering the relative rich potassium the base fertilizer included 163 kg ha 1 urea 420 kg ha 1 diammonium phosphate and 90 kg ha 1 potassium sulfate additional topdressing 326 kg ha 1 urea was applied during the growing seasons for all treatments as for bi and fi the topdressing was applied through broadcasting followed by the irrigation at the grain filling stage for di the topdressing was applied through fertigation system with the irrigation events following local and common practices field management measures also included regular weeding and of pesticide application to control insects 2 5 observation and calculations 2 5 1 soil moisture and potential after calibration tdr soil moisture probes trime pico64 imko germany were installed at the center of rows to measure soil moisture fig 3 soil volumetric water contents were measured every 20 cm depth down to 120 cm with a 15 day interval during the maize s growing seasons the average soil water content cm3 cm 3 and water storage mm of root zone were calculated by spatially weighed mean method fig 3 the smp used to trigger drip irrigation was measured by a tensiometer which was installed at 20 cm depth below the drip emitter fig 3c and read at 8 00 am and 3 00 pm daily additionally the root zone was defined as 0 100 cm depth below surface in order to calculate the water flux at the lower boundary the soil water potentials at 90 cm and 110 cm depths were monitored at 30 min interval using mps 6 water potential sensors and em50 data loggers meter group inc wa usa fig 3 2 5 2 evaporation rainfall and crop water consumption a weather station hobo h21 001 onset usa and a 20 cm diameter evaporation pan were

including the depreciation of the irrigation systems water usage fee and its related labor etc all the expenses were valued at the local market prices in the corresponding growing season and given the promise of the availability of field water supply whenever needed the well water pump and main water pipe had been equipped 2 6 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was performed among

135 mm respectively fig 4 compared with the average rainfall of 92 mm during the same period in 1990 2010 zhou and feng 2020 2017 was a dry year and 2016 and 2018 were the wet years the evaporation in the beginning of the growing season early may was higher and the maximum rate of daily ep reached around 15 mm fig 4 the cumulative ep was 852 mm 899 mm and 814 mm in growing seasons of 2016 2017 and 2018 creating the evaporation rainfall ratios of 6 9 24 3 and 6 0 respectively fig 4 in this study the 525 mm bi was applied for three times at the v12 12 leaf stage r1 silking stage and r5 dent stage stages table 2 for fi four irrigation events were applied at the v6 6 leaf stage vt tasseling stage r3 milk stage and r5 stages with the total irrigation of 450 mm 360 mm and 270 mm for fi h fi m and fi l respectively table 2 during the v6 r5 stages di was triggered once the designated threshold value was reached and 10 20 mm water was applied for one time the irrigation times and cumulative amounts of di differed markedly in different years among the three years the irrigation amount of 2017 dry year for a same smp level was always higher than those of 2016 and 2018 table 2 3 2 crop water consumption assessing water savings in agriculture requires analyzing the fate of the water applied to the crop fernández et al 2020 it was reported that the maize root could penetrate as deep as 150 200 cm below the surface steduto et al 2012 considering the fluctuating groundwater table of 2 3 m below surface fig 3 the contribution of groundwater to the crop water use could not be ignored the positive value of q under bi indicated that the deep percolation occurred and its volume was larger than capillary rise of groundwater on average about 10 of the irrigation water 44 9 58 9 mm under bi infiltrated through root layer to recharge groundwater table 3 however the negative q values were observed under the fi l and di l with the smaller water applied this implied that the capillary rise of groundwater dominated the water flux at the deeper layer a significant volume of groundwater was contributed to the root zone of crop taking di l as an example it was estimated 10 5 29 0 mm of groundwater contributed to the crop s water uptake annually table 3 during the wet years of 2016 and 2018 the water storages of root zone under bi fi h and di h were larger than those before sowing δs was negative table 3 while in the dry year of 2017 δs were positive for all treatments except di h showing a decrease in water storage after harvest relative to that before sowing the average etc of bi was 537 4 mm over the three seasons the corresponding values were 514 4 mm 446 3 mm and 401 8 mm for fi h fi m and fi l respectively and 496 2 mm 371 4 mm and 306 6 mm for di h di m and di l respectively this implies that etc increased with the increasing irrigation water levels within the studied scope of our experiment considering the actual sampling date and maize growth stages etc was divided into four stages v0 v6 v10 sowing to 6 leaf or10 leaf stages v6 v10 vt 6 leaf or 10 leaf to tasseling stages vt r3 r4 tasseling to milk or dough stages and r3 r4 r6 milk or dough to maturity stages in all treatments the biggest kwc was always obtained in v6 v10 vt stages which should be caused by the vigorously vegetative growth and the longest duration 47 49 days fig 5 the irrigation methods and water levels significantly affected the kwc p 0 05 wherein the highest kwc 55 was recorded under bi in 2017 among the three seasons the di especially with high and medium water levels always showed the higher kwc in r3 r6 stages than bi and fi 3 3 grain yield and harvest index the grain yield was affected significantly p 0 05 by irrigation methods and water levels fig 6 for the same irrigation method grain yield increased with the increasing water levels the di h produced the highest grain yield on average 16 0 t ha 1 among all the treatments while the lowest on average 10 6 t ha 1 was recorded in di l the average grain yields of fi were 14 4 t ha 1 13 3 t ha 1 and 11 4 t ha 1 respectively for three water levels from high to low the grain yield of bi was on average 13 2 t ha 1 within the studied periods in the dry 2017 the grain yields of bi and fi were lower than those in 2016 and 2018 however no decrease was observed under di in 2017 except di l these different responses suggest that di should be more conducive to producing higher crop yields in the drought stress climate relative to bi and fi the hi reflects the transfer efficiency of assimilation from the straw to grain the irrigation methods had a significant impact on hi the higher hi were observed for di h and di m than other treatments particularly in the dry season of 2017 fig 6 indicating that di with smp 30 kpa could promote the transfer of assimilation and subsequently increase grain yield 3 4 water productivity the wpc and wpi were affected significantly p 0 05 by the irrigation methods and water levels table 4 the three year average wpc of bi was 2 46 kg m 3 significantly lower than those of fi 2 79 2 98 kg m 3 and di 3 23 4 12 kg m 3 among the three water levels under the same irrigation method the highest wpc was always observed under the medium water level moreover wpi showed a sequence of di fi bi and a significant increasing trend with the decreasing water levels p 0 05 table 4 the grain yield etc relationships showed variations between fi and di fig 7 it is well known that with the progressively increasing water supply crop yield increases first reaches the peak value the potential yield for a specific growing condition and then decreases due to the possible waterlogging stress and hypoxia conditions steduto et al 2012 under di the grain yield etc relationship confirmed to this quadratic production functions r2 0 85 p 0 01 with the maximum yield of 16 t ha 1 observed at the etc of 460 mm approximately fig 7 but as for fi the relationship between grain yield and etc was linear r2 0 79 p 0 01 which indicated that the potential maximum yield might not be reached under fi in this study if water supplies could be further increased a possible increase in grain yield could be observed additionally the grain yield produced by di was higher than fi with a same etc consumed fig 7 eq 8 where relative yield reduction was related to the corresponding relative reduction in water consumption proposed by doorenbos and kassam 1979 was used widely for a broad range of applications steduto et al 2012 in the equation ky is a yield response factor representing the specific sensitivity to water deficits the effect of a reduction in water consumption on yield losses doorenbos and kassam 1979 in this study the ky was 0 82 and 0 68 respectively for fi and di fig 8 the lower ky of di indicated a lesser reduction in yield induced by the decreased etc this again proved that di was more conducive to producing higher crop yields under the potential drought stress condition than fi 3 5 economic profit the water productivity approach alone is not enough to identify the best option for irrigation fernández et al 2020 hence the economic profit must be considered first the grower s revenue is closely related to the price of the agricultural products the corn price in inner mongolia increased gradually in 2016 2018 from 1 631 cny t 1 1 761 cny t 1 to 1 810 cny t 1 as shown in the real time data from the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of china with corn prices rising in the studied three years the grower s income increased steadily among different treatments the highest average annual income 27 806 cny ha 1 was obtained from the di h and the lowest 18 256 cny ha 1 from the di l due to a substantial reduction in grain yield table 5 the same expenses for different irrigations mainly included seed fertilizer pesticide and other agricultural production materials as well as labor cost of sowing and harvesting table 5 compared with bi the total expenditure of fi was increased by the increased cost of tillage before sowing while more input was recorded for the irrigation systems in di the main differences in expenses among different irrigation methods were mainly caused by irrigation management table 5 generally the fi h increased the net profit by 13 with reduction in water application of 14 over bi the fi m levelled in net profit with bi but reduced irrigation water by 31 meanwhile the net profits of di h and di m increased by 29 and 23 with irrigation water reduced by 19 and 57 correspondingly table 5 4 discussion 4 1 crop water use under different irrigation methods following local practice the studied field was flood irrigated after the harvest every year to leach the accumulated salt during the growing season and to replenish the soil water availability for the following spring crops liu et al 2017 as a result the soil moisture was in good condition when sowing table 1 which could meet the crop s emergence and water requirement at the seedling stage therefore the first irrigation generally occurred at least after a month of sowing as surface irrigations bi and fi s application efficiencies water flow wetting pattern irrigation distribution uniformity etc can be influenced by the plot size layout and land slopes and impact crop s growth and yield subsequently xu and li 2007 nie et al 2012 in this study a land levelling was conducted before sowing and the plot size was 4 m 15 m additionally samples were collected from the middle of the plots to reduce the variations in soil moisture and plant growth resulted from the advance of water flow our results showed that about 10 of applied water was lost through deep percolation in bi table 3 this was consistent with the previous studies in the same region miao et al 2015 2018 however the fi with high and medium water levels reduced irrigation water substantially with no reduction or even increase in grain yield resulting in a higher water productivity table 4 this could be attributed to the fact that the water flow in fi created an additional lateral infiltration due to the ridge furrow tillage systems resulting in the reduced deep percolation benjamin et al 1994 xu and li 2007 moreover although the net profit from fi m was very close to bi fi m reduced irrigation water by 31 over the latter this conclusion is consistent with the previous findings in other areas for example a previous study conducted for safflower production in a semi arid area of iran reported that fi dominantly reduced applied irrigation water by 30 2 against only a 13 reduction in safflower seed yield which was not statistically significant with other treatments shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2016 di applies water slowly to the plant root zone resulting in little water loss through surface runoff or deep percolation and improving water productivity table 4 for the production and distribution of dry matter in maize it is well known that the grain at the final harvest constituted 65 80 of the dry matter accumulated after flowering allison and watson 1966 this means that the photosynthetic assimilation after flowering is the main source of corn grain yield formation and determines the grain yield to a large extent the drip fertigation with characteristics of low amount and high frequency especially with high water level is beneficial to provide a suitable soil water and nutrients environment in root zone at the later growing stages subsequently improve the grain filling and yield formation jha et al 2019 meanwhile the lowest grain and straw yield was also reported by di l with smp threshold of 50 kpa the fact that the total resistance in the soil plant system increases with decreasing soil water potential leading to reduced photosynthesis and growth leach 1980 may explain this reduced yield additionally somewhat reduction in etc under deficit irrigation may not necessarily result in the significant decrease in crop yield kang et al 2000b liang et al 2002 du et al 2015 our results also indicated that the etc was reduced largely under fi and di relative to bi but the high and medium water levels of the former two increased the grain yield resulting in the improved water productivity table 4 the contribution of groundwater to the water uptake by roots could not be ignored when comparing the effects of various irrigation methods in shallow groundwater regions du et al 2015 as for the hid generally flood irrigation recharges groundwater while drip irrigation extracts water from shallow groundwater gao et al 2017 wang et al 2018 our study found that an estimated 44 9 58 9 mm of irrigation water recharged groundwater through deep percolation under bi and 10 5 29 0 mm of groundwater contributed to the etc under di l table 3 it is widely accepted that if the depth to the groundwater table is shallow less than about 3 m and the soil is fine textured capillary rise can contribute a significant volume of water to the rootzone of the crop bos et al 2009 however the groundwater contribution 10 5 29 0 mm under di l in our study was lower than that of previous study 86 mm in the same area reported by wang et al 2018 this difference might be ascribed to the occurrence of a sandy layer in our study which could interrupt the capillary porosity of soil profile and reduce the height of the capillary rise the yield response factor ky represents the effect of a reduction in water consumption on yield losses and captures the essence of the complex linkages between production and water use by a crop involving many biological physical and chemical processes doorenbos and kassam 1979 as stated above the lower ky proves that di is more conducive to producing higher crop yields under the potential drought stress it should also be noted that both ky values obtained by fi 0 82 and di 0 68 were less than the value 1 25 proposed by fao paper 66 steduto et al 2012 this might be related to the values of ymax selected in this study the actual maximum grain yield during the experimental three years which should be lower than the potential yield determined by breed characteristics due to the existing limited fertilization and field management steduto et al 2012 also reported that maize with ky 1 was very sensitive to water deficit with proportional larger yield reductions however our results ky 1 indicate that maize is a relatively stronger drought resistance crop which is also proved by other study that the cereal crops including maize are moderately drought tolerant crops university of würzburg 2018 this discrepancy should be partially attributed to the variations in crop variety characteristics and its planting environments additionally with the advancement of breeding technology the emergence of more drought tolerant varieties changed the drought tolerant threshold values of crops obtained decades ago nuccio et al 2018 according to the changes of kwc among different growth stages the water should be reasonably allocated to the key growth stages of crop allen et al 1998 in our study the higher kwc observed in the r3 r6 stages under di indicates that di should help expand the grain filling duration to consequently produce higher grain yield this result was different from the previous studies which showed that although the etc under di was lower than that under bi the daily average water consumption under di was nearly equal to that under bi the reduction in etc under di was primarily caused by the shorter growth days qin et al 2016 wang et al 2020 it was reported that this might be because mulched drip irrigation could provide better water salt and nutrition environment in root zone and accelerate crop growth and advance maize maturity fan et al 2017 4 2 economic profits of different irrigation methods our results showed switching bi to fi or di could substantially reduce irrigation water application and increase water productivity fereres et al 2017 and fernández et al 2020 stated that water productivity is a simple indicator when the analysis of agricultural water use is made however the local hydrological context must be considered to state whether any reduction in water use actually constitutes water savings that can be used elsewhere perry 2011 in other words the economic return of irrigation often involves more than the value of crop yield ali et al 2007 above all the reduction in irrigation water permits the expansion of irrigation area du et al 2015 importantly the ecological and social benefits resulted from the re allocation of water resources should also be considered pereira et al 2002 specifically the farm level economic consequence of switching from bi to higher efficient irrigations fi or di is that it will increase the net profit for the local growers the off farm external economic consequence is that it will reduce agricultural water use making more water resources available for other local industries or even for other areas in any cases not just the policy makers the growers also should be informed about direct and indirect consequences so that they could motivate themselves to adopt the optional irrigation methods and thus the economic efficiency at the farm and regional levels could be optimized matović et al 2016 sinha et al 2017 the substantial increase in net profit and reduction in water application under di h and di m indicate di is a higher efficient irrigation method over bi and even fi in both yield and economic aspects our field experiment concentrated on the effect of water management so the fertilizers were applied at the same rate among different treatments in order to eliminate the confounding effects of other factors influencing maize s growth however considering the advantages of drip fertigation where fertilizers are applied along with irrigation water to minimize nutrient leaching and to increase fertilizer use efficiency bar yosef 1999 fertilizer could be reduced by 30 ng kee kwong et al 1999 in this context the net profit of di with a proper fertigation strategy should be much higher otherwise it should be stated that the groundwater was used for irrigation in this study rather than the yellow river water the latter has considerable sediment concentration resulting in an increased cost of water filtration for di in that case the net profit of di should be reevaluated besides the economic benefit the utilization of groundwater on one hand could lower the shallow groundwater table to mitigate the salinity buildup in root zone on the other hand the overexploitation of groundwater would break the existing eco hydrological balance at the basin scale and thereby impact the whole agroecological environment thus considering where and how much area could di with groundwater be adopted in the hid and how di could be combined with the flooding autumn irrigation to leach salt out of root zone mao et al 2018 should be given priority in future research to provide predication and verification 5 conclusion a three year field experiment showed that the crop water consumption and economic profit were affected significantly by the irrigation methods and water levels on average 10 of applied water was lost through deep percolation under bi and it was estimated that 10 5 29 0 mm of groundwater contributed to the root zone for water uptake by plants under di with smp threshold value of 50 kpa with 360 mm water level the fi achieved a comparable grain yield and net profit as the control while reduced irrigation water application by 31 on average in the studied three years the di with the smp thresholds of 10 kpa and 30 kpa increased the grain yield and net profit significantly improved water productivity substantially and also reduced water application by 19 and 57 respectively given these results it is suggested that the growers should choose the appropriate higher efficient irrigation at field level to replace the conventional bi according to the local conditions in the areas with relatively scarce surface water and where the local growers have a high acceptance of high efficient irrigation di with smp 30 kpa is recommended while in the areas with relatively abundant surface water and where di is not available or accepted by the growers the fi with 360 mm water is also an alternative to replace bi these findings could provide technical reference for the extension of high efficient irrigation technologies and also provide theoretical basis for

10416,the widening gap between china s urban and rural diets and population size poses new challenges to the sustainable supply of agricultural water undoubtedly increasing the uncertainty of ensuring china s food security this study compares water required for food in urban and rural areas from 1981 to 2016 using data collected from multiple sources and projects the water required amount in urban and rural areas based different diet scenarios the results show that food consumption patterns in both urban and rural areas gradually changed from a vegetable dominated diet to an animal dominated one in past decades during 1981 2016 total agricultural water requirements awr for urban residents increased from 167 to 671 billion m3 whereas the for rural residents decreased from 485 to 403 billion m3 at the same period the urban and rural irrigation water requirements iwr shows similar trend to awr and increased animal products consumption and decreased grain consumption are the main reason for iwr change in urban and rural areas respectively furthermore under current dietary patterns national iwr will reach to 249 billion m3 when the expected population peak occurs in 2032 however if according to the recommended diet china needs to consume 24 41 billion m³ more irrigation water to meet national food demand and this value will exceed the upper limit allowed by china s water policy this study also proposes some measures to ensure china s agricultural water security based on presented findings keywords urban areas rural areas food security agriculture water china 1 introduction adequate agricultural water supply is the foundation of food production at present global agricultural water consumption exceeds 2700 billion m³ accounting for approximately 70 of global freshwater withdraw shabbir et al 2014 by the middle of this century global agricultural water consumption is projected to reach to 3200 billion m³ as population growth and two thirds of the global population about 6 billion will face water crisis due to the excessive water consumption by food production united nations educational scientific and cultural organization 2012 2015 moreover increasing extreme weather frequencies could also expand pressure on global agricultural water supplies in the future gosling and arnell 2016 as the most populous country in the world china s food security has always been at the top of the political agenda since 2004 improve agricultural production capacity has been at the center of every national 1 st policy document lu et al 2015 however drastic changes in food habits change and population structure have put tremendous pressure on china s agricultural water sustainable use he et al 2019 in addition the scale of expansion of china s cities is increasing the conflict between cities and agriculture due to the limited amount of water available davies and evan 2018 to protect the deteriorating water environment the chinese government published the report opinions of the state council on the implementation of the most stringent water resources management also called the three red lines policy of water resources in 2012 which set mandatory targets for national water consumption by 2030 zang et al 2016 this water protection policy will further increase the difficulty of supplying agricultural water in response to china s food production due to the widening differences in food consumption patterns setting different goals for agricultural water management in urban and rural areas is becoming important in general urban residents consume more animal products than rural residents due to higher income especially in developing countries li et al 2013 with it more water is consumed for urban areas for animal food production according to food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao an affluent diet requires more than 8 10 times as much water as a vegetarian diet and the current livestock accounts for 8 of global agricultural water consumption fao 2006 many studies have noted the impact of different dietary structure on agricultural water demand for example vanham et al 2016 analyzed the relationship between urbanization levels and the food s water demand in dutch cities they found that in extremely urbanized municipalities such as amsterdam and rotterdam people eat more meat and cereals and less potatoes than in other cities therefore the current food related water demand in both amsterdam and rotterdam is higher 3245 l cap day than in other cities 3126 l cap day marlow et al 2009 investigated the impact of california food consumption patterns on environmental systems they found that nonvegetarian diet required 2 9 times more water than vegetarian diet and the greatest contribution to the differences came from the consumption of beef vanham et al 2018 refined the water demand of different diets in all cities in the united kingdom france and germany and showed that a healthier meat containing diet decreased the water demand by 11 35 larger reductions were observed for the healthy pescatarian 33 55 reduction and healthy vegetarian 35 55 reduction diets changes in diet may put more water pressure on china than other countries due to its large population base according to liu et al 2008 global water crisis is driven by climate change economic development and population growth however in china food habits change will be the main cause for future water shortages in addition the rapid change in population structure has also increased the difficulty of china s agricultural water supply china is the country with the largest urban population in the world and its urban population scale currently accounts for about 20 of the world s total national bureau of statistics of china 2019 according to china s urban development plan china s urbanization rate will increase from 57 in 2016 to 80 in 2050 and more than 250 million people will be transferred from rural to urban areas zhang et al 2016 this means that agricultural water demand in urban and rural areas will change significantly from the current situation due to the changing population size as mentioned above different food consumption patterns and population sizes in urban and rural areas will bring new challenges to china s agricultural water management and it is crucial to evaluate the true demands for agricultural water in urban and rural areas to ensure food security in recent years research on water required for food consumption has increased and most of these studies focused on the supporting capacity of water resources to food production under changing environment mclaughlin and kinzelbach 2015 analyzes the relationship between future global food security and water demand who concluded that the water requirements of current agriculture are significantly less than global reserves however some populous countries such as china and india will likely experience food crisis due to water shortage rockström et al 2009 studied the impact of the effective use of green water on the global food crisis by a vegetation growth model the results showed that 36 of world population will face green and blue water shortage in 2050 while through green water management can effectively reduce risks for dry spells and agricultural droughts the impact of urbanization on agricultural water supply has been also extensively studied in many countries for example richtera et al 2013 investigated the impact of urban expansion on agricultural water use in arid regions taking adelaide phoenix san antonio and san diego as examples they concluded that unless cities work with farmers to implement irrigation conservation measures through urban rural partnerships urban areas will face severe water shortages and ecological degradation the impacts of urbanization on agricultural water use in china were investigated using the china water simulation model cwsm model results show a significant negative correlation between urbanization and agricultural water use for every 1 increase in urbanization rate the amount of water available for agriculture will decrease by 0 47 leading to lower crop yields and ultimately affecting national food security yan et al 2015 climate change will also bring uncertainty to the food related water security according to guo and shen in northwestern china the irrigation water demand is projected to increase by 4 3 6 2 billion m3 during 2016 2075 with temperature increase while the annual runoff will only increase by 4 8 8 5 billion m3 which is equivalent to or even less than the regional increased irrigation water demand guo and shen 2016 in addition several studies have discussed the macro relationships between food water and environment these studies focus on how to ensure the sustainable development of water resources keeping in mind future food security ringler et al 2013 wichelns and dennis 2017 in general although current studies have discussed the relationship between water and food from various perspectives and have presented many useful quantitative conclusions few studies focus on a comparison of agricultural water requirements in urban and rural areas at the national level moreover data from other study areas has often been used when local data was unavailable to our knowledge there are no comprehensive analyses of future population growth and food habits change on urban and rural agricultural water requirements china is the largest water and food consumer in the world as well as one of the fastest growing economy in view of the increasing demand and diminishing supply of water resources assessing the urban and rural agricultural water requirements is crucial not only for china s food and water security but also for other developing countries in our research the content can be summarized as follows 1 changes in diet patterns of urban and rural residents from 1981 to 2016 are introduced and agricultural water requirements of urban and rural areas are estimated 2 agricultural water requirements is predicted when china s population peak arrives 2032 under different diet scenarios 3 agricultural water development strategies are presented based on china s water supply and demand situation in the future 2 methods to calculate the agriculture water requirements of urban and rural areas from 1981 to 2016 we included the following thirteen main food items based on chinese eating habits vegetable foods included wheat rice maize vegetables fruits and vegetable oils animal foods included pork beef mutton and goat poultry fish and sea food eggs and milk moreover the effects of food habit change and population growth on future agriculture water demand is also analyzed in this study 2 1 data sources the data used in this study is grouped into the following four categories 1 the annual per capita food consumption data in urban and rural areas from 1981 to 2016 was collected from the china statistical yearbook and results of study by ju 2017 the population in urban and rural areas from 1981 to 2016 was obtained from databases of the chinese bureau of statistics 2 climate data required to estimate the reference crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation were acquired from 777 national meteorological stations these stations have daily records of climatic variables from 1981 to 2016 the values of crop coefficient of different crops at different growth stages come from the research results of fao 3 the agriculture yield of different crops from 1981 to 2016 were obtained from statistical yearbooks such as the china agricultural statistical yearbook and the china statistical yearbook 4 food consumption pattern population scale and population structure are the three parameters used to predict the future agriculture water requirements the current dietary pattern in urban and rural regions the diet pattern recommended by nutritionists and chinese government recommended diet pattern serve as three scenarios for future dietary patterns the future population size and structure used in this study was obtained from reports issued by the state council of china 2 2 water requirements of vegetable food consumption because vegetable oil is an indirect type of vegetable food that is converted from oil crops we divided annual consumption of each type of vegetable food under two categories the first category is indirect vegetable foods which refers to vegetable oil the second is direct vegetable foods which refers to other vegetable foods but excluding vegetable oils the annual consumption of each type of vegetable food in urban and rural areas was calculated as follows 1 g i v e g u f i v e g i n d u s i f i v e g d i r u 2 g i v e g r f i v e g i n d r s i f i v e g d i r r where gi veg u and gi veg r are the per capita annual consumption of each type of vegetable food in urban and rural areas respectively kg cap fi veg ind u and fi veg dir u are the per capita urban annual consumption of indirect and direct vegetable foods in category i respectively kg cap fi veg ind r and fi veg dir r are the rural annual consumption of indirect and direct vegetable foods in category i respectively kg cap si is the efficiency that oil crops are converted into vegetable oils in china soybean oil accounts for approximately 50 of the total vegetable oil consumption and the conversion efficiency of soybean oil is 17 liu 2017 this study selected the conversion efficiency of soybean oil in place of vegetable oil the total water requirements for crop growth in growing seasons is the sum of precipitation requirements and irrigation water requirements 3 w i v e g w i p r e w i i r r i where wi veg is the total water demand for each type of vegetable food in its growing season mm wi pre and wi irri is the precipitation water demand mm and irrigation water demand mm of each type of vegetable food in its growing season respectively the total water demand during crop growth includes water used to compensate for evaporation loss from a cropped field which is a function of reference evaporation et0 mm and the crop coefficient the penman monteith method has been widely used to calculate et0 because of its higher accuracy and this method was adopted in this study 4 w i v e g e t 0 k c i 5 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 273 t u 2 e a e d δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where wi veg is the water demand for each type of vegetable food during its growing season mm kc i is the crop coefficient of each crop and the value of kc i used in our research come from the crop water requirements calculation guide issued by fao fao 1998 δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve kpa c rn and g are the net radiation mj m2 d and soil heat flux mj m2 d respectively γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c t is the mean daily air temperature c u2 is the daily average wind speed at a 2 m height m s and ea and ed are the saturation vapor pressure kpa and actual atmospheric water vapor pressure kpa respectively effective rainfall is the amount of rainfall that can be absorbed by crops during growing seasons in this study the usda scs model was used to calculate china s effective rainfall from 1981 to 2016 6 p i e f f p 125 0 2 p 125 p 250 m m m 125 0 1 p p 250 m m m where pi eff and p are the monthly effective rainfall mm and monthly total rainfall mm respectively irrigation water requirements are calculated as the difference between wi veg and pi eff during crop growing seasons when the pi eff is more than the wi veg the wi veg may be met by rainfall without irrigation when the pi eff is less than the wi veg the crop needs extra water from irrigation 7 w i p r e w i v e g w i v e g p i e f f p i e f f w i v e g p i e

and twveg irri r are annual irrigation water demand of vegetable food in urban and rural areas respectively m3 pop u and pop r are the annual population in urban and rural areas respectively mcii varies significantly in different regions due to climate condition and crop types according to wang et al 2008 the average mcii in china is 1 29 thus the mcii was set as 1 29 in this study bi is the actual annual arable land area required to produce 1 kg of each type of food m2 kg ri self is the food self sufficiency rate of each type of crop and was set at 95 national development and reform commission 2008 rdef irri is the refers to the coefficient of deficit irrigation owing to the irrigation water shortage a deficit irrigation pattern is widely used in china and the actual crop yields are also related to this irrigation pattern according to he et al 2019 the average rdef irri is 0 8 in china and this value was used in our research 2 3 water requirements of animal food consumption the water requirement of each type of animal products is defined as the total volume of water used to grow and process its feed water used for drinking and water used for cleaning house and the like chapagain and hoekstra 2004 due to the diversity of climate and planting structure the feed structure in different countries varies greatly in china feed grain accounts for majority 74 of the total feed consumption long 1999 and water requirements of food grain is calculated in this study according to wang and lv 2012 china s feed grain is generally composed of three parts wheat corn and soy beans and the proportion of each part is 18 59 and 23 respectively thus the precipitation and irrigation water requirements for feed growth in china can be calculated as eqs 14 and 15 and the total water requirements and irrigation water requirements of each type of animal products can be calculated as eqs 16 and 17 14 w f e e d p r e 18 w w h e a t p r e 59 w c o r n p r e 23 w b e a n p r e 15

hoekstra 2003 considering the feed conversion ratio of each type of animal product zi fcr the amount of per capita annual feed consumed in animal food production in urban gi ani u kg cap and rural regions gi ani r kg cap is given as follows 18 g i a n i u f i a n i u z i f c r 19 g i a n i r f i a n i r z i f c r where fi ani u and fi ani r is the per capita annual animal products consumed in urban and rural regions respectively kg cap the value of zi fcr collected from a series of reports and academic journal articles hu 2017 similar to vegetable food the total water and irrigation water

development of the economy both urban and rural residents have been undergoing dramatic changes in their dietary patterns fig 1 grain including wheat rice and maize is the core of the traditional diet however its consumption has fallen rapidly over the past 35 years especially in urban areas in 1981 the per capita grain consumption in urban areas was 135 kg this value dropped to 59 kg in 2016 a decline of 56 at the same time annual rural grain consumption fell from 241 kg cap to 142 kg cap although china has become the world s largest vegetable exporter since 2005 and vegetable production has increased dramatically annual per capita vegetable consumption in both urban and rural areas is falling by 32 and 28 respectively the per capita consumption of fruits in urban areas was 1 7 times that of rural areas in 2016 while the total relative growth of rural areas 332 was higher than that of urban areas 174 from 1981 to 2016 vegetable oil is the fastest growing vegetable food item in both urban and rural areas at present soybean oil accounts for approximately 50 of the total vegetable oil consumption while the domestic production of soybeans can only supply 15 of national demand thus more than 90 million tons of soybeans are imported from abroad most of which come from the united states and brazil chen et al 2012 the per capita consumption of animal food during past 35 years is shown in fig 2 we can clearly see that the per capita consumption of all animal foods increased through time meats including pork beef mutton and goat and poultry and fish and other seafoods are considered a luxury food and its consumption is clearly related to income levels in 1981 meat consumption in urban and rural areas of china was only 28 kg cap and 11 kg cap respectively these values have increased to 54 kg cap and 36 kg cap respectively in 2016 due to increased household income furthermore the consumption of eggs and milk which are food types that are prone to be neglected in traditional diets has also increased by 106 and 302 in urban areas and by 554 and 856 in rural areas respectively in general the dietary patterns of urban and rural residents have followed similar trends from 1981 to 2016 however compared with rural residents urban residents eat less grain and vegetables but more vegetable oils fruits and animal foods figs 1 and 2 3 2 agricultural water requirements in urban and rural regions from 1981 to 2016 the total agricultural water requirements awr for food consumption from 1981 to 2016 in chinese urban areas are shown in fig 3 a which shows that urban water demand at different rates before and after 1999 from 1981 to 1999 the urban awr increased from 167 billion m3 to 281 billion m3 from 1999 to 2016 however the urban awr rapidly increased from 281 billion m3 to 671 billion m3 currently approximately 671 billion m3 of awr is consumed by urban residents which is 4 times higher than that consumed by urban residents in 1981 although the per capita consumption of grain and vegetables decreased during the study period fig 1 the overall growth in urban population increased the water requirements of these food items nevertheless the growth rate of the awr of grain and vegetables increased at a slower rate compared to those of other vegetable foods vegetable oil is the vegetable food whose awr increased the most in the past 35 years the water requirements for vegetable oil consumption increased from 23 billion m3 to 139 billion m3 an increase of 502 fig 3a also shows that the increased water requirements for animal based food consumption is the main reason for water demand growth during the study period in 1981 the size of the water needed for the meat consumption of urban residents was 53 billion m3 which accounted for 31 of urban awr at that time in 2016 the water needed for meats increased to 328 billion m3 which accounted for approximately 50 of the urban awr from 1981 to 2016 the urban water demand of milk and eggs rose by 555 and 1181 respectively the rural agriculture water demand was calculated by the same methods although the dietary patterns in urban and rural areas have similar trends from 1981 to 2016 the declining rural population has resulted in decreasing water consumptions in rural areas fig 3b we can see from fig 3b that the awr for meat and vegetable oil consumption continues to increase in rural areas however the awr growth rate of these food items cannot offset the decline rate of grain in 2004 the awr for food in urban areas exceeded that of rural areas for the first time and the gap between the two has expanded since then at present awr of urban food consumption is 671 billion m3 which is 1 7 times that of rural areas fig 4 a shows the trend of irrigation water requirements iwr of food in urban areas from 1981 to 2016 the iwr fluctuated more than the awr because the effective rainfall affecting crop growth differs every year in general the trend for the iwr during the study period is similar to that of the awr and the average annual iwr consumption accounts for roughly 23 of the awr in urban areas in 1981 51 billion m3 of iwr was enough to meet the urban food demand this value rose to 138 billion m3 in 2016 an increase of 169 according to the china water resources bulletin the ministry of water resources 2016 net irrigation water consumption in 2016 was 209 billion m3 this means that the urban iwr used to meet urban food demand accounted for 66 of the national total if the food demand in urban areas was met domestically the trend in rural iwr is opposite that of the urban areas fig 4b the iwr consumption in rural areas decreased from 162 billion m3 in 1981 to 90 billion m3 in 2016 representing a decline factor of 17 decline in irrigation water consumption for grain is the main reason for the rural iwr decrease in the past 35 years in 2016 the iwr for rural grain consumption is 31 billion m3 accounted for 35 of rural total iwr in that year which was a quarter lower than in 1981 nationwide iwr for food has not shown significant changes in the past few decades and china s total irrigation water demand in 2016 increased by only 7 compared to 1981 3 3 the difference between per capita agricultural water requirements of urban and rural areas in order to exclude the impact of population scale on agricultural water demand this study also analyze the difference between per capita awr of urban and rural residents as shown in fig 5 per capita urban and rural awr have similar trends from 1981 to 1999 per capita awr have declined in both urban and rural areas by factors of 9 8 and 4 4 respectively however from 2000 to 2016 per capita awr tended to increase in both regions according to the calculation formula of this study the per capita awr is determined by many factors for example water intensive diet pattern more animal food and less vegetable food can lead to increased awr conversely improvements in agricultural production lessen the awr required to meet food demand the combined effect of multiple factors caused china s per capita awr show different trends around 1999 in general the per capita awr in urban areas is always higher than that in rural areas from 1981 to 2016 the multi year average per capita awr in urban and rural areas is 801 m3 and 572 m3 respectively meaning that the average awr required to meet the food needs of a city resident is 229 m3 more than that of a rural resident fig 6 shows the per capita awr for different food items in 1981 1999 and 2016 in 1981 827 m3 of awr was required to meet the food needs of an urban resident of which 31 and 32 accounted for the awr of grain and meats respectively at the same time 606 m3 of awr was needed for a rural resident 57 of which was used for grain consumption in 2016 the size of the awr needed to meet the food requirements of an urban and rural resident increased to 845 m3 and 684 m3 respectively of which 49 and 41 respectively were used for meat consumption in addition the awr requirement for most vegetable food items has been decreasing in both urban and rural areas however the water demand for vegetable oil has increased significantly over the past few decades in urban areas the per capita awr for vegetable oil production increased from 115 m3 in 1981 to 175 m3 in 2016 and this value increased from 45 m3 in 1981 to 148 m3 in 2016 in rural areas we can conclude from fig 6 that meat and vegetable oil is the main reason for the per capita awr difference between urban and rural areas 3 4 forecast of agricultural water requirements at peak population in 2032 future agricultural water requirements largely depend on population scale and food consumption pattern according to the prediction of the chinese central government china s total population will peak in 2032 at 1 473 billion and urban and rural populations will account for 75 and 25 of the total population at that time respectively china state council 1994 a reasonable diet structure suitable for chinese residents has also been recommended by many official agencies for example chinese nutrition society and the state council of china put forward different reasonable food consumption patterns from the perspective of nutritional balance china state council 2001 chinese nutrition society 2016 both recommended diets emphasize reducing grain intake and increasing milk and egg intake to predict the impact of population scale and diet pattern on water requirements in 2032 the current diet pattern s1 the nutritionists recommended diet pattern s2 and the government recommended diet pattern s3 was used as three scenarios to predict future food consumption of urban and rural residents a comparison of different diet patterns is shown in table1 particularly due to s2 does not distinguish between urban and rural residents this study assumes that the urban and rural food habits in 2032 is the same under s2 scenario this study also assumes that crop yield and climate condition for each food item are the same as in 2016 the sizes of the awr of urban and rural residents at peak population are shown in fig 7 using the calculation method proposed in this study under current food habits an increase in urban population will increase awr from 671 billion m3 in 2016 to 935 billion m3 in 2032 however urban areas need more awr in the future if a healthier diet is chosen and approximately 1020 and 1129 billion m³ of agriculture water are required under s2 and s3 scenarios respectively for rural areas due to a significant decline in population rural awr declines in all three diet scenarios in the future in 2016 awr in rural areas accounted for 60 of urban areas with the change of food habits and population scale rural awr will account for 27 33 and 23 in urban areas in 2032 under s1 s2 and s3 respectively the amount of irrigation water required in urban and rural areas in 2032 are shown in fig 8 in 2016 138 billion m3 of iwr was required for urban food production and this value will reach 193 billion m3 under current diet pattern however according to the recommended diet china needs to consume 12 41 billion m³ more irrigation water to meet urban food demand eggs and milk which are often overlooked food items are the reason why the recommended diet consumes more water than the current diet compared with 2016 rural iwr in 2032 will decline with 38 24 and 38 under s1 s2 and s3 respectively but these reduced irrigation volumes cannot offset the amount of urban growth and the national iwr will increase 21 62 billion m3 compared to 2016 in general although the food habits recommended by the government and nutritionists is more conducive to health this comes at the cost of consuming more water resources which will further increase pressure on china to ensure food safety 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty analysis this study used multi source data to compare china s water demand for urban and rural food production from 1981 to 2016 and the awr and iwr needed in 2032 were also projected under different diet scenarios our estimates match well with some previous studies for example he et al 2019 analyzed the impact of chinese dietary changes on irrigation water requirements and showed that from 1981 to 2016 an average of 172 billon m3 of irrigation water is needed to meet chinese food demands during the same period this study showed the average iwr for food in urban and rural areas are 83 and 112 billion m3 respectively fig 4a and 4b thus the total iwr consumed in china is 195 billion m3 liu and savenije 2008 who analyzed the food related water demand from the perspective of nutrition balance found that the average per capita water requirement for food production from 1981 to 2003 was 606 m3 which is comparable to the 657 m3 obtained in this study for the same period the values obtained in this study and those of he et al 2019 and liu and savenije 2008 are within 15 of each other in addition liu 2007 reported that blue water consumption accounted for 19 of global water consumption for crop growth a percentage similar to the ratio of irrigation water demand to total water demand in our research future food production is closely related to agricultural technology level and climatic conditions however our study assumed that crop yields and climate conditions in 2032 will be the same as those in 2016 which is a source of error regarding our future water demand predictions the heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers pollutes the water environment requiring plenty of fresh water to enable the absorption of these pollutants in this study we have not considered china s agricultural pollution which indicates that we may have underestimated the pressure of agricultural production on water resources in addition soil water is an important water source for crop growth especially in arid areas or water shortage periods while the effect of soil water on irrigation water requirements is ignored in our research due to a lack of national soil moisture data this may lead to uncertainties in irrigation water requirements for food irrigation efficiency is an important factor affecting the calculation of iwr however due to lack of detailed and accurate data this parameter was not considered in this study and this may lead to an underestimation of china s iwr lastly some important parameters such as mcii ri self and rdef irri will affect the calculation of agricultural water demand however since it is difficult to obtain a long series of data on these parameters the fixed values of these parameters are adopted by our research which will also bring errors to our results 4 2 challenges to ensuring sustainability of china s agricultural water based on our research results if the food demand in china was met domestically the consumption amount of irrigation water in 2016 is 228 3 billion m3 in 2032 the projection indicates that the total irrigation water demand would increase to 248 8 billion m3 under current diets and water demand will further increase to 272 7 or 289 7 billion m3 if according to the recommended diet patterns however actual net irrigation water consumption in 2016 was 209 billion m3 this means that china is currently unable to achieve food self sufficiency target due to insufficient irrigation water moreover according to the water resources comprehensive plan released by the china s central government in 2030 china s irrigation water consumption in 2030 should not exceed 245 billion m³ national development and reform commission 2009 according to this plan the difference in china s irrigation water consumption volume between 2030 and 2016 cannot exceed 36 billion and increased iwr calculated by our research will account for 56 9 123 3 and 170 6 of the total water consumption increase under s1 s2 and s3 respectively hence the increase in irrigation water consumption allowed by government s plan can only support the population increase under the current diet pattern and unable to meet recommended healthy food habits paradoxically at present china has the world s most obese population improving china s health condition through a reasonable diet seems to be a consensus of the whole society of china non communicable diseases risk factor collaboration 2017 in the future most of china s agricultural water demands will be used to feed urban residents figs 6 and 7 but the rapid development of urbanization in the past few decades has led to increasing competition in water use in agriculture and cities according to china water resources bulletin agriculture is the sector that has reduced its water use by the largest amount in the past five years agricultural water use fell from 390 3 billion m3 in 2012 to 376 8 billion m3 in 2016 conversely urbanization is the fastest growing sector with water use increasing by 8 5 billion m3 over the past five years worryingly there are 400 cities in china are still experiencing water shortages with water shortages reaching 6 billion m³ national development and reform commission 2009 china s uneven spatial distribution of water resources also poses challenges to food production currently cultivated land area and grain yield in northern china account for 60 and 58 of the country respectively while northern china accounts for only 20 of the national water resources and most of them are concentrated in summer he et al 2018 in order to meet the growing food demand a large amount of groundwater has been extracted in northern china and large scale and long term groundwater extraction has led to a decline in groundwater levels and an increasing adverse impact on the environment moreover according to relevant research results the area of cultivated land in the northern china has further expanded in recent years yang et al 2019 this means that china s future food security will face greater water challenges in general the food patterns change the water competition between agriculture and cities and the mismatch between cultivated land and water resources has widened the gap between available agricultural supply and demand which will put greater pressure on china s future food production 4 3 countermeasures to ensure agricultural water sustainability ensuring adequate agricultural water supply has become a major challenge to ensure china s food security in the future in the past decades china s government has proposed many effective measures to strengthen agricultural water supply capacity for instance the water pollution prevention and action plan policy was proposed in 2015 this policy requires that the city scale arable land area population scale and industry pattern must be determined based on the amount of water available and high water consumption projects should be strictly managed in water deficient areas china is also trying to improve its euci the ratio of surface water used by crops to the total irrigation volume applied to increase water supply potential at present china s euci is 0 542 meaning that about half of irrigation water is wasted china plans to implement measures to increase the euci to 0 60 by 2030 resulting in an increase of 25 billion m3 of irrigation water sources moreover a national efficient water saving irrigation management system was established in 2016 to improve the management level of china s agricultural water resources in addition to measures that have already been implemented three other promising options to ensure effective use of agricultural water can be implemented the first approach aims to reduce food wastage during the processes of production transportation and consumption water consumption for food production is directly proportional to the food consumption for a prescribed agricultural technology therefore food savings translate into water savings according to the report on food waste in chinese cities the amount of urban grain waste in china was 18 million tons in 2015 world wide fund for nature 2018 meaning that approximately 3 2 billion m3 of irrigation water was wasted by urban residents there are many measures that can be implemented to reduce food waste such as optimizing the food transportation network improving storage capacity and changing lifestyle habits the second opinion is to increase the import of water intensive foods appropriately such as meats and soybeans in the context of a healthy diet structure china may have been unable to balance the contradiction between food security and water security only rely on domestic supply in the future increasing food imports not only directly ensures food supplies but also deduce pressure on china s water supply especially in arid and semi arid regions the third opinion is to improve agricultural water saving levels china is the second largest consumer of agricultural water in the world just behind india however china s irrigation water use efficiency is much lower than developed countries such as israel and australia and about half of the irrigation water is wasted currently by evaporation or leaking underground learning advanced water saving technologies from other countries to improve agriculture water efficiency is an effective measure to realize water food coordinated security 5 conclusion china is the world s largest water and food consumer and its food and water security are significant not only for the nation s economic development and social stability but also for global sustainable development however rapid changes in diet structure and population size make urban and rural areas face different agricultural water security goals in this study data from multiple sources were collected and compiled to compare water required for food in urban and rural areas from 1981 to 2016 moreover the size of the future water demand in urban and rural areas was also calculated assuming a changing population structure and diet pattern our results show that the total agricultural water requirements for urban residents increased from 167 to 671 billion m3 during 1981 2016 whereas for the rural residents decreased from 485 to 403 billion m3 at the same period furthermore the irrigation water and total agricultural water showed the same change trend during past 35 years and increased animal products consumption and decreased grain consumption are the main reason for irrigation water demand change in urban and rural areas respectively from the perspective of per capita food consumption the average agricultural water required to meet the food needs of a city resident is 229 m3 more than that of a rural resident we also project that if current crop yield and climate condition hold true in the future then the national irrigation water demand will increase from 228 billion m3 in 2016 to 249 billion m3 in 2032 under current diet scenarios however if according to the recommended diet china needs to consume 24 41 billion m³ more irrigation water to meet national food demand and this value will exceed the water use limit allowed by china s government sustainable food production is a top priority issue in china however due to water shortage the changing diet patterns and population will make china s food supply more difficult to ensure in the future based on the findings of this study we propose three measures to mitigate the pressure on food and water 1 reduce food wastage during the processes of production transportation and consumption 2 increase the import of water intensive foods appropriately such as meats and soybeans 3 china should improve agricultural water saving levels in general ensuring food and water security simultaneously is proving to be a difficult challenge in china as its population increases along with dietary changes looking forward comprehensive studies that explore all aspects of the relationship between water and food are needed to develop integrated and explicit plans for the sustainable use of resources while ensuring the cooperative security of food and water in china

10416,the widening gap between china s urban and rural diets and population size poses new challenges to the sustainable supply of agricultural water undoubtedly increasing the uncertainty of ensuring china s food security this study compares water required for food in urban and rural areas from 1981 to 2016 using data collected from multiple sources and projects the water required amount in urban and rural areas based different diet scenarios the results show that food consumption patterns in both urban and rural areas gradually changed from a vegetable dominated diet to an animal dominated one in past decades during 1981 2016 total agricultural water requirements awr for urban residents increased from 167 to 671 billion m3 whereas the for rural residents decreased from 485 to 403 billion m3 at the same period the urban and rural irrigation water requirements iwr shows similar trend to awr and increased animal products consumption and decreased grain consumption are the main reason for iwr change in urban and rural areas respectively furthermore under current dietary patterns national iwr will reach to 249 billion m3 when the expected population peak occurs in 2032 however if according to the recommended diet china needs to consume 24 41 billion m³ more irrigation water to meet national food demand and this value will exceed the upper limit allowed by china s water policy this study also proposes some measures to ensure china s agricultural water security based on presented findings keywords urban areas rural areas food security agriculture water china 1 introduction adequate agricultural water supply is the foundation of food production at present global agricultural water consumption exceeds 2700 billion m³ accounting for approximately 70 of global freshwater withdraw shabbir et al 2014 by the middle of this century global agricultural water consumption is projected to reach to 3200 billion m³ as population growth and two thirds of the global population about 6 billion will face water crisis due to the excessive water consumption by food production united nations educational scientific and cultural organization 2012 2015 moreover increasing extreme weather frequencies could also expand pressure on global agricultural water supplies in the future gosling and arnell 2016 as the most populous country in the world china s food security has always been at the top of the political agenda since 2004 improve agricultural production capacity has been at the center of every national 1 st policy document lu et al 2015 however drastic changes in food habits change and population structure have put tremendous pressure on china s agricultural water sustainable use he et al 2019 in addition the scale of expansion of china s cities is increasing the conflict between cities and agriculture due to the limited amount of water available davies and evan 2018 to protect the deteriorating water environment the chinese government published the report opinions of the state council on the implementation of the most stringent water resources management also called the three red lines policy of water resources in 2012 which set mandatory targets for national water consumption by 2030 zang et al 2016 this water protection policy will further increase the difficulty of supplying agricultural water in response to china s food production due to the widening differences in food consumption patterns setting different goals for agricultural water management in urban and rural areas is becoming important in general urban residents consume more animal products than rural residents due to higher income especially in developing countries li et al 2013 with it more water is consumed for urban areas for animal food production according to food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao an affluent diet requires more than 8 10 times as much water as a vegetarian diet and the current livestock accounts for 8 of global agricultural water consumption fao 2006 many studies have noted the impact of different dietary structure on agricultural water demand for example vanham et al 2016 analyzed the relationship between urbanization levels and the food s water demand in dutch cities they found that in extremely urbanized municipalities such as amsterdam and rotterdam people eat more meat and cereals and less potatoes than in other cities therefore the current food related water demand in both amsterdam and rotterdam is higher 3245 l cap day than in other cities 3126 l cap day marlow et al 2009 investigated the impact of california food consumption patterns on environmental systems they found that nonvegetarian diet required 2 9 times more water than vegetarian diet and the greatest contribution to the differences came from the consumption of beef vanham et al 2018 refined the water demand of different diets in all cities in the united kingdom france and germany and showed that a healthier meat containing diet decreased the water demand by 11 35 larger reductions were observed for the healthy pescatarian 33 55 reduction and healthy vegetarian 35 55 reduction diets changes in diet may put more water pressure on china than other countries due to its large population base according to liu et al 2008 global water crisis is driven by climate change economic development and population growth however in china food habits change will be the main cause for future water shortages in addition the rapid change in population structure has also increased the difficulty of china s agricultural water supply china is the country with the largest urban population in the world and its urban population scale currently accounts for about 20 of the world s total national bureau of statistics of china 2019 according to china s urban development plan china s urbanization rate will increase from 57 in 2016 to 80 in 2050 and more than 250 million people will be transferred from rural to urban areas zhang et al 2016 this means that agricultural water demand in urban and rural areas will change significantly from the current situation due to the changing population size as mentioned above different food consumption patterns and population sizes in urban and rural areas will bring new challenges to china s agricultural water management and it is crucial to evaluate the true demands for agricultural water in urban and rural areas to ensure food security in recent years research on water required for food consumption has increased and most of these studies focused on the supporting capacity of water resources to food production under changing environment mclaughlin and kinzelbach 2015 analyzes the relationship between future global food security and water demand who concluded that the water requirements of current agriculture are significantly less than global reserves however some populous countries such as china and india will likely experience food crisis due to water shortage rockström et al 2009 studied the impact of the effective use of green water on the global food crisis by a vegetation growth model the results showed that 36 of world population will face green and blue water shortage in 2050 while through green water management can effectively reduce risks for dry spells and agricultural droughts the impact of urbanization on agricultural water supply has been also extensively studied in many countries for example richtera et al 2013 investigated the impact of urban expansion on agricultural water use in arid regions taking adelaide phoenix san antonio and san diego as examples they concluded that unless cities work with farmers to implement irrigation conservation measures through urban rural partnerships urban areas will face severe water shortages and ecological degradation the impacts of urbanization on agricultural water use in china were investigated using the china water simulation model cwsm model results show a significant negative correlation between urbanization and agricultural water use for every 1 increase in urbanization rate the amount of water available for agriculture will decrease by 0 47 leading to lower crop yields and ultimately affecting national food security yan et al 2015 climate change will also bring uncertainty to the food related water security according to guo and shen in northwestern china the irrigation water demand is projected to increase by 4 3 6 2 billion m3 during 2016 2075 with temperature increase while the annual runoff will only increase by 4 8 8 5 billion m3 which is equivalent to or even less than the regional increased irrigation water demand guo and shen 2016 in addition several studies have discussed the macro relationships between food water and environment these studies focus on how to ensure the sustainable development of water resources keeping in mind future food security ringler et al 2013 wichelns and dennis 2017 in general although current studies have discussed the relationship between water and food from various perspectives and have presented many useful quantitative conclusions few studies focus on a comparison of agricultural water requirements in urban and rural areas at the national level moreover data from other study areas has often been used when local data was unavailable to our knowledge there are no comprehensive analyses of future population growth and food habits change on urban and rural agricultural water requirements china is the largest water and food consumer in the world as well as one of the fastest growing economy in view of the increasing demand and diminishing supply of water resources assessing the urban and rural agricultural water requirements is crucial not only for china s food and water security but also for other developing countries in our research the content can be summarized as follows 1 changes in diet patterns of urban and rural residents from 1981 to 2016 are introduced and agricultural water requirements of urban and rural areas are estimated 2 agricultural water requirements is predicted when china s population peak arrives 2032 under different diet scenarios 3 agricultural water development strategies are presented based on china s water supply and demand situation in the future 2 methods to calculate the agriculture water requirements of urban and rural areas from 1981 to 2016 we included the following thirteen main food items based on chinese eating habits vegetable foods included wheat rice maize vegetables fruits and vegetable oils animal foods included pork beef mutton and goat poultry fish and sea food eggs and milk moreover the effects of food habit change and population growth on future agriculture water demand is also analyzed in this study 2 1 data sources the data used in this study is grouped into the following four categories 1 the annual per capita food consumption data in urban and rural areas from 1981 to 2016 was collected from the china statistical yearbook and results of study by ju 2017 the population in urban and rural areas from 1981 to 2016 was obtained from databases of the chinese bureau of statistics 2 climate data required to estimate the reference crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation were acquired from 777 national meteorological stations these stations have daily records of climatic variables from 1981 to 2016 the values of crop coefficient of different crops at different growth stages come from the research results of fao 3 the agriculture yield of different crops from 1981 to 2016 were obtained from statistical yearbooks such as the china agricultural statistical yearbook and the china statistical yearbook 4 food consumption pattern population scale and population structure are the three parameters used to predict the future agriculture water requirements the current dietary pattern in urban and rural regions the diet pattern recommended by nutritionists and chinese government recommended diet pattern serve as three scenarios for future dietary patterns the future population size and structure used in this study was obtained from reports issued by the state council of china 2 2 water requirements of vegetable food consumption because vegetable oil is an indirect type of vegetable food that is converted from oil crops we divided annual consumption of each type of vegetable food under two categories the first category is indirect vegetable foods which refers to vegetable oil the second is direct vegetable foods which refers to other vegetable foods but excluding vegetable oils the annual consumption of each type of vegetable food in urban and rural areas was calculated as follows 1 g i v e g u f i v e g i n d u s i f i v e g d i

fi veg ind u and fi veg dir u are the per capita urban annual consumption of indirect and direct vegetable foods in category i respectively kg cap fi veg ind r and fi veg dir r are the rural annual consumption of indirect and direct vegetable foods in category i respectively kg cap si is the efficiency that oil crops are converted into vegetable oils in china soybean oil accounts for approximately 50 of the total vegetable oil consumption and the conversion efficiency of soybean oil is 17 liu 2017 this study selected the conversion efficiency of soybean oil in place of vegetable oil the total water requirements for crop growth in growing seasons is the sum of precipitation requirements and irrigation water requirements 3 w i v e g w i p r e w i i r r i where wi veg is the total water demand for each type of vegetable food in its growing season mm wi pre and wi irri is the precipitation water demand mm and irrigation water demand mm of each type of vegetable food in its growing season respectively the total water demand during crop growth includes water used to compensate for evaporation loss from a cropped field which is a function of reference evaporation et0 mm and the crop coefficient the penman monteith method has been widely used to calculate et0 because of its higher accuracy and this method was adopted in this study 4 w i v e g e t 0 k c i 5 e t 0 0 408

soil heat flux mj m2 d respectively γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c t is the mean daily air temperature c u2 is the daily average wind speed at a 2 m height m s and ea and ed are the saturation vapor pressure kpa and actual atmospheric water vapor pressure kpa respectively effective rainfall is the amount of rainfall that can be absorbed by crops during growing seasons in this study the usda

monthly total rainfall mm respectively irrigation water requirements are calculated as the difference between wi veg and pi eff during crop growing seasons when the pi eff is more than the wi veg the wi veg may be met by rainfall without irrigation when the pi eff is less than the wi veg the crop needs extra water from irrigation 7 w i p r e w i v e g w i v e g p i e f f p i e f f w i v e g p i e

are also related to this irrigation pattern according to he et al 2019 the average rdef irri is 0 8 in china and this value was used in our research 2 3 water requirements of animal food consumption the water requirement of each type of animal products is defined as the total volume of water used to grow and process its feed water used for drinking and water used for cleaning house and the like chapagain and hoekstra 2004 due to the diversity of climate and planting structure the feed structure in different countries varies greatly in china feed grain accounts for majority 74 of the total feed consumption long 1999 and water requirements of food grain is calculated in this study according to wang and lv 2012 china s feed grain is generally composed of three parts wheat corn and soy beans and the proportion of each part is 18 59 and 23 respectively thus the precipitation and irrigation water requirements for feed growth in china can be calculated as eqs 14 and 15 and the total water requirements and irrigation water requirements of each type of animal products can be calculated as eqs 16 and 17 14 w f e e d p r e 18 w w h e a t p r e 59 w c o r n p r e 23 w b e a n p r e 15

development of the economy both urban and rural residents have been undergoing dramatic changes in their dietary patterns fig 1 grain including wheat rice and maize is the core of the traditional diet however its consumption has fallen rapidly over the past 35 years especially in urban areas in 1981 the per capita grain consumption in urban areas was 135 kg this value dropped to 59 kg in 2016 a decline of 56 at the same time annual rural grain consumption fell from 241 kg cap to 142 kg cap although china has become the world s largest vegetable exporter since 2005 and vegetable production has increased dramatically annual per capita vegetable consumption in both urban and rural areas is falling by 32 and 28 respectively the per capita consumption of fruits in urban areas was 1 7 times that of rural areas in 2016 while the total relative growth of rural areas 332 was higher than that of urban areas 174 from 1981 to 2016 vegetable oil is the fastest growing vegetable food item in both urban and rural areas at present soybean oil accounts for approximately 50 of the total vegetable oil consumption while the domestic production of soybeans can only supply 15 of national demand thus more than 90 million tons of soybeans are imported from abroad most of which come from the united states and brazil chen et al 2012 the per capita consumption of animal food during past 35 years is shown in fig 2 we can clearly see that the per capita consumption of all animal foods increased through time meats including pork beef mutton and goat and poultry and fish and other seafoods are considered a luxury food and its consumption is clearly related to income levels in 1981 meat consumption in urban and rural areas of china was only 28 kg cap and 11 kg cap respectively these values have increased to 54 kg cap and 36 kg cap respectively in 2016 due to increased household income furthermore the consumption of eggs and milk which are food types that are prone to be neglected in traditional diets has also increased by 106 and 302 in urban areas and by 554 and 856 in rural areas respectively in general the dietary patterns of urban and rural residents have followed similar trends from 1981 to 2016 however compared with rural residents urban residents eat less grain and vegetables but more vegetable oils fruits and animal foods figs 1 and 2 3 2 agricultural water requirements in urban and rural regions from 1981 to 2016 the total agricultural water requirements awr for food consumption from 1981 to 2016 in chinese urban areas are shown in fig 3 a which shows that urban water demand at different rates before and after 1999 from 1981 to 1999 the urban awr increased from 167 billion m3 to 281 billion m3 from 1999 to 2016 however the urban awr rapidly increased from 281 billion m3 to 671 billion m3 currently approximately 671 billion m3 of awr is consumed by urban residents which is 4 times higher than that consumed by urban residents in 1981 although the per capita consumption of grain and vegetables decreased during the study period fig 1 the overall growth in urban population increased the water requirements of these food items nevertheless the growth rate of the awr of grain and vegetables increased at a slower rate compared to those of other vegetable foods vegetable oil is the vegetable food whose awr increased the most in the past 35 years the water requirements for vegetable oil consumption increased from 23 billion m3 to 139 billion m3 an increase of 502 fig 3a also shows that the increased water requirements for animal based food consumption is the main reason for water demand growth during the study period in 1981 the size of the water needed for the meat consumption of urban residents was 53 billion m3 which accounted for 31 of urban awr at that time in 2016 the water needed for meats increased to 328 billion m3 which accounted for approximately 50 of the urban awr from 1981 to 2016 the urban water demand of milk and eggs rose by 555 and 1181 respectively the rural agriculture water demand was calculated by the same methods although the dietary patterns in urban and rural areas have similar trends from 1981 to 2016 the declining rural population has resulted in decreasing water consumptions in rural areas fig 3b we can see from fig 3b that the awr for meat and vegetable oil consumption continues to increase in rural areas however the awr growth rate of these food items cannot offset the decline rate of grain in 2004 the awr for food in urban areas exceeded that of rural areas for the first time and the gap between the two has expanded since then at present awr of urban food consumption is 671 billion m3 which is 1 7 times that of rural areas fig 4 a shows the trend of irrigation water requirements iwr of food in urban areas from 1981 to 2016 the iwr fluctuated more than the awr because the effective rainfall affecting crop growth differs every year in general the trend for the iwr during the study period is similar to that of the awr and the average annual iwr consumption accounts for roughly 23 of the awr in urban areas in 1981 51 billion m3 of iwr was enough to meet the urban food demand this value rose to 138 billion m3 in 2016 an increase of 169 according to the china water resources bulletin the ministry of water resources 2016 net irrigation water consumption in 2016 was 209 billion m3 this means that the urban iwr used to meet urban food demand accounted for 66 of the national total if the food demand in urban areas was met domestically the trend in rural iwr is opposite that of the urban areas fig 4b the iwr consumption in rural areas decreased from 162 billion m3 in 1981 to 90 billion m3 in 2016 representing a decline factor of 17 decline in irrigation water consumption for grain is the main reason for the rural iwr decrease in the past 35 years in 2016 the iwr for rural grain consumption is 31 billion m3 accounted for 35 of rural total iwr in that year which was a quarter lower than in 1981 nationwide iwr for food has not shown significant changes in the past few decades and china s total irrigation water demand in 2016 increased by only 7 compared to 1981 3 3 the difference between per capita agricultural water requirements of urban and rural areas in order to exclude the impact of population scale on agricultural water demand this study also analyze the difference between per capita awr of urban and rural residents as shown in fig 5 per capita urban and rural awr have similar trends from 1981 to 1999 per capita awr have declined in both urban and rural areas by factors of 9 8 and 4 4 respectively however from 2000 to 2016 per capita awr tended to increase in both regions according to the calculation formula of this study the per capita awr is determined by many factors for example water intensive diet pattern more animal food and less vegetable food can lead to increased awr conversely improvements in agricultural production lessen the awr required to meet food demand the combined effect of multiple factors caused china s per capita awr show different trends around 1999 in general the per capita awr in urban areas is always higher than that in rural areas from 1981 to 2016 the multi year average per capita awr in urban and rural areas is 801 m3 and 572 m3 respectively meaning that the average awr required to meet the food needs of a city resident is 229 m3 more than that of a rural resident fig 6 shows the per capita awr for different food items in 1981 1999 and 2016 in 1981 827 m3 of awr was required to meet the food needs of an urban resident of which 31 and 32 accounted for the awr of grain and meats respectively at the same time 606 m3 of awr was needed for a rural resident 57 of which was used for grain consumption in 2016 the size of the awr needed to meet the food requirements of an urban and rural resident increased to 845 m3 and 684 m3 respectively of which 49 and 41 respectively were used for meat consumption in addition the awr requirement for most vegetable food items has been decreasing in both urban and rural areas however the water demand for vegetable oil has increased significantly over the past few decades in urban areas the per capita awr for vegetable oil production increased from 115 m3 in 1981 to 175 m3 in 2016 and this value increased from 45 m3 in 1981 to 148 m3 in 2016 in rural areas we can conclude from fig 6 that meat and vegetable oil is the main reason for the per capita awr difference between urban and rural areas 3 4 forecast of agricultural water requirements at peak population in 2032 future agricultural water requirements largely depend on population scale and food consumption pattern according to the prediction of the chinese central government china s total population will peak in 2032 at 1 473 billion and urban and rural populations will account for 75 and 25 of the total population at that time respectively china state council 1994 a reasonable diet structure suitable for chinese residents has also been recommended by many official agencies for example chinese nutrition society and the state council of china put forward different reasonable food consumption patterns from the perspective of nutritional balance china state council 2001 chinese nutrition society 2016 both recommended diets emphasize reducing grain intake and increasing milk and egg intake to predict the impact of population scale and diet pattern on water requirements in 2032 the current diet pattern s1 the nutritionists recommended diet pattern s2 and the government recommended diet pattern s3 was used as three scenarios to predict future food consumption of urban and rural residents a comparison of different diet patterns is shown in table1 particularly due to s2 does not distinguish between urban and rural residents this study assumes that the urban and rural food habits in 2032 is the same under s2 scenario this study also assumes that crop yield and climate condition for each food item are the same as in 2016 the sizes of the awr of urban and rural residents at peak population are shown in fig 7 using the calculation method proposed in this study under current food habits an increase in urban population will increase awr from 671 billion m3 in 2016 to 935 billion m3 in 2032 however urban areas need more awr in the future if a healthier diet is chosen and approximately 1020 and 1129 billion m³ of agriculture water are required under s2 and s3 scenarios respectively for rural areas due to a significant decline in population rural awr declines in all three diet scenarios in the future in 2016 awr in rural areas accounted for 60 of urban areas with the change of food habits and population scale rural awr will account for 27 33 and 23 in urban areas in 2032 under s1 s2 and s3 respectively the amount of irrigation water required in urban and rural areas in 2032 are shown in fig 8 in 2016 138 billion m3 of iwr was required for urban food production and this value will reach 193 billion m3 under current diet pattern however according to the recommended diet china needs to consume 12 41 billion m³ more irrigation water to meet urban food demand eggs and milk which are often overlooked food items are the reason why the recommended diet consumes more water than the current diet compared with 2016 rural iwr in 2032 will decline with 38 24 and 38 under s1 s2 and s3 respectively but these reduced irrigation volumes cannot offset the amount of urban growth and the national iwr will increase 21 62 billion m3 compared to 2016 in general although the food habits recommended by the government and nutritionists is more conducive to health this comes at the cost of consuming more water resources which will further increase pressure on china to ensure food safety 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty analysis this study used multi source data to compare china s water demand for urban and rural food production from 1981 to 2016 and the awr and iwr needed in 2032 were also projected under different diet scenarios our estimates match well with some previous studies for example he et al 2019 analyzed the impact of chinese dietary changes on irrigation water requirements and showed that from 1981 to 2016 an average of 172 billon m3 of irrigation water is needed to meet chinese food demands during the same period this study showed the average iwr for food in urban and rural areas are 83 and 112 billion m3 respectively fig 4a and 4b thus the total iwr consumed in china is 195 billion m3 liu and savenije 2008 who analyzed the food related water demand from the perspective of nutrition balance found that the average per capita water requirement for food production from 1981 to 2003 was 606 m3 which is comparable to the 657 m3 obtained in this study for the same period the values obtained in this study and those of he et al 2019 and liu and savenije 2008 are within 15 of each other in addition liu 2007 reported that blue water consumption accounted for 19 of global water consumption for crop growth a percentage similar to the ratio of irrigation water demand to total water demand in our research future food production is closely related to agricultural technology level and climatic conditions however our study assumed that crop yields and climate conditions in 2032 will be the same as those in 2016 which is a source of error regarding our future water demand predictions the heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers pollutes the water environment requiring plenty of fresh water to enable the absorption of these pollutants in this study we have not considered china s agricultural pollution which indicates that we may have underestimated the pressure of agricultural production on water resources in addition soil water is an important water source for crop growth especially in arid areas or water shortage periods while the effect of soil water on irrigation water requirements is ignored in our research due to a lack of national soil moisture data this may lead to uncertainties in irrigation water requirements for food irrigation efficiency is an important factor affecting the calculation of iwr however due to lack of detailed and accurate data this parameter was not considered in this study and this may lead to an underestimation of china s iwr lastly some important parameters such as mcii ri self and rdef irri will affect the calculation of agricultural water demand however since it is difficult to obtain a long series of data on these parameters the fixed values of these parameters are adopted by our research which will also bring errors to our results 4 2 challenges to ensuring sustainability of china s agricultural water based on our research results if the food demand in china was met domestically the consumption amount of irrigation water in 2016 is 228 3 billion m3 in 2032 the projection indicates that the total irrigation water demand would increase to 248 8 billion m3 under current diets and water demand will further increase to 272 7 or 289 7 billion m3 if according to the recommended diet patterns however actual net irrigation water consumption in 2016 was 209 billion m3 this means that china is currently unable to achieve food self sufficiency target due to insufficient irrigation water moreover according to the water resources comprehensive plan released by the china s central government in 2030 china s irrigation water consumption in 2030 should not exceed 245 billion m³ national development and reform commission 2009 according to this plan the difference in china s irrigation water consumption volume between 2030 and 2016 cannot exceed 36 billion and increased iwr calculated by our research will account for 56 9 123 3 and 170 6 of the total water consumption increase under s1 s2 and s3 respectively hence the increase in irrigation water consumption allowed by government s plan can only support the population increase under the current diet pattern and unable to meet recommended healthy food habits paradoxically at present china has the world s most obese population improving china s health condition through a reasonable diet seems to be a consensus of the whole society of china non communicable diseases risk factor collaboration 2017 in the future most of china s agricultural water demands will be used to feed urban residents figs 6 and 7 but the rapid development of urbanization in the past few decades has led to increasing competition in water use in agriculture and cities according to china water resources bulletin agriculture is the sector that has reduced its water use by the largest amount in the past five years agricultural water use fell from 390 3 billion m3 in 2012 to 376 8 billion m3 in 2016 conversely urbanization is the fastest growing sector with water use increasing by 8 5 billion m3 over the past five years worryingly there are 400 cities in china are still experiencing water shortages with water shortages reaching 6 billion m³ national development and reform commission 2009 china s uneven spatial distribution of water resources also poses challenges to food production currently cultivated land area and grain yield in northern china account for 60 and 58 of the country respectively while northern china accounts for only 20 of the national water resources and most of them are concentrated in summer he et al 2018 in order to meet the growing food demand a large amount of groundwater has been extracted in northern china and large scale and long term groundwater extraction has led to a decline in groundwater levels and an increasing adverse impact on the environment moreover according to relevant research results the area of cultivated land in the northern china has further expanded in recent years yang et al 2019 this means that china s future food security will face greater water challenges in general the food patterns change the water competition between agriculture and cities and the mismatch between cultivated land and water resources has widened the gap between available agricultural supply and demand which will put greater pressure on china s future food production 4 3 countermeasures to ensure agricultural water sustainability ensuring adequate agricultural water supply has become a major challenge to ensure china s food security in the future in the past decades china s government has proposed many effective measures to strengthen agricultural water supply capacity for instance the water pollution prevention and action plan policy was proposed in 2015 this policy requires that the city scale arable land area population scale and industry pattern must be determined based on the amount of water available and high water consumption projects should be strictly managed in water deficient areas china is also trying to improve its euci the ratio of surface water used by crops to the total irrigation volume applied to increase water supply potential at present china s euci is 0 542 meaning that about half of irrigation water is wasted china plans to implement measures to increase the euci to 0 60 by 2030 resulting in an increase of 25 billion m3 of irrigation water sources moreover a national efficient water saving irrigation management system was established in 2016 to improve the management level of china s agricultural water resources in addition to measures that have already been implemented three other promising options to ensure effective use of agricultural water can be implemented the first approach aims to reduce food wastage during the processes of production transportation and consumption water consumption for food production is directly proportional to the food consumption for a prescribed agricultural technology therefore food savings translate into water savings according to the report on food waste in chinese cities the amount of urban grain waste in china was 18 million tons in 2015 world wide fund for nature 2018 meaning that approximately 3 2 billion m3 of irrigation water was wasted by urban residents there are many measures that can be implemented to reduce food waste such as optimizing the food transportation network improving storage capacity and changing lifestyle habits the second opinion is to increase the import of water intensive foods appropriately such as meats and soybeans in the context of a healthy diet structure china may have been unable to balance the contradiction between food security and water security only rely on domestic supply in the future increasing food imports not only directly ensures food supplies but also deduce pressure on china s water supply especially in arid and semi arid regions the third opinion is to improve agricultural water saving levels china is the second largest consumer of agricultural water in the world just behind india however china s irrigation water use efficiency is much lower than developed countries such as israel and australia and about half of the irrigation water is wasted currently by evaporation or leaking underground learning advanced water saving technologies from other countries to improve agriculture water efficiency is an effective measure to realize water food coordinated security 5 conclusion china is the world s largest water and food consumer and its food and water security are significant not only for the nation s economic development and social stability but also for global sustainable development however rapid changes in diet structure and population size make urban and rural areas face different agricultural water security goals in this study data from multiple sources were collected and compiled to compare water required for food in urban and rural areas from 1981 to 2016 moreover the size of the future water demand in urban and rural areas was also calculated assuming a changing population structure and diet pattern our results show that the total agricultural water requirements for urban residents increased from 167 to 671 billion m3 during 1981 2016 whereas for the rural residents decreased from 485 to 403 billion m3 at the same period furthermore the irrigation water and total agricultural water showed the same change trend during past 35 years and increased animal products consumption and decreased grain consumption are the main reason for irrigation water demand change in urban and rural areas respectively from the perspective of per capita food consumption the average agricultural water required to meet the food needs of a city resident is 229 m3 more than that of a rural resident we also project that if current crop yield and climate condition hold true in the future then the national irrigation water demand will increase from 228 billion m3 in 2016 to 249 billion m3 in 2032 under current diet scenarios however if according to the recommended diet china needs to consume 24 41 billion m³ more irrigation water to meet national food demand and this value will exceed the water use limit allowed by china s government sustainable food production is a top priority issue in china however due to water shortage the changing diet patterns and population will make china s food supply more difficult to ensure in the future based on the findings of this study we propose three measures to mitigate the pressure on food and water 1 reduce food wastage during the processes of production transportation and consumption 2 increase the import of water intensive foods appropriately such as meats and soybeans 3 china should improve agricultural water saving levels in general ensuring food and water security simultaneously is proving to be a difficult challenge in china as its population increases along with dietary changes looking forward comprehensive studies that explore all aspects of the relationship between water and food are needed to develop integrated and explicit plans for the sustainable use of resources while ensuring the cooperative security of food and water in china

10417,in the presented study we estimated the effect of long term application of i various systems of soil cultivation i conventional tillage ii reduced tillage and iii no tillage ii wheat monoculture spring and winter forms and iii crop rotation on the basic physical properties of rendzic phaeozem in the experiment soil physical properties were studied such as particle density bulk density total porosity air capacity at 15 5 kpa water content at sampling field water capacity at 15 5 kpa available water content and the ratio of field water capacity and total porosity was calculated the hypothesis that long term wheat monoculture and or reduced tillage have a negative effect on the soil physical condition has been verified it should be emphasised that the long term application of reduced tillage systems and wheat monoculture did not cause significant differences in the analysed parameters the lowest compaction and the best conditions for gas exchange were noted in the soil on which conventional tillage was applied under spring wheat monoculture the results of field water capacity and available water content showed that long term application of reduced systems of soil tillage had a positive effect on the water properties of soil soil under the conventional tillage ensured significantly the smallest amount of water for the plants it has been shown that long term application of reduced tillage as well as the form of wheat spring or winter wheat have a stronger impact on changes in the soil water air relations than long term use of monoculture we found out that both the use of reduced tillage and the abandonment of crop rotation in favour of monoculture can be put into safely use in agricultural practice we believe that the application of such systems is especially valuable in emergency situations keywords tillage systems crop rotation soil compaction air capacity soil water properties retention properties 1 introduction soil tillage determines the air water relations the rate of organic matter mineralisation and the availability of nutrients zikeli et al 2013 kravchenko et al 2016 it radically transforms soil structure and in consequence affects the entire set of soil physical properties lipiec et al 2006a keller et al 2007 elder and lal 2008 deterioration of soil structure is viewed as a form of physical degradation of soil it is undoubtedly related with the intensity of soil use and with the intensity of treatments concerning the mechanical tillage of soil chan et al 2003 pulleman et al 2003 milne and haynes 2004 lipiec et al 2006b liu et al 2016 mechanical tillage is a factor which strongly degrades the stability of soil aggregates and it also affects the level of soil water retention as a result of reduction of the content of larger pores caused by soil compaction there takes place a lowering of the content of water available for plants and a reduction of soil air capacity håkansson and lipiec 2000 dexter and zoebisch 2002 batey and mckenzie 2006 pranagal 2011 pranagal et al 2017 deterioration of air water properties of soil may in consequence lead to a limitation of the production of crop plants freebairn

there takes place an increase in the content of organic carbon nitrogen and nutrients melero et al 2009 noted in soil under no tillage cultivation not only a higher content of organic carbon but also an increase biomass of microorganisms in the opinion of micucci and taboada 2006 and of angers and eriksen hamel 2008 in plough tillage there takes place strong oxygenation of soil which contributes to rapid mineralisation of organic matter and to a reduction in the content of organic carbon and to the leaching of nutrients fiorini et al 2020 observed that no tillage enhances aggregates water stable when starting organic carbon content is low and clay and silt are not predominant soil fractions other researchers lal 2009 liu et al 2016 woźniak and kawecka radomska 2016 emphasised that the content and composition of plant residues and the method of soil cultivation affect the content of organic carbon and the direction and rate of transformation of soil organic matter the application of reduced tillage systems is a promising method improving soil physical quality spq the improvement of the condition of soil results from an increase in the content of organic matter better aggregation and soil water retention and from reduced soil density arshad et al 1996 ghuman and sur 2001 pranagal and domżał 2001 arshad and martin 2002 li et al 2020 such soil use not only improves the balance

layer of 0 10 cm 1 65 mg m 3 was lower than in the deeper layer of 10 20 cm 1 79 mg m 3 the calculated means of bd for the tillage systems revealed that conventional tillage ct caused the least compaction 1 70 mg m 3 and no tillage nt the greatest 1 74 mg m 3 soil under reduced tillage rt had a medium level of compaction bd 1 72 mg m 3 table 8 these differences were statistically insignificant based on the means for the crop rotation systems it was observed that the soil under wheat monoculture mn had lower density 1 69 mg m 3 than the soil under crop rotation cr bd 1 75 mg m

20 cm showed that in a majority 4 6 of the compared pairs of results soil under spring wheat sw had lower bulk density that soil under winter wheat ww the differences were often statistically significant anova lsd tables 1 8 and 9 the range in the mean bd results for the tillage systems was 0 04 mg m 3 table 1 and it was similar to that obtained in the study by castellini et al 2019a increased soil density under no tillage nt was also indicated in the study by li et al 2020 the obtained bd results were also similar to those presented by other authors arshad et al 1996 logsdon and karlen 2004 drewry et al 2008 mueller et al 2008 reynolds et al 2008 those authors informed that in soil with particle size distribution of loams bd of the arable horizon attains most frequently values from 1 50 mg m 3 to 1 70 mg m 3 paluszek 2011 reported that in poland arable soil with the particle size distribution of sands and loams have bd with values usually varying in the range from 1 39 mg m 3 to 1 79 mg m 3 arshad et al 1996 determined that taking into account favourable aeration conditions root growth of crop plants yields nutrient availability and resistance to water erosion optimum bd of loamy soils should not be higher than 1 63 mg m 3 for the purpose of estimation of soil physical quality dexter 2004a 2004b 2004c proposed the use of parameter s he assumed s 0 035 as the limit for good physical quality of soil pranagal 2011 took into account the limit value of parameter s in his study dexter 2004a 2004b 2004c dexter and czyż 2007 and calculated bd which should not be higher than 1 68 mg m 3 this is in conformance with the proposal of arshad et al 1996 where those authors indicated the value limiting plant root growth as bd 1 80 mg m 3 in conformance with the studies by arshad et al 1996 jones 1983 reynolds et al 2002 and drewry et al 2008 the analysed soil was characterised by considerable compaction as the studies by jones 1983 carter 1988 mcqueen and shepherd 2002 reynolds et al 2002 2008 2009 drewry et al 2008 pranagal 2011 and castellini et al 2019a 2019b indicate at such a density one should expect interference with soil aeration limited availability of water usable for plants increased mechanical resistance to plant root movement in soil mass and disturbances in the development of the root system of plants such disturbances in the functioning of the soil plant atmosphere system usually lead to a lowering in the yields of the cultivated crop plants the values of total porosity tp ranged from 0 279 m3 m 3 in the layer of 10 20 cm cr ww pl to 0 436 m3 m 3 in the layer of 0 10 cm cr sw pl tp of the surface horizon was most often higher than that of the deeper layer table 2 the calculated mean values for the layers were as follows 0 10 cm 0 374 m3 m 3 10 20 cm 0 325 m3 m 3 based on the mean tp values for the soil tillage systems the most free spaces in the soil was noted under conventional tillage ct tp 0 358 m3 m 3 a smaller volume of all pores was found in the soil under reduced tillage rt where tp 0 349 m3 m 3 the lowest value of tp was characteristic of the soil under no tillage nt at 0 342 m3 m 3 the variation in the values of tp was also affected by the applied crop rotation systems monoculture or crop rotation table 8 and 9 this is supported by the calculated mean values in the case of monoculture tp was 0 361 m3 m 3 and in the case of crop rotation 0 338 m3 m 3 the physical status of the soil in spring was also determined by the form of wheat i e spring or winter wheat based on the mean values for plants a significantly higher tp was noted in the soil under spring wheat sw 0 366 m3 m 3 than under winter wheat ww 0 333 m3 m 3 the lower tp under ww could be the result of soil subsidence during the winter the differences were often statistically significant this was confirmed many times in the analysis of variance of the results of tp anova lsd tables 2 8 and 9 kowda 1984 and thompson and troeh 1978 accepted that the optimum of the value of tp was minimum 0 500 m3 m 3 in the presented study in no case the mean tp was higher than the indicated minimum kowda 1984 thompson and troeh 1978 according to the classification proposed by paluszek 2011 tp of the analysed soil was usually low or very low it should be emphasised that ensuring air water relations in soil for favourable plants is largely determined not only by the value of tp but also by a beneficial size distribution of soil pores and their openness skopp et al 1990 cockroft and olsson 1997 olness et al 1998 reynolds et al 2008 walczak et al 2002 pranagal et al 2007 pranagal and podstawka chmielewska 2012 field air capacity fac determined at the state of field water capacity at the potential 15 5 kpa corresponds also to the content of macropores φ 20 0 μm they varied from 0 066 m3 m 3 in the layer of 10 20 cm cr ww rt to 0 224 m3 m 3 in the layer of 0 10 cm cr sw rt in almost every case 11 12 the arithmetic mean of the value of fac in the layer of 0 10 cm was higher than that in the layer of 10 20 cm at 0 153 m3 m 3 and 0 107 m3 m 3 respectively table 3 based on the mean values for the soil tillage systems it was concluded that the best aeration conditions in the soil were ensured by conventional tillage ct fac 0 148 m3 m 3 in soil under rt the mean value was 0 127 m3 m 3 and under nt it was the lowest 0 116 m3 m 3 table 8 fac values calculated for the crop rotation systems mn and cr showed that the soil under wheat monoculture mn contained more air 0 144 m3 m 3 than the soil under the crop rotation cr 0 117 m3 m 3 table 9 the cultivation of spring wheat sw caused an increase of fac value with a mean of 0 140 m3 m 3 and significantly higher compared to the conditions in the soil under winter wheat ww 0 121 m3 m 3 the mean values of fac for the whole arable horizon 0 20 cm also indicated a greater content of air in the soil under spring wheat sw these observations were confirmed many times in the statistical analysis anova lsd tables 3 8 and 9 soil air capacity at the potential 15 5 kpa is a parameter which helps in the estimation of the physical status of the soil the value of fac provides information on the conditions of soil oxygenation gas exchange activity of soil organisms processes of oxidation and reduction etc grable and siemer 1968 mayers and barrs 1991 cockroft and olsson 1997 paluszek 2011 pranagal et al 2017 as the cited authors indicate a low content of air in the soil usually results in inhibited plant growth those authors adopted the value of fac 0 100 m3 m 3 as the limit value below that limit the conditions are highly unfavourable due primarily to a deficit of air in the rhizosphere according to that criterion for most of the measurements 18 24 the analysed soil was characterised by a sufficient content of air a deficit of soil air was noted only in the layer of 10 20 cm this related usually to the cultivation of winter wheat in the reduced tillage systems rt and nt tables 3 8 and 9 without a doubt this was closely related with the compaction of soil on those plots reynolds et al 2008 2009 and castellini et al 2019a 2019b proposed a reference range of fac 0 110 0 260 m3 m 3 indicating the value of 0 180 m3 m 3 as the optimum it should be emphasised nevertheless that those values of air content in the soil refer to the state of field water capacity fc at 15 5 kpa such a level of saturation of mineral soils with water during the vegetation season occurs sporadically and it is short lasting paluszek 2011 pranagal 2011 pranagal et al 2007 2012 2017 summing up the results of fac we can accept that the analysed soil was characterised by good aeration conditions 3 2 soil water properties sm fc awc and uwc and ratio fc tp the

the soil under conventional tillage ct sm 0 084 kg kg 1 in the soil under reduced tillage rt and no tillage nt similar value of sm were observed rt 0 090 kg kg 1 nt 0 091 kg kg 1 table 8 the mean values of sm for the crop rotation systems showed that under wheat monoculture mn soil moisture was higher 0 090 kg kg 1 than in the soil under the crop rotation cr 0 086 kg kg 1 table 9 the differences were statistically insignificant based on the mean values calculated from the crop plants spring wheat sw and winter wheat ww sm was significantly higher in the soil under ww 0 105 kg kg 1 compared to the soil under sw 0 070 kg kg 1 also the mean values determined for the whole arable horizon 0 20 cm showed that in every case 6 6 a higher water content in the soil at sampling was noted under winter wheat ww on the basis of the analysis of variance anova lsd it was concluded that the differences were often significant tables 4 8 and 9 as emphasised by authors of other studies soil moisture is a highly variable parameter kutílek 2004 petrosyants et al 2005 white 2006 leśny 2010 paluszek 2011 pranagal et al 2017 sm of the arable horizon of soil depends primarily on the value of i atmospheric precipitation ii transpiration and evaporation iii crop plant species iv cultivation treatments and in certain cases v on the level of capillary rise during rainfall deficits it depends also on soil granularity structure and compaction bd and tp it is also important what type of water economy is encountered in the analysed area this field experiment was located in an area characterised by the precipitation type of water economy therefore sm should be related primarily to the volume of precipitation and to air temperature petrosyants et al 2005 white 2006 leśny 2010 and the remaining factors i e kind of cultivated crop plant and evapotranspiration should only have a secondary influence in the case of our study the value of sm was strongly affected primarily by the cultivation technology applied for a given crop plant tables 4 8 and 9 this was observed in spite of the fact that the precipitation total during the first five months of 2017 when spring wheat was cultivated sw was distinctly higher 210 8 mm than during the cultivation of winter wheat ww in 2018 133 7 mm mean air temperature at the beginning of 2017 was t 4 1 and it was lower than in the analogous period of 2018 t 5 2 fig 1 the lower value of sm under spring wheat resulted most likely from the fact that the soil was bare on any plant cover until the first decade of april and the spring tillage treatments related with the sowing caused a decrease of soil compaction in addition such a status of the soil was conducive to increased evaporation authors involved in this subject matter indicated that the values of sm are subject not only to dynamic changes in time but also to spatial variation and that may relate even to small areas usowicz and usowicz 2004 petrosyants et al 2005 paluszek 2011 pranagal and podstawka chmielewska 2012 the field water capacity fc at 15 5 kpa canarache et al 2006 cassel and nielsen 1986 walczak et al 2002 varied from 0 197 m3 m 3 in the layer

for the soil tillage systems the highest fc value was noted in the soil under nt 0 226 m3 m 3 reduced tillage ensured an average of 0 222 m3 m 3 and under ct the fc value was the lowest at 0 210 m3 m

the mean values for the crop rotation systems showed that in the soil under the monoculture the water capacity was lower than in the soil under the crop rotation at 0 218 m3 m 3 and 0 221 m3 m 3 respectively table 9 the differences could be due to greater number of cultivation in crop rotation pea winter wheat or spring wheat winter barley spring wheat cultivation caused an increase of fc value which was a mean of 0 227 m3 m 3 and significantly higher than in the soil under winter wheat 0 212 m3 m 3 also based on the mean values calculated for the whole arable horizon 0 20 cm the field water capacity was usually significantly higher in soil under spring wheat this was confirmed by the estimation of fc results anova lsd tables 5 8 and 9 field water capacity fc is similarly to fac a useful parameter in the estimation of soil physical quality spq the obtained range of fc values was convergent with the results obtained by other authors witkowska walczak et al 2000 for polish arable rendzinas with the same particle size distribution scl as the analysed soil the cited authors obtained fc values in the range of 0 174 0 289 m3 m 3 on a study by walczak et al 2002 covering a large number of soils with various particle size distribution it was noted that fc values in mineral soils form a broad range of values 0 039 0 455 m3 m 3 in the presented experiment the field water capacity was characterised by values lower than the optimum values given by those authors walczak et al 2002 reynolds et al 2008 paluszek 2011 the content of water available for plants awc is another important parameter describing soil physical quality spq walczak et al 2002 olness and archer 2005 reynolds et al 2008 2009 asgarzadeh et al 2014 pranagal et al 2017 castellini et al 2019a 2019b li et

of awc for the soil layers it was noted that in 50 of the results 6 12 the value of awc in the layer of 0 10 cm was higher than in the layer of 10 20 cm the mean values for the layers 0 10 and 10 20 cm were 0 140 m3 m 3 and 0 136 m3 m 3 respectively arithmetic means relating to the tillage systems showed that in the soil under nt the value of awc was the highest 0 143 m3 m 3 under reduced tillage rt the value was very similar 0 142 m3 m 3 while the conventional tillage ct caused significantly the lowest value of awc 0 130 m3 m 3 table 8 similar differences in awc values between ct and nt were also reported by li et al 2020 mean values of awc calculated for the crop rotation systems indicated that the soil under monoculture contained on average less water available for plants than the soil under the crop rotation the difference however was small as the values of awc were as follows mn 0 136 m3 m 3 and cr 0 140 m3 m 3 the range of those results was only 0 004 m3 m 3 and it was identical to that noted in the case of compared means for the soil layers based on the means determined for the cultivated plants awc values were significantly higher in the soil under spring wheat than in that under winter wheat the values of awc were 0 145 m3 m 3 and 0 132 m3 m 3 respectively table 9 also based on the mean values calculated for the whole arable horizon of 0 20 cm in every case 6 6 more water available for plants was determined on the soil under spring wheat and most often the differences were statistically significant anova lsd tables 6 8 and 9 in all the cases table 6 awc of the analysed soil assumed values below 200 m3 m 3 recommended by the authors cited earlier walczak et al 2002 reynolds et al 2008 2009 paluszek 2011 pranagal 2011 castellini et al 2019a 2019b according to the classification in quality classes proposed by reynolds et al 2008 2009 the analysed soil could be classified mainly in the limited class 18 cases and only in 6 cases in the good class table 6 the presented experiment included also the estimation of the air water relations in the soil for that purpose the fc tp ratio was calculated skopp et al 1990 olness et al 1998 pranagal et al 2017 reynolds

noted that most frequently 21 24 the value of fc tp was higher in the layer of 10 20 cm table 7 the average value of the ratio in the layer of 0 10 cm was 0 60 and in the layer of 10 20 cm 0 67 this was in conformance with the optimum range of fc tp values adopted by some authors reynolds et al 2008 2009 castellini et al 2019a 2019b the calculated mean values calculated for the tillage systems indicated that fc tp in the soil under no tillage equalled 0 66 according to skopp et al 1990 and olness et al 1998 the mean value obtained informs about optimum balance between water retention capacity and aeration of the soil in the case of reduced tillage the mean value of fc tp was close to that obtained for no tillage and amounted to 0 65 for the soil under conventional tillage the mean value of fc tp was the lowest 0 60 table 8 it may happen that despite the larger bulk density no tillage has better soil pore distribution than conventional tillage this may indicate periodical water deficits in the soil skopp et al 1990 olness et al 1998 paluszek 2011 pranagal et al 2017 based on the mean values for the crop rotation systems in the soil under the crop rotation the air water relations were close to the optimum skopp et al 1990 olness et al 1998 reynolds et al 2008 2009 castellini et al 2019a 2019b as fc tp 0 66 in the soil under the monoculture those conditions were less favourable as the value of the analysed parameter was 0 61 the mean values determined for the calculated plants indicated a slight effect of the form of wheat spring or winter on the variation of the soil water air relation the values of fc tp were as follows sw 0 63 ww 0 65 comparison in sw ww pairs for the layer of 0 20 cm provided data indicating that under the crop rotation significant differences were noted relating to the form spring winter wheat of cultivated wheat anova lsd tables 7 9 it should be emphasised that the obtained values of fc tp indicated also that the conditions in the soil differed from the adopted optimum reynolds et al 2008 2009 castellini et al 2019a b the observed conditions inhibited aeration fc tp 0 70 or else indicated excessive aeration and thus states of water deficit fc tp 0 60 the greatest variation of the soil water air relation was noted in soil under conventional ct and reduced rt tillage for which the range of fc tp results attained 0 24 the

table 7 castellini et al 2019b based on their study they arrived at the conclusion that fc tp is a key parameter in the estimation of soil physical quality spq while bd tp and awc are only complementary parameters in the estimation of spq 4 conclusions analysis of the results allowed the estimation of selected parameters of soil physical quality spq as affected by the long term 29 30 years application of various soil tillage systems conventional ct reduced rt and no tillage nt and wheat monoculture mn or crop rotation cr the analysed soil was characterised by rather considerable compaction the lowest compaction was noted in the soil under conventional tillage ct we wish to emphasise that the long term application of reduced tillage systems and wheat monoculture did not cause significant differences in the analysed parameters of spq the range for mean bulk density bd values between the tillage systems ct rt nt was only 0 04 mg m 3 and that for the values of total porosity tp 0 015 m3 m 3 the calculated ranges for the crop rotation systems mn cr were as follows bd 0 06 mg m 3 and tp 0 022 m3 m 3 we assumed that the changes in field air capacity caused by the long term application of the reduced tillage systems and wheat monoculture did not cause any significant deterioration of soil aeration the results of soil moisture at sampling sm were determined primarily by the treatments related with the sowing of spring wheat the value of sm was usually significantly lower in the soil under winter wheat this resulted most likely from increased evaporation from soil without any plant cover for the initial 4 months of the year analysis of the result of field water capacity fc and available water content awc showed that the long term application of the reduced tillage systems rt and nt had a beneficial effect on soil water properties the soil tilled conventionally with a plough ct ensured significantly the smallest amount of water for the plants whereas the analysed crop rotation systems mn and cr did not generate such differences the values of fc and awc were affected to a greater extent by the form of the cultivated wheat winter or spring the values of fc tp ratio confirmed that the long term use of reduced tillage systems rt and nt as well as the form of wheat spring or winter wheat have a stronger impact on changes of the soil water air relation than the long term application of monoculture we founded that long term wheat monoculture and or reduced tillage not have a significant negative effect on the soil physical condition based on the data acquired in the experiment we concluded that both the application of the reduced tillage systems and the resignation from the use of crop rotation in favour of monoculture can be put into safely used in agricultural practice we believe then that the application of such systems is especially valuable in emergency situations such situation result often from the meteorological conditions from the impossibility of performing soil cultivation treatments or in the case of mass dropout of plants e g large scale losses in winter crops declaration of competing interest no potential conflict of

10417,in the presented study we estimated the effect of long term application of i various systems of soil cultivation i conventional tillage ii reduced tillage and iii no tillage ii wheat monoculture spring and winter forms and iii crop rotation on the basic physical properties of rendzic phaeozem in the experiment soil physical properties were studied such as particle density bulk density total porosity air capacity at 15 5 kpa water content at sampling field water capacity at 15 5 kpa available water content and the ratio of field water capacity and total porosity was calculated the hypothesis that long term wheat monoculture and or reduced tillage have a negative effect on the soil physical condition has been verified it should be emphasised that the long term application of reduced tillage systems and wheat monoculture did not cause significant differences in the analysed parameters the lowest compaction and the best conditions for gas exchange were noted in the soil on which conventional tillage was applied under spring wheat monoculture the results of field water capacity and available water content showed that long term application of reduced systems of soil tillage had a positive effect on the water properties of soil soil under the conventional tillage ensured significantly the smallest amount of water for the plants it has been shown that long term application of reduced tillage as well as the form of wheat spring or winter wheat have a stronger impact on changes in the soil water air relations than long term use of monoculture we found out that both the use of reduced tillage and the abandonment of crop rotation in favour of monoculture can be put into safely use in agricultural practice we believe that the application of such systems is

2006b liu et al 2016 mechanical tillage is a factor which strongly degrades the stability of soil aggregates and it also affects the level of soil water retention as a result of reduction of the content of larger pores caused by soil compaction there takes place a lowering of the content of water available for plants and a reduction of soil air capacity håkansson and lipiec 2000 dexter and

an increase biomass of microorganisms in the opinion of micucci and taboada 2006 and of angers and eriksen hamel 2008 in plough tillage there takes place strong oxygenation of soil which contributes to rapid mineralisation of organic matter and to a reduction in the content of organic carbon and to the leaching of nutrients fiorini et al 2020 observed that no tillage enhances aggregates water stable when starting organic carbon content is low and clay and silt are not predominant soil fractions other researchers lal 2009 liu et al 2016 woźniak and kawecka radomska 2016 emphasised that the content and composition of plant residues and the method of soil cultivation affect the content of organic carbon and the direction and rate of transformation of soil organic matter the application of reduced tillage systems is a promising method improving soil physical quality spq the improvement of the condition of soil results from an increase in the content of organic matter better aggregation

layer of 0 10 cm 1 65 mg m 3 was lower than in the deeper layer of 10 20 cm 1 79 mg m 3 the calculated means of bd for the tillage systems revealed that conventional tillage ct caused the least compaction 1 70 mg m 3 and no tillage nt the greatest 1 74 mg m 3 soil under reduced tillage rt had a medium level of compaction bd 1 72 mg m 3 table 8 these differences were statistically insignificant based on the means for the crop rotation systems it was observed that the soil under wheat monoculture mn had lower density 1 69 mg m 3 than the soil under crop rotation cr bd 1 75 mg m

significant anova lsd tables 1 8 and 9 the range in the mean bd results for the tillage systems was 0 04 mg m 3 table 1 and it was similar to that obtained in the study by castellini et al 2019a increased soil density under no tillage nt was also indicated in the study by li et al 2020 the obtained bd results were also similar to those presented by other authors arshad et al 1996 logsdon and karlen 2004 drewry et al 2008 mueller et al 2008 reynolds et al 2008 those authors informed that in soil with particle size distribution of loams bd of the arable horizon attains most frequently values from 1 50 mg m 3 to 1 70 mg m 3 paluszek 2011 reported that in poland arable soil with the particle size distribution of sands and loams have bd with values usually varying in the range from 1 39 mg m 3 to 1 79 mg m 3 arshad et al 1996 determined that taking into account favourable aeration conditions root growth of crop plants yields nutrient availability and resistance to water erosion optimum bd of loamy soils should not be higher than 1 63 mg m 3 for the purpose of estimation of soil physical quality dexter 2004a 2004b 2004c proposed the use of parameter s he assumed s 0 035 as the limit for good physical quality of soil pranagal 2011 took into account the limit value of parameter s in his study dexter 2004a 2004b 2004c dexter and czyż 2007 and calculated bd which should not be higher than 1 68 mg m 3 this is in conformance with the proposal of arshad et al 1996 where those authors indicated the value limiting plant root growth as bd 1 80 mg m 3 in conformance with the studies by arshad et al 1996 jones 1983 reynolds et al 2002 and drewry et al 2008 the analysed soil was characterised by considerable compaction as the studies by jones 1983 carter 1988 mcqueen and shepherd 2002 reynolds et al 2002 2008 2009 drewry et al 2008 pranagal 2011 and castellini et al 2019a 2019b indicate at such a density one should expect interference with soil aeration limited availability of water usable for plants increased mechanical resistance to plant root movement in soil mass and disturbances in the development of the root system of plants such disturbances in the functioning of the soil plant atmosphere system usually lead to a lowering in the yields of the cultivated crop plants the values of total porosity tp ranged from 0 279 m3 m 3 in the layer of 10 20 cm cr ww pl to 0 436 m3 m 3 in the layer of 0 10 cm cr sw pl tp of the surface horizon was most often higher than that of the deeper layer table 2 the calculated mean values for the layers were as follows 0 10 cm 0 374 m3 m 3 10 20 cm 0 325 m3 m 3 based on the mean tp values for the soil tillage systems the most free spaces in the soil was noted under conventional tillage ct tp 0 358 m3 m 3 a smaller volume of all pores was found in the soil under reduced tillage rt where tp 0 349 m3 m 3 the lowest value of tp was characteristic of the soil under no tillage nt at 0 342 m3 m 3 the variation in the values of tp was also affected by the applied crop rotation systems monoculture or crop rotation table 8 and 9 this is supported by the calculated mean values in the case of monoculture tp was 0 361 m3 m 3 and in the case of crop rotation 0 338 m3 m 3 the physical status of the soil in spring was also determined by the form of wheat i e spring or winter wheat based on the mean values for plants a significantly higher tp was noted in the soil under spring wheat sw 0 366 m3 m 3 than under winter wheat ww 0 333 m3 m 3 the lower tp under ww could be the result of soil subsidence during the winter the differences were often statistically significant this was confirmed many times in the analysis of variance of the results of tp anova lsd tables 2 8 and 9 kowda 1984 and thompson and troeh 1978 accepted that the optimum of the value of tp was minimum 0 500 m3 m 3 in the presented study in no case the mean tp was higher than the indicated minimum kowda 1984 thompson and troeh 1978 according to the classification proposed by paluszek 2011 tp of the analysed soil was usually low or very low it should be emphasised that ensuring air water relations in soil for favourable plants is largely determined not only by the value of tp but also by a beneficial size distribution of soil pores and their openness skopp et al 1990 cockroft and olsson 1997 olness et al 1998 reynolds et al 2008 walczak et al 2002 pranagal et al 2007 pranagal and podstawka chmielewska 2012 field air capacity fac determined at the state of field water capacity at the potential 15 5 kpa corresponds also to the content of macropores φ 20 0 μm they varied from 0 066 m3 m 3 in the layer of 10 20 cm cr ww rt to 0 224 m3 m 3 in the layer of 0 10 cm cr sw rt in almost every case 11 12 the arithmetic mean of the value of fac in the layer of 0 10 cm was higher than that in the layer of 10 20 cm at 0 153 m3 m 3 and 0 107 m3 m 3 respectively table 3 based on the mean values for the soil tillage systems it was concluded that the best aeration conditions in the soil were ensured by conventional tillage ct fac 0 148 m3 m 3 in soil under rt the mean value was 0 127 m3 m 3 and under nt it was the lowest 0 116 m3 m 3 table 8 fac values calculated for the crop rotation systems mn and cr showed that the soil under wheat monoculture mn contained more air 0 144 m3 m 3 than the soil under the crop rotation cr 0 117 m3 m 3 table 9 the cultivation of spring wheat sw caused an increase of fac value with a mean of 0 140 m3 m 3 and significantly higher compared to the conditions in the soil under winter wheat ww 0 121 m3 m 3 the mean values of fac for the whole arable horizon 0 20 cm also indicated a greater content of air in the soil under spring wheat sw these observations were confirmed many times in the statistical analysis anova lsd tables 3 8 and 9 soil air capacity at the potential 15 5 kpa is a parameter which helps in the estimation of the physical status of the soil the value of fac provides information on the conditions of soil oxygenation gas exchange activity of soil organisms processes of oxidation and reduction etc grable and siemer 1968 mayers and barrs 1991 cockroft and olsson 1997 paluszek 2011 pranagal et al 2017 as the cited authors indicate a low content of air in the soil usually results in inhibited plant growth those authors adopted the value of fac 0 100 m3 m 3 as the limit value below that limit the conditions are highly unfavourable due primarily to a deficit of air in the rhizosphere according to that criterion for most of the measurements 18 24 the analysed soil was characterised by a sufficient content of air a deficit of soil air was noted only in the layer of 10 20 cm this related usually to the cultivation of winter wheat in the reduced tillage systems rt and nt tables 3 8 and 9 without a doubt this was closely related with the compaction of soil on those plots reynolds et al 2008 2009 and castellini et al 2019a 2019b proposed a reference range of fac 0 110 0 260 m3 m 3 indicating the value of 0 180 m3 m 3 as the optimum it should be emphasised nevertheless that those values of air content in the soil refer to the state of field water capacity fc at 15 5 kpa such a level of saturation of mineral soils with water during the vegetation season occurs sporadically and it is short lasting paluszek 2011 pranagal 2011 pranagal et al 2007 2012 2017 summing up the results of fac we can accept that the analysed soil was characterised by good aeration conditions 3 2 soil water properties sm fc awc and uwc and ratio fc tp the value of soil moisture at sampling sm varied from 0 059 kg kg 1 in the layer of 10 20 cm cr sw ct to 0 134 kg kg 1 in the layer of 0 10 cm cr ww rt in every case the value of sm in the layer of 0 10

the soil under conventional tillage ct sm 0 084 kg kg 1 in the soil under reduced tillage rt and no tillage nt similar value of sm were observed rt 0 090 kg kg 1 nt 0 091 kg kg 1 table 8 the mean values of sm for the crop rotation systems showed that under wheat monoculture mn soil moisture was higher 0 090 kg kg 1 than in the soil under the crop rotation cr 0 086 kg kg 1 table 9 the differences were statistically insignificant based on the mean values calculated from the crop plants spring wheat sw and winter wheat ww sm was significantly higher in the soil under ww 0 105 kg kg 1 compared to the soil under sw 0 070 kg kg 1 also the mean values determined for the whole arable horizon 0 20 cm showed that in every case 6 6 a higher water content in the soil at sampling was noted under winter wheat ww on the basis of the analysis of variance anova lsd it was concluded that the differences were often significant tables 4 8 and 9 as emphasised by authors of other studies soil moisture is a highly variable parameter kutílek 2004 petrosyants et al 2005 white 2006 leśny 2010 paluszek 2011 pranagal et al 2017 sm of the arable horizon of soil depends primarily on the value of i atmospheric precipitation ii transpiration and evaporation iii crop plant species iv cultivation treatments and in certain cases v on the level of capillary rise during rainfall deficits it depends also on soil granularity structure and compaction bd and tp it is also important what type of water economy is encountered in the analysed area this field experiment was located in an area characterised by the precipitation type of water economy therefore sm should be related primarily to the volume of precipitation and to air temperature petrosyants et al 2005 white 2006 leśny 2010 and the remaining factors i e kind of cultivated crop plant and evapotranspiration should only have a secondary influence in the case of our study the value of sm was strongly affected primarily by the cultivation technology applied for a given crop plant tables 4 8 and 9 this was observed in spite of the fact that the precipitation total during the first five months of 2017 when spring wheat was cultivated sw was distinctly higher 210 8 mm than during the cultivation of winter wheat ww in 2018 133 7 mm mean air temperature at the beginning of 2017 was t 4 1 and it was lower than in the analogous period of 2018 t 5 2 fig 1 the lower value of sm under spring wheat resulted most likely from the fact that the soil was bare on any plant cover until the first decade of april and the spring tillage treatments related with the sowing caused a decrease of soil compaction in addition such a status of the soil was conducive to increased evaporation authors involved in this subject matter indicated that the values of sm are subject not only to dynamic changes in time but also to spatial variation and that may relate even to small areas usowicz and usowicz 2004 petrosyants et al 2005 paluszek 2011 pranagal and podstawka chmielewska 2012 the field water capacity fc at 15 5 kpa canarache et al 2006 cassel and nielsen 1986 walczak et al 2002 varied from 0 197 m3 m 3 in the layer of 10 20 cm cr ww nt to 0 249 m3 m 3 in the layer of 0 10 cm mn sw rt table 5 in comparative analysis of the result of mean fc values for the soil layers it was found that in 50 of cases 6 12 fc in the layer of 0 10 cm was higher than in the deeper layer the average values of fc for the layers 0 10 and 10 20 cm were 0 221 m3 m 3 and 0 217 m3 m 3 respectively based on the mean values calculated for the soil tillage systems the highest fc value was noted in the soil under nt 0 226 m3 m 3 reduced tillage ensured an average of 0 222 m3 m 3 and under ct the fc value was the lowest at 0 210 m3 m 3 table 8 the range of the mean values of fc for the tillage systems was as little as 0 016 m3 m 3 and it not differ from the range found between ct and nt in a study by castellini et al 2019a 2019b the mean values for the crop rotation systems showed that in the soil under the monoculture the water capacity was lower than in the soil under the crop rotation at 0 218 m3 m 3 and 0 221 m3 m 3 respectively table 9 the differences could be due to greater number of cultivation in crop rotation pea winter wheat or spring wheat winter barley spring wheat cultivation caused an increase of fc value which was a mean of 0 227 m3 m 3 and significantly higher than in the soil under winter wheat 0 212 m3 m 3 also based on the mean values calculated for the whole arable horizon 0 20 cm the field water capacity was usually significantly higher in soil under spring wheat this was confirmed by the estimation of fc results anova lsd tables 5 8 and 9 field water capacity fc is similarly to fac a useful parameter in the estimation of soil physical quality spq the obtained range of fc values was convergent with the results obtained by other authors witkowska walczak et al 2000 for polish arable rendzinas with the same particle size distribution scl as the analysed soil the cited authors obtained fc values in the range of 0 174 0 289 m3 m 3 on a study by walczak et al 2002 covering a large number of soils with various particle size distribution it was noted that fc values in mineral soils form a broad range of values 0 039 0 455 m3 m 3 in the presented experiment the field water capacity was characterised by values lower than the optimum values given by those authors walczak et al 2002 reynolds et al 2008 paluszek 2011 the content of water available for plants awc is another important parameter describing soil physical quality spq walczak et al 2002 olness and archer 2005 reynolds et al 2008 2009 asgarzadeh et al 2014 pranagal et al 2017 castellini et al 2019a 2019b li et

of awc for the soil layers it was noted that in 50 of the results 6 12 the value of awc in the layer of 0 10 cm was higher than in the layer of 10 20 cm the mean values for the layers 0 10 and 10 20 cm were 0 140 m3 m 3 and 0 136 m3 m 3 respectively arithmetic means relating to the tillage systems showed that in the soil under nt the value of awc was the highest 0 143 m3 m 3 under reduced tillage rt the value was very similar 0 142 m3 m 3 while the conventional tillage ct caused significantly the lowest value of awc 0 130 m3 m 3 table 8 similar differences in awc values between ct and nt were also reported by li et al 2020 mean values of awc calculated for the crop rotation systems indicated that the soil under monoculture contained on average less water available for plants than the soil under the crop rotation the difference however was small as the values of awc were as follows mn 0 136 m3 m 3 and cr 0 140 m3 m 3 the range of those results was only 0 004 m3 m 3 and it was identical to that noted in the case of compared means for the soil layers based on the means determined for the cultivated plants awc values were significantly higher in the soil under spring wheat than in that under winter wheat the values of awc were 0 145 m3 m 3 and 0 132 m3 m 3 respectively table 9 also based on the mean values calculated for the whole arable horizon of 0 20 cm in every case 6 6 more water available for plants was determined on the soil under spring wheat and most often the differences were statistically significant anova lsd tables 6 8 and 9 in all the cases table 6 awc of the analysed soil assumed values below 200 m3 m 3 recommended by the authors cited earlier walczak et al 2002 reynolds et al 2008 2009 paluszek 2011 pranagal 2011 castellini et al 2019a 2019b according to the classification in quality classes proposed by reynolds et al 2008 2009 the analysed soil could be classified mainly in the limited class 18 cases and only in 6 cases in the good class table 6 the presented experiment included also the estimation of the air water relations in the soil for that purpose the fc tp ratio was calculated skopp et al 1990 olness et al 1998 pranagal et al 2017 reynolds et al 2008 2009 castellini et al 2019a 2019b fc tp varied from 0 49 in the layer of 0 10 cm cr sw rt to 0 76 in the layer of 10 20 cm cr sw nt comparing the mean values for the soil layers it was noted that most frequently 21 24 the value of fc tp was higher in the layer of 10 20 cm table 7 the average value of the ratio in the layer of 0 10 cm was 0 60 and in the layer of 10 20 cm 0 67 this was in conformance with the optimum range of fc tp values adopted by some authors reynolds et al 2008 2009 castellini et al 2019a 2019b the calculated mean values calculated for the tillage systems indicated that fc tp in the soil under no tillage equalled 0 66 according to skopp et al 1990 and olness et al 1998 the mean value obtained informs about optimum balance between water retention capacity and aeration of the soil in the case of reduced tillage the mean value of fc tp was close to that obtained for no tillage and amounted to 0 65 for the soil under conventional tillage the mean value of fc tp was the lowest 0 60 table 8 it may happen that despite the larger bulk density no tillage has better soil pore distribution than conventional tillage this may indicate periodical water deficits in the soil skopp et al 1990 olness et al 1998 paluszek 2011 pranagal et al 2017 based on the mean values for the crop rotation systems in the soil under the crop rotation the air water relations were close to the optimum skopp et al 1990 olness et al 1998 reynolds et al 2008 2009 castellini et al 2019a 2019b as fc tp 0 66 in the soil under the monoculture those conditions were less favourable as the value of the analysed parameter was 0 61 the mean values determined for the calculated plants indicated a slight effect of the form of wheat spring or winter on the variation of the soil water air relation the values of fc tp were as follows sw 0 63 ww 0 65 comparison in sw ww pairs for the layer of 0 20 cm provided data indicating that under the crop rotation significant differences were noted relating to the form spring winter wheat of cultivated wheat anova lsd tables 7 9 it should be emphasised that the obtained values of fc tp indicated also that the conditions in the soil differed from the adopted optimum reynolds et al 2008 2009 castellini et al 2019a b the observed conditions inhibited aeration fc tp 0 70 or else indicated excessive aeration and thus states of water deficit fc tp 0 60 the greatest variation of the soil water air relation was noted in soil under conventional ct and reduced rt tillage for which the range of fc tp results attained 0 24 the soil under no tillage nt was characterised by the smallest range 0 16 the mean for nt as indicated earlier assumed the optimum value according to skopp et al 1990 and olness et al 1998 fc tp 0 66 table 7 castellini et al 2019b based on their study they arrived at the conclusion that fc tp is a key parameter in the estimation of soil physical quality spq while bd tp and awc are only complementary parameters in the estimation of spq 4 conclusions analysis of the results allowed the estimation of selected parameters of soil physical quality spq as affected by the long term 29 30 years application of various soil tillage systems conventional ct reduced rt and no tillage nt and wheat monoculture mn or crop rotation cr the analysed soil was characterised by rather considerable compaction the lowest compaction was noted in the soil under conventional tillage ct we wish to emphasise that the long term application of reduced tillage systems and wheat monoculture did not cause significant differences in the analysed parameters of spq the range for mean bulk density bd values between the tillage systems ct rt nt was only 0 04 mg m 3 and that for the values of total porosity tp 0 015 m3 m 3 the calculated ranges for the crop rotation systems mn cr were as follows bd 0 06 mg m 3 and tp 0 022 m3 m 3 we assumed that the changes in field air capacity caused by the long term application of the reduced tillage systems and wheat monoculture did not cause any significant deterioration of soil aeration the results of soil moisture at sampling sm were determined primarily by the treatments related with the sowing of spring wheat the value of sm was usually significantly lower in the soil under winter wheat this resulted most likely from increased evaporation from soil without any plant cover for the initial 4 months of the year analysis of the result of field water capacity fc and available water content awc showed that the long term application of the reduced tillage systems rt and nt had a beneficial effect on soil water properties the soil tilled conventionally with a plough ct ensured significantly the smallest amount of water for the plants whereas the analysed crop rotation systems mn and cr did not generate such differences the values of fc and awc were affected to a greater extent by the form of the cultivated wheat winter or spring the values of fc tp ratio confirmed that the long term use of reduced tillage systems rt and nt as well as the form of wheat spring or winter wheat have a stronger impact on changes of the soil water air relation than the long term application of monoculture we founded that long term wheat monoculture and or reduced tillage not have a significant negative effect on the soil physical condition based on the data acquired in the experiment we concluded that both the application of the reduced tillage systems and the resignation from the use of crop rotation in favour of monoculture can be put into safely used in agricultural practice we believe then that the application of such systems is especially valuable in emergency situations such situation result often from the meteorological conditions from the impossibility of performing soil cultivation treatments or in the case of mass dropout of plants e g large scale losses in winter crops declaration of competing interest no potential conflict of

10418,the current study evaluated the development and growth of three major rapeseed genotypes hyola308 hyola401 and rgs003 as early mid and late maturity genotypes respectively as well as seed yield under different irrigation regimes full irrigation withholding irrigation at the flowering stage withholding irrigation at the pod initiation stage and withholding irrigation at the seed filling period and also the spatial yield potential apsim canola model was applied to investigate the response of rapeseed genotypes to irrigation regimes in ten locations simulated results indicated that yield potential for rapeseed production was higher in the west which is a temperate agro climatic zone 2852 6 kg ha 1 than in the southwest which is a hot agro climatic zone 1885 1 kg ha 1 although hyola401 the mid maturity genotype had the maximum seed yield 2798 4 kg ha 1 rgs003 the late maturity genotype was found to be more drought resistant due to a lower decrease in seed yield 18 1 under water limited conditions compared with full irrigation conditions the current findings suggest that the mid maturity genotype has more yield potential in the studied locations with different climates and soils under full irrigation conditions due to higher seed yield and the late maturity genotype can be suggested as a resistant genotype for future breeding programs to introduce new high yielding genotypes with high drought tolerance especially in drought prone environments furthermore withholding irrigation at seed filling onwards which showed the lowest decrease in seed yield 13 6 can be recommended as a strategy for water saving at the end of the growing season and farmers can allocate irrigation water to other crops keywords apsim canola drought tolerant genotypes late season drought stress spatial yield potential 1 introduction rapeseed brassica napus l is globally a major oilseed crop cultivated on over 34 7 million ha worldwide in 2017 fao 2017 after palm and soybean it is currently the third most important oilseed crop in the world rapeseed can be used as an alternative crop for cereal based crop rotations particularly in arid and semi arid regions like iran hamzei and soltani 2012 and thus can be grown as a break crop for continuous wheat cropping systems kirkegaard et al 1997 furthermore rapeseed is an appropriate crop for cultivation in arid regions due to its high water use efficiency and relative tolerance to drought stress albarrak 2006 the seed yield and yield components of a crop depend mainly on growth conditions during the growing period which is significantly affected by water availability nazeri et al 2018 drought is one of the most important limiting factors for rapeseed growth and productivity in iran especially at the final growth stages flowering pod formation and seed filling jabbari et al 2013 which can reduce seed yield safavi fard et al 2018 water saving at the end of the rapeseed growing season especially flowering pod formation and seed filling stages is significantly important for farmers in arid and semi arid regions withholding irrigation in these stages leads to 2 3 times less irrigation compared with full irrigation conditions safavi fard et al 2018 under drought stress conditions reduction in rapeseed seed yield can be attributed to reduced yield components including number of pods per plant number of seeds per pod and individual seed weight eyni nargeseh et al 2020b several researchers have reported that drought stress during development and growth stages is the limiting factor that has considerable influence on biochemical kalantar ahmadi et al 2015a b quantitative and qualitative traits nazeri et al 2018 moradi aghdam et al 2019 under different environmental conditions the responses of genotypes which usually vary due to different genetic makeups are called genotype environment interactions mansour et al 2017 selecting genotypes which tolerate water deficit stress at the generative growth phase could increase the cultivated area of rapeseed in arid and semi arid regions like iran as well as other countries that have the same climate conditions nasiri et al 2017 rashidi et al 2012 safavi fard et al 2018 investigated the effect of late season drought stress withholding irrigation from flowering and pod formation stages on five canola cultivars sarigol delgan jacamo jerumeh and hyola 401 and reported that in cold temperate regions with arid and semi arid climates delgan as an early maturity cultivar could be recommended considering the acceptable seed oil yield for full irrigation and withholding irrigation conditions in winter cultivation respectively eyni nargeseh et al 2020a studied the response of 17 rapeseed genotypes to late season deficit irrigation withholding irrigation from pod formation stage until the end of the growing period and stated that the mid maturity genotype under full irrigation and the mid maturity genotype under withholding irrigation conditions produced the highest seed yields compared with other genotypes because of high pods per plant seeds per pod and 1000 seed weight crop simulation models are widely used to evaluate the development and growth of crops such as wheat eyni nargeseh et al 2020c maize rahimi moghaddam et al 2019 sugar beet deihimfard et al 2019 chickpea amiri et al 2020 and rapeseed he et al

efficiency across a number of environments growing seasons and management scenarios he et al 2017b iran 25 5 to 39 78 n latitude classified as an arid and semi arid country has suffered from limited water resources as a result of reduced rainfall over the last few years rahimi moghaddam et al 2019 consequently water saving is very important especially late in the season for rapeseed at flowering pod formation and seed filling stages which coincides with the early irrigation of spring crops it is significantly vital because farmers often do not have enough irrigation water to devote to both autumn and spring crops safavi fard et al 2018 accordingly the current study aimed to evaluate i the apsim canola model accuracy for simulation of rapeseed seed yield under full irrigation and water stress conditions ii the seed yield of three rapeseed genotypes under late season drought stress in different regions and also the spatial yield potential and iii withholding irrigation as a strategy to reduce irrigation without significant yield loss 2 materials and methods 2 1 study locations and climate types the current study focused on ten locations in four provinces in the west and southwest

before irrigation in this study water volume entering the field was measured by a water meter irrigation dates and amounts are presented in supplementary table s1 it should be noted that the 3rd and 4th experiments were used only for testing the soil water balance module of the model table 2 crop model calibration refers to the estimation of the key model parameters by fitting the overall model to observed data which is an integral part of crop modeling wallach et al 2011 in this study it was performed through a trial and error procedure to minimize the difference between simulated and observed data calibration was started by adjusting the phenological parameters such as tt emergence tt end of juvenile and tt flowering table 3 to ensure that apsim canola simulated to flowering and maturity dates secondly the parameters related to biomass and seed growth were derived using the trial and error method the harvest index hi was derived using the optimization process in order to correctly simulate seed yield all calibration processes were done under full irrigation and nutrition the final values of the cultivar specific parameters which were obtained through model calibration are shown in table 3 a workflow diagram describing all data tools and simulation processes used in the current study is presented in supplementary fig s1 evaluating the performance of a crop model apsim canola is an important and necessary step before using the model for simulation studies such evaluation is based on the comparison of field measured and simulated values for study traits various indicators can be applied to evaluate the differences between simulated and field measured values in the current study normalized root mean squared error nrmse wallach and gofnet 1987 the willmott index of agreement d index willmott 1982 mean bias error mbe willmott 1982 determination coefficient r2 and 1 1 line were calculated as follows 2 n r m s e i 1 n s i o i 2 n 100 ō 3 d i n d e x 1 i 1

measure of the relative difference of simulated versus observed data and model simulation accuracy increases as nrmse approaches zero the willmott index d index is ranged from 0 to 1 with 1 denoting a perfect match between the observed and simulated data a model is judged to simulate satisfactorily when mbe is close to zero moreover matching 1 1 and regression lines shows that the model predicts the goal trait with high accuracy 2 4 long term simulation experiments and description of treatments simulation experimental treatments included irrigation regimes and genotypes four irrigation regimes consisted of full irrigation withholding irrigation at the flowering stage withholding irrigation at the pod formation stage and withholding irrigation at the seed filling stage abbreviated as i1 i2 i3 and i4 respectively three major and predominate rapeseed genotypes in the study area hyola308 hyola401 and rgs003 as early mid and late maturity genotypes respectively were used to investigate the effects of genetic factors on seed yield experimental treatments irrigation regimes and genotypes were considered for the ten locations in iranian rapeseed agro ecosystems most farmers perform dry sowing and then start to irrigate immediately under the circumstances the initial soil water is assumed to be equal to pawc in each location during the rapeseed growing period irrigation was triggered whenever available soil water asw fell below 70 from sowing to maturity stage for i1 from sowing to flowering stage for i2 from sowing to pod formation for i3 and from sowing to seed filling stage for i4 water nitrogen and surface organic matter were all reset at sowing each year throughout all simulations for model application tillage conventional tillage plant density 80 plants m 2 sowing depth 30 mm and row spacing 300 mm were held constant in all simulations for model application moreover all simulations for model application were conducted under stress free conditions of nitrogen and biotic factors finally long term simulation experiments consisted of a factorial of four irrigation regimes three genotypes and ten locations over the simulation years which differed for each location refer to table 1 a total of 3420 simulation experiments 2 5 supply demand ratio sdr apart from different outputs such as seed yield biomass evapotranspiration and pod total weight the apsim canola model produced a water stress factor named supply demand ratio sdr which shows the degree to which the soil water extractable by the plant roots water supply is able to match the potential transpiration water demand wd in fact the water demand corresponds to the amount of water the crop would have transpired in the absence of soil water constraint and is calculated as follows 5 w d c g r v p d c o 2 t e c r o p where cgr is crop growth on that day g mm 2 vpd is the atmospheric saturation vapor pressure deficit kpa c o 2 is a coefficient adjusting the transpiration efficiency for co2 concentration and t e c r o p is the transpiration efficiency coefficient for above ground biomass g m 2 mm 1 kpa the crop water supply is computed for each layer of the soil where roots are present and depends on the root growth and soil property of each layer chenu et al 2013 the sdr is outlined as the ratio between water supply ws and water demand wd and was capped between 1 0 no water stress and 0 0 no water available to the crop more details about the sdr can be found in chapman et al 1993 and chenu et al 2013 in the current study the growing period for rapeseed was divided into nine stages i e sowing germination emergence end of juvenile floral initiation flowering start of seed filling end of seed filling and maturity then the sdr ratio intensity and frequency was calculated for each stage at all study locations separately for all genotypes and irrigation regimes i1 and i4 more description about growth stages and phenological development can be found in robertson and lilley 2016 mean sdr ratio at each development stage of rapeseed was considered as the intensity of the sdr ratio to consider the frequency of sdr ratio and water stress events two sdrs were computed so that continuous days with an sdr ratio of 0 to 0 69 and 0 7 1 were separately extracted at different stages for genotypes and irrigation regimes i1 and i4 at all study locations it was assumed that a stress event occurred when the sdr ratio was below 0 7 chenu et al 2013 2 6 statistical analysis the current study used an rcbd in a factorial arrangement in which years were considered as blocks analysis of variance of the experimental factors ten locations four irrigation regimes and three genotypes and mean comparisons were done using sas 9 2 mean comparisons of the study traits were conducted using the least significant difference lsd test at the 0 05 probability level 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation under potential and water limited conditions results of model calibration using the data obtained from different sowing dates and genotypes under potential situations showed that the simulated seed yield and days to flowering and maturity were modeled reasonably well for the three studied genotypes table 4 the apsim canola model predicted phenological stages including days to flowering and maturity reasonably well with nrmse of 3 79 and 2 85 mbe of 0 92 and 0 61 day and d index of 0 91 and 0 94 respectively the nrmse mbe and d index values for seed yield 8 56 74 9 kg ha 1 and 0 87 respectively and biomass 7 86 362 3 kg ha 1 and 0 88 respectively indicated a close agreement between the field measured and simulated values table 4 in validation a comparison of the apsim canola model with the experimental data collected from different irrigation regimes and genotypes under water limited conditions revealed that the model accurately predicted the seed yield and biomass of rapeseed fig 3 measured biomass ranged from 6810 kg ha 1 to 13 500 kg ha 1 and the nrmse mbe r2 and d index values for biomass simulation were 12 3 327 8 kg ha 1 0 82 and 0 51 respectively fig 3a moreover the apsim canola model accurately simulated rapeseed seed yield so that nrmse mbe r2 and d index values of 10 04 52 1 kg ha 1 0 65 and 0 88 respectively were recorded indicating a good agreement between the observed and simulated values fig 3b the nrmse values for soil moisture content ranged from 13 1 water stress at the flowering and pod formation stages to 8 68 rainfed fig 4 b and d the d index varied from 0 88 water stress at the flowering and pod formation stages to 0 54 full irrigation fig 4b and 4e this shows that the apsim model captured the soil water balance with high accuracy during the growing period of rapeseed under different irrigation treatments and water limited situations however over different years and irrigation treatments the apsim canola model underestimated the soil moisture content in both experiments to some extent with an mbe of 0 024 cm3 cm 3 under full irrigation to 0 007 cm3 cm 3 under water stress at the flowering and pod formation stages fig 4a and b overall the results illustrated that water climatic and soil relationships were well structured in the apsim canola model and their effects on the development and growth of rapeseed were well captured by the apsim canola model 3 2 large variability in seed yield depending upon genotype irrigation regime and location main effects of irrigation regimes and genotypes on simulated rapeseed seed yield were statistically significant at a 1 probability level among locations results of analysis of variance not shown the average seed yield of the entire rapeseed agro ecosystem all study locations was 2560 kg ha 1 fig 5 a large variability was found in rapeseed seed yields depending upon irrigation regimes and genotypes at each location fig 5 moreover significant regional differences in seed yield of rapeseed were projected by the apsim canola model for example the effect of location made a difference of 2301 1 kg ha 1 in seed yield fig 5 the western regions of iran produced higher seed yields than the southwest regions figs 1 and 5 for instance khorramabad in the west with a temperate ago climatic zone and dezful in the southwest with a hot agro climatic zone with averages of 3761 3 and 1460 2 kg ha 1 generated the highest and lowest seed yield respectively fig 5 the results of long term simulations indicated that seed yield varied significantly across genotypes and withholding irrigation regimes fig 5 mid maturity hyola401 2798 4 kg ha 1 was the best yielding genotype followed by late rgs003 2496 7 kg ha 1 and early maturity hyola308 2392 kg ha 1 genotypes fig 5 under different irrigation management practices rapeseed produced the maximum seed yield 2989 6 kg ha 1 in full irrigation condition i1 followed by i4 withholding irrigation at the seed filling stage 2584 2 kg ha 1 i3 withholding irrigation at the pod formation stage 2448 5 kg ha 1 and i2 withholding irrigation at the flowering stage 2227 2 kg ha 1 regimes fig 5 in other words under i2 i3 and i4 regimes compared with the i1 regime as full irrigation seed yield tended to decline by 25 8 18 3 and 13 6 respectively fig 5 it should be noted that i2 i3 and i4 regimes averagely saved 1500 2000 1000 1500 and 500 1000 m3 ha 1 irrigation water compared with i1 regime respectively data not shown the irrigation regime genotype interaction showed that the reduction rate was different within various genotypes for example the late maturity genotype had the smallest decrease in the i3 and i4 regimes 16 9 and 12 2 respectively and early maturity had a better performance in the i2 regime 24 32 however across all locations the best interaction of genotype management to increase seed yield was mid maturity i1 3311 47 kg ha 1 overall the results presented that seed yield of rapeseed varied extremely over different iranian rapeseed agro ecosystems and a full irrigation regime along with a mid maturity genotype i1 hyola401 performed better in terms of seed yield withholding irrigation at the seed filling period i4 as a water saving strategy had the lowest yield loss compared with the i2 and i3 regimes 3 3 water supply demand ratio intensity and frequency of water stress varied among phenological stages locations irrigation regimes and genotypes the first impression given by fig 6 is that the intensity of water stress varied during the growing period of rapeseed across all regions genotypes and irrigation regimes i1 and i4 there was no water stress observed sdr 0 7 during stages 1 6 with only slightly fluctuation over stages 4 6 while severe stresses sdr 0 6 occurred mainly after flowering stage 6 at the start of seed filling and lasted until maturity stages 7 9 fig 6 although the sdr trend differed between locations and genotypes in some cases there were similarities in terms of this trend sever stress in all locations except shushtar for hyola401 and rgs003 genotypes began at the start of seed filling and lasted until maturity with a sdr of less than 0 6 fig 6 for hyola308 genotype severe stress occurred after flowering in behbahan darrehshahr dehloran dezful ilam and sarpol e zahab in gilan e gharb khorramabad and kuhdasht table 1 hyola401 mid maturity and rgs003 late maturity rapeseed genotypes experienced water limited conditions from the start of seed filling to maturity while severe stress started later for the hyola308 early maturity genotype where the sdr was less than 0 46 during end of seed filling and maturity stages stages 8 9 fig 6 in shushtar an arid and hot region rapeseed only experienced severe stress during end of seed filling for hyola401 it is worth noting that there was no water stress for rgs003 throughout the crop season in shushtar when i1 regime was applied while a slight water stress sdr 0 61 was observed during the final stage maturity in i4 regime fig 6 as can be seen from fig 7 the frequency of occurrence of water stress types varied considerably among phenological stages locations irrigation regimes i1 and i2 and genotypes across all rapeseed agro ecosystems and genotypes free water stress conditions were dominant during flowering i1 and i4 81 5 while rapeseed frequently experienced 80 1 and 84 2 water stress conditions around the end of seed filling in i1 and i4 respectively fig 7 generally during different stages the early maturity genotype hyola308 50 5 and 54 4 in i1 and i4 respectively was less exposed to water stress situations than mid hyola401 54 5 and 59 4 in i1 and i4 respectively or late maturity rgs003 55 7 and 59 6 in i1 and i4 respectively genotypes taking into account various regions it was observed that the performance of the genotypes changed and the exposure of different stages of rapeseed to water stress conditions varied across regions fig 7 for instance in the west and in ilam none of the genotypes were able to relieve the effects of water stress during the end of seed filling and rapeseed plants filled their seeds under full water stress conditions 100 in contrast in the southwest and in shushtar all genotypes were able to reduce the negative impacts of water stress during the canola growth period generally the simulated data showed that the intensity and frequency of water stress events varied over genotypes development stages of rapeseed irrigation regimes and locations furthermore an early maturity genotype could avoid exposure of the final development stages to late season water stress 4 discussion 4 1 apsim canola accurately simulated development and growth of different canola genotypes under different management practices by taking into account the value of errors in observation the agreement between field measured and simulated values showed that across all study locations and years the apsim canola model was able to capture the changes in seed yield biomass and days to flowering and maturity for genotypes and sowing dates under potential situations table 4 as well as changes in seed yield biomass and soil moisture content under water limited situations table 4 it was generally concluded that the apsim canola model can be used to capture the response of study genotypes to different irrigation regimes these results are similar to those of rahimi moghaddam et al 2019 who reported an nrmse value of 7 21 10 04 and 9 8 d index of 0 53 to 0 79 and 0 95 and mbe value of 0 019 to 0 003 mm mm and 0 14 t ha 1 for soil moisture content and seed yield respectively using the apsim maize model in iran and indicated that apsim maize was able to predict the response of maize plants to different irrigation management practices from 30 to 60 reduction in available soil water reasonably well in another simulation study he et al 2017b concluded that apsim canola was able to predict the seed yield of two rapeseed genotypes spring and winter across contrasting climatic regions with acceptable accuracy finally given that the model was able to simulate both biomass and seed yield under potential and water stress conditions the model can be used in different management practices including water management in the present study and other studies 4 2 withholding irrigation and shifting towards the cooler agro climatic zone as solutions for water saving and increasing canola production the higher seed yields in the west and temperate location of khorramabad averaged across genotypes and irrigation regimes could be largely attributed to higher cumulative rainfall 495 mm evapotranspiration 420 mm and days to maturity 228 66 as well as appropriate temperature over the growing period 11 05 c table 5 especially in the late stages of the growing period including flowering start of seed filling and end of seed filling data not shown the seed filling stage of rapeseed depends on daily biomass production and biomass partitioning basically there is a temperature stress factor to control radiation use efficiency rue which would affect daily potential biomass accumulation the cardinal temperatures are 0 10 22 30 c in this regard the frequency of temperatures greater than 22 c was 2 6 for khorramabad data not shown thus the longer growing period under suitable temperature conditions on the one hand as well as higher transpiration over the growing period compared with the other study locations on the other led to a higher photosynthesis rate and consequently higher pod total weight table 5 furthermore the frequency of sdr indicated that approximately no water deficit stress was observed during the flowering stage one of the most important sensitive stages to water limited conditions in khorramabad fig 7 it is worth noting that at the start of the seed filling stage the frequency rates of two sdr types 0 to 0 69 water stress conditions and 0 7 1 free water stress conditions were almost equal in khorramabad while across all study locations except kuhdasht and shushtar the frequency of sdr was higher for values of less than 0 7 fig 7 all these factors eventually led to the greater seed yield of rapeseed in khorramabad fig 5 in contrast the lower seed yield for the arid and hot location of dezful averaged across genotypes and irrigation regimes could be attributed mainly to lower evapotranspiration 298 56 mm days to maturity 171 28 and inappropriate temperature during the growing period 16 12 c table 5 especially in the late stages of the growing period including start of seed filling and end of seed filling data not shown at the seed filling stage about 35 of days had temperatures above 22 c data not shown which had a negative effect on the photosynthetic rate and dry matter accumulation of rapeseed and consequently produced lower pod total weight in dezful table 5 it is worth noting that at the flowering stage the frequency rates of the two sdr types were almost equal in dezful while the frequency of 0 to 0 69 was almost 80 at the start and end of seed filling fig 7 the results of the current study showed that the highest seed yield was simulated for the i1 regime followed by the i4 i3 and i2 regimes it is well known that water limitation affects development and growth of crops so a decrease in available water could eventually cause a decrease in seed yield farahani et al 2019 rahimi moghaddam et al 2019 moreover averaged across irrigation regimes i1 i2 i3 and i4 the frequency of sdr for values of less than 0 7 obviously increased during the start of seed filling and the end of seed filling stages in comparison to the flowering stage due to increased water limitations fig 7 drought occurs when there is insufficient soil moisture content to achieve the highest or potential growth of crops blum 2012 the crops ability is very important to maintain the photosynthetic mechanism under water limited conditions baghbani arani et al 2017 the development and growth of rapeseed under water limitation conditions led to lower stomatal conductance and photosynthesis rate which affected the accumulation of dry matter shabani et al 2013 and seed yield moradi aghdam et al 2019 eyni nargeseh et al 2020b although the seed yield of rapeseed was obviously reduced under withholding irrigation conditions i2 i3 and i4 regimes compared to full irrigation i1 regime the decrease in simulated seed yield was not identical between study locations fig 5 averaged by genotypes dehloran as a hot region table 1 had the greatest reduction in simulated seed yield under i2 40 5 i3 28 8 and i4 18 9 regimes compared with the i1 regime fig 5 while the lowest decrease in simulated seed yield for i2 12 5 i3 9 9 and i4 9 1 regimes compared with the i1 regime was detected in khorramabad as a temperate region table 1 fig 5 thus it is concluded that there is a potential for expanding the area under cultivation in temperate regions and shifting towards the cooler agro climatic zone such as khorramabad with the low area under cultivation of 184 ha and high seed yield of 3761 3 kg ha 1 table 1 and fig 5 can lead to more canola production moreover by accepting a slight decrease in seed yield and withholding irrigation at the seed filling period i4 regime farmers can save irrigation water approximately 500 1000 m3 ha 1 data not shown at the end of the season and allocate irrigation water to other crops when averaged across locations the lowest decrease in seed yield was simulated for rgs003 late maturity genotype 18 1 followed by hyola308 mid maturity genotype 18 6 and hyola401 early maturity genotype 20 9 under water limited conditions i2 i3 and i4 regimes compared with the i1 regime which indicated that the late maturity genotype had more resistance under water limited conditions fig 5 the yield and yield components of the crops depend mainly upon growth conditions which are significantly affected by water availability nazeri et al 2018 the performance of the crops under water deficit stress conditions depends upon different factors such as genotypes climatic conditions intensity and duration of stress and stages of plant development and growth stress occurrence time is more vital compared with drought stress intensity sinaki et al 2007 the reduction in seed yield could be considered as the drought susceptibility of a genotype under water limited conditions blum 2012 if resistant genotypes are used under water limited conditions seed yield could be less affected by water deficit stress over variable environmental conditions nazari et al 2017 eyni nargeseh et al 2020a dorostkar et al 2015 concluded that rapeseed genotypes with low seed yield losses under drought stress conditions compared with a full irrigation regime can be used in plant breeding programs for drought tolerance in the current study although the mid maturity genotype averaged by irrigation regimes and locations produced the highest simulated seed yield rgs003 was a more resistant genotype because of its lower decrease in seed yield under water limited conditions the same results were reported by other researchers eyni nargeseh et al 2020a who evaluated the response of 17 rapeseed genotypes under water limited conditions in iran and showed that the seed yield of studied genotypes was reduced by 24 9 under withholding irrigation from the silique setting stage until maturity in comparison to full irrigation over the growing period their results indicated l72 hl3721 and mercure were detected as resistant genotypes under withholding irrigation conditions due to higher seed yields compared with other studied genotypes the results of farahani et al 2019 demonstrated that rapeseed seed yield averaged by genotypes decreased by 32 and 22 6 as a result of restricted irrigation from the flowering and pod formation stages respectively with respect to full irrigation there was large variability among the three studied genotypes in terms of simulated seed yield fig 6 when averaged across locations and irrigation regimes the mid maturity genotype hyola401 had the highest simulated seed yield with an average of 2798 4 kg ha 1 followed by the late maturity genotype rgs003 and early maturity genotype hyola308 with an average of 2496 7 and 2392 0 kg ha 1 respectively fig 6 the higher simulated seed yield for hyola401 than hyola308 and rgs003 can be largely attributed to higher hi and duration of seed filling table 3 in this regard he et al 2017c reported that rapeseed seed yield is simulated using a hi that increases linearly with time during seed filling stages generally individual seed weight is one of the most important yield components to be accomplished during the development period diepenbrock 2000 the rate and duration of seed filling affect individual seed weight and it is the result of the crop s current photosynthesis and remobilization sinaki et al 2007 nazeri et al 2018 investigated the effects of different sowing dates and late season water deficit stress on quantitative traits of rapeseed genotypes and indicated that high yielding genotypes had maximum 1000 seed weights averaged by sowing dates and irrigation regimes in general the results of the genotypes performance highlighted two points first under free water stress situations farmers can maximize canola production by applying a mid maturity genotype hyola401 particularly in temperate areas second under conditions of scarcity and insufficient access to irrigation water in order to reduce the effects of water stress both frequency and intensity farmers should cultivate a genotype with the characteristics of the rgs003 late maturity and hyola308 early maturity genotypes and breeders should focus on the genetic characteristics of these genotypes table 3 to introduce new varieties especially in fragile and drought prone environments such as hot and semi arid regions 5 conclusions the apsim canola model simulated reasonably well phenological stages days to flowering and maturity under potential conditions no water and nitrogen limitations which resulted in a successful and acceptable simulation for rapeseed seed yield and biomass also under water limited conditions the model was able to simulate well seed yield and biomass on average yield potential for rapeseed production was higher in the west with a temperate agro climatic zone 2852 6 kg ha 1 than in the southwest with a hot agro climatic zone 1885 1 kg ha 1 therefore increasing the cultivated area of rapeseed in the west could increase the production of rapeseed in iran moreover withholding irrigation at the seed filling period produced the lowest reduction in seed yield 13 1 compared with other withholding irrigation regiems thus if farmers are faced with water limitations in the late stages of rapeseed growth withholding irrigation at seed filling onwards could be recommended as a solution for water saving at the end of the growing season and they can allocate irrigation water to other crops under free water stress conditions hyola401 mid maturity genotype produced the highest simulated seed yield 2798 4 kg ha 1 and could be cultivated for maximizing rapeseed production in canola agro ecosystems especially in temperate areas furthermore the late maturity genotype rgs003 could be applied in breeding programs to release new high yielding genotypes with high drought tolerance declaration of competing interest the authors reported no declarations of interest acknowledgment this research did not receive any specific grant from

10418,the current study evaluated the development and growth of three major rapeseed genotypes hyola308 hyola401 and rgs003 as early mid and late maturity genotypes respectively as well as seed yield under different irrigation regimes full irrigation withholding irrigation at the flowering stage withholding irrigation at the pod initiation stage and withholding irrigation at the seed filling period and also the spatial yield potential apsim canola model was applied to investigate the response of rapeseed genotypes to irrigation regimes in ten locations simulated results indicated that yield potential for rapeseed production was higher in the west which is a temperate agro climatic zone 2852 6 kg ha 1 than in the southwest which is a hot agro climatic zone 1885 1 kg ha 1 although hyola401 the mid maturity genotype had the maximum seed yield 2798 4 kg ha 1 rgs003 the late maturity genotype was found to be more drought resistant due to a lower decrease in seed yield 18 1 under water limited conditions compared with full irrigation conditions the current findings suggest that the mid maturity genotype has more yield potential in the studied locations with different climates and soils under full irrigation conditions due to higher seed yield and the late maturity genotype can be suggested as a resistant genotype for future breeding programs to introduce new high yielding genotypes with high drought tolerance especially in drought prone environments furthermore withholding irrigation at seed filling onwards which showed the lowest decrease in seed yield 13 6 can be recommended as a strategy for water saving at the end of the growing season and farmers can allocate irrigation water to other crops keywords apsim canola drought tolerant genotypes late season drought stress spatial yield potential 1 introduction rapeseed brassica napus l is globally a major oilseed crop cultivated on over 34 7 million ha worldwide in 2017 fao 2017 after palm and soybean it is currently the third most important oilseed crop in the world rapeseed can be used as an alternative crop for cereal based crop rotations particularly in arid and semi arid regions like iran hamzei and soltani 2012 and thus can be grown as a break crop for continuous wheat cropping systems kirkegaard et al 1997 furthermore rapeseed is an appropriate crop for cultivation in arid regions due to its high water use efficiency and relative tolerance to drought stress albarrak 2006 the seed yield and yield components of a crop depend mainly on growth conditions during the growing period which is significantly affected by water availability nazeri et al 2018 drought is one of the most important limiting factors for rapeseed growth and productivity in iran especially at the final growth stages flowering pod formation and seed filling jabbari et al 2013 which can reduce seed yield safavi fard et al 2018 water saving at the end of the rapeseed growing season especially flowering pod formation and seed filling stages is significantly important for farmers in arid and semi arid regions withholding irrigation in these stages leads to 2 3 times less irrigation compared with full irrigation conditions safavi fard et al 2018 under drought stress conditions reduction in rapeseed seed yield can be attributed to reduced yield components including number of pods per plant number of seeds per pod and individual seed weight eyni nargeseh et al 2020b several researchers have reported that drought stress during development and growth stages is the limiting factor that has considerable influence on biochemical kalantar ahmadi et al 2015a b quantitative and qualitative traits nazeri et al 2018 moradi aghdam et al 2019 under different environmental conditions the responses of genotypes which usually vary due to different genetic makeups are called genotype environment interactions mansour et al 2017 selecting genotypes which tolerate water deficit stress at the generative growth phase could increase the cultivated area of rapeseed in arid and semi arid regions like iran as well as other countries that have the same climate conditions nasiri et al 2017 rashidi et al 2012 safavi fard et al 2018 investigated the effect of late season drought stress withholding irrigation from flowering and pod formation stages on five canola cultivars sarigol delgan jacamo jerumeh and hyola 401 and reported that in cold temperate regions with arid and semi arid climates delgan as an early maturity cultivar could be recommended considering the acceptable seed oil yield for full irrigation and withholding irrigation conditions in winter cultivation respectively eyni nargeseh et al 2020a studied the response of 17 rapeseed genotypes to late season deficit irrigation withholding irrigation from pod formation stage until the end of the growing period and stated that the mid maturity genotype under full irrigation and the mid maturity genotype under withholding irrigation conditions produced the highest seed yields compared with other genotypes because of high pods per plant seeds per pod and 1000 seed weight crop simulation models are widely used to evaluate the development and growth of crops such as wheat eyni nargeseh et al 2020c maize rahimi moghaddam et al 2019 sugar beet deihimfard et al 2019 chickpea amiri et al 2020 and rapeseed he et al 2017c simulation research using crop models could enhance the understanding of plant responses to weather conditions deihimfard et al 2019 and soils and their interactions with different crop

the genotype environment management interactions on crops e g rahimi moghaddam et al 2019 such a modeling approach may help identify likely strategies that could enhance productivity and resource use efficiency across a number of environments growing seasons and management scenarios he et al 2017b iran 25 5 to 39 78 n latitude classified as an arid and semi arid country has suffered from limited water resources as a result of reduced rainfall over the last few years rahimi moghaddam et al 2019 consequently water saving is very important especially late in the season for rapeseed at flowering pod formation and seed filling stages which coincides with the early irrigation of spring crops it is significantly vital because farmers often do not have enough irrigation water to devote to both autumn and spring crops safavi fard et al 2018 accordingly the current study aimed to evaluate i the apsim canola model accuracy for simulation of rapeseed seed yield under full irrigation and water stress conditions ii the seed yield of three rapeseed genotypes under late season drought stress in different regions and also the spatial yield potential and iii withholding irrigation as a strategy to reduce irrigation without significant yield loss 2 materials and methods 2 1 study locations and climate types the current study focused on ten locations in four provinces in the west and southwest

pre plant 2 150 kg ha 1 nitrogen in two splits 50 kg ha 1 in pre plant and 100 kg ha 1 in stem elongation stage rapeseed seeds were sown on 22 september 2007 the plots were thinned after complete seedling establishment 2 4 leaf stage the experimental plots were kept free of weeds by hand pulling over the growing period soil moisture content was measured by a neutron meter model cpn 503 dr before irrigation in this study water volume entering the field was measured by a water meter irrigation dates and amounts are presented in supplementary table s1 it should be noted that the 3rd and 4th experiments were used only for testing the soil water balance module of the model table 2 crop model calibration refers to the estimation of the key model parameters by fitting the overall model to observed data which is an integral part of crop modeling wallach et al 2011 in this study it was performed through a trial and error procedure to minimize the difference between simulated and observed data calibration was started by adjusting the phenological parameters such as tt emergence tt end of juvenile and tt flowering table 3 to ensure that apsim canola simulated to flowering and maturity dates secondly the parameters related to biomass and seed growth were derived using the trial and error method the harvest index hi was derived using the optimization process in order to correctly simulate seed yield all calibration processes were done under full irrigation and nutrition the final values of the cultivar specific parameters which were obtained through model calibration are shown in table 3 a workflow diagram describing all data tools and simulation processes used in the current study is presented in supplementary fig s1 evaluating the performance of a crop model apsim canola is an important and necessary step before using the model for simulation studies such evaluation is based on the comparison of field measured and simulated values for study traits various indicators can be applied to evaluate the differences between simulated and field measured values in the current study normalized root mean squared error nrmse wallach and gofnet 1987 the willmott index of agreement d index willmott 1982 mean bias error mbe willmott 1982 determination coefficient r2 and 1 1 line were calculated as follows 2 n r m s e i 1 n s i o i 2 n 100 ō 3 d i n d e x 1 i 1

measure of the relative difference of simulated versus observed data and model simulation accuracy increases as nrmse approaches zero the willmott index d index is ranged from 0 to 1 with 1 denoting a perfect match between the observed and simulated data a model is judged to simulate satisfactorily when mbe is close to zero moreover matching 1 1 and regression lines shows that the model predicts the goal trait with high accuracy 2 4 long term simulation experiments and description of treatments simulation experimental treatments included irrigation regimes and genotypes four irrigation regimes consisted of full irrigation withholding irrigation at the flowering stage withholding irrigation at the pod formation stage and withholding irrigation at the seed filling stage abbreviated as i1 i2 i3 and i4 respectively three major and predominate rapeseed genotypes in the study area hyola308 hyola401 and rgs003 as early mid and late maturity genotypes respectively were used to investigate the effects of genetic factors on seed yield experimental treatments irrigation regimes and genotypes were considered for the ten locations in iranian rapeseed agro ecosystems most farmers perform dry sowing and then start to irrigate immediately under the circumstances the initial soil water is assumed to be equal to pawc in each location during the rapeseed growing period irrigation was triggered whenever available soil water asw fell below 70 from sowing to maturity stage for i1 from sowing to flowering stage for i2 from sowing to pod formation for i3 and from sowing to seed filling stage for i4 water nitrogen and surface organic matter were all reset at sowing each year throughout all simulations for model application tillage conventional tillage plant density 80 plants m 2 sowing depth 30 mm and row spacing 300 mm were held constant in all simulations for model application moreover all simulations for model application were conducted under stress free conditions of nitrogen and biotic factors finally long term simulation experiments consisted of a factorial of four irrigation regimes three genotypes and ten locations over the simulation years which differed for each location refer to table 1 a total of 3420 simulation experiments 2 5 supply demand ratio sdr apart from different outputs such as seed yield biomass evapotranspiration and pod total weight the apsim canola model produced a water stress factor named supply demand ratio sdr which shows the degree to which the soil water extractable by the plant roots water supply is able to match the potential transpiration water demand wd in fact the water demand corresponds to the amount of water the crop would have transpired in the absence of soil water constraint and is calculated as follows 5 w d c g r v p d c o 2 t e c r o p where cgr is crop growth on that day g mm 2 vpd is the atmospheric saturation vapor pressure deficit kpa c o 2 is a coefficient adjusting the transpiration efficiency for co2 concentration and t e c r o p is the transpiration efficiency coefficient for above ground biomass g m 2 mm 1 kpa the crop water supply is computed for each layer of the soil where roots are present and depends on the root growth and soil property of each layer chenu et al 2013 the sdr is outlined as the ratio between water supply ws and water demand wd and was capped between 1 0 no water stress and 0 0 no water available to the crop more details about the sdr can be found in chapman et al 1993 and chenu et al 2013 in the current study the growing period for rapeseed was divided into nine stages i e sowing germination emergence end of juvenile floral initiation flowering start of seed filling end of seed filling and maturity then the sdr ratio intensity and frequency was calculated for each stage at all study locations separately for all genotypes and irrigation regimes i1 and i4 more description about growth stages and phenological development can be found in robertson and lilley 2016 mean sdr ratio at each development stage of rapeseed was considered as the intensity of the sdr ratio to consider the frequency of sdr ratio and water stress events two sdrs were computed so that continuous days with an sdr ratio of 0 to 0 69 and 0 7 1 were separately extracted at different stages for genotypes and irrigation regimes i1 and i4 at all study locations it was assumed that a stress event occurred when the sdr ratio was below 0 7 chenu et al 2013 2 6 statistical analysis the current study used an rcbd in a factorial arrangement in which years were considered as blocks analysis of variance of the experimental factors ten locations four irrigation regimes and three genotypes and mean comparisons were done using sas 9 2 mean comparisons of the study traits were conducted using the least significant difference lsd test at the 0 05 probability level 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation under potential and water limited conditions results of model calibration using the data obtained from different sowing dates and genotypes under potential situations showed that the simulated seed yield and days to flowering and maturity were modeled reasonably well for the three studied genotypes table 4 the apsim canola model predicted phenological stages including days to flowering and maturity reasonably well with nrmse of 3 79 and 2 85 mbe of 0 92 and 0 61 day and d index of 0 91 and 0 94 respectively the nrmse mbe and d index values for seed yield 8 56 74 9 kg ha 1 and 0 87 respectively and biomass 7 86 362 3 kg ha 1 and 0 88 respectively indicated a close agreement between the field measured and simulated values table 4 in validation a comparison of the apsim canola model with the experimental data collected from different irrigation regimes and genotypes under water limited conditions revealed that the model accurately predicted the seed yield and biomass of rapeseed fig 3 measured biomass ranged from 6810 kg ha 1 to 13 500 kg ha 1 and the nrmse mbe r2 and d index values for biomass simulation were 12 3 327 8 kg ha 1 0 82 and 0 51 respectively fig 3a moreover the apsim canola model accurately simulated rapeseed seed yield so that nrmse mbe r2 and d index values of 10 04 52 1 kg ha 1 0 65 and 0 88 respectively were recorded indicating a good agreement between the observed and simulated values fig 3b the nrmse values for soil moisture content ranged from 13 1 water stress at the flowering and pod formation stages to 8 68 rainfed fig 4 b and d the d index varied from 0 88 water stress at the flowering and pod formation stages to 0 54 full irrigation fig 4b and 4e this shows that the apsim model captured the soil water balance with high accuracy during the growing period of rapeseed under different irrigation treatments and water limited situations however over different years and irrigation treatments the apsim canola model underestimated the soil moisture content in both experiments to some extent with an mbe of 0 024 cm3 cm 3 under full irrigation to 0 007 cm3 cm 3 under water stress at the flowering and pod formation stages fig 4a and b overall the results illustrated that water climatic and soil relationships were well structured in the apsim canola model and their effects on the development and growth of rapeseed were well captured by the apsim canola model 3 2 large variability in seed yield depending upon genotype irrigation regime and location main effects of irrigation regimes and genotypes on simulated rapeseed seed yield were statistically significant at a 1 probability level among locations results of analysis of variance not shown the average seed yield of the entire rapeseed agro ecosystem all study locations was 2560 kg ha 1 fig 5 a large variability was found in rapeseed seed yields depending upon irrigation regimes and genotypes at each location fig 5 moreover significant regional differences in seed yield of rapeseed were projected by the apsim canola model for example the effect of location made a difference of 2301 1 kg ha 1 in seed yield fig 5 the western regions of iran produced higher seed yields than the southwest regions figs 1 and 5 for instance khorramabad in the west with a temperate ago climatic zone and dezful in the southwest with a hot agro climatic zone with averages of 3761 3 and 1460 2 kg ha 1 generated the highest and lowest seed yield respectively fig 5 the results of long term simulations indicated that seed yield varied significantly across genotypes and withholding irrigation regimes fig 5 mid maturity hyola401 2798 4 kg ha 1 was the best yielding genotype followed by late rgs003 2496 7 kg ha 1 and early maturity hyola308 2392 kg ha 1 genotypes fig 5 under different irrigation management practices rapeseed produced the maximum seed yield 2989 6 kg ha 1 in full irrigation condition i1 followed by i4 withholding irrigation at the seed filling stage 2584 2 kg ha 1 i3 withholding irrigation at the pod formation stage 2448 5 kg ha 1 and i2 withholding irrigation at the flowering stage 2227 2 kg ha 1 regimes fig 5 in other words under i2 i3 and i4 regimes compared with the i1 regime as full irrigation seed yield tended to decline by 25 8 18 3 and 13 6 respectively fig 5 it should be noted that i2 i3 and i4 regimes averagely saved 1500 2000 1000 1500 and 500 1000 m3 ha 1 irrigation water compared with i1 regime respectively data not shown the irrigation regime genotype interaction showed that the reduction rate was different within various genotypes for example the late maturity genotype had the smallest decrease in the i3 and i4 regimes 16 9 and 12 2 respectively and early maturity had a better performance in the i2 regime 24 32 however across all locations the best interaction of genotype management to increase seed yield was mid maturity i1 3311 47 kg ha 1 overall the results presented that seed yield of rapeseed varied extremely over different iranian rapeseed agro ecosystems and a full irrigation regime along with a mid maturity genotype i1 hyola401 performed better in terms of seed yield withholding irrigation at the seed filling period i4 as a water saving strategy had the lowest yield loss compared with the i2 and i3 regimes 3 3 water supply demand ratio intensity and frequency of water stress varied among phenological stages locations irrigation regimes and genotypes the first impression given by fig 6 is that the intensity of water stress varied during the growing period of rapeseed across all regions genotypes and irrigation regimes i1 and i4 there was no water stress observed sdr 0 7 during stages 1 6 with only slightly fluctuation over stages 4 6 while severe stresses sdr 0 6 occurred mainly after flowering stage 6 at the start of seed filling and lasted until maturity stages 7 9 fig 6 although the sdr trend differed between locations and genotypes in some cases there were similarities in terms of this trend sever stress in all locations except shushtar for hyola401 and rgs003 genotypes began at the start of seed filling and lasted until maturity with a sdr of less than 0 6 fig 6 for hyola308 genotype severe stress occurred after flowering in behbahan darrehshahr dehloran dezful ilam and sarpol e zahab in gilan e gharb khorramabad and kuhdasht table 1 hyola401 mid maturity and rgs003 late maturity rapeseed genotypes experienced water limited conditions from the start of seed filling to maturity while severe stress started later for the hyola308 early maturity genotype where the sdr was less than 0 46 during end of seed filling and maturity stages stages 8 9 fig 6 in shushtar an arid and hot region rapeseed only experienced severe stress during end of seed filling for hyola401 it is worth noting that there was no water stress for rgs003 throughout the crop season in shushtar when i1 regime was applied while a slight water stress sdr 0 61 was observed during the final stage maturity in i4 regime fig 6 as can be seen from fig 7 the frequency of occurrence of water stress types varied considerably among phenological stages locations irrigation regimes i1 and i2 and genotypes across all rapeseed agro ecosystems and genotypes free water stress conditions were dominant during flowering i1 and i4 81 5 while rapeseed frequently experienced 80 1 and 84 2 water stress conditions around the end of seed filling in i1 and i4 respectively fig 7 generally during different stages the early maturity genotype hyola308 50 5 and 54 4 in i1 and i4 respectively was less exposed to water stress situations than mid hyola401 54 5 and 59 4 in i1 and i4 respectively or late maturity rgs003 55 7 and 59 6 in i1 and i4 respectively genotypes taking into account various regions it was observed that the performance of the genotypes changed and the exposure of different stages of rapeseed to water stress conditions varied across regions fig 7 for instance in the west and in ilam none of the genotypes were able to relieve the effects of water stress during the end of seed filling and rapeseed plants filled their seeds under full water stress conditions 100 in contrast in the southwest and in shushtar all genotypes were able to reduce the negative impacts of water stress during the canola growth period generally the simulated data showed that the intensity and frequency of water stress events varied over genotypes development stages of rapeseed irrigation regimes and locations furthermore an early maturity genotype could avoid exposure of the final development stages to late season water stress 4 discussion 4 1 apsim canola accurately simulated development and growth of different canola genotypes under different management practices by taking into account the value of errors in observation the agreement between field measured and simulated values showed that across all study locations and years the apsim canola model was able to capture the changes in seed yield biomass and days to flowering and maturity for genotypes and sowing dates under potential situations table 4 as well as changes in seed yield biomass and soil moisture content under water limited situations table 4 it was generally concluded that the apsim canola model can be used to capture the response of study genotypes to different irrigation regimes these results are similar to those of rahimi moghaddam et al 2019 who reported an nrmse value of 7 21 10 04 and 9 8 d index of 0 53 to 0 79 and 0 95 and mbe value of 0 019 to 0 003 mm mm and 0 14 t ha 1 for soil moisture content and seed yield respectively using the apsim maize model in iran and indicated that apsim maize was able to predict the response of maize plants to different irrigation management practices from 30 to 60 reduction in available soil water reasonably well in another simulation study he et al 2017b concluded that apsim canola was able to predict the seed yield of two rapeseed genotypes spring and winter across contrasting climatic regions with acceptable accuracy finally given that the model was able to simulate both biomass and seed yield under potential and water stress conditions the model can be used in different management practices including water management in the present study and other studies 4 2 withholding irrigation and shifting towards the cooler agro climatic zone as solutions for water saving and increasing canola production the higher seed yields in the west and temperate location of khorramabad averaged across genotypes and irrigation regimes could be largely attributed to higher cumulative rainfall 495 mm evapotranspiration 420 mm and days to maturity 228 66 as well as appropriate temperature over the growing period 11 05 c table 5 especially in the late stages of the growing period including flowering start of seed filling and end of seed filling data not shown the seed filling stage of rapeseed depends on daily biomass production and biomass partitioning basically there is a temperature stress factor to control radiation use efficiency rue which would affect daily potential biomass accumulation the cardinal temperatures are 0 10 22 30 c in this regard the frequency of temperatures greater than 22 c was 2 6 for khorramabad data not shown thus the longer growing period under suitable temperature conditions on the one hand as well as higher transpiration over the growing period compared with the other study locations on the other led to a higher photosynthesis rate and consequently higher pod total weight table 5 furthermore the frequency of sdr indicated that approximately no water deficit stress was observed during the flowering stage one of the most important sensitive stages to water limited conditions in khorramabad fig 7 it is worth noting that at the start of the seed filling stage the frequency rates of two sdr types 0 to 0 69 water stress conditions and 0 7 1 free water stress conditions were almost equal in khorramabad while across all study locations except kuhdasht and shushtar the frequency of sdr was higher for values of less than 0 7 fig 7 all these factors eventually led to the greater seed yield of rapeseed in khorramabad fig 5 in contrast the lower seed yield for the arid and hot location of dezful averaged across genotypes and irrigation regimes could be attributed mainly to lower evapotranspiration 298 56 mm days to maturity 171 28 and inappropriate temperature during the growing period 16 12 c table 5 especially in the late stages of the growing period including start of seed filling and end of seed filling data not shown at the seed filling stage about 35 of days had temperatures above 22 c data not shown which had a negative effect on the photosynthetic rate and dry matter accumulation of rapeseed and consequently produced lower pod total weight in dezful table 5 it is worth noting that at the flowering stage the frequency rates of the two sdr types were almost equal in dezful while the frequency of 0 to 0 69 was almost 80 at the start and end of seed filling fig 7 the results of the current study showed that the highest seed yield was simulated for the i1 regime followed by the i4 i3 and i2 regimes it is well known that water limitation affects development and growth of crops so a decrease in available water could eventually cause a decrease in seed yield farahani et al 2019 rahimi moghaddam et al 2019 moreover averaged across irrigation regimes i1 i2 i3 and i4 the frequency of sdr for values of less than 0 7 obviously increased during the start of seed filling and the end of seed filling stages in comparison to the flowering stage due to increased water limitations fig 7 drought occurs when there is insufficient soil moisture content to achieve the highest or potential growth of crops blum 2012 the crops ability is very important to maintain the photosynthetic mechanism under water limited conditions baghbani arani et al 2017 the development and growth of rapeseed under water limitation conditions led to lower stomatal conductance and photosynthesis rate which affected the accumulation of dry matter shabani et al 2013 and seed yield moradi aghdam et al 2019 eyni nargeseh et al 2020b although the seed yield of rapeseed was obviously reduced under withholding irrigation conditions i2 i3 and i4 regimes compared to full irrigation i1 regime the decrease in simulated seed yield was not identical between study locations fig 5 averaged by genotypes dehloran as a hot region table 1 had the greatest reduction in simulated seed yield under i2 40 5 i3 28 8 and i4 18 9 regimes compared with the i1 regime fig 5 while the lowest decrease in simulated seed yield for i2 12 5 i3 9 9 and i4 9 1 regimes compared with the i1 regime was detected in khorramabad as a temperate region table 1 fig 5 thus it is concluded that there is a potential for expanding the area under cultivation in temperate regions and shifting towards the cooler agro climatic zone such as khorramabad with the low area under cultivation of 184 ha and high seed yield of 3761 3 kg ha 1 table 1 and fig 5 can lead to more canola production moreover by accepting a slight decrease in seed yield and withholding irrigation at the seed filling period i4 regime farmers can save irrigation water approximately 500 1000 m3 ha 1 data not shown at the end of the season and allocate irrigation water to other crops when averaged across locations the lowest decrease in seed yield was simulated for rgs003 late maturity genotype 18 1 followed by hyola308 mid maturity genotype 18 6 and hyola401 early maturity genotype 20 9 under water limited conditions i2 i3 and i4 regimes compared with the i1 regime which indicated that the late maturity genotype had more resistance under water limited conditions fig 5 the yield and yield components of the crops depend mainly upon growth conditions which are significantly affected by water availability nazeri et al 2018 the performance of the crops under water deficit stress conditions depends upon different factors such as genotypes climatic conditions intensity and duration of stress and stages of plant development and growth stress occurrence time is more vital compared with drought stress intensity sinaki et al 2007 the reduction in seed yield could be considered as the drought susceptibility of a genotype under water limited conditions blum 2012 if resistant genotypes are used under water limited conditions seed yield could be less affected by water deficit stress over variable environmental conditions nazari et al 2017 eyni nargeseh et al 2020a dorostkar et al 2015 concluded that rapeseed genotypes with low seed yield losses under drought stress conditions compared with a full irrigation regime can be used in plant breeding programs for drought tolerance in the current study although the mid maturity genotype averaged by irrigation regimes and locations produced the highest simulated seed yield rgs003 was a more resistant genotype because of its lower decrease in seed yield under water limited conditions the same results were reported by other researchers eyni nargeseh et al 2020a who evaluated the response of 17 rapeseed genotypes under water limited conditions in iran and showed that the seed yield of studied genotypes was reduced by 24 9 under withholding irrigation from the silique setting stage until maturity in comparison to full irrigation over the growing period their results indicated l72 hl3721 and mercure were detected as resistant genotypes under withholding irrigation conditions due to higher seed yields compared with other studied genotypes the results of farahani et al 2019 demonstrated that rapeseed seed yield averaged by genotypes decreased by 32 and 22 6 as a result of restricted irrigation from the flowering and pod formation stages respectively with respect to full irrigation there was large variability among the three studied genotypes in terms of simulated seed yield fig 6 when averaged across locations and irrigation regimes the mid maturity genotype hyola401 had the highest simulated seed yield with an average of 2798 4 kg ha 1 followed by the late maturity genotype rgs003 and early maturity genotype hyola308 with an average of 2496 7 and 2392 0 kg ha 1 respectively fig 6 the higher simulated seed yield for hyola401 than hyola308 and rgs003 can be largely attributed to higher hi and duration of seed filling table 3 in this regard he et al 2017c reported that rapeseed seed yield is simulated using a hi that increases linearly with time during seed filling stages generally individual seed weight is one of the most important yield components to be accomplished during the development period diepenbrock 2000 the rate and duration of seed filling affect individual seed weight and it is the result of the crop s current photosynthesis and remobilization sinaki et al 2007 nazeri et al 2018 investigated the effects of different sowing dates and late season water deficit stress on quantitative traits of rapeseed genotypes and indicated that high yielding genotypes had maximum 1000 seed weights averaged by sowing dates and irrigation regimes in general the results of the genotypes performance highlighted two points first under free water stress situations farmers can maximize canola production by applying a mid maturity genotype hyola401 particularly in temperate areas second under conditions of scarcity and insufficient access to irrigation water in order to reduce the effects of water stress both frequency and intensity farmers should cultivate a genotype with the characteristics of the rgs003 late maturity and hyola308 early maturity genotypes and breeders should focus on the genetic characteristics of these genotypes table 3 to introduce new varieties especially in fragile and drought prone environments such as hot and semi arid regions 5 conclusions the apsim canola model simulated reasonably well phenological stages days to flowering and maturity under potential conditions no water and nitrogen limitations which resulted in a successful and acceptable simulation for rapeseed seed yield and biomass also under water limited conditions the model was able to simulate well seed yield and biomass on average yield potential for rapeseed production was higher in the west with a temperate agro climatic zone 2852 6 kg ha 1 than in the southwest with a hot agro climatic zone 1885 1 kg ha 1 therefore increasing the cultivated area of rapeseed in the west could increase the production of rapeseed in iran moreover withholding irrigation at the seed filling period produced the lowest reduction in seed yield 13 1 compared with other withholding irrigation regiems thus if farmers are faced with water limitations in the late stages of rapeseed growth withholding irrigation at seed filling onwards could be recommended as a solution for water saving at the end of the growing season and they can allocate irrigation water to other crops under free water stress conditions hyola401 mid maturity genotype produced the highest simulated seed yield 2798 4 kg ha 1 and could be cultivated for maximizing rapeseed production in canola agro ecosystems especially in temperate areas furthermore the late maturity genotype rgs003 could be applied in breeding programs to release new high yielding genotypes with high drought tolerance declaration of competing interest the authors reported no declarations of interest acknowledgment this research did not receive any specific grant from

10419,reducing water inputs by maintaining grain yield quality is important for sustainable production of rice this study was conducted to investigate the influence of different water management techniques on milling recovery grain quality and mercury uptake in rice under dry direct seeded and transplanted production systems two aromatic rice cultivars basmati 515 and chenab basmati were planted in conventional puddled transplanted rice tpr and dry direct seeded rice ddsr three irrigation management systems based on soil moisture tension smt continuous flooding 10 kpa smt alternate wetting and drying awd 20 kpa smt and aerobic rice 40 kpa smt were maintained rice planting in ddsr system performed comparable to tpr however percentage of broken rice chalky kernels abortive kernels and opaque kernels were higher 5 8 20 19 and 25 respectively under ddsr system however kernel amylopectin contents and mercury uptake were reduced by 9 and 11 under ddsr system in awd irrigation management substantial increase in brown head rice 11 white head rice 15 and kernel protein contents 11 were recorded as compared to aerobic irrigation management however awd irrigation reduced the kernel chalkiness 42 abortive kernels 51 and opaque kernels 62 as compared to aerobic irrigation management moreover the awd irrigation threshold also reduced the kernel amylose contents 15 amylopectin contents 6 and mercury uptake 21 in comparison to continuous flooded irrigation threshold in conclusion awd improved the milling recovery as well as grain quality and reduced the mercury uptake under tpr and ddsr in both rice cultivars rice cultivation under ddsr in combination with awd can help to improve the quality traits while reducing the total water inputs and heavy metal accumulation keywords production system alternate wetting and drying aerobic rice milling recovery mercury uptake appearance quality 1 introduction globally rice oryza sativa l is cultivated on an area of 167 million hectares with production of 782 million tonnes annually fao 2018 and contributes to food security for more than half of the world population carrijo et al 2017 rice is the biggest user of worldwide freshwater according to an estimation 35 45 of the world s irrigation water is utilized for rice production irri 2013 three fourth of rice cultivation is practiced under flooded conditions in which paddy fields remained flooded throughout or most of the season pimentel et al 2004 chauhan et al 2017 declining water supply to rice due to increasing water demand in other sectors such as industrialization and urbanization threatens the sustainability of traditional rice production singh et al 2013 traditional continuously flooded transplanted rice tpr system and emerging resource saving direct seeded rice are the principal methods of rice production in pakistan however the efficiency of any rice production system is determined by quantity and quality of the produce zhang et al 2008 to evaluate the rice quality several attributes like milling cooking appearance and nutrients composition are considered rice quality is generally controlled by genetics and the environment han et al 2004 out of environmental factors water management especially at the crop critical stages has strong influence on quality of rice as well as yield dingkuhn and gal 1996 although the tpr system produces fair yield the continuity of this system is being challenged by water scarcity and higher cost of production aslam et al 2008 furthermore higher grain contents of heavy metals like arsenic and mercury are a major concern in this system zhao et al 2016 mitra et al 2017 in this context water saving production systems like direct seeding and potential water saving irrigation systems like aerobic rice cultivation lampayan et al 2010 singh et al 2013 and alternate wetting and drying awd are attravtive options carrijo et al 2017 to harvest fair amount of yield of premium quality production system like dry direct seeded rice ddsr seems to be a viable alternative approach of conventional rice production because ddsr crop is conducive to mechanization earlier maturity and resource water time labor and energy saving farooq et al 2006 liu et al 2015 however the grain quality may vary while switching to water saving rice production systems sarwar et al 2016 farooq et al 2011 highlighted that the quality of direct seeded rice is challenged due to impaired kernel quality while contrary to this ishfaq et al 2018 concluded that direct seeded rice has potential to maintain the quality of rice if management practices water weeds and both micro and macro nutrients are executed properly the awd irrigation increased grain protein contents milling recovery grain pulpiness appearance cooking quality attributes and grain yield yang et al 2007 zhang et al 2008 darzi naftchali et al 2017 moreover awd alters the phyto hormonal levels particularly indole acetic acid increased during drying event and cytokinin levels increased upon re watering which boosts carbon mobilization toward sink grain from source to ensure the proper grain filling zhang et al 2010a wang et al 2016 application of awd irrigation technique resulted in intermediate amylose contents a decrease in kernel chalkiness and an increase in head rice recovery and protein contents darzi naftchali et al 2017 sandhu et al 2017 similarly many other studies highlighted the potential benefits of awd as it requires 23 33 less water carrijo et al 2017 while improving the grain quality by reducing total arsenic by 50 das et al 2016 and mercury contents by 38 60 in rice grains tanner et al 2018 wise application of awd technology not only had potential to maintain or increase the yield but also to improve the quality of rice similarly aerobic rice is another viable irrigation management option in the water scarce area wang et al 2002 aerobic rice system acts as a sink of methane emission hou et al 2000 37 50 water saving singh et al 2013 and higher water use efficiency rejesus et al 2013 as compared to traditional continuous flooded tpr it was found that aerobic rice cultivation not only maintained the rice grain quality by reducing the accumulation of arsenic and mercury contents in grains remarkably but also made it more attractive for consumer preferences xu et al 2008 basmati rice of pakistan is a type of indica rice and well known across the world due to its taste and special aromatic compound 2 acetyl 1 pyrroline ashfaq et al 2015 recent studies have reported excellent performance of basmati rice under tpr and ddsr systems in terms of productivity liu et al 2015 ishfaq et al 2020 however to the best of our knowledge no study has been conducted to evaluate the influence of different soil moisture tensions of water saving irrigations awd and aerobic rice in comparison to continuous flooded irrigation under tpr and ddsr on the milling recovery

drill on 07 june and 27 june during 2017 and 2018 respectively nursery for transplanted rice was sown on the same day using seed rate of 10 kg ha 1 during both years nursery seedlings were transplanted in 22 5 cm spaced rows whole of phosphorus and potassium and 40 of nitrogen were applied before sowing and transplanting while remaining nitrogen was top dressed at 20 days after transplanting dat in tpr and 30 days after sowing das in ddsr and panicle initiation stage an integrated package of stale seedbed technique pre and post emergence herbicides was used to control the weeds in experimental field oxadiargyl as pre emergence was applied in nursery plots and ddsr experimental units soon after seeding in flooded conditions using a shaker bottle while ethoxysulfuron as post emergence herbicide was flooded at 20 das in ddsr using flood irrigation similarly in tpr oxadiargyl was applied in standing water conditions after transplanting the seedlings whereas ethoxysulfuron was flooded at 15 dat total volume of applied water was measured by installing cut throat flume in main water channel and presented in tables s2 s4 field water depth was monitored by installing tubes pvc water pipes the irrigation requirements of respective treatment were fulfilled after attaining the pre decided threshold level there were three threshold levels of soil moisture tension viz 40 kpa aerobic rice 20 kpa awd and 10 kpa continuous flooded for both tpr and ddsr tensiometers were installed in each experimental unit to monitor soil moisture level irrigation was applied to each plot when the pre defined threshold level was achieved fig 1 in each experimental unit initial fully soil saturated condition was retained to attain stand establishment and better weed control tuong et al 2005 in the continuous flooded treatment of tpr flooding condition was maintained from the day of transplanting to physiological maturity whereas in continuous flooded treatment of ddsr muddy conditions 10 kpa soil moisture tension were maintained soon after seeding to two weeks after seeding while the remaining crop season flooding conditions were maintained to minimize yield losses in awd treatments flooding conditions 5 cm water depth were maintained from 14 to 30 das and panicle initiation to flowering stage for the remaining growth period fields were re flooded 3 cm water depth when water level in water tubes reached to 20 cm below the soil surface or when soil water tension reached at 20 kpa correspondingly for awd in tpr culture flooding conditions were maintained from the day of transplanting to 20 dat and panicle initiation to flowering stage whereas rest of the crop season awd experimental units were re irrigated when soil moisture tension reached to 20 kpa in aerobic rice treatments of tpr and ddsr experimental units were re flooded when soil moisture tension of 40 kpa attained to ensure crop establishment aerobic rice experimental units were kept saturated from the day of sowing to 30 das ddsr and from transplanting to 20 dat tpr irrigation was stopped to ddsr experimental units on 29th september 2017 and 15th october 2018 in transplanting experimental units irrigation was stopped on 7th and 20th october of 2017 and 2018 rice chewing insects and stem borers were controlled by applying fipronil 80 w w gr at 75 g ha 1 in both experimental years two applications of fipronil at 40 and 55 das in ddsr experimental units and 25 and 40 dat in tpr experimental units were done similarly crop was sprayed with tebuconazole 50 trifloxystrobin 25 w w 75 w g at 165 g ha 1 using a knapsack sprayer to control glume discoloration brown leaf spot leaf blast and neck blast at 45 and 60 dat in tpr experimental units while in ddsr experimental units crop was sprayed at 60 and 75 das to manage the bacterial leaf blight of rice fosetyl aluminium was applied at 55 dat and 65 dat in tpr experimental unit while in ddsr fosetyl aluminium was applied at 55 dat and 65 dat during 2017 and 2018 respectively crop was harvested manually using a sickle the crop was left in the field for drying and was threshed manually by beating against the metal drum the paddy moisture content was monitored by using mc 7825 g portable microprocessor grain moisture meter with a range of 5 31 and the final yield was expressed in t ha 1 at 14 grain moisture content tables s2 s4 2 5 observations and measurements data regarding milling recoveries mercury uptake kernel morphological physical dimensions and biochemical attributes were recorded using standard procedure during both years of experimentation as detailed below 2 5 1 milling recoveries attributes paddy sample 2 kg at 12 moisture content of each experimental unit was taken for further processing husker machine satake type thu 35b japan was used for husking of 500 g paddy samples brown rice br percentage was calculated by dividing the weight of brown rice by 500 g and multiplying by 100 percentage of brown head rice bhr and brown broken rice bbr was calculated by passing retrieved brown rice from husker through rice length grader stake type trg 05b japan both bhr

head rice whr and white broken rice wbr 2 5 2 kernel morphological attributes quality attributes like opaqueness and abortive kernel percentage per panicle were determined following akbar 2004 to determine kernel chalkiness sample of 15 de hulled rice kernel were taken and observed by positioning on a glass plate in front of light bulb 2 5 3 kernel physical dimensions and water absorption grain dimensions length and width of 50 grains from each experimental unit was measured and expressed in mm milled grains were taken to measure grain length width and thickness grain length and width

absorption ratio weight of cooked rice weight of raw rice 2 5 4 kernel biochemical composition kernel nitrogen contents were estimated by micro kjeldhal method kernel crude protein contents were calculated by multiplying the nitrogen contents with a correction factor 5 95 aoac 2006 rice kernel amylose contents were estimated using a modified procedure of juliano et al 1981 while amylopectin contents in rice grains were determined using procedure of yang et al 2013 2 5 5 mercury contents kernel mercury contents were determined using hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry hg

software 3 results 3 1 milling recoveries attributes year rice production systems irrigation management and variety significantly affected the percentage of brown head rice brown broken rice white head rice and white broken rice in both tested rice cultivars as well as lower order and higher order interactions during both years of study however brown rice and white rice percentage were not influenced significantly by year production systems and higher order interaction of production systems irrigation management varieties table s5 on an average of two years percentage of brown broken rice and white broken rice were significantly highest 5 and 2 respectively in ddsr as compared to tpr while percentage of brown head rice and white head rice were highest in tpr as compared to ddsr in case of irrigation management techniques awd gave the highest percentage of brown rice brown head rice white rice and white head rice by 2 11 3 and 15 respectively in comparison to aerobic rice cultivation while the percentage of brown broken rice and white broken rice were substantially highest in aerobic rice by 33 and 26 respectively in comparison to awd regarding cultivars basmati 515 performed better as compared to chenab basmati and had a highest percentage of brown head rice white rice and whaite head rice on the other hand percentage of brown rice brown broken rice and white broken rice were significantly highest in chenab basmati table 1 regarding higher order interaction chenab basmati under awd of ddsr performed better while basmati 515 gave lowest percentage of brown rice brown head rice and white head rice when the aerobic rice irrigation technique was used in the ddsr system table 2 3 2 kernel appearance traits and water absorption ratio abortive kernel and opaque kernel percentage were significantly influenced by all main factors year production systems irrigation management and varieties and lower order interaction during both years however interaction of irrigation management varieties did not influence kernel chalkiness and the influence of higher order interaction was also non significant during both years table s6 rice production in tpr system had lower chalky kernel abortive kernel and opaque kernel percentage by 17 16 and 20 respectively in comparison to ddsr across the year regarding irrigation management awd irrigation threshold performed equally as continuous flooded irrigation threshold but aerobic rice irrigation threshold increased chalkiness by 78 abortive kernel by 112 and opaque kernel by 222 as compared to continuous flooded across the years chenab basmati performed better as compared to basmati 515 and produced 12 15 and 15 lower chalky kernel abortive kernel and opaque kernel respectively across the year table 3 in lower order interaction of production system irrigation management aerobic rice cultivation either under ddsr or tpr gave the highest percentage of these kernel appearance traits while continuous flooded and awd irrigation performed equally under both rice systems table 3 whereas under the interaction of irrigation management varieties both cultivars under aerobic rice irrigation threshold produced a highest percentage of these traits table 4 analysis of variance indicated that kernel length and width were only influenced by two main factors irrigation management and varieties and year factors however kernel length to width ratio was non significant for all other factors beside year factor table s6 alternate wetting and drying and continuous flooded threshold produced statistically similar kernel length and width while aerobic rice irrigation threshold reduced the kernel length by 13 and 5 and kernel width by 15 and 11 in comparison to awd and continuous flooded irrigation respectively whereas kernel length and width of chenab basmati were significantly highest by 8 and 6 respectively in comparison to basmati 515 table 3 water absorption ratio was only significantly influenced by year production systems and irrigation management table s7 fig 2 a c water absorption ratio was 3 less in ddsr reduced by as compared to tpr fig 2a similarly rice produced under water saving irrigation awd and aerobic rice decreased the water absorption ratio by 2 and 9 respectively in comparison to continuous flooded irrigation threshold fig 2b regarding variety both varieties performed statisticaaly similar and gave similar water absorption ratio fig 2c 3 3 kernel biochemical composition analysis of variance revealed that kernel amylose contents protein contents and amylopectin contents were substantially influenced by year irrigation management and varieties during both years however protein contents were significantly influenced by all factors during second year interaction of production systems and irrigation management was significant for kernel biochemical traits during first year table s7 amylose contents in basmati 515 were more 4 than that of chenab basmati across the years fig 3 a continuous flooded irrigation threshold produced highest kernel amylose contents 17 and 18 respectively as compared to awd and aerobic rice irrigation threshold fig 3b regarding production systems irrigation mangement interaction highest kernel amylose contents were found in the tpr system during both years irrespective of irrigation management treatments however highest kernel amylose contents were recorded in tpr with continuous flooded irrigation management fig 3c chenab basmati produced highest protein contents during both years as compared to basmati 515 fig 3d results indicated that when rice was cultivated using awd irrigation threshold kernel protein contents improved significantly by 2 and 10 in comparison to continuous flooded and aerobic rice irrigation threshold respectively across the years fig 3e interaction of production systems irrigation management revealed that awd increased the kernel protein contents across the year in comparison to continuous flooded and aerobic rice irrigation either under ddsr or tpr system fig 3f kernel amylopectin contents were lower 9 in ddsr system than that of tpr system fig 4 a similarly kernel amylopectin contents were lower in awd and aerobic rice than continuous flooded irrigation by 5 and 19 respectively across the years fig 4b regarding variety kernel amylopectin contents were significantly higher in basmati 515 than the chenab basmati fig 4c interaction of production system irrigatoion management showed that during 2017 awd either under ddsr or tpr had higher kernel amylopectin contents but during 2018 the highest kernel amylopectin contents were recorded under continuous flooded irrigation threshold either under ddsr or tpr fig 4d 3 4 grain mercury contents analysis of variance indicated that mercury uptake was influenced by all main factors and year factor however it was non significant for production systems during second year interaction of production systems irrigation management was also significant during second year all other interactions were not significant during both years table s7 highest mercury uptake was found in case of tpr by 12 as compared to ddsr fig 4e similarly mercury uptake in continuous flooded was substantially highest 27 and 69 in comparison to awd and aerobic rice irrigation threshold respectively across the years fig 4f whereas average mercury uptake during two years of experimentation was highest 17 in basmati 515 as compared to chenab basmati fig 4g interaction of production systems and irrigation management revealed that reducing water inputs either in ddsr or tpr system decreased the mercury uptake significantly in comparison to continuous flooded irrigation of both systems however this reduction in mercury uptake was more pronounced in tpr as compared to ddsr system during both years of experimentation fig 4h 4 discussion 4 1 growing season head rice recovery brown head rice and white head rice appearance traits kernel length width and length to width ratio and biochemical traits amylopectin contents were significantly higher in 2018 that can be attributed to better climatic conditiods lower mean and higher temperature at grain filling stage previous studies of huang and lur 2000 and fitzgerald and resurreccion 2009 highlited that higher temperature at grain filling stage resulted into reduced head rice recovery increased kernel chalkiness and degraded market value 4 2 milling recoveries the findings of this study supported the hypothesis that water saving irrigation techniques can improve milling recovery quality traits and reduction in mercury uptake under tpr and ddsr for both cultivars of rice tables 1 4 figs 1 3 the percentage of milled rice directly influences the market price and economics of millers brown rice percentage and white head rice percentage are the two most important indicators of milled rice cheng et al 2003 in this study brown rice and white rice recovery was statistically similar in both production systems water saving irrigation system awd increased the milling recoveries significantly several studies concluded that moderate awd substantially increased the grain quality by improving milling grain appearance and cooking quality which ultimately enhanced market value zhang et al 2008 darzi naftchali et al 2017 in this study better milling recoveries might be attributed to more effective tillers deep root system higher leaf area index lower sterile spikelet ratio better nutrient acquisition from lower layer of soil higher assimilates translocation to sink and higher index weight bueno and lafarge 2009 zhang et al 2010b yadav et al 2014 ishfaq et al 2020 moreover split application of nitrogen in water saving techniques is also an important tool that influences milling quality as well as rice yield on the other hand reduced milling recoveries in aerobic rice irrigation scheduling either under ddsr or tpr might be attributed to stunted growth due to water stress at crop critical growth stage reduced leaf area index lower assimilates acquisition and translocation to sink and higher spikelet sterility zhang et al 2008 jabran et al 2015 darzi naftchali et al 2017 at post anthesis stage awd implication increased grain filling rate significantly which is attributed to increased root oxidation activity photosynthetic rate of flag leaf and activity of sucrose to starch conversion enzymes sucrose synthase phosphate synthase starch synthase adenosine diphosphate glucose pyro phosphorylase and starch branching enzyme during grain filling stage zhang et al 2008 4 3 kernel appearance traits and water absorption ratio higher productivity coupled with better appearance quality not only boost the export potential but also sustain marketability and business it was observed that in ddsr chalky kernels abortive kernels and opaque kernels were highest than tpr during both years previous studies indicated that the challenges for direct seeded rice grains quality are appearance sterility chalkiness and inferior grains dimensions farooq et al 2011 performance of awd in terms of chalky kernels abortive kernels and opaque kernels was comparable to traditional continuous flooded irrigation and this may due to the outcome of a better weed control program and better root proliferation coupled with the judicial application of irrigation and proper grain filling pascual and wang 2017 ishfaq et al 2020 higher root metabolic activity enables the plant to acquire more nutrients and water from greater depth and hence supports the higher photosynthetic rate zhang et al 2009 norton et al 2017 moreover in awd the alteration in phyto hormonal levels particularly abscisic acid indole acetic acid increased during drying event and enhanced cytokinin levels upon re watering to boost carbon mobilization toward sink grain from source to ensure the proper grain filling zhang et al 2008 2010a wang et al 2016 kernel chalkiness was reduced in awd treatments in comparison to continuous flooded that could be due to enhanced uptake of micronutrients selenium nickel cadmium and copper yang et al 2007 norton et al 2012 however further reduction in irrigation inputs as in aerobic rice irrigation scheduling increased the kernel chalkiness opaqueness and abortive kernel percentage significantly it might be explained as in aerobic rice irrigation scheduling reduced water content yoshida 1981 resulted in precipitation of iron fe to fe oh 3 enhanced oxidation of organic matter and reduced zinc bioavailability guo et al 2016 that ultimately affected the kernel quality inferior kernel quality in aerobic rice irrigation threshold was also attributed to the overlapping of drying event and crop critical stage anthesis and grain filling stage rice kernel dimensions are considered as the most important quality traits after milling recovery and other appearance traits cruz and khush 2000 longer kernel is preferred over the shorter kernel for better marketing especially for the aromatic rice which brings highest price across the world the outcomes of our studies explained that the water saving irrigation technique awd improved the kernel length in comparison to continuous flooded and aerobic rice irrigation threshold for both varieties increased in kernel length might be due to proper grain filling and re mobilization of assimilates especially when awd was practiced at the post anthesis stage wang et al 2016 similar to kernel dimensions water absorption ratio is an important indicator in determining the processing and cooking quality of aromatic rice butt et al 2008 in this study it was revealed that with the reduction of water inputs from continuous flooded to awd and aerobic rice irrigation threshold water absorption ratio reduced significantly that might be attributed to percentage of amylose contents because its higher contents is responsible for higher water uptake upon cooking correia et al 2016 similarly a higher water absorption ratio in basmati 515 might be attributed to higher amylose contents across the year 4 4 kernel biochemical traits soil moisture status at the post anthesis stage had a substantial influence on rice kernel biochemical traits reduced soil moisture content reduced the amylose content and percentage of un ripened grains but improved the protein content of brown rice zhang et al 2008 protein contents were higher in tpr treatment as compared to the same irrigation threshold level of ddsr the most important reason for low protein contents in ddsr as compared to tpr might be due to rubisco activity that was higher in tpr and rubisco considerable portion consists of protein sarker et al 2002 similarly chen et al 2005 highlighted that with the reduction of the photosynthetic rate due to lower rubisco activity soluble protein content also reduces it was reported that gradual drying or mild water stress resulted to increase grain protein contents while severe water stress reduced the grain protein contents significantly darzi naftchali et al 2017 higher protein contents in awd treatments could be attributed to a positive correlation between total nitrogen uptake and grain protein contents wang et al 2012 under awd the split application of nitrogen at critical stages enhanced its uptake that is also explained by darzi naftchali and shahnazari 2014 in 2017 protein contents in aerobic rice irrigation threshold were higher in comparison to awd in case of variety protein contents of chenab basmati were significantly highest as compared to basmati 515 which could be explained as the accumulation of protein in rice grain is cultivar dependent ning et al 2009 when the irrigation threshold was reduced from continuous flooded to awd or aerobic rice irrigation threshold amylose or amylopectin contents significantly reduced reduction in amylose and amylopectin contents with reduction of water inputs can be attributed to the abridged activity of granule bound starch synthase enzyme which is specifically involved in the biosynthesis of amylose robyt 1984 moreover with the increase of protein content in rice reduction in amylose contents also explained by gu et al 2015 and zhu et al 2017 that might be due to increase in nitrogen uptake basmati 515 exhibited highest amylose and amylopectin contents across the year over chenab basmati and this difference might be attributed to genetic variation in amylopectin and amylose contents in the rice grain bao 2012 amylopectin contents were highest in 2018 than 2017 because of higher environmental temperature in 2017 at the grain filling stage reduced the grain amylopectin contents suzuki et al 2004 explained that higher environmental temperature reduces the relative amount of amylopectin and it might be linked to reduced activity of starch branching enzyme at higher temperature ohdan et al 2011 4 5 grain mercury contents mercury uptake in rice grains was highest in continuous flooded irrigation treatment but with the reduction of water inputs its uptake decreased significantly previous research studies indicated that in terrestrial ecosystem paddy fields serve as primary pathways that expose mercury to humans zhang et al 2010b peng et al 2012 as paddy field are an important place for its production meng et al 2011 fluctuation in redox potential ph and water saturation levels of paddy field s soil during the rice season significantly influence mercury bioavailability for the methylation process zhao et al 2016 in contionuous flooded treatment mercury contents were highest because it promotes the activities of anaerobic microbes and enhances mercury uptake under anaerobic conditions iron fleming et al 2006 and sulfate reducing bacteria gilmour et al 1992 facilitate methylation especially of inorganic mercury liu et al 2014 accumulated mercury during the vegetative phase readily translocate to rice grains at the grain filling stage meng et al 2011 however drying paddy field before harvesting facilitates some degree of demethylation and it is attributed to decreased population of sulfate reducing bacteria under aerobic conditions wang et al 2014 so water management in paddy fields is the most novel step to mitigate the heavy metal accumulation in rice grain irrigation application according to awd threshold as contrary to continuous flooded could hinder the mercury solubilization and methylation in the rhizosphere of paddy field and ultimately it will result in reduced mercury uptake by 38 60 peng et al 2012 tanner et al 2018 4 6 variety performance chenab basmati outperformed in ddsr with awd irrigation management in term of quality traits while basmati 515 performed well in tpr either under awd consistently across the years thease findings recommend that the high yielding cultivars developed for the conventional cf irrigated rice system tpr cf or conservational cf irrigation system ddsr cf could still perform well under water saving irrigation system awd however under aerobic rice both varieties may reduce the milling recovery appearance quality and kernel physical dimensions 5 conclusion alternate weeting and drying improved the milling recovery as well as grain quality and reduced the mercury uptake under transplanted rice and dry direct seeded rice for both rice cultivars cultivar basmati 515 outperformed in transplanted system in terms of milling recovery as compared to chenab basmati while chenab basmati performed better in dry direct seeded rice in case of quality traits and reduced mercury uptake this study revealed that the high yielding cultivars developed for the conventional continuous flooded transplanted rice system or continuous flooded dry direct seeded rice system could still perform well under alternate wetting and drying a water saving irrigation system moreover alternate wetting and drying also has potential to improve the rice quality

10419,reducing water inputs by maintaining grain yield quality is important for sustainable production of rice this study was conducted to investigate the influence of different water management techniques on milling recovery grain quality and mercury uptake in rice under dry direct seeded and transplanted production systems two aromatic rice cultivars basmati 515 and chenab basmati were planted in conventional puddled transplanted rice tpr and dry direct seeded rice ddsr three irrigation management systems based on soil moisture tension smt continuous flooding 10 kpa smt alternate wetting and drying awd 20 kpa smt and aerobic rice 40 kpa smt were maintained rice planting in ddsr system performed comparable to tpr however percentage of broken rice chalky kernels abortive kernels and opaque kernels were higher 5 8 20 19 and 25 respectively under ddsr system however kernel amylopectin contents and mercury uptake were reduced by 9 and 11 under ddsr system in awd irrigation management substantial increase in brown head rice 11 white head rice 15 and kernel protein contents 11 were recorded as compared to aerobic irrigation management however awd irrigation reduced the kernel chalkiness 42 abortive kernels 51 and opaque kernels 62 as compared to aerobic irrigation management moreover the awd irrigation threshold also reduced the kernel amylose contents 15 amylopectin contents 6 and mercury uptake 21 in comparison to continuous flooded irrigation threshold in conclusion awd improved the milling recovery as well as grain quality and reduced the mercury uptake under tpr and ddsr in both rice cultivars rice cultivation under ddsr in combination with awd can help to improve the quality traits while reducing the total water inputs and heavy metal accumulation keywords production system alternate wetting and drying aerobic rice milling recovery mercury uptake appearance quality 1 introduction globally rice oryza sativa l is cultivated on an area of 167 million hectares with production of 782 million tonnes annually fao 2018 and contributes to food security for more than half of the world population carrijo et al 2017 rice is the biggest user of worldwide freshwater according to an estimation 35 45 of the world s irrigation water is utilized for rice production irri 2013 three fourth of rice cultivation is practiced under flooded conditions in which paddy fields remained flooded throughout or most of the season pimentel et al 2004 chauhan et al 2017 declining water supply to rice due to increasing water demand in other sectors such as industrialization and urbanization threatens the sustainability of traditional rice production singh et al 2013 traditional continuously flooded transplanted rice tpr system and emerging resource saving direct seeded rice are the principal methods of rice production in pakistan however the efficiency of any rice production system is determined by quantity and quality of the produce zhang et al 2008 to evaluate the rice quality several attributes like milling cooking appearance and nutrients composition are considered rice quality is generally controlled by genetics and the environment han et al 2004 out of environmental factors water management especially at the crop critical stages has strong influence on quality of rice as well as yield dingkuhn and gal 1996 although the tpr system produces fair yield the continuity of this system is being challenged by water scarcity and higher cost of production aslam et al 2008 furthermore higher grain contents of heavy metals like arsenic and mercury are a major concern in this system zhao et al 2016 mitra et al 2017 in this context water saving production systems like direct seeding and potential water saving irrigation systems like aerobic rice cultivation lampayan et al 2010 singh et al 2013 and alternate wetting and drying awd are attravtive options carrijo et al 2017 to harvest fair amount of yield of premium quality production system like dry direct seeded rice ddsr seems to be a viable alternative approach of conventional rice production because ddsr crop is conducive to mechanization earlier maturity and resource water time labor and energy saving farooq et al 2006 liu et al 2015 however the grain quality may vary while switching to water saving rice production systems sarwar et al 2016 farooq et al 2011 highlighted that the quality of direct seeded rice is challenged due to impaired kernel quality while contrary to this ishfaq et al 2018 concluded that direct seeded rice has potential to maintain the quality of rice if management practices water weeds and both micro and macro nutrients are executed properly the awd irrigation increased grain protein contents milling recovery grain pulpiness appearance cooking quality attributes and grain yield yang et al 2007 zhang et al 2008 darzi naftchali et al 2017 moreover awd alters the phyto hormonal levels particularly indole acetic acid increased during drying event and cytokinin levels increased upon re watering which boosts carbon mobilization toward sink grain from source to ensure the proper grain filling zhang et al 2010a wang et al 2016 application of awd irrigation technique resulted in intermediate amylose contents a decrease in kernel chalkiness and an increase in head rice recovery and protein contents darzi naftchali et al 2017 sandhu et al 2017 similarly many other studies highlighted the potential benefits of awd as it requires 23 33 less water carrijo et al 2017 while improving the grain quality by reducing total arsenic by 50 das et al 2016 and mercury contents by 38 60 in rice grains tanner et al 2018 wise application of awd technology not only had potential to maintain or increase the yield but also to improve the quality of rice similarly aerobic rice is another viable irrigation management option in the water scarce area wang et al 2002 aerobic rice system acts as a sink of methane emission hou et al 2000 37 50 water saving singh et al 2013 and higher water use efficiency rejesus et al 2013 as compared to traditional continuous flooded tpr it was found that aerobic rice cultivation not only maintained the rice grain quality by reducing the accumulation of arsenic and mercury contents in grains remarkably but also made it more attractive for consumer preferences xu et al 2008 basmati rice of pakistan is a type of indica rice and well known across the world due to its taste and special aromatic compound 2 acetyl 1 pyrroline ashfaq et al 2015 recent studies have reported excellent performance of basmati rice under tpr and ddsr systems in terms of productivity liu et al 2015 ishfaq et al 2020 however to the best of our knowledge no study has been conducted to evaluate the influence of different soil moisture tensions of water saving irrigations awd and aerobic rice in comparison to continuous flooded irrigation under tpr and ddsr on the milling recovery grain quality and mercury uptake of aromatic rice therefore this study evaluated the influence of different irrigation management techniques on the milling recoveries appearance biochemical traits and mercury uptake of two promising basmati cultivars under traditional tpr and conservational ddsr systems for this study we hypothesized that water saving irrigation techniques can improve milling recovery and grain quality and can reduce mecury uptake in two basmati cultivars of rice when implemented in tpr and ddsr systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and soil this field experiment was

were randomized in sub plots whereas rice cultivars were placed in sub sub plots fig s2 2 4 crop husbandry the ﬁeld was cultivated twice using a tractor mounted cultivator followed by levelling each year for puddling field was rotavated followed by cultivation three times and levelling for direct seeding crop was seeded 22 5 cm spaced rows using a seed rate of 30 kg ha 1 with a single row hand drill on 07 june and 27 june during 2017 and 2018 respectively nursery for transplanted rice was sown on the same day using seed rate of 10 kg ha 1 during both years nursery seedlings were transplanted in 22 5 cm spaced rows whole of phosphorus and potassium and 40 of nitrogen were applied before sowing and transplanting while remaining nitrogen was top dressed at 20 days after transplanting dat in tpr and 30 days after sowing das in ddsr and panicle initiation stage an integrated package of stale seedbed technique pre and post emergence herbicides was used to control the weeds in experimental field oxadiargyl as pre emergence was applied in nursery plots and ddsr experimental units soon after seeding in flooded conditions using a shaker bottle while ethoxysulfuron as post emergence herbicide was flooded at 20 das in ddsr using flood irrigation similarly in tpr oxadiargyl was applied in standing water conditions after transplanting the seedlings whereas ethoxysulfuron was flooded at 15 dat total volume of applied water was measured by installing cut throat flume in main water channel and presented in tables s2 s4 field water depth was monitored by installing tubes pvc water pipes the irrigation requirements of respective treatment were fulfilled after attaining the pre decided threshold level there were three threshold levels of soil moisture tension viz 40 kpa aerobic rice 20 kpa awd and 10 kpa continuous flooded for both tpr and ddsr tensiometers were installed in each experimental unit to monitor soil moisture level irrigation was applied to each plot when the pre defined threshold level was achieved fig 1 in each experimental unit initial fully soil saturated condition was retained to attain stand establishment and better weed control tuong et al 2005 in the continuous flooded treatment of tpr flooding condition was maintained from the day of transplanting to physiological maturity whereas in continuous flooded treatment of ddsr muddy conditions 10 kpa soil moisture tension were maintained soon after seeding to two weeks after seeding while the remaining crop season flooding conditions were maintained to minimize yield losses in awd treatments flooding conditions 5 cm water depth were maintained from 14 to 30 das and panicle initiation to flowering stage for the remaining growth period fields were re flooded 3 cm water depth when water level in water tubes reached to 20 cm below the soil surface or when soil water tension reached at 20 kpa correspondingly for awd in tpr culture flooding conditions were maintained from the day of transplanting to 20 dat and panicle initiation to flowering stage whereas rest of the crop season awd experimental units were re irrigated when soil moisture tension reached to 20 kpa in aerobic rice treatments of tpr and ddsr experimental units were re flooded when soil moisture tension of 40 kpa attained to ensure crop establishment aerobic rice experimental units were kept saturated from the day of sowing to 30 das ddsr and from transplanting to 20 dat tpr irrigation was stopped to ddsr experimental units on 29th september 2017 and 15th october 2018 in transplanting experimental units irrigation was stopped on 7th and 20th october of 2017 and 2018 rice chewing insects and stem borers were controlled by applying fipronil 80 w w gr at 75 g ha 1 in both experimental years two applications of fipronil at 40 and 55 das in ddsr experimental units and 25 and 40 dat in tpr experimental units were done similarly crop was sprayed with tebuconazole 50 trifloxystrobin 25 w w 75 w g at 165 g ha 1 using a knapsack sprayer to control glume discoloration brown leaf spot leaf blast and neck blast at 45 and 60 dat in tpr experimental units while in ddsr experimental units crop was sprayed at 60 and 75 das to manage the bacterial leaf blight of rice fosetyl aluminium was applied at 55 dat and 65 dat in tpr experimental unit while in ddsr fosetyl aluminium was applied at 55 dat and 65 dat during 2017 and 2018 respectively crop was harvested manually using a sickle the crop was left in the field for drying and was threshed manually by beating against the metal drum the paddy moisture content was monitored by using mc 7825 g portable microprocessor grain moisture meter with a range of 5 31 and the final yield was expressed in t ha 1 at 14 grain moisture content tables s2 s4 2 5 observations and measurements data regarding milling recoveries mercury uptake kernel morphological physical dimensions and biochemical attributes were recorded using standard procedure during both years of experimentation as detailed below 2 5 1 milling recoveries attributes paddy sample 2 kg at 12 moisture content of each experimental unit was taken for further processing husker machine satake type thu 35b japan was used for husking of 500 g paddy samples brown rice br percentage was calculated by dividing the weight of brown rice by 500 g and multiplying by 100 percentage of brown head rice bhr and brown broken rice bbr was calculated by passing retrieved brown rice from husker through rice length grader stake type trg 05b japan both bhr and bbr were passed through rice polisher stake type tmo 5c japan to obtain white rice wr white rice obtained from rice polisher was graded using rice grader wesort to find the percentage of white head rice whr and white broken rice wbr 2 5 2 kernel morphological attributes quality attributes like opaqueness and abortive kernel percentage per panicle were determined following akbar 2004 to determine kernel chalkiness sample of 15 de hulled rice kernel were taken and observed by positioning on a glass plate in front of light bulb 2 5 3 kernel physical dimensions and water absorption grain dimensions length and width of 50 grains from each experimental unit was measured and expressed in mm milled grains were taken to measure grain length width and thickness grain length and width of randomly selected grains were measured by using digital vernier caliper 0 150 mm and then average values were taken kernel water absorption ratio was determined following juliano 1965 kernel water absorption ratio weight of cooked rice weight of raw rice 2 5 4 kernel biochemical composition kernel nitrogen contents were estimated by micro kjeldhal method kernel crude protein contents were calculated by multiplying the nitrogen contents with a correction factor 5 95 aoac 2006 rice kernel amylose contents were estimated using a modified procedure of juliano et al 1981 while amylopectin contents in rice grains were determined using procedure of yang et al 2013 2 5 5 mercury contents kernel mercury contents were determined using hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry hg afs xgy 1011a igge china following method of mao et al 2019 2 6 statistical analysis data collected were analysed by fisher s analysis of variance using computer program statistix 10 steel et al 1997

software 3 results 3 1 milling recoveries attributes year rice production systems irrigation management and variety significantly affected the percentage of brown head rice brown broken rice white head rice and white broken rice in both tested rice cultivars as well as lower order and higher order interactions during both years of study however brown rice and white rice percentage were not influenced significantly by year production systems and higher order interaction of production systems irrigation management varieties table s5 on an average of two years percentage of brown broken rice and white broken rice were significantly highest 5 and 2 respectively in ddsr as compared to tpr while percentage of brown head rice and white head rice were highest in tpr as compared to ddsr in case of irrigation management techniques awd gave the highest percentage of brown rice brown head rice white rice and white head rice by 2 11 3 and 15 respectively in comparison to aerobic rice cultivation while the percentage of brown broken rice and white broken rice were substantially highest in aerobic rice by 33 and 26 respectively in comparison to awd regarding cultivars basmati 515 performed better as compared to chenab basmati and had a highest percentage of brown head rice white rice and whaite head rice on the other hand percentage of brown rice brown broken rice and white broken rice were significantly highest in chenab basmati table 1 regarding higher order interaction chenab basmati under awd of ddsr performed better while basmati 515 gave lowest percentage of brown rice brown head rice and white head rice when the aerobic rice irrigation technique was used in the ddsr system table 2 3 2 kernel appearance traits and water absorption ratio abortive kernel and opaque kernel percentage were significantly influenced by all main factors year production systems irrigation management and varieties and lower order interaction during both years however interaction of irrigation management varieties did not influence kernel chalkiness and the influence of higher order interaction was also non significant during both years table s6 rice production in tpr system had lower chalky kernel abortive kernel and opaque kernel percentage by 17 16 and 20 respectively in comparison to ddsr across the year regarding irrigation management awd irrigation threshold performed equally as continuous flooded irrigation threshold but aerobic rice irrigation threshold increased chalkiness by 78 abortive kernel by 112 and opaque kernel by 222 as compared to continuous flooded across the years chenab basmati performed better as compared to basmati 515 and produced 12 15 and 15 lower chalky kernel abortive kernel and opaque kernel respectively across the year table 3 in lower order interaction of production system irrigation management aerobic rice cultivation either under ddsr or tpr gave the highest percentage of these kernel appearance traits while continuous flooded and awd irrigation performed equally under both rice systems table 3 whereas under the interaction of irrigation management varieties both cultivars under aerobic rice irrigation threshold produced a highest percentage of these traits table 4 analysis of variance indicated that kernel length and width were only influenced by two main factors irrigation management and varieties and year factors however kernel length to width ratio was non significant for all other factors beside year factor table s6 alternate wetting and drying and continuous flooded threshold produced statistically similar kernel length and width while aerobic rice irrigation threshold reduced the kernel length by 13 and 5 and kernel width by 15 and 11 in comparison to awd and continuous flooded irrigation respectively whereas kernel length and width of chenab basmati were significantly highest by 8 and 6 respectively in comparison to basmati 515 table 3 water absorption ratio was only significantly influenced by year production systems and irrigation management table s7 fig 2 a c water absorption ratio was 3 less in ddsr reduced by as compared to tpr fig 2a similarly rice produced under water saving irrigation awd and aerobic rice decreased the water absorption ratio by 2 and 9 respectively in comparison to continuous flooded irrigation threshold fig 2b regarding variety both varieties performed statisticaaly similar and gave similar water absorption ratio fig 2c 3 3 kernel biochemical composition analysis of variance revealed that kernel amylose contents protein contents and amylopectin contents were substantially influenced by year irrigation management and varieties during both years however protein contents were significantly influenced by all factors during second year interaction of production systems and irrigation management was significant for kernel biochemical traits during first year table s7 amylose contents in basmati 515 were more 4 than that of chenab basmati across the years fig 3 a continuous flooded irrigation threshold produced highest kernel amylose contents 17 and 18 respectively as compared to awd and aerobic rice irrigation threshold fig 3b regarding production systems irrigation mangement interaction highest kernel amylose contents were found in the tpr system during both years irrespective of irrigation management treatments however highest kernel amylose contents were recorded in tpr with continuous flooded irrigation management fig 3c chenab basmati produced highest protein contents during both years as compared to basmati 515 fig 3d results indicated that when rice was cultivated using awd irrigation threshold kernel protein contents improved significantly by 2 and 10 in comparison to continuous flooded and aerobic rice irrigation threshold respectively across the years fig 3e interaction of production systems irrigation management revealed that awd increased the kernel protein contents across the year in comparison to continuous flooded and aerobic rice irrigation either under ddsr or tpr system fig 3f kernel amylopectin contents were lower 9 in ddsr system than that of tpr system fig 4 a similarly kernel amylopectin contents were lower in awd and aerobic rice than continuous flooded irrigation by 5 and 19 respectively across the years fig 4b regarding variety kernel amylopectin contents were significantly higher in basmati 515 than the chenab basmati fig 4c interaction of production system irrigatoion management showed that during 2017 awd either under ddsr or tpr had higher kernel amylopectin contents but during 2018 the highest kernel amylopectin contents were recorded under continuous flooded irrigation threshold either under ddsr or tpr fig 4d 3 4 grain mercury contents analysis of variance indicated that mercury uptake was influenced by all main factors and year factor however it was non significant for production systems during second year interaction of production systems irrigation management was also significant during second year all other interactions were not significant during both years table s7 highest mercury uptake was found in case of tpr by 12 as compared to ddsr fig 4e similarly mercury uptake in continuous flooded was substantially highest 27 and 69 in comparison to awd and aerobic rice irrigation threshold respectively across the years fig 4f whereas average mercury uptake during two years of experimentation was highest 17 in basmati 515 as compared to chenab basmati fig 4g interaction of production systems and irrigation management revealed that reducing water inputs either in ddsr or tpr system decreased the mercury uptake significantly in comparison to continuous flooded irrigation of both systems however this reduction in mercury uptake was more pronounced in tpr as compared to ddsr system during both years of experimentation fig 4h 4 discussion 4 1 growing season head rice recovery brown head rice and white head rice appearance traits kernel length width and length to width ratio and biochemical traits amylopectin contents were significantly higher in 2018 that can be attributed to better climatic conditiods lower mean and higher temperature at grain filling stage previous studies of huang and lur 2000 and fitzgerald and resurreccion 2009 highlited that higher temperature at grain filling stage resulted into reduced head rice recovery increased kernel chalkiness and degraded market value 4 2 milling recoveries the findings of this study supported the hypothesis that water saving irrigation techniques can improve milling recovery quality traits and reduction in mercury uptake under tpr and ddsr for both cultivars of rice tables 1 4 figs 1 3 the percentage of milled rice directly influences the market price and economics of millers brown rice percentage and white head rice percentage are the two most important indicators of milled rice cheng et al 2003 in this study brown rice and white rice recovery was statistically similar in both production systems water saving irrigation system awd increased the milling recoveries significantly several studies concluded that moderate awd substantially increased the grain quality by improving milling grain appearance and cooking quality which ultimately enhanced market value zhang et al 2008 darzi naftchali et al 2017 in this study better milling recoveries might be attributed to more effective tillers deep root system higher leaf area index lower sterile spikelet ratio better nutrient acquisition from lower layer of soil higher assimilates translocation to sink and higher index weight bueno and lafarge 2009 zhang et al 2010b yadav et al 2014 ishfaq et al 2020 moreover split application of nitrogen in water saving techniques is also an important tool that influences milling quality as well as rice yield on the other hand reduced milling recoveries in aerobic rice irrigation scheduling either under ddsr or tpr might be attributed to stunted growth due to water stress at crop critical growth stage reduced leaf area index lower assimilates acquisition and translocation to sink and higher spikelet sterility zhang et al 2008 jabran et al 2015 darzi naftchali et al 2017 at post anthesis stage awd implication increased grain filling rate significantly which is attributed to increased root oxidation activity photosynthetic rate of flag leaf and activity of sucrose to starch conversion enzymes sucrose synthase phosphate synthase starch synthase adenosine diphosphate glucose pyro phosphorylase and starch branching enzyme during grain filling stage zhang et al 2008 4 3 kernel appearance traits and water absorption ratio higher productivity coupled with better appearance quality not only boost the export potential but also sustain marketability and business it was observed that in ddsr chalky kernels abortive kernels and opaque kernels were highest than tpr during both years previous studies indicated that the challenges for direct seeded rice grains quality are appearance sterility chalkiness and inferior grains dimensions farooq et al 2011 performance of awd in terms of chalky kernels abortive kernels and opaque kernels was comparable to traditional continuous flooded irrigation and this may due to the outcome of a better weed control program and better root proliferation coupled with the judicial application of irrigation and proper grain filling pascual and wang 2017 ishfaq et al 2020 higher root metabolic activity enables the plant to acquire more nutrients and water from greater depth and hence supports the higher photosynthetic rate zhang et al 2009 norton et al 2017 moreover in awd the alteration in phyto hormonal levels particularly abscisic acid indole acetic acid increased during drying event and enhanced cytokinin levels upon re watering to boost carbon mobilization toward sink grain from source to ensure the proper grain filling zhang et al 2008 2010a wang et al 2016 kernel chalkiness was reduced in awd treatments in comparison to continuous flooded that could be due to enhanced uptake of micronutrients selenium nickel cadmium and copper yang et al 2007 norton et al 2012 however further reduction in irrigation inputs as in aerobic rice irrigation scheduling increased the kernel chalkiness opaqueness and abortive kernel percentage significantly it might be explained as in aerobic rice irrigation scheduling reduced water content yoshida 1981 resulted in precipitation of iron fe to fe oh 3 enhanced oxidation of organic matter and reduced zinc bioavailability guo et al 2016 that ultimately affected the kernel quality inferior kernel quality in aerobic rice irrigation threshold was also attributed to the overlapping of drying event and crop critical stage anthesis and grain filling stage rice kernel dimensions are considered as the most important quality traits after milling recovery and other appearance traits cruz and khush 2000 longer kernel is preferred over the shorter kernel for better marketing especially for the aromatic rice which brings highest price across the world the outcomes of our studies explained that the water saving irrigation technique awd improved the kernel length in comparison to continuous flooded and aerobic rice irrigation threshold for both varieties increased in kernel length might be due to proper grain filling and re mobilization of assimilates especially when awd was practiced at the post anthesis stage wang et al 2016 similar to kernel dimensions water absorption ratio is an important indicator in determining the processing and cooking quality of aromatic rice butt et al 2008 in this study it was revealed that with the reduction of water inputs from continuous flooded to awd and aerobic rice irrigation threshold water absorption ratio reduced significantly that might be attributed to percentage of amylose contents because its higher contents is responsible for higher water uptake upon cooking correia et al 2016 similarly a higher water absorption ratio in basmati 515 might be attributed to higher amylose contents across the year 4 4 kernel biochemical traits soil moisture status at the post anthesis stage had a substantial influence on rice kernel biochemical traits reduced soil moisture content reduced the amylose content and percentage of un ripened grains but improved the protein content of brown rice zhang et al 2008 protein contents were higher in tpr treatment as compared to the same irrigation threshold level of ddsr the most important reason for low protein contents in ddsr as compared to tpr might be due to rubisco activity that was higher in tpr and rubisco considerable portion consists of protein sarker et al 2002 similarly chen et al 2005 highlighted that with the reduction of the photosynthetic rate due to lower rubisco activity soluble protein content also reduces it was reported that gradual drying or mild water stress resulted to increase grain protein contents while severe water stress reduced the grain protein contents significantly darzi naftchali et al 2017 higher protein contents in awd treatments could be attributed to a positive correlation between total nitrogen uptake and grain protein contents wang et al 2012 under awd the split application of nitrogen at critical stages enhanced its uptake that is also explained by darzi naftchali and shahnazari 2014 in 2017 protein contents in aerobic rice irrigation threshold were higher in comparison to awd in case of variety protein contents of chenab basmati were significantly highest as compared to basmati 515 which could be explained as the accumulation of protein in rice grain is cultivar dependent ning et al 2009 when the irrigation threshold was reduced from continuous flooded to awd or aerobic rice irrigation threshold amylose or amylopectin contents significantly reduced reduction in amylose and amylopectin contents with reduction of water inputs can be attributed to the abridged activity of granule bound starch synthase enzyme which is specifically involved in the biosynthesis of amylose robyt 1984 moreover with the increase of protein content in rice reduction in amylose contents also explained by gu et al 2015 and zhu et al 2017 that might be due to increase in nitrogen uptake basmati 515 exhibited highest amylose and amylopectin contents across the year over chenab basmati and this difference might be attributed to genetic variation in amylopectin and amylose contents in the rice grain bao 2012 amylopectin contents were highest in 2018 than 2017 because of higher environmental temperature in 2017 at the grain filling stage reduced the grain amylopectin contents suzuki et al 2004 explained that higher environmental temperature reduces the relative amount of amylopectin and it might be linked to reduced activity of starch branching enzyme at higher temperature ohdan et al 2011 4 5 grain mercury contents mercury uptake in rice grains was highest in continuous flooded irrigation treatment but with the reduction of water inputs its uptake decreased significantly previous research studies indicated that in terrestrial ecosystem paddy fields serve as primary pathways that expose mercury to humans zhang et al 2010b peng et al 2012 as paddy field are an important place for its production meng et al 2011 fluctuation in redox potential ph and water saturation levels of paddy field s soil during the rice season significantly influence mercury bioavailability for the methylation process zhao et al 2016 in contionuous flooded treatment mercury contents were highest because it promotes the activities of anaerobic microbes and enhances mercury uptake under anaerobic conditions iron fleming et al 2006 and sulfate reducing bacteria gilmour et al 1992 facilitate methylation especially of inorganic mercury liu et al 2014 accumulated mercury during the vegetative phase readily translocate to rice grains at the grain filling stage meng et al 2011 however drying paddy field before harvesting facilitates some degree of demethylation and it is attributed to decreased population of sulfate reducing bacteria under aerobic conditions wang et al 2014 so water management in paddy fields is the most novel step to mitigate the heavy metal accumulation in rice grain irrigation application according to awd threshold as contrary to continuous flooded could hinder the mercury solubilization and methylation in the rhizosphere of paddy field and ultimately it will result in reduced mercury uptake by 38 60 peng et al 2012 tanner et al 2018 4 6 variety performance chenab basmati outperformed in ddsr with awd irrigation management in term of quality traits while basmati 515 performed well in tpr either under awd consistently across the years thease findings recommend that the high yielding cultivars developed for the conventional cf irrigated rice system tpr cf or conservational cf irrigation system ddsr cf could still perform well under water saving irrigation system awd however under aerobic rice both varieties may reduce the milling recovery appearance quality and kernel physical dimensions 5 conclusion alternate weeting and drying improved the milling recovery as well as grain quality and reduced the mercury uptake under transplanted rice and dry direct seeded rice for both rice cultivars cultivar basmati 515 outperformed in transplanted system in terms of milling recovery as compared to chenab basmati while chenab basmati performed better in dry direct seeded rice in case of quality traits and reduced mercury uptake this study revealed that the high yielding cultivars developed for the conventional continuous flooded transplanted rice system or continuous flooded dry direct seeded rice system could still perform well under alternate wetting and drying a water saving irrigation system moreover alternate wetting and drying also has potential to improve the rice quality
