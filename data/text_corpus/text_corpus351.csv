1755,suspended sediment discharge ssd in the yangtze river yr plays a crucial role in transporting nutrients and sediment to the yr estuaries and the east china sea in order to gather information on suspended sediment concentration ssc and ssd across an entire river cross section we investigated a novel method supported by coastal acoustic tomography cat consequently two cat systems were employed to estimate the cross section averaged ssc and ssd at the datong dt station of the yr over approximately 2 5 years low 0 02 kg m3 high 0 44 kg m3 and mean 0 10 kg m3 ssc values were successfully estimated the ssd was primarily driven by water discharge exhibiting low values 204 kg s during the dry season and a maximum of 36 299 kg s during flood events with the mean value of 3 903 kg s throughout the observation period the water sample and cat results demonstrated high consistency with correlation coefficients r2 of 0 92 for ssc between the water sample and cat results and 0 96 for ssd between the dt result and cat results this study established the ability to monitor transect ssc and ssd in the yr using the cat sound attenuation approach offering the advantage of continuous real time monitoring of transect river flow ssc and ssd even during extreme flood events for the success of this method factors such as particle size sound frequency selection and the measurable distance between instruments must be meticulously considered this work highlights the potential of cat for monitoring riverine transect ssc and ssd keywords coastal acoustic tomography suspended sediment concentration suspended sediment discharge yangtze river data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction river suspended sediment concentration ssc is one of the primary factors for determining the amount of suspended sediment discharge ssd transferred to marginal seas guo et al 2018 tian et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 ssd is a function of water discharge and ssc therefore accurate measurements of ssc and ssd are key to understanding land ocean interactions dijkstra et al 2019 ralston et al 2020 generally functional relationships between water discharge and ssc such as sediment rating curves are employed in rivers turowski et al 2010 vračar and mijić 2011 wang et al 2008 however measuring ssc remains a challenging task in rivers due to the absence of general and unequivocal relationships between water discharge and ssc aleixo et al 2020 necessitating frequent calibration for different areas seasons or years unfortunately the traditional water sampling method for determining ssc is a challenging and time consuming task especially during massive flood periods in large rivers continuous and long term observation of ssc at a fixed site is also impractical due to the time consuming process of field campaigns and laboratory analyses aleixo et al 2020 vercruysse et al 2017 to address this issue studies over the past few decades have employed indirect approaches and techniques to estimate ssc such as light or sound attenuation and sound scattering guerrero and di federico 2018 haught et al 2017 kawanisi and yokosi 1997 merckelbach and ridderinkhof 2006 moura et al 2011 the measurement of ssc using acoustic backscatter following the progress made in the development of acoustic doppler current profilers adcps and horizontal adcps h adcps has become one of the most significant achievements of these studies these methods can continuously document the variations of ssc in rivers xiao et al 2020 however they face difficulties in capturing the cross section variability of ssc in rivers due to the limited measurement range of adcp 1 300 m nihei and kimizu 2008 h adcp can cover the entire cross section of small river systems since these cross sections are narrow however this becomes challenging for large river systems although the moving adcp method can obtain transect information these measurements rely on short duration observations from boats and are labor intensive in particular field observations are difficult and hazardous during extreme floods cross section measurements of suspended sediment are crucial parameters for estimating the suspended sediment load through a specific gauging section therefore due to the disadvantages of conventional observations directly obtaining cross section suspended sediment data remains a problem regardless of river size coastal acoustic tomography cat was proposed as an innovative method kaneko et al 2020 for measuring water currents and discharge kawanisi et al 2017 zhu et al 2012 and has been extensively used in tidal rivers and estuaries two recent studies verified the feasibility and performance of applying cat to gauge water discharge at the datong dt station of the yangtze river yr xiao et al 2022 zhu et al 2021 two extreme flood events were successfully described with one peak discharge exceeding 80 000 m3 s and the roles of the three gorges dam tgd and rainfall in water discharge were discussed the dt station is approximately 630 km upstream of the yr estuary and 1 100 km downstream of the tgd numerous previous studies focusing on the suspended sediment transport of the yr the largest river in china have primarily investigated the source of suspended sediments and identified historical declines in ssd and ssc dai lu 2014 dai et al 2018 dai liu 2013 guo et al 2018 the suspended sediment data used in these studies were mainly provided by the changjiang river water conservancy committee crwcc which belongs to the ministry of water conservancy of china mwcc and were obtained from water samples these samples were taken at a fixed gauging section water discharge was recorded during specific time slots and the daily monthly and annual ssc and ssd passing through the measured section were derived guo et al 2020 due to the limitations of measuring ssc and ssd with water samples it is understood that this task is highly time labor and cost intensive furthermore it is well known that cat can continuously monitor cross section flow velocity and water discharge however the acoustic signals received in cat can be affected by suspended sediment attenuation it has been demonstrated that suspended sediment attenuation is strongly related to suspended clay and silt sediments moore et al 2013 while coarser sand sized suspended sediment tends to be related substantially more strongly to acoustic backscatter than attenuation hanes 2012 this concept allows for two independent relations that could estimate fine and coarse suspended sediment concentration and load respectively haught et al 2017 therefore the main purpose of this study was to develop methods based on sound attenuation between two cat stations for real time continuous measurement of cross section ssc and ssd in the yr using cat for studying ssc or ssd is advantageous as it provides cross sectional results enables long term monitoring and is not labor intensive moreover the instrumentation can be calibrated and widely applied in different environments 2 coastal acoustic tomography basics 2 1 measurement of the cross and depth averaged velocity by coastal acoustic tomography the cat system kaneko et al 2020 is an advanced hydroacoustic system developed to monitor section averaged velocity in coastal areas chen et al 2021 zhang et al 2015 2017 zhu et al 2017 2022 and streamflow in riverine environments zhu et al 2021 the theory of cat is based on the sound travel time method between two acoustic stations the sound travel time t i along the ith reciprocal ray path γ between two cat stations can be written as 1 t i γ ds c 0 δ c v n i where represents the direction of sound propagation c0 represents the reference sound speed δc indicates the sound speed deviation relative to c0 v is the water velocity ni denotes the unit vector along the ray and ds is the increment of the arc length along the ray assuming the same reciprocal travel path and that δ c c 0 1 then the travel time difference can be expressed as 2 δ t i t i t i 2 v n c 0 2 d s 2 l i v i c i 2 thus the section average velocity can be expressed as 3 v i c i 2 2 l i δ t i where li is the length of the ith ray path and v i and c i 2 represent the section averaged velocity and the sound speed along the ith ray path respectively cat is equipped with gps receivers which provide high precision standard frequency 10 mhz and accurate timing pulses 1 hz essential for maintaining and ensuring that both systems run simultaneously zheng et al 1997 1998 the acoustic pulse is modulated by pseudo random signals m sequence and gold sequence the m sequence maximum length sequence is a type of pseudo random sequence and is applied to increase the receiver s signal to noise ratio snr zheng et al 1997 1998 the processing gain is calculated by taking the 10 times logarithm of the m sequence length zheng et al 1997 1998 2 2 field observation of coastal acoustic tomography at datong station transect velocity and discharge gauging were performed at the dt station from july 2018 to january 2021 fig 1 an overview of the observation site and the placement of two cat systems is presented in fig 1b the horizontal distance between two stations n and s was 3 015 m and the angle between the n s transect and the main flow direction was approximately 31 7 the details of the cat setting can be found in previous studies xiao et al 2022 zhu et al 2021 the cat system was mounted on a floating barge at n and s stations and the transducers were suspended approximately 2 m underwater by iron chains acoustic signals of 9 khz were transmitted simultaneously between two transducers every 5 min and the m sequence of 11th order was used during the observation 3 acoustic estimation algorithm methodology similar to the cross and depth averaged velocity method the ssc deviation between the reciprocal travel paths was derived in this study to estimate the cross and depth averaged ssc hence an important task for this method with cat is to establish the relationship between the signal to noise ratio snr and sound attenuation induced by ssc within the determined distance the following is a detailed description of the fundamentals of the cat estimation algorithm for the cross and depth averaged ssc and the determination of the sound attenuation coefficient 3 1 acoustic estimation algorithm of suspended sediment concentration the received acoustic signals are attenuated by the suspended sediment hence the signal to noise ratio snr analysis is the key step to obtain the relevant data referring to the sonar equation urick 1983 the snr of the received level rl at one of the cat stations is written as 4 snr sl pl tl nl where sl represents the source level db pl is the spreading loss db tl represents the transmission loss db and nl is the noise level db eq 4 can be expressed as 5 snr s l 20 l o g r α r l 0 n l where 20 l o g r is the spreading loss db r represents the distance from the acoustic station m α is the absorption coefficient db km α r denotes the transmission loss due to water and suspended sediment absorption db and l 0 is other transmission loss which primarily results from the reflection and interference of the bed and water db for the cat observations the m sequence technique was utilized to amplify the received sound levels to describe the snr from station n to s snr ns and station s to n snr sn eq 5 was further modified as 6 snr ns s l 20 l o g r α ns r l 0 n l g p 7 snr sn s l 20 l o g r α sn r l 0 n l g p where nl denotes the total noise level mainly composed of ambient and system noises and gp represents the processing gain resulting from the m sequence one period m sequence was used as a transmitted signal and after the auto correlation procedure the snr can be improved by 2n 1 times for the m sequence of the nth order in this study gp was 10 log 10 2 11 1 33 1 db in eqs 6 and 7 α ns and α sn represent the total absorption coefficients which are the sum of the sound attenuation including water absorption α w and suspended sediment absorption α s generally α w is mostly related to the sound frequency and can be estimated as follows yamaguchi et al 2005 8 α w 3 3 10 3 0 11 f 2 1 f 2 44 f 2 4100 f 2 3 10 4 f 2 where f is frequency hz in this study α w was approximately 24 34 db km with a frequency of 9 khz meanwhile α s is related to the ssc and can be estimated as thorne and hanes 2002 thorne and hurther 2014 9 α s 1 r 0 r ξ s s c r d r where ξ denotes the suspended sediment attenuation constant db m2 kg r denotes the distance from the acoustic source m and ssc r represents the suspended sediment concentration at certain distance from the acoustic source kg m3 owing to the lack of suspended sediment size distribution data in the river cross section along the ray path between the two cat stations the suspended sediment size cannot be clearly distinguished along the ray path here we use the mean value to represent the cross section equation 9 can be further simplified as 10 α s ξ s s c where α s represents the total cross section absorption coefficient and s s c represents the cross sectional averaged suspended sediment concentration hence eqs 6 and 7 can be expressed as 11 snr ns s l 20 l o g c ns t ns α wns α sns c ns t ns l 0 n l g p 12 snr sn s l 20 l o g c sn t sn α wsn α ssn c sn t sn l 0 n l g p where c ns and c sn represent the sound speed from station n to s and s to n t ns and t sn represent the sound travel time from station n to s and s to n similar to the velocity method calculated by the reciprocal travel path during each transmission sl l 0 and nl were assumed to be the same the snr difference between the reciprocal ray paths can be written as 13 snr ns snr sn 20 l o g c ns t ns α wns α sns c ns t ns 20 l o g c sn t sn α wsn α ssn c sn t sn 20 l o g c sn t sn c ns t ns α wns α sns c ns t ns α wsn α ssn c sn t sn thus eqs 10 and 13 can be rewritten as 14 snr ns snr sn 20 l o g c sn t sn c ns t ns α wns c ns t ns α wsn c sn t sn ξ ssc ns c ns t ns ξ ssc sn c sn t sn where ssc ns and ssc sn represent the cross averaged ssc from station n to s and s to n ssc is defined as the amount of suspended sediment contained in a unit of water at a specific time with respect to the present study it can be written as 15 ssc ns 0 n ns 0 t ns s s t d n d t t ns 16 ssc sn 0 n sn 0 t sn s s t d n d t t sn where n ns and n sn denote the amount of suspended sediment ss from station n to s and s to n respectively since the two way ray path was reciprocal and in the order of δ c c 0 1 and t c 0 1 it can be assumed that c ns t ns c sn t ns eq 14 can be further simplified as 17 snr ns snr sn ξ ssc ns r ξ ssc sn r the travel time along the ray path differs from station n to s and s to n and the amount of suspended sediment also varies due to the distinct travel time and velocity effect therefore ssc ns ssc sn and the cross section ssc deviation can be expressed as 18 ssc sn ssc ns δ s s c snr ns snr sn ξ r subsequently to estimate s s c eq 18 can be further modified as 19 s s c snr ns snr sn ξ r ssc 0 where the first term on the right side is the cross section ssc deviation which is mostly induced by river flow discharge indicates the absolute value the rationale for this is that the ssc is scalar and the river flow is always uni directional from upstream to downstream although the dt station is a recognized location of the upper limit of the tidal river streamflow is not influenced by the tide for the ssc estimation the snr difference only represents the ssc deviation during each transmission thus a reference ssc is needed no single reference value can be used for large timescales in the yr e g the mean ssc during winter and summer are different in this study since ssc 0 represents the reference ssc which was calculated using the daily mean ssc and discharge at the dt station using the sediment rating curve method wang et al 2008 as shown in fig 2 the sediment rating curve cannot accurately estimate the ssc at the dt station however it was applied here to provide the reference ssc and help the readers understand the ssc basics s s c in eq 19 represents the ssc along the n s transect the s s c presented in the following results section 4 2 of this paper were projected onto the transect perpendicular to the riverbank yellow line in fig 1b from the angle between the n s transect and the northern riverbank 3 2 acoustic attenuation coefficient the suspended sediment attenuation constant ξ db m2 kg consists of two components viscous absorption ξ v and scattering loss ξ s ha et al 2011 ξ s is primarily influenced by the suspended sediment size while viscous absorption ξ v is influenced by both water and suspended sediment size the attenuation constant components ξ s and ξ v can be estimated using the following equations 20 ξ s 1 ρ s a s γ k a s 4 1 k a s 2 4 3 γ k a s 4 ξ v k σ 1 2 2 ρ s s s 2 σ δ 2 21 σ ρ s ρ s 9 4 β a s 1 1 β a s δ 1 2 1 9 2 β a s β ω 2 v where k represents the acoustic wavenumber ρ s and a s represent the density and radius of the suspended particle respectively ν is the kinematic viscosity of water and ω is the angular frequency of the incident pressure wave for quartz particles γ 0 18 the suspended sediment size distributions from 2018 to 2020 at the dt station are presented in fig 3 a the suspended sediment was water sampled between one and several times each month and the results were shared by the crwcc the suspended sediment size distribution revealed the presence of sand silt and clay with the curve s flat slope indicating presence of fine particles the suspended sediment primarily consisted of silt furthermore the suspended sediment size distributions revealed a higher medium particle size d50 during flood seasons may and june and a lower d50 during dry seasons january fig 3a the attenuation constant varied with the suspended sediment size for the frequency of 9 khz as shown in fig 3b and was estimated using eqs 20 and 21 scattering loss ξ s contributes to the attenuation constant for large particles with sizes 3 6 mm while viscous absorption ξ v is a significant component of the total constant for fine grained particles with sizes 3 6 mm the annual average d50 of suspended sediment at the dt station in 2018 2019 and 2020 were 0 013 0 0038 mm 0 026 0 020 mm and 0 021 0 017 mm respectively the total sediment attenuation constant ξ during 2018 2020 is represented by the black lines in fig 3b and was estimated from the average d50 and a frequency of 9 khz the constant was 0 0126 0 0113 0 0139 db m2 kg in 2018 0 0086 0 0066 0 0146 db m2 kg in 2019 and 0 0099 0 0056 0 0146 db m2 kg in 2020 3 3 determining the ray path based on the aforementioned estimation algorithm acoustic rays traversing the entire water layer with improved snr data are necessary to estimate the cross sectional and depth averaged ssc consequently ray simulations were performed separately for winter and summer using two typical sound speed profiles with sound angles varying by 0 1 increments from 10 to 10 the simulation results are depicted in fig 4 direct paths with angles around 0 arrive first however they constitute only 10 of the simulation rays resulting in weak superimposed energy paths with multiple reflections 80 ranging from two to six times dominate the simulation results since multiple rays are superimposed to form a high snr peak and the ray path of the largest peak is relatively stable the acoustic rays travel almost the entire transect cross section with similar reciprocal travel paths fig 4 thus to obtain better ray path and snr data the largest peaks were selected and utilized in this study as a result the measurements observed by cat were assumed to represent the cross sectional and depth averaged results along the ray path additionally since the acoustic signals propagating between the two stations were primarily attenuated by water and suspended sediment absorption eqs 4 18 in section 3 1 the measured snr could be converted to cross sectional and depth averaged ssc deviations 4 result 4 1 time series of signal to noise ratio fig 5 displays an example diagram of the snrs received at stations n and s during november 2019 the time series of reciprocal snr are shown in fig 5c the snr ranged from 14 to 22 db during the observation period generally a low snr appeared during the flood seasons and due to the presence of higher ssc during flood periods the sound attenuation induced by ssc reduced the snr of cat with the mean snr being approximately 16 db during the observation period a minimum snr of 14 db was observed during two massive floods july 2019 and 2020 the time series of acoustic travel time were obtained using the peak snr method in this study and section averaged flow velocities were presented in a previous study by zhu et al 2021 the travel time and flow velocity ranged from 1 99 to 2 09 s and 0 45 to 2 m s respectively 4 2 time series of suspended sediment concentration and suspended sediment discharge at datong station fig 6 a illustrates the cross sectional average ssc and ssd estimated by cat for a period of 2 5 years the s s c ranged from 0 02 to 0 44 kg m3 and exhibited a noticeable seasonal variation fig 6a the ssd was obtained as the product of s s c and river discharge the water discharge was also estimated by cat details and performance of the cat method for estimating discharge can be found in previous studies xiao et al 2022 zhu et al 2021 similar to the pattern of ssc ssd was primarily driven by river discharge exhibiting low values approximately 204 kg s during winter while the maximum ssd reached up to 36 299 kg s during summer fig 6a with a mean value of 3 903 kg s for the observation period measurements of ssc at the dt station were conducted daily and shared by the crwcc the concentrations defined as the dry mass of particles per unit volume of water were measured using a standard gravimetric technique involving water sample collection on site filtration and laboratory weighing comparisons ssc and ssd of daily crwcc water sample results and daily cat results are presented in fig 6a 6e although some inconsistencies exist the ssc estimated by cat is in good agreement with the water sample results obtained by crwcc with a correlation coefficient r2 of 0 92 and a root mean square error rmse of 0 025 kg m3 additionally there is high consistency between the cat and water sample results obtained by crwcc for ssd with r2 0 96 and rmse 1 185 kg s the daily ssc exhibited a clear seasonal variation with ssc fluctuating from 0 02 to 0 37 kg m3 and a mean value of 0 10 kg m3 the mean sscs were 0 13 kg m3 and 0 06 kg m3 during the flood and dry seasons respectively for the ssd which was directly driven by water discharges the mean ssd for flood and dry seasons were 5 975 kg s and 1 517 kg s respectively the crwcc reported that the total annual suspended sediment load ssl at the dt station was 1 05 million tons in 2019 and 1 64 million tons in 2020 in this study the total annual ssl in 2019 and 2020 estimated by cat were 1 04 and 1 66 million tons respectively both methods presented similar results proving the accuracy and feasibility of the cat method in monitoring ssc and ssd 5 discussion 5 1 effect of suspended sediment size on suspended sediment concentration estimation by coastal acoustic tomography variability in s s c in eq 19 primarily resulted from the estimations of the range r between the two stations and the constant of total sediment attenuation ξ the range r was calculated from the sound travel time and sound speed r varied from 3 000 to 3 050 m during the observation period and the mean value was 3 015 m a 50 m deviation only resulted in a 1 6 deviation from the distance of 3 015 m which would eventually lead to an uncertainty of s s c 1 6 in contrast to r the estimation of the total sediment attenuation constant ξ significantly influenced the s s c results as illustrated in fig 7 since the notable difference in ssc between the dry and wet seasons consisted of the ssc during the dry season being largely 0 1 kg m3 fig 6b two cases were tested to reveal the influence of ξ in the dry and wet seasons regardless of high or low ssc suspended sediment size or ξ considerably affected the estimate of concentration as indicated by the green lines in fig 7 ξ varied from 0 0126 db m2 kg 0 013 mm in 2018 to 0 0086 db m2 kg 0 026 mm in 2019 and to 0 0099 db m2 kg 0 021 mm in 2020 and the relative differences of s s c induced by the variations of ξ ranged from 5 to 30 fig 7 the accurate estimation of ξ is a prerequisite for the precise estimation of ssc by cat which implies that the suspended sediment size distribution must be accurately monitored it is particularly important to precisely quantify the suspended sediment size distribution along the transect 5 2 effect of sound frequency on suspended sediment concentration estimation by coastal acoustic tomography generally hydroacoustical approaches to estimate ssc or suspended sediment size are derived from sonar equations which model the relationships between a distinct acoustic frequency and ssc or suspended sediment size in the water column thorne and hanes 2002 thorne and hurther 2014 this is achieved by finding unequivocal relations between acoustic signal indices and metrics of ssc or suspended sediment size distribution ha et al 2011 thorne and hurther 2014 for instance sediment concentration can influence backscatter and sediment attenuation can affect sound levels cat was designed for observing small scale ocean dynamic phenomena in coastal seas typically the central frequency of cat is 10 khz to assess the performance of different cat frequencies in estimating transect ssc three cases were considered to represent low 0 05 kg m3 medium 0 1 kg m3 and high 0 4 kg m3 ssc relative to the cat central frequency from 4 to 10 khz at 3 km as presented in fig 8 fig 8a displays the total attenuation constants ξ for frequencies between 4 and 10 khz as in the previous section 3 2 the annual average d50 of suspended sediments in 2018 2019 and 2020 are marked by black dashed lines higher frequencies corresponded to larger attenuation constants indicating a more significant effect induced by water and suspended sediment fig 8a furthermore the primary task of ssc inversion by cat is the estimation of the absorption coefficient α which is the sum of sound attenuation resulting from suspended sediment α s and water absorption α w for the same central frequency as the ssc decreased α w became more dominant than α s and the difference in the attenuation coefficient between water and suspended sediment declined in terms of frequency as the ssc decreased the advantage of high frequency systems became apparent fig 8c 8d this assessment provides a method to examine or select appropriate acoustic systems for cross sectional s s c estimation in riverine or estuarine environments as illustrated in fig 8c 8d at low ssc in situ monitoring using low frequency cat is nearly unreliable as the absorption attenuation induced by suspended sediment is weak considering the actual range of ssc variations and selecting the applicable frequency of cat are necessary for successfully monitoring s s c 5 3 discussion of applicable measure distance for suspended sediment concentration estimation by coastal acoustic tomography as indicated in eqs 6 and 7 the range between cat stations and the characteristics of suspended sediment affect the snr of cat the range r can be estimated based on eqs 6 or 7 by assuming different absorption coefficients α and various s s c values the source level sl of cat was set to 192 198 db zheng et al 1998 and l0 was assumed to be approximately 15 db zheng et al 1998 vračar and mijić 2011 studied the ambient noise in three large european rivers for frequencies ranging from 5 hz to 20 khz and reported that the ambient noise fluctuated from approximately 45 to 105 db consequently based on the daily results of this study the noise level nl was approximately 41 5 db as estimated from eqs 6 and 7 during our observation period ssc varied from 0 05 to 0 4 kg m3 thus different cases representing low 0 01 0 05 kg m3 medium 0 1 kg m3 and high 0 4 kg m3 s s c values relative to the cat central frequency of 9 khz were used in this study fig 9 illustrates the results of effective distance vs snr for different average s s c values with 9 khz at a suspended sediment size of 0 020 mm observations conducted at 9 khz were physically unreasonable where the distance exceeded 4 2 km in this study the snr threshold was set to 14 db to select the arrival peak implying that the applicable distance should be 3 5 4 2 km for ssc monitoring by cat at 9 khz in the yr at the dt station the distance calculated from the sound travel time and speed varied from 3 000 to 3 050 m during the observation period demonstrating that such a setting laid the foundation for the s s c results of this study cat was designed to observe small scale ocean dynamic phenomena in coastal areas but many previous studies have successfully applied it to different environments chen et al 2017 syamsudin et al 2019 yamaguchi et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 zhu et al 2022 zhu et al 2017 typically a central frequency of 5 khz is used in coastal areas the applicable distances of the 5 khz cat are also presented here fig 9 compared to the 9 khz system the 5 khz system could cover wider areas such as the yr estuary additionally the effects of the m sequence are presented in fig 9 although a higher m sequence leads to higher processing gain snr the resultant distance increase is 10 for example in the case of high average s s c 0 4 kg m3 the maximum distance increase was approximately 0 5 km while m9 increased to m11 this study both presents a method to estimate ssc using cat and provides information on the effects of various parameters e g ssc m sequence frequency and distance that offer guidance for conducting optimal environmental monitoring with cat under different conditions 5 4 overview of the suspended sediment discharge at datong station and the coastal acoustic tomography approach since the 1990 s variations in ssd in the yr have attracted significant attention chen et al 2001 observed a decreasing trend in sediment load at the dt station furthermore yang et al 2002 noted that ssd began to decrease in the 1970 s primarily due to the impact of the danjiankou dam yang et al 2006 demonstrated that ssd at the dt station decreased in three distinct phases 1 from 1969 mainly due to the danjiangkou dam 2 from 1986 largely because of human activities in the river basin such as dam construction and soil conservation 3 from 2003 following the completion of the tgd which has significantly regulated river flow and sediment budget in the middle and lower reaches of the yr since then sedimentary processes along the entire yr have been considerably altered by the tgd and issues associated with the tgd have become the primary focus of yr studies continuous tracking of ssd has always been a critical aspect of yr management here the cat method was applied at the dt station to estimate ssc and ssd enabling continuous real time monitoring of cross sectional data kawanisi et al 2017 first employed the acoustic tomography approach to estimate cross sectional averaged ssc during tidal bores in the qiantang river however their study neglected changes in sediment size limited the observation period to several hours or days and did not thoroughly verify the performance of the cat method in the present work variations in sediment size were taken into account for ssc estimation and long term monitoring over 2 5 years was conducted moreover the results were validated providing valuable guidance for future research 6 conclusion an acoustic approach for monitoring cross sectional ssc and ssd based on sound attenuation using cat proved to be practical for the yangtze river yr at the datong dt station the most significant achievement was the successful acquisition of realistic estimations of cross sectional averaged ssc and ssd using cat at the observation sites to continuously monitor the suspended sediment of the yr two synchronized cat instruments were placed at the dt station from july 2018 to january 2021 during this 2 5 year period the 5 minute interval ssc ranged from 0 02 to 0 44 kg m3 with a mean ssc of 0 11 kg m3 the ssd varied from 204 kg s in winter to 36 299 kg s in summer the total annual suspended sediment load estimated by cat was 1 04 and 1 66 million tons in 2019 and 2020 respectively when compared with the daily ssc directly determined by water samples our results had an r2 of 0 92 and an rmse of 0 025 kg m3 both ssc and ssd showed high consistency between the cat results and water samples analyzed by crwcc notably cat is equipped with wireless transmission capabilities enabling real time monitoring of ssc and ssd sensitivity experiments of suspended sediment size and sound frequency revealed the advantages and disadvantages of the cat method the results demonstrated that different suspended sediment sizes directly determine the role of viscous absorption and scattering loss which significantly influenced the estimation of ssc by cat additionally the choice of sound frequency is a key factor for estimating ssc with cat because of differences in high and low frequency responses to attenuation and absorption of water and suspended sediment the arrangement of cat sites measurement distance was also found to be important for ssc inversion this study suggests an acoustic approach that relies on cat for continuous and real time observation of cross sectional averaged ssc and ssd in large rivers consequently the use of cat over extended periods e g decades to observe different parameters water discharge ssc and ssd is feasible and should be implemented to test the cat method under various flow regimes tidal rivers and suspended sediment loads credit authorship contribution statement cong xiao methodology conceptualization data curation writing original draft software xiao hua

1755,suspended sediment discharge ssd in the yangtze river yr plays a crucial role in transporting nutrients and sediment to the yr estuaries and the east china sea in order to gather information on suspended sediment concentration ssc and ssd across an entire river cross section we investigated a novel method supported by coastal acoustic tomography cat consequently two cat systems were employed to estimate the cross section averaged ssc and ssd at the datong dt station of the yr over approximately 2 5 years low 0 02 kg m3 high 0 44 kg m3 and mean 0 10 kg m3 ssc values were successfully estimated the ssd was primarily driven by water discharge exhibiting low values 204 kg s during the dry season and a maximum of 36 299 kg s during flood events with the mean value of 3 903 kg s throughout the observation period the water sample and cat results demonstrated high consistency with correlation coefficients r2 of 0 92 for ssc between the water sample and cat results and 0 96 for ssd between the dt result and cat results this study established the ability to monitor transect ssc and ssd in the yr using the cat sound attenuation approach offering the advantage of continuous real time monitoring of transect river flow ssc and ssd even during extreme flood events for the success of this method factors such as particle size sound frequency selection and the measurable distance between instruments must be meticulously considered this work highlights the potential of cat for monitoring riverine transect ssc and ssd keywords coastal acoustic tomography suspended sediment concentration suspended sediment discharge yangtze river data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction river suspended sediment concentration ssc is one of the primary factors for determining the amount of suspended sediment discharge ssd transferred to marginal seas guo et al 2018 tian et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 ssd is a function of water discharge and ssc therefore accurate measurements of ssc and ssd are key to understanding land ocean interactions dijkstra et al 2019 ralston et al 2020 generally functional relationships between water discharge and ssc such as sediment rating curves are employed in rivers turowski et al 2010 vračar and mijić 2011 wang et al 2008 however measuring ssc remains a challenging task in rivers due to the absence of general and unequivocal relationships between water discharge and ssc aleixo et al 2020 necessitating frequent calibration for different areas seasons or years unfortunately the traditional water sampling method for determining ssc is a challenging and time consuming task especially during massive flood periods in large rivers continuous and long term observation of ssc at a fixed site is also impractical due to the time consuming process of field campaigns and laboratory analyses aleixo et al 2020 vercruysse et al 2017 to address this issue studies over the past few decades have employed indirect approaches and techniques to estimate ssc such as light or sound attenuation and sound scattering guerrero and di federico 2018 haught et al 2017 kawanisi and yokosi 1997 merckelbach and ridderinkhof 2006 moura et al 2011 the measurement of ssc using acoustic backscatter following the progress made in the development of acoustic doppler current profilers adcps and horizontal adcps h adcps has become one of the most significant achievements of these studies these methods can continuously document the variations of ssc in rivers xiao et al 2020 however they face difficulties in capturing the cross section variability of ssc in rivers due to the limited measurement range of adcp 1 300 m nihei and kimizu 2008 h adcp can cover the entire cross section of small river systems since these cross sections are narrow however this becomes challenging for large river systems although the moving adcp method can obtain transect information these measurements rely on short duration observations from boats and are labor intensive in particular field observations are difficult and hazardous during extreme floods cross section measurements of suspended sediment are crucial parameters for estimating the suspended sediment load through a specific gauging section therefore due to the disadvantages of conventional observations directly obtaining cross section suspended sediment data remains a problem regardless of river size coastal acoustic tomography cat was proposed as an innovative method kaneko et al 2020 for measuring water currents and discharge kawanisi et al 2017 zhu et al 2012 and has been extensively used in tidal rivers and estuaries two recent studies verified the feasibility and performance of applying cat to gauge water discharge at the datong dt station of the yangtze river yr xiao et al 2022 zhu et al 2021 two extreme flood events were successfully described with one peak discharge exceeding 80 000 m3 s and the roles of the three gorges dam tgd and rainfall in water discharge were discussed the dt station is approximately 630 km upstream of the yr estuary and 1 100 km downstream of the tgd numerous previous studies focusing on the suspended sediment transport of the yr the largest river in china have primarily investigated the source of suspended sediments and identified historical declines in ssd and ssc dai lu 2014 dai et al 2018 dai liu 2013 guo et al 2018 the suspended sediment data used in these studies were mainly provided by the changjiang river water conservancy committee crwcc which belongs to the ministry of water conservancy of china mwcc and were obtained from water samples these samples were taken at a fixed gauging section water discharge was recorded during specific time slots and the daily monthly and annual ssc and ssd passing through the measured section were derived guo et al 2020 due to the limitations of measuring ssc and ssd with water samples it is understood that this task is highly time labor and cost intensive furthermore it is well known that cat can continuously monitor cross section flow velocity and water discharge however the acoustic signals received in cat can be affected by suspended sediment attenuation it has been demonstrated that suspended sediment attenuation is strongly related to suspended clay and silt sediments moore et al 2013 while coarser sand sized suspended sediment tends to be related substantially more strongly to acoustic backscatter than attenuation hanes 2012 this concept allows for two independent relations that could estimate fine and coarse suspended sediment concentration and load respectively haught et al 2017 therefore the main purpose of this study was to develop methods based on sound attenuation between two cat stations for real time continuous measurement of cross section ssc and ssd in the yr using cat for studying ssc or ssd is advantageous as it provides cross sectional results enables long term monitoring and is not labor intensive moreover the instrumentation can be calibrated and widely applied in different environments 2 coastal acoustic tomography basics 2 1 measurement of the cross and depth averaged velocity by coastal acoustic tomography the cat system kaneko et al 2020 is an advanced hydroacoustic system developed to monitor section averaged velocity in coastal areas chen et al 2021 zhang et al 2015 2017 zhu et al 2017 2022 and streamflow in riverine environments zhu et al 2021 the theory of cat is based on the sound travel time method between two acoustic stations the sound travel time t i along the ith reciprocal ray path γ between two cat stations can be written as 1 t i γ ds c 0 δ c v n i where represents the direction of sound propagation c0 represents the reference sound speed δc indicates the sound speed deviation relative to c0 v is the water velocity ni denotes the unit vector along the ray and ds is the increment of the arc length along the ray assuming the same reciprocal travel path and that δ c c 0 1 then the travel time difference can be expressed as 2 δ t i t i t i 2 v n c 0 2 d s 2 l i v i c i 2 thus the section average velocity can be expressed as 3 v i c i 2 2 l i δ t i where li is the length of the ith ray path and v i and c i 2 represent the section averaged velocity and the sound speed along the ith ray path respectively cat is equipped with gps receivers which provide high precision standard frequency 10 mhz and accurate timing pulses 1 hz essential for maintaining and ensuring that both systems run simultaneously zheng et al 1997 1998 the acoustic pulse is modulated by pseudo random signals m sequence and gold sequence the m sequence maximum length sequence is a type of pseudo random sequence and is applied to increase the receiver s signal to noise ratio snr zheng et al 1997 1998 the processing gain is calculated by taking the 10 times logarithm of the m sequence length zheng et al 1997 1998 2 2 field observation of coastal acoustic tomography at datong station transect velocity and discharge gauging were performed at the dt station from july 2018 to january 2021 fig 1 an overview of the observation site and the placement of two cat systems is presented in fig 1b the horizontal distance between two stations n and s was 3 015 m and the angle between the n s transect and the main flow direction was approximately 31 7 the details of the cat setting can be found in previous studies xiao et al 2022 zhu et al 2021 the cat system was mounted on a floating barge at n and s stations and the transducers were suspended approximately 2 m underwater by iron chains acoustic signals of 9 khz were transmitted simultaneously between two transducers every 5 min and the m sequence of 11th order was used during the observation 3 acoustic estimation algorithm methodology similar to the cross and depth averaged velocity method the ssc deviation between the reciprocal travel paths was derived in this study to estimate the cross and depth averaged ssc hence an important task for this method with cat is to establish the relationship between the signal to noise ratio snr and sound attenuation induced by ssc within the determined distance the following is a detailed description of the fundamentals of the cat estimation algorithm for the cross and depth averaged ssc and the determination of the sound attenuation coefficient 3 1 acoustic estimation algorithm of suspended sediment concentration the received acoustic signals are attenuated by the suspended sediment hence the signal to noise ratio snr analysis is the key step to obtain the relevant data referring to the sonar equation urick 1983 the snr of the received level rl at one of the cat stations is written as 4 snr sl pl tl nl where sl represents the source level db pl is the spreading loss db tl represents the transmission loss db and nl is the noise level db eq 4 can be expressed as 5 snr s l 20 l o g r α r l 0 n l where 20 l o g r is the spreading loss db r represents the distance from the acoustic station m α is the absorption coefficient db km α r denotes the transmission loss due to water and suspended sediment absorption db and l 0 is other transmission loss which primarily results from the reflection and interference of the bed and water db for the cat observations the m sequence technique was utilized to amplify the received sound levels to describe the snr from station n to s snr ns and station s to n snr sn eq 5 was further modified as 6 snr ns s l 20 l o g r α ns r l 0 n l g p 7 snr sn s l 20 l o g r α sn r l 0 n l g p where nl denotes the total noise level mainly composed of ambient and system noises and gp represents the processing gain resulting from the m sequence one period m sequence was used as a transmitted signal and after the auto correlation procedure the snr can be improved by 2n 1 times for the m sequence of the nth order in this study gp was 10 log 10 2 11 1 33 1 db in eqs 6 and 7 α ns and α sn represent the total absorption coefficients which are the sum of the sound attenuation including water absorption α w and suspended sediment absorption α s generally α w is mostly related to the sound frequency and can be estimated as follows yamaguchi et al 2005 8 α w 3 3 10 3 0 11 f 2 1 f 2 44 f 2 4100 f 2 3 10 4 f 2 where f is frequency hz in this study α w was approximately 24 34 db km with a frequency of 9 khz meanwhile α s is related to the ssc and can be estimated as thorne and hanes 2002 thorne and hurther 2014 9 α s 1 r 0 r ξ s s c r d r where ξ denotes the suspended sediment attenuation constant db m2 kg r denotes the distance from the acoustic source m and ssc r represents the suspended sediment concentration at certain distance from the acoustic source kg m3 owing to the lack of suspended sediment size distribution data in the river cross section along the ray path between the two cat stations the suspended sediment size cannot be clearly distinguished along the ray path here we use the mean value to represent the cross section equation 9 can be further simplified as 10 α s ξ s s c where α s represents the total cross section absorption coefficient and s s c represents the cross sectional averaged suspended sediment concentration hence eqs 6 and 7 can be expressed as 11 snr ns s l 20 l o g c ns t ns α wns α sns c ns t ns l 0 n l g p 12 snr sn s l 20 l o g c sn t sn α wsn α ssn c sn t sn l 0 n l g p where c ns and c sn represent the sound speed from station n to s and s to n t ns and t sn represent the sound travel time from station n to s and s to n similar to the velocity method calculated by the reciprocal travel path during each transmission sl l 0 and nl were assumed to be the same the snr difference between the reciprocal ray paths can be written as 13 snr ns snr sn 20 l o g c ns t ns α wns α sns c ns t ns 20 l o g c sn t sn α wsn α ssn c sn t sn 20 l o g c sn t sn c ns t ns α wns α sns c ns t ns α wsn α ssn c sn t sn thus eqs 10 and 13 can be rewritten as 14 snr ns snr sn 20 l o g c sn t sn c ns t ns α wns c ns t ns α wsn c sn t sn ξ ssc ns c ns t ns ξ ssc sn c sn t sn where ssc ns and ssc sn represent the cross averaged ssc from station n to s and s to n ssc is defined as the amount of suspended sediment contained in a unit of water at a specific time with respect to the present study it can be written as 15 ssc ns 0 n ns 0 t ns s s t d n d t t ns 16 ssc sn 0 n sn 0 t sn s s t d n d t t sn where n ns and n sn denote the amount of suspended sediment ss from station n to s and s to n respectively since the two way ray path was reciprocal and in the order of δ c c 0 1 and t c 0 1 it can be assumed that c ns t ns c sn t ns eq 14 can be further simplified as 17 snr ns snr sn ξ ssc ns r ξ ssc sn r the travel time along the ray path differs from station n to s and s to n and the amount of suspended sediment also varies due to the distinct travel time and velocity effect therefore ssc ns ssc sn and the cross section ssc deviation can be expressed as 18 ssc sn ssc ns δ s s c snr ns snr sn ξ r subsequently to estimate s s c eq 18 can be further modified as 19 s s c snr ns snr sn ξ r ssc 0 where the first term on the right side is the cross section ssc deviation which is mostly induced by river flow discharge indicates the absolute value the rationale for this is that the ssc is scalar and the river flow is always uni directional from upstream to downstream although the dt station is a recognized location of the upper limit of the tidal river streamflow is not influenced by the tide for the ssc estimation the snr difference only represents the ssc deviation during each transmission thus a reference ssc is needed no single reference value can be used for large timescales in the yr e g the mean ssc during winter and summer are different in this study since ssc 0 represents the reference ssc which was calculated using the daily mean ssc and discharge at the dt station using the sediment rating curve method wang et al 2008 as shown in fig 2 the sediment rating curve cannot accurately estimate the ssc at the dt station however it was applied here to provide the reference ssc and help the readers understand the ssc basics s s c in eq 19 represents the ssc along the n s transect the s s c presented in the following results section 4 2 of this paper were projected onto the transect perpendicular to the riverbank yellow line in fig 1b from the angle between the n s transect and the northern riverbank 3 2 acoustic attenuation coefficient the suspended sediment attenuation constant ξ db m2 kg consists of two components viscous absorption ξ v and scattering loss ξ s ha et al 2011 ξ s is primarily influenced by the suspended sediment size while viscous absorption ξ v is influenced by both water and suspended sediment size the attenuation constant components ξ s and ξ v can be estimated using the following equations 20 ξ s 1 ρ s a s γ k a s 4 1 k a s 2 4 3 γ k a s 4 ξ v k σ 1 2 2 ρ s s s 2 σ δ 2 21 σ ρ s ρ s 9 4 β a s 1 1 β a s δ 1 2 1 9 2 β a s β ω 2 v where k represents the acoustic wavenumber ρ s and a s represent the density and radius of the suspended particle respectively ν is the kinematic viscosity of water and ω is the angular frequency of the incident pressure wave for quartz particles γ 0 18 the suspended sediment size distributions from 2018 to 2020 at the dt station are presented in fig 3 a the suspended sediment was water sampled between one and several times each month and the results were shared by the crwcc the suspended sediment size distribution revealed the presence of sand silt and clay with the curve s flat slope indicating presence of fine particles the suspended sediment primarily consisted of silt furthermore the suspended sediment size distributions revealed a higher medium particle size d50 during flood seasons may and june and a lower d50 during dry seasons january fig 3a the attenuation constant varied with the suspended sediment size for the frequency of 9 khz as shown in fig 3b and was estimated using eqs 20 and 21 scattering loss ξ s contributes to the attenuation constant for large particles with sizes 3 6 mm while viscous absorption ξ v is a significant component of the total constant for fine grained particles with sizes 3 6 mm the annual average d50 of suspended sediment at the dt station in 2018 2019 and 2020 were 0 013 0 0038 mm 0 026 0 020 mm and 0 021 0 017 mm respectively the total sediment attenuation constant ξ during 2018 2020 is represented by the black lines in fig 3b and was estimated from the average d50 and a frequency of 9 khz the constant was 0 0126 0 0113 0 0139 db m2 kg in 2018 0 0086 0 0066 0 0146 db m2 kg in 2019 and 0 0099 0 0056 0 0146 db m2 kg in 2020 3 3 determining the ray path based on the aforementioned estimation algorithm acoustic rays traversing the entire water layer with improved snr data are necessary to estimate the cross sectional and depth averaged ssc consequently ray simulations were performed separately for winter and summer using two typical sound speed profiles with sound angles varying by 0 1 increments from 10 to 10 the simulation results are depicted in fig 4 direct paths with angles around 0 arrive first however they constitute only 10 of the simulation rays resulting in weak superimposed energy paths with multiple reflections 80 ranging from two to six times dominate the simulation results since multiple rays are superimposed to form a high snr peak and the ray path of the largest peak is relatively stable the acoustic rays travel almost the entire transect cross section with similar reciprocal travel paths fig 4 thus to obtain better ray path and snr data the largest peaks were selected and utilized in this study as a result the measurements observed by cat were assumed to represent the cross sectional and depth averaged results along the ray path additionally since the acoustic signals propagating between the two stations were primarily attenuated by water and suspended sediment absorption eqs 4 18 in section 3 1 the measured snr could be converted to cross sectional and depth averaged ssc deviations 4 result 4 1 time series of signal to noise ratio fig 5 displays an example diagram of the snrs received at stations n and s during november 2019 the time series of reciprocal snr are shown in fig 5c the snr ranged from 14 to 22 db during the observation period generally a low snr appeared during the flood seasons and due to the presence of higher ssc during flood periods the sound attenuation induced by ssc reduced the snr of cat with the mean snr being approximately 16 db during the observation period a minimum snr of 14 db was observed during two massive floods july 2019 and 2020 the time series of acoustic travel time were obtained using the peak snr method in this study and section averaged flow velocities were presented in a previous study by zhu et al 2021 the travel time and flow velocity ranged from 1 99 to 2 09 s and 0 45 to 2 m s respectively 4 2 time series of suspended sediment concentration and suspended sediment discharge at datong station fig 6 a illustrates the cross sectional average ssc and ssd estimated by cat for a period of 2 5 years the s s c ranged from 0 02 to 0 44 kg m3 and exhibited a noticeable seasonal variation fig 6a the ssd was obtained as the product of s s c and river discharge the water discharge was also estimated by cat details and performance of the cat method for estimating discharge can be found in previous studies xiao et al 2022 zhu et al 2021 similar to the pattern of ssc ssd was primarily driven by river discharge exhibiting low values approximately 204 kg s during winter while the maximum ssd reached up to 36 299 kg s during summer fig 6a with a mean value of 3 903 kg s for the observation period measurements of ssc at the dt station were conducted daily and shared by the crwcc the concentrations defined as the dry mass of particles per unit volume of water were measured using a standard gravimetric technique involving water sample collection on site filtration and laboratory weighing comparisons ssc and ssd of daily crwcc water sample results and daily cat results are presented in fig 6a 6e although some inconsistencies exist the ssc estimated by cat is in good agreement with the water sample results obtained by crwcc with a correlation coefficient r2 of 0 92 and a root mean square error rmse of 0 025 kg m3 additionally there is high consistency between the cat and water sample results obtained by crwcc for ssd with r2 0 96 and rmse 1 185 kg s the daily ssc exhibited a clear seasonal variation with ssc fluctuating from 0 02 to 0 37 kg m3 and a mean value of 0 10 kg m3 the mean sscs were 0 13 kg m3 and 0 06 kg m3 during the flood and dry seasons respectively for the ssd which was directly driven by water discharges the mean ssd for flood and dry seasons were 5 975 kg s and 1 517 kg s respectively the crwcc reported that the total annual suspended sediment load ssl at the dt station was 1 05 million tons in 2019 and 1 64 million tons in 2020 in this study the total annual ssl in 2019 and 2020 estimated by cat were 1 04 and 1 66 million tons respectively both methods presented similar results proving the accuracy and feasibility of the cat method in monitoring ssc and ssd 5 discussion 5 1 effect of suspended sediment size on suspended sediment concentration estimation by coastal acoustic tomography variability in s s c in eq 19 primarily resulted from the estimations of the range r between the two stations and the constant of total sediment attenuation ξ the range r was calculated from the sound travel time and sound speed r varied from 3 000 to 3 050 m during the observation period and the mean value was 3 015 m a 50 m deviation only resulted in a 1 6 deviation from the distance of 3 015 m which would eventually lead to an uncertainty of s s c 1 6 in contrast to r the estimation of the total sediment attenuation constant ξ significantly influenced the s s c results as illustrated in fig 7 since the notable difference in ssc between the dry and wet seasons consisted of the ssc during the dry season being largely 0 1 kg m3 fig 6b two cases were tested to reveal the influence of ξ in the dry and wet seasons regardless of high or low ssc suspended sediment size or ξ considerably affected the estimate of concentration as indicated by the green lines in fig 7 ξ varied from 0 0126 db m2 kg 0 013 mm in 2018 to 0 0086 db m2 kg 0 026 mm in 2019 and to 0 0099 db m2 kg 0 021 mm in 2020 and the relative differences of s s c induced by the variations of ξ ranged from 5 to 30 fig 7 the accurate estimation of ξ is a prerequisite for the precise estimation of ssc by cat which implies that the suspended sediment size distribution must be accurately monitored it is particularly important to precisely quantify the suspended sediment size distribution along the transect 5 2 effect of sound frequency on suspended sediment concentration estimation by coastal acoustic tomography generally hydroacoustical approaches to estimate ssc or suspended sediment size are derived from sonar equations which model the relationships between a distinct acoustic frequency and ssc or suspended sediment size in the water column thorne and hanes 2002 thorne and hurther 2014 this is achieved by finding unequivocal relations between acoustic signal indices and metrics of ssc or suspended sediment size distribution ha et al 2011 thorne and hurther 2014 for instance sediment concentration can influence backscatter and sediment attenuation can affect sound levels cat was designed for observing small scale ocean dynamic phenomena in coastal seas typically the central frequency of cat is 10 khz to assess the performance of different cat frequencies in estimating transect ssc three cases were considered to represent low 0 05 kg m3 medium 0 1 kg m3 and high 0 4 kg m3 ssc relative to the cat central frequency from 4 to 10 khz at 3 km as presented in fig 8 fig 8a displays the total attenuation constants ξ for frequencies between 4 and 10 khz as in the previous section 3 2 the annual average d50 of suspended sediments in 2018 2019 and 2020 are marked by black dashed lines higher frequencies corresponded to larger attenuation constants indicating a more significant effect induced by water and suspended sediment fig 8a furthermore the primary task of ssc inversion by cat is the estimation of the absorption coefficient α which is the sum of sound attenuation resulting from suspended sediment α s and water absorption α w for the same central frequency as the ssc decreased α w became more dominant than α s and the difference in the attenuation coefficient between water and suspended sediment declined in terms of frequency as the ssc decreased the advantage of high frequency systems became apparent fig 8c 8d this assessment provides a method to examine or select appropriate acoustic systems for cross sectional s s c estimation in riverine or estuarine environments as illustrated in fig 8c 8d at low ssc in situ monitoring using low frequency cat is nearly unreliable as the absorption attenuation induced by suspended sediment is weak considering the actual range of ssc variations and selecting the applicable frequency of cat are necessary for successfully monitoring s s c 5 3 discussion of applicable measure distance for suspended sediment concentration estimation by coastal acoustic tomography as indicated in eqs 6 and 7 the range between cat stations and the characteristics of suspended sediment affect the snr of cat the range r can be estimated based on eqs 6 or 7 by assuming different absorption coefficients α and various s s c values the source level sl of cat was set to 192 198 db zheng et al 1998 and l0 was assumed to be approximately 15 db zheng et al 1998 vračar and mijić 2011 studied the ambient noise in three large european rivers for frequencies ranging from 5 hz to 20 khz and reported that the ambient noise fluctuated from approximately 45 to 105 db consequently based on the daily results of this study the noise level nl was approximately 41 5 db as estimated from eqs 6 and 7 during our observation period ssc varied from 0 05 to 0 4 kg m3 thus different cases representing low 0 01 0 05 kg m3 medium 0 1 kg m3 and high 0 4 kg m3 s s c values relative to the cat central frequency of 9 khz were used in this study fig 9 illustrates the results of effective distance vs snr for different average s s c values with 9 khz at a suspended sediment size of 0 020 mm observations conducted at 9 khz were physically unreasonable where the distance exceeded 4 2 km in this study the snr threshold was set to 14 db to select the arrival peak implying that the applicable distance should be 3 5 4 2 km for ssc monitoring by cat at 9 khz in the yr at the dt station the distance calculated from the sound travel time and speed varied from 3 000 to 3 050 m during the observation period demonstrating that such a setting laid the foundation for the s s c results of this study cat was designed to observe small scale ocean dynamic phenomena in coastal areas but many previous studies have successfully applied it to different environments chen et al 2017 syamsudin et al 2019 yamaguchi et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 zhu et al 2022 zhu et al 2017 typically a central frequency of 5 khz is used in coastal areas the applicable distances of the 5 khz cat are also presented here fig 9 compared to the 9 khz system the 5 khz system could cover wider areas such as the yr estuary additionally the effects of the m sequence are presented in fig 9 although a higher m sequence leads to higher processing gain snr the resultant distance increase is 10 for example in the case of high average s s c 0 4 kg m3 the maximum distance increase was approximately 0 5 km while m9 increased to m11 this study both presents a method to estimate ssc using cat and provides information on the effects of various parameters e g ssc m sequence frequency and distance that offer guidance for conducting optimal environmental monitoring with cat under different conditions 5 4 overview of the suspended sediment discharge at datong station and the coastal acoustic tomography approach since the 1990 s variations in ssd in the yr have attracted significant attention chen et al 2001 observed a decreasing trend in sediment load at the dt station furthermore yang et al 2002 noted that ssd began to decrease in the 1970 s primarily due to the impact of the danjiankou dam yang et al 2006 demonstrated that ssd at the dt station decreased in three distinct phases 1 from 1969 mainly due to the danjiangkou dam 2 from 1986 largely because of human activities in the river basin such as dam construction and soil conservation 3 from 2003 following the completion of the tgd which has significantly regulated river flow and sediment budget in the middle and lower reaches of the yr since then sedimentary processes along the entire yr have been considerably altered by the tgd and issues associated with the tgd have become the primary focus of yr studies continuous tracking of ssd has always been a critical aspect of yr management here the cat method was applied at the dt station to estimate ssc and ssd enabling continuous real time monitoring of cross sectional data kawanisi et al 2017 first employed the acoustic tomography approach to estimate cross sectional averaged ssc during tidal bores in the qiantang river however their study neglected changes in sediment size limited the observation period to several hours or days and did not thoroughly verify the performance of the cat method in the present work variations in sediment size were taken into account for ssc estimation and long term monitoring over 2 5 years was conducted moreover the results were validated providing valuable guidance for future research 6 conclusion an acoustic approach for monitoring cross sectional ssc and ssd based on sound attenuation using cat proved to be practical for the yangtze river yr at the datong dt station the most significant achievement was the successful acquisition of realistic estimations of cross sectional averaged ssc and ssd using cat at the observation sites to continuously monitor the suspended sediment of the yr two synchronized cat instruments were placed at the dt station from july 2018 to january 2021 during this 2 5 year period the 5 minute interval ssc ranged from 0 02 to 0 44 kg m3 with a mean ssc of 0 11 kg m3 the ssd varied from 204 kg s in winter to 36 299 kg s in summer the total annual suspended sediment load estimated by cat was 1 04 and 1 66 million tons in 2019 and 2020 respectively when compared with the daily ssc directly determined by water samples our results had an r2 of 0 92 and an rmse of 0 025 kg m3 both ssc and ssd showed high consistency between the cat results and water samples analyzed by crwcc notably cat is equipped with wireless transmission capabilities enabling real time monitoring of ssc and ssd sensitivity experiments of suspended sediment size and sound frequency revealed the advantages and disadvantages of the cat method the results demonstrated that different suspended sediment sizes directly determine the role of viscous absorption and scattering loss which significantly influenced the estimation of ssc by cat additionally the choice of sound frequency is a key factor for estimating ssc with cat because of differences in high and low frequency responses to attenuation and absorption of water and suspended sediment the arrangement of cat sites measurement distance was also found to be important for ssc inversion this study suggests an acoustic approach that relies on cat for continuous and real time observation of cross sectional averaged ssc and ssd in large rivers consequently the use of cat over extended periods e g decades to observe different parameters water discharge ssc and ssd is feasible and should be implemented to test the cat method under various flow regimes tidal rivers and suspended sediment loads credit authorship contribution statement cong xiao methodology conceptualization data curation writing original draft software xiao hua

1756,this study aimed to analyze the interaction among watershed food producing and food demanding areas through the connected system of physical virtual water flows and local food networks in terms of the transboundary water food nexus even though they might not be geographically connected here we analyzed the potential food network of local rice among 47 prefectures in japan using the gravity model and estimated the physical virtual water flows pvwfs by lining the physical water flow in food producing areas and virtual water flow embedded in the food network through in and out degree centralities of the food network we found that the results of degree centrality revealed which prefecture was more influenced by the changes in self supply ratios ssrs of local rice as all prefectures intended to increase consumption of local rice that was produced in their area the scale of the food network was reduced as shown by the decrease in in and out degree centralities based on the food network we analyzed the dependency of food demanding areas on each watershed based on a connected system of pvwfs in a case study of the kansai region the northern watershed directly affected hyogo which was also indirectly influenced by osaka in terms of pvwfs in the food network with 20 ssr the pvwf was estimated to be 189 17 106 m3 yr 1 from the northern watershed to osaka in the food producing area of the northern watershed showing higher interaction of osaka with the northern watershed than with other watersheds keywords transboundary water food nexus food network physical virtual water gravity model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the debate on effectively addressing water and food challenges stems from whether the water food crisis is caused by a poor understanding of these resources and or improper management mohtar et al 2015 additionally the lack of integration among sectors interacting with water across geographical areas or within large transboundary basins is a long standing challenge for water management mohtar and lawford 2016 traditional water management strategies have mainly been aimed at supplying and allocating water resources such as surface or groundwater thus several studies have analyzed the water supply for food products in a specific water boundary such as a watershed by considering transboundary water management for example upstream downstream linkages however the united nations un sustainability development goals show the importance of the interlinkage between resources including water and socio economic and environmental variables bleischwitz et al 2018 liu et al 2018 food security is strongly related to an increase in domestic production which depends on water irrigation moreover food trade could be considered an important factor for utilizing and saving water resources by food exporting and importing areas smajgl et al 2016 implemented a nexus framework in the transboundary context of the mekong river basin providing novel insights for understanding cross sectoral dynamics lawford et al 2013 identified potential factors that may affect water availability quality and food production as these factors influence water energy and food to this end they employed a nexus approach considering four asian basins and the lake winnipeg basin moreover liu et al 2019 emphasized the importance of agricultural sustainability based on the nexus approach through a case study of the chenmengquan irrigation district in china the water energy food nexus approach has risen as a key model for assessing holistic impacts in the complex relationship among stakeholders resources and other variables the concept of virtual water trade vwt which indicates the water included in product trading allan 2001 hoekstra 2003 hanasaki et al 2010 fader et al 2011 schyns and hoekstra 2014 lee et al 2017 provides a broad perspective in the water food nexus linking consuming and producing areas the vwt widens the perspective by expanding the boundary of water management from the actual water supply within the watershed to virtual water transfer from producing to consuming areas the scarcity of water resources has become a global focal point in agriculture and food supply problems notably vwt is useful for analyzing and alleviating this problem ke et al 2004 similar to the predictions regarding the rise in global population and climate change vwt embedded in food trade is expected to double by 2050 falkenmark and lannerstad 2010 in a case study in egypt where substantial amounts of vwt were embodied in wheat and maize imports wichelns 2001 emphasized the importance of vwt in achieving national goals regarding food security within a broader framework earle 2001 theoretically analyzed the interaction among water food and trade and assessed the level of reliance on vwt and its effect on food security in southern africa whereas bulsink et al 2010 analyzed how food trade affected water resilience in indonesia through vwt furthermore biewald et al 2014 analyzed blue vwt sourced from surface or groundwater resources and revealed that the global trade of food crops contributed to blue vwt saving worth 2 4 billion usd dalin et al 2014 analyzed how much vwt was traded among china and other countries lee et al 2016 analyzed the global trade network of vwt and found that in contrast to european countries asian countries were highly dependent on a few leading exporters in addition several studies downscaled the vwt to regional local and watershed levels for example zhang and anadon 2014 quantified the amount of vwt at the provincial level in china based on a multi regional input output model and found that domestic vwt was nearly twice of that entailed in china s international exports vanham 2013 assessed the vwt balance for agricultural products in european river basins and identified them as highly positivenet vwt basins including those in densely populated and industrialized regions of western europe the vwt studies have mainly focused on quantifying vwt rather than the interlinkage between food and water management although most vwt and food trade studies barely considered the changes in food trade and only showed the quantitative vwt during past years food trade could be changed by interactions among countries by considering market size and accessibility as factors affecting consumer and producer decisions tinbergen 1962 in addition vwt is embedded in the food trade and has been mainly considered at the boundary of exporting and importing areas or countries thus the vwt application can be limited to the water resource boundary as vwt is strongly related to both food demand and resource use in importing and exporting areas respectively water management in local watersheds needs to consider not only water supply but also food trade in both exporting and importing areas regarding the interlinkage among local food supply food trade actual water and vwt therefore we believe that the vwt could bring more expandable resource management beyond traditional resource management in the water food nexus model as shown in fig 1 for example in the nexus model the linkage between water and food exists as water for food that generally indicates irrigation water thus the boundary of water management is limited to crop areas and water resources such as reservoirs or aquifers however several studies have revealed that changes in food consumption patterns can affect water resource management salmoral and yan 2018 serrano et al 2016 zhao et al 2005 zhuo et al 2016 accordingly the application of vwt adds a line between water and food in the nexus that potentially links water resources and food consumers via producers furthermore considering vwt we can apply additional food scenarios representing food security and various influential factors such as food consumption local food supply and transportation this study aimed to analyze the water food interaction in the nexus model based on new transboundary management linking water resources crop areas and food consumption by quantifying physical virtual water flow pvwf linking physical water flow pwf from watershed to food producing areas and virtual water flow vwf from food producing and food demanding areas finally we assessed the impacts of local food strategy on the interaction among watersheds food producing areas and food demanding areas by applying various food self supply ratio ssr scenarios as shown in fig 1 this approach of pvwf was applicable in countries where the proportion of local food in food consumption is significant as a national boundary scale however it could also be expanded to a global scale with global water basins and global food networks by importing and exporting countries this is a fundamental study to develop a method to bring the pvwf concept into the water food nexus thus we analyzed the food network and vwt by local rice among 47 prefectures in japan and assessed the impacts of ssrs on pvwf in water basins in the kansai region as shown in fig 2 2 methods 2 1 simulation of potential food network of local product through gravity model with ssrs the food network is a key factor in revealing the interaction between rural and urban areas based on production and consumption in japan rice contributed approximately 30 of the daily caloric intake of an average person in 2012 maff 2016 and 90 of total rice consumption 7 1 106 t yr 1 in 2012 was fulfilled by domestic production fao 2018 as shown in table 1 approximately 6 5 106 t yr 1 of rice in japan was produced between 2000 and 2012 with the tohoku region producing 34 of the total in particular niigata prefecture in the tohoku region produced 0 48 106 t yr 1 while consuming only 0 13 106 t yr 1 thus niigata prefecture is considered the main supplier to other prefectures in national food management in contrast metropolitan areas such as tokyo prefecture consumed more rice than they produced and depended on suppliers in other areas however international or local food trade involves various stakeholders policies and environmental issues thus it is limited to predicting food trade therefore we adapted the concept of ideal food trade determined by market size and distance between production and consumption areas as shown in the gravity model the gravity model was first applied to analyze global trade tinbergen 1962 pöyhönen 1963 and was later applied to different types of flows such as commuting migration information capital activities and freight roy and thill 2004 rodrigue 2009 martinez zarzoso 2003 in addition several empirical applications have been reported to improve the performance of gravity models wei 1996 bougheas et al 1999 egger 2002 antonucci and manzocchi 2006 batra 2006 in this study we analyzed the food network to evaluate the impacts of local food policy on the food water nexus we used the gravity model adapting spatial interaction si between food producing and food demanding areas in the gravity model si can be defined as various movements with the basic assumption that flows are a function of the attributes and the distance between the origins and destinations rodrigue et al 2009 for si simulation in the food network we applied the balance of food supply demand as the attraction factor and the distances among prefectures as the friction factor as shown in equation 1 1 si ij ae i ri j r ij α where siij represents the spatial interaction between prefectures i and j ae is the amount of products available for exports ri is the requirement of product import r is the distance between prefectures and α is the friction parameter although an area produces large amounts of food products the availability of products for export to other areas could be low if the food product requirement is significantly large for example if a local area sets a food policy to increase the consumption of local products the amount of exported products could decrease thus we applied ssr the amount of food products consumed within the area to ae and ri in si as shown in eq 2 2 ae i p i 1 ssr i p i c i ri i c i 1 s s r i p i c i where ae is the amount of products available for exports ri is the requirement of product import p is production c is consumption and ssri is the self supply ratio in prefecture i for example a 50 ssr in an area where the consumption is larger than production indicates that 50 of the total production is supplied to people living in that area the distance between prefectures producer and consumer is considered a friction factor in the rice trade although α should be estimated through observed data there is no available data on rice among the prefectures and we assumed an α of 2 for the food network products are transported through roads or trails but transportation systems are largely complex for example road types in road transportation thus we calculated the straight line distance between the center points in prefectures using arcmap 10 1 the validation is the most important process for applying the gravity model to real world in particular the friction parameter α in the model should be decided through the validation process however it is difficult to get the data about local distribution of products including details of origins and destinations in japan the details about the transportation of rice among prefectures were not available but the local distribution of rice should be important factor for water food governance and integrated resource management accordingly we applied several friction parameters from 1 0 to 2 0 increased by 0 1 and realized the friction parameter from 1 0 to 2 0 did not bring big changes in results thus we applied 2 0 as friction parameter in order to emphasize the influence of distance on local trade as potential situation another limitation is the lack of data to validate the food network simulation only local rice production and consumption data are available in each prefecture and there are no data on food networks among local areas accordingly we first simulated the potential amount of trade among prefectures as shown in eq 3 and compared the production and consumption in each prefecture derived from the food network simulation to historical production and consumption finally we re simulated the food network by adjusting the difference between simulated and historical production and consumption as shown in eq 4 3 ex 1 i j si ij i si ij 1 ri j 4 ex 2 n i j ex 2 n 1 i j i ex 2 n 1 i j 1 r i j ex 2 n 1 i j ex 2 n i j j ex 2 n i j 1 a e i where ex i j is the export from prefecture i to prefecture j ri j is the import requirement in prefecture j ae i is the available export in prefecture i ex n i j is the iteration function of exports from prefecture i to prefecture j and n represents the number of iterations we tried to assess the impacts of them on local food distribution through the methodology in this study however the simulation included complex network of 47 prefectures and the gravity model hardly derives accurate results from single simulation therefore we set observed total production and consumption in each prefecture as the control factors and several iterations were conducted until the simulated values were close to the control factors accordingly we iterated these processes until d i and d j reached to the very small number such as 1 for both ae and ri in all prefectures as shown in eq 5 5 d i j ex 2 n i j ae i d j i ex 2 n 1 i j ri j where d i represents the difference between the sum of simulated exports and ae in prefecture i and d j is the difference between the sum of simulated exports and ri in prefecture j 2 2 analysis of degree centralities of food network network analysis helps understand the connectivity among nodes in particular food production is the main driver of the water food energy nexus for instance water for food is the amount of water for producing food products and it should be the main component of the nexus linking water and food policies in other words changes in food production and consumption affect food transportation deriving virtual water flows embedded in food products food transportation is represented by the complex relationship between production and consumption areas and it could be affected by food policies such as preference for local food or national food security accordingly we understood food transportation as a complex food network considering food policy and analyzed it to quantify the impacts of local food self supply on each producing and consuming area as a scenario through the degree centrality of the food network which represents the number of edges incident on a given node degree centrality considers both the number of trade partners and the volume of each flow freeman et al 1979 degree centrality is divided into in and out degrees by network flow for example in degree centrality is analyzed by the amount of food products imported by each trader whereas out degree centrality considers food products exported by each trader the degree centrality of the food network is represented by eq 6 as follows 6 c i j n f i j n 1 where c i is the degree centrality of node i n is the total number of nodes and f i j is the volume of food products transported between the i t h and j t h nodes 2 3 estimation of connected physical virtual water flows to estimate pwf and vwf the water footprint wf m3 t 1 i e the water volume used for producing one ton of product is an essential factor in this study as wf indicated the irrigation water supply it implied blue wf calculated based on crop water requirement m3 t 1 and yield t ha 1 the pwf indicates the irrigation water supply from water resources such as watersheds to crop areas we assumed that crop areas utilize irrigation water from the watershed where they are located thus we extracted the crop area in each watershed and estimated the irrigation water supply from the watershed to the crop area vwf represents the water entailed in the trade of products and is calculated by multiplying the trade by its associated wf as shown in eqs 7 9 7 w f p c bwu p c production p c 8 p w f w p c w f p c p r o d u c t i v i t y p c c a w p c 9 v w f p d c e x p d c w f p c where wf bwu and production represent the water footprint n e blue water use and yield per year respectively of crop c in producing area p pwf w p c is the pwf from watershed w to producing area p ca w p c is the crop area located in both watershed w and producing area p and productivity represents yield per area t ha 1 of crop c vwf p d c is the vwf from producing area p n e to demanding area d embedded in the result of export ex of crop c pwf is bonded in the watershed and vwf has a larger boundary linking food producing and food demanding areas fig 3 each flow is separated highlighting the scarce relationship between the watershed and food demanding areas however the final consumers of food products live in food demanding areas thus watersheds are linked to food demanding areas in terms of pwf and vwf therefore we calculated pvwf which indicated water flow from the watershed to food demanding areas via food producing areas in physical and virtual forms in this study the wft interaction indicated the dependence of a food demanding area on each watershed as the relationship between the food demanding area and watershed as shown in eq 10 a high wft interaction means that the food demanding area depends on water resources in a specific watershed based on the wft interaction we quantified the pvwf from the watershed to the food demanding area via the food producing area as shown in equation 11 10 wtf i n t e r a c t i o n w i d j k pwf w i p k i p w f w i p k vwf p k d j j v w f p k d j 11 p v w f w i d

to the demanding area d and pvwf w i d j is the physical virtual water flow from the watershed w to the demanding area d wft interaction indicates the ratio of pvwf to the total inflow of virtual water in the food demanding area d 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of potential food network of local rice by ssrs in this study we analyzed the food network of local rice among the 47 prefectures in japan using a gravity model based on import requirements available exports and distances among prefectures to validate the food distribution model we compared simulated results to the observed data of the regional self dependency in 2016 which indicates the proportion of consumption of rice produced at own region as shown in fig 4 in case of weighted distribution under 20 ssr scenario the regional self dependency in tohoku region where is the representative paddy rice area was 83 4 and it was 4 difference from the observation data in 2016 in most regions except for kansai region the simulation of regional self dependency through the weighted distribution was closer to observation in comparison to non weighed distribution however shikoku region showed a large difference between simulation and observation under 20 ssr scenarios even the regional self dependency in shikoku region through the weighted distribution under 20 ssr was calculated to 41 9 but it was still large different from observation 77 3 shikoku region is kinds of big island and it is quite limited to access other regions because only 3 bridges are connected to the hiroshima okayama and hyogo prefectures therefore we believe the regional self dependency of rice was higher than 20 ssr scenarios and fig 4 showed that the self dependency simulated through 60 ssr scenario was getting close to observed one however this study did not intend to define the accurate ssr scenario but we showed that the food distribution model developed in this study could assess the various situation relating to local food security through the adaptation of various ssr scenarios based on simulation the degree of the food network of local rice was analyzed using ssr scenarios under the 20 ssr scenario the chubu hokkaido and kanto regions depended on rice produced in the tohoku region in particular the kanto region imported 43 of its total rice requirement from the tohoku region approximately 45 of the total rice consumed originated from prefectures in the chubu region and 29 came from prefectures in the tohoku region despite the ssr being 20 the kyushu and tohoku regions exhibited the highest self dependency levels regarding rice consumption approximately 79 of the total rice consumed in kyushu was obtained from the prefectures within that region therefore the local self sufficiency of this region was higher than that of other regions and the allocation of local resources for rice production could be the main issue concerning trade offs between local food supply and resource usage in contrast the kansai region showed a more evenly distributed import of rice that is only 30 of its total consumed rice originated from its prefectures and 50 of the total came from the chubu tohoku and chugoku regions 21 18 and 11 respectively when the ssr increased to 60 the regional dependencies among all the regions changed for example the chubu hokkaido and kanto regions still showed high dependency in the tohoku region while increasing their regional self dependencies in the kanto region the ratio of rice consumed from the tohoku region to the total consumption of the region slightly increased because the increase in ssr of all prefectures led to decreasing exports from the hokkaido region to the kanto region hence the kanto region required more rice from the tohoku region in contrast in the shikoku and chugoku regions 60 ssr largely increased regional self dependency compared to that of other regions the kyushu and tohoku regions had high levels of regional self dependency in both the 20 and 60 ssrs because the prefectures in these regions produced substantially more rice than they consumed thus increasing ssr could hardly affect regional self dependency through in and out degree centralities of the food network we found that the results of degree centrality revealed which prefecture was more influenced by the changes in ssrs of local rice as all prefectures intended to increase consumption of local rice produced in their area the scale of the food network was reduced and it was shown by the decrease in in and out degree centralities fig 5 however the impact of ssrs on degree centrality was distinguished by the prefecture and direction of centrality for example the changes in in degree centrality representing food network based on the import of local rice showed that the increase of ssrs in the entire food network more affected the in degree centrality in prefectures located from fourth to the ninth rank under 20 ssr such as aichi saitama chiba hyogo fukuoka and hokkaido the in degree centrality of chiba and hokkaido decreased significantly indicating that a large amount of local rice could be circulated inside the prefecture boundary and that they could afford to reduce imports from various prefectures the statistical data on production and consumption supported the results because these prefectures have a larger production than the consumption of local rice however the in degree centrality of the largest market prefectures tokyo kanagawa and osaka were not significantly influenced by changes in ssrs even though prefectures increase the proportion of local rice in total consumption these prefectures need to be supplied by various prefectures because they account for about 25 of the national consumption of local rice in japan and the proportion of local rice produced in their crop area in total consumption was less than 5 in the food network based on exports fig 5 b shows that variation of the changes in out degree centrality by ssrs is larger than in degree centrality and it indicates that the influence of ssr on the export structure of food networks was differential for example the most significant decrease in out degree centrality was shown in hokkaido and chiba which had second to 11th rank under 20 ssr in summary based on 20 ssr the increase in ssr brought about big changes in the food import network to the second rank group rather than the first rank group but the influence of ssr on the export network was more variable by prefecture these changes in the food network by ssr were connected to water resource management in the way of vwt embedded in the food network and these results were considered the main factor for estimating pvwf in the next chapter 3 2 analysis of internal and external virtual water flows embedded in the food networks as the importance of domestic food products increases agricultural water use in producing areas could become an important issue because rice production could be regarded as the main stakeholder in water management that is 90 of the water withdrawn in agriculture is used in paddy rice fields in japan mlit 2018 according to the japanese ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlit 2018 approximately 51 5 109 m3 yr 1 of water was withdrawn from rice paddy fields from 2000 to 2012 table 2 the rice paddy fields in the tohoku region had the largest annual rice production and withdrew 14 9 109 m3 yr 1 of water that is 29 of the national amount however water withdrawal includes water returning to rivers and 70 of the total water withdrawal is estimated to be the return flow in japanese rice paddy fields masumoto and yoshida 2014 therefore we set the blue vw as the water excluding return flows for total water withdrawal in paddy fields in each region table 2 the tohoku region had the largest production area and the smallest wf 1505 m3 t 1 thus increasing rice production in the tohoku region would contribute to national water conservation in contrast the shikoku region had the largest wf 2253 m3 t 1 based on the food network we analyzed the internal and external vwfs in each region under various ssrs from 20 to 100 fig 6 and table 3 internal and external vwf in a region indicates vwfs between prefectures in the same and different regions respectively the largest internal vwf was observed in the kanto region and the internal vwf increased from 1784 to 2026 106 m3 yr 1 under the 20 and 100 ssr scenarios respectively the kyushu region showed the second largest internal vwf 1387 106 m3 yr 1 under 20 ssr which increased to 1691 106 m3 yr 1 under 100 ssr the chubu region showed the largest increase in internal vwfs from 1017 to 1621 106 m3 yr 1 under 20 and 100 ssr respectively as internal vwf is highly related to integrated pwf such as water allocation at regional boundaries prefectures in the chubu region should be more careful regarding sharing water resources among prefectures in addition the relationship between producing and consuming areas would become closer as ssrs increased and the changes in food production or consumption in a specific area in the chubu region could affect water management in other prefectures in the region in contrast the impact of ssr on internal vwf was small in the case of the tohoku and shikoku regions and the tohoku region exhibited the largest external vwf for example 3229 and 3000 106 m3 yr 1 of vw were exported from the tohoku region under the 20 and 100 ssr scenarios respectively in addition the decrease in the outflow ratio of external vw to other regions upon changing ssr from 20 to 100 was smaller in the case of tohoku than in other regions in contrast the hokkaido and chubu regions exhibited the largest decrease in this ratio which indicated the high sensitivity of the external vw outflow to ssr regarding external vw inflow the kanto region imported the most vw 2756 106 m3 yr 1 approximately 37 of the total vw imported in japan followed by kansai which imported 1680 106 m3 yr 1 of vw under a 20 ssr as the ssr increased from 20 to 100 the largest decrease in external vw inflow was observed in the chubu region from 1204 to 614 106 m3 yr 1 however the chugoku hokkaido kyushu shikoku and tohoku regions had almost no external vw inflow from other regions when the ssr was 100 the results showed that these regions have an adequate rice supply which is weakly influenced by water resources in other regions 3 3 analysis of impacts of ssrs of local rice on connected physical virtual water flows in kansai region through the simulation of pwf and vwf in the kansai region we analyzed the wft interaction representing the dependency of food demanding areas on each watershed and estimated pvwfs from watersheds to food demanding areas fig 7 and table 4 interestingly pvwf changed in watershed and food demanding areas by changing ssrs because of complex interlinkages among watershed producing and demanding areas in this study we applied concept of pvwf to specific region with simulation results of vwf in total regions first as the study area of pvwf we considered the area including main food consumption area and production area in addition to several watersheds thus kansai area includes osaka as main food consumption area hyogo as main food production area and 4 watersheds in addition various scale of prefectures such as kyoto shiga nara and wakayama are located in kansai region in particular these prefectures are sharing the watersheds as main water resource for producing rice osaka was directly related to the eastern watershed however osaka s pvwf could indirectly affect the northern watershed because a large amount of rice was imported from hyogo using irrigation water from the northern watershed as the main water resource in the 20 ssr the pvwf was estimated to be 189 17 106 m3 yr 1 from the northern watershed to osaka in the food producing area of the northern watershed and it showed that osaka has a higher wft interaction with the northern watershed than other watersheds in addition osaka has a large amount of pvwf from the eastern watershed even though only 33 4 106 m3 yr 1 of water from the eastern watershed was used for rice production in osaka the pvwf from the eastern watershed to osaka was estimated to be 161 59 106 m3 yr 1 and most of them were flown via producing area in shiga which exported 90 7 106 m3 yr 1 vw to osaka in 20 ssr however as the ssr increased to 100 the dependency on the northern watershed decreased and the dependency on the eastern and southern watersheds increased even though the total pvwf from watersheds in the kansai region decreased from 541 75 106 m3 yr 1 20 ssr to 291 85 106 m3 yr 1 100 ssr because of increasing rice imports from outside the kansai region to osaka the pvwf from the eastern watershed to kyoto and shiga simultaneously increased the pvwf from the eastern watershed to kyoto was estimated to be 56 85 106 m3 yr 1 under the food network with 20 ssr and it increased to 79 81 106 m3 yr 1 with 100 ssr the largest increase was shown in shiga by increasing ssr and the 134 8 106 m3 yr 1 pvwf was increased in addition the pvwf from the watershed to nara also increased accordingly the eastern watershed management should consider the pwf to hyogo and shiga and also the indirect supply through vwf to the predominant consuming prefectures in other words the changes in food policy consumption pattern and population in kyoto shiga and nara should be considered more important in the water management plan of the eastern watershed the northern watershed is an important water resource for the food producing area in hyogo kyoto and other prefectures outside the kansai region thus the conflict of water resources would be an important issue for both the internal and external kansai regions hyogo also had an extensive interaction as a food demanding area with the northern watershed and pvwf from the northern watershed to hyogo was quantified as 135 09 106 m3 yr 1 as the ssr increased the amount of pvwf to hyogo from the northern watershed increased and the pvwf under the food network with 100 ssr was estimated to be 214 12 106 m3 yr 1 in the case of western watersheds the pvwf to hyogo increased from 41 53 106 m3 yr 1 20 ssr to 193 8 106 m3 yr 1 100 ssr therefore the northern and western watersheds were considered the main water resources for food producing areas and significant water resource for food consumers in hyogo as people prefer local food products therefore water management in these watersheds should bring food consumers as indirect stakeholders however an increase in the ssr led to increased pvwf to hyogo in the northern and western watersheds and decreased in the eastern and southern watersheds these results show how each watershed is related to food demanding areas and changes in local food networks affect the relationship between them traditional water management policy in watersheds focusing on water requirements in food producing areas should be extended to include food demanding areas through pvwfs therefore new water management should physically integrate watersheds and irrigation and link watersheds and food trade through the pvwf the changes in local food policy relating to food supply demand preference for local food products food consumption patterns and population should play important roles in water food management accordingly the concept of pvwfs from watershed to food demanding areas via producing areas could be applied to assess the interaction among water food and trade becoming an important factor for the wft nexus even though these results specifically corresponded to the kansai region 4 limitations but possibilities the domestic distribution of food products is more directly related to resource management such as water land and energy concerning governance and integrated water food management it is important to analyze the local distribution of food among prefectures and assess the impacts of local food security in each prefecture on integrated water food management the methodology in this study assumed the potential situation of local distribution of rice and applied several scenarios related to local food security with potential impacts of distances using the gravity model we believe it could show various possibilities and the outcomes could be used as a guideline for integrated national regional local food and water management however there are limitations in methodology validation and application for example we applied different self supply in each prefecture as ssr scenarios which represents local food security policy and we could assess the impacts of them on local food distribution through the methodology however we set observed total production and consumption in each prefecture as the control factors and several iterations were conducted until the simulated values were close to the control factors in order to reduce the bias and error of simulation although this study focused on domestic rice trade with constant international trade the gravity model approach could be adapted to reflect changes in international trade for example the food self sufficiency increases in japan due to national policy would encourage domestic production moreover the market size of production increases in contrast the decrease in paddy fields could decrease domestic production and japan would increase rice imports from other countries thus the changes in international trade could be related to production within the gravity model and the impact of international trade on the local food network could be assessed however we would need to determine which prefectures exhibit the largest increase even though the amount of international import and export could be quantified in other words international trade affects various situations and variables including national and local food supply domestic production changes and the international trade network regarding applicability and contribution this study focused on the food network of domestic rice in japan which seems to be an exclusive case study with little applicability to international cases several studies on international food trade or water security have focused on the interlinkage between countries rather than the downscaled impacts on local or regional areas asian countries such as thailand taiwan vietnam japan and south korea produce large amounts of rice for domestic consumption with a large irrigation water supply furthermore they also have high levels of self sufficiency of rice thus local distribution of rice could be an important factor for managing local regional national food and irrigation water in addition we believe that this approach could be connected to agrarian region where water consumption is very high level and major contributor to the national economies abhishek kinouchi 2021 abhishek et al 2021 for example resource governance or integrated resource management could be considered a way of sustainable management and the distribution of domestic food could be more feasible than international trade concerning resource governance even if great deals of food products are traded between countries it is difficult to apply integrated water food management that include countries because water food are highly dependent upon spatial characteristics and boundaries of management as well as local government however local policy of food security or water management could relate to production in other local areas accordingly we need to analyze the food transportation between local areas and water food dependency on other local areas in addition it is important to understand the gap between the national food policy and local situation especially in the countries where domestic production occupies a large proportion of food security 5 conclusions traditionally integrated water management in a region considered parallel watersheds for example the total water withdrawal in a region is calculated as the sum of the water withdrawal in each watershed in addition urban areas are rarely included in agricultural water management at the regional level thus it was difficult to propose a single transboundary water policy for rural and urban areas this study integrated pwf and vwf through a food network for transboundary water management our results demonstrated that the watershed could be related to the main consumption areas mainly urban areas allowing transboundary water management beyond a physical water boundary to be dynamic depending on the food policy from this study we found that the physical water in watershed was connected to virtual water flow as new transboundary water management the urban area as food consumers could be considered as main stakeholder of water management in rural area physical virtual water flow was highly influenced by the self supply of local food most of the existing research is based on theories such as life cycle focusing on the quantification of pwf and vwf the research method of this paper is a new one which is easier to implement first this study embedded vwt into the water food nexus taking into account the impact of changes in food trading on the entire nexus second as long as there is the total amount of food production and consumption in the study area the local food trading network can be simulated to estimate the water translocation this is a new way of thinking that integrated pwf and vwf which enriched the content of food water linkages and provided a new perspective for water resource management in summary resource governance or integrated resource management would be more feasible on a local or regional scale than international moreover the food network and internal vwfs could be important factors for multiple stakeholders within integrated spatial boundaries despite its limitations this study s attempt to bring food networks to transboundary water management linking physical and virtual water flows may help develop useful frameworks for connecting water and food management and producing and consuming areas credit authorship contribution statement sang hyun lee conceptualization methodology formal analysis visualization

1756,this study aimed to analyze the interaction among watershed food producing and food demanding areas through the connected system of physical virtual water flows and local food networks in terms of the transboundary water food nexus even though they might not be geographically connected here we analyzed the potential food network of local rice among 47 prefectures in japan using the gravity model and estimated the physical virtual water flows pvwfs by lining the physical water flow in food producing areas and virtual water flow embedded in the food network through in and out degree centralities of the food network we found that the results of degree centrality revealed which prefecture was more influenced by the changes in self supply ratios ssrs of local rice as all prefectures intended to increase consumption of local rice that was produced in their area the scale of the food network was reduced as shown by the decrease in in and out degree centralities based on the food network we analyzed the dependency of food demanding areas on each watershed based on a connected system of pvwfs in a case study of the kansai region the northern watershed directly affected hyogo which was also indirectly influenced by osaka in terms of pvwfs in the food network with 20 ssr the pvwf was estimated to be 189 17 106 m3 yr 1 from the northern watershed to osaka in the food producing area of the northern watershed showing higher interaction of osaka with the northern watershed than with other watersheds keywords transboundary water food nexus food network physical virtual water gravity model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the debate on effectively addressing water and food challenges stems from whether the water food crisis is caused by a poor understanding of these resources and or improper management mohtar et al 2015 additionally the lack of integration among sectors interacting with water across geographical areas or within large transboundary basins is a long standing challenge for water management mohtar and lawford 2016 traditional water management strategies have mainly been aimed at supplying and allocating water resources such as surface or groundwater thus several studies have analyzed the water supply for food products in a specific water boundary such as a watershed by considering transboundary water management for example upstream downstream linkages however the united nations un sustainability development goals show the importance of the interlinkage between resources including water and socio economic and environmental variables bleischwitz et al 2018 liu et al 2018 food security is strongly related to an increase in domestic production which depends on water irrigation moreover food trade could be considered an important factor for utilizing and saving water resources by food exporting and importing areas smajgl et al 2016 implemented a nexus framework in the transboundary context of the mekong river basin providing novel insights for understanding cross sectoral dynamics lawford et al 2013 identified potential factors that may affect water availability quality and food production as these factors influence water energy and food to this end they employed a nexus approach considering four asian basins and the lake winnipeg basin moreover liu et al 2019 emphasized the importance of agricultural sustainability based on the nexus approach through a case study of the chenmengquan irrigation district in china the water energy food nexus approach has risen as a key model for assessing holistic impacts in the complex relationship among stakeholders resources and other variables the concept of virtual water trade vwt which indicates the water included in product trading allan 2001 hoekstra 2003 hanasaki et al 2010 fader et al 2011 schyns and hoekstra 2014 lee et al 2017 provides a broad perspective in the water food nexus linking consuming and producing areas the vwt widens the perspective by expanding the boundary of water management from the actual water supply within the watershed to virtual water transfer from producing to consuming areas the scarcity of water resources has become a global focal point in agriculture and food supply problems notably vwt is useful for analyzing and alleviating this problem ke et al 2004 similar to the predictions regarding the rise in global population and climate change vwt embedded in food trade is expected to double by 2050 falkenmark and lannerstad 2010 in a case study in egypt where substantial amounts of vwt were embodied in wheat and maize imports wichelns 2001 emphasized the importance of vwt in achieving national goals regarding food security within a broader framework earle 2001 theoretically analyzed the interaction among water food and trade and assessed the level of reliance on vwt and its effect on food security in southern africa whereas bulsink et al 2010 analyzed how food trade affected water resilience in indonesia through vwt furthermore biewald et al 2014 analyzed blue vwt sourced from surface or groundwater resources and revealed that the global trade of food crops contributed to blue vwt saving worth 2 4 billion usd dalin et al 2014 analyzed how much vwt was traded among china and other countries lee et al 2016 analyzed the global trade network of vwt and found that in contrast to european countries asian countries were highly dependent on a few leading exporters in addition several studies downscaled the vwt to regional local and watershed levels for example zhang and anadon 2014 quantified the amount of vwt at the provincial level in china based on a multi regional input output model and found that domestic vwt was nearly twice of that entailed in china s international exports vanham 2013 assessed the vwt balance for agricultural products in european river basins and identified them as highly positivenet vwt basins including those in densely populated and industrialized regions of western europe the vwt studies have mainly focused on quantifying vwt rather than the interlinkage between food and water management although most vwt and food trade studies barely considered the changes in food trade and only showed the quantitative vwt during past years food trade could be changed by interactions among countries by considering market size and accessibility as factors affecting consumer and producer decisions tinbergen 1962 in addition vwt is embedded in the food trade and has been mainly considered at the boundary of exporting and importing areas or countries thus the vwt application can be limited to the water resource boundary as vwt is strongly related to both food demand and resource use in importing and exporting areas respectively water management in local watersheds needs to consider not only water supply but also food trade in both exporting and importing areas regarding the interlinkage among local food supply food trade actual water and vwt therefore we believe that the vwt could bring more expandable resource management beyond traditional resource management in the water food nexus model as shown in fig 1 for example in the nexus model the linkage between water and food exists as water for food that generally indicates irrigation water thus the boundary of water management is limited to crop areas and water resources such as reservoirs or aquifers however several studies have revealed that changes in food consumption patterns can affect water resource management salmoral and yan 2018 serrano et al 2016 zhao et al 2005 zhuo et al 2016 accordingly the application of vwt adds a line between water and food in the nexus that potentially links water resources and food consumers via producers furthermore considering vwt we can apply additional food scenarios representing food security and various influential factors such as food consumption local food supply and transportation this study aimed to analyze the water food interaction in the nexus model based on new transboundary management linking water resources crop areas and food consumption by quantifying physical virtual water flow pvwf linking physical water flow pwf from watershed to food producing areas and virtual water flow vwf from food producing and food demanding areas finally we assessed the impacts of local food strategy on the interaction among watersheds food producing areas and food demanding areas by applying various food self supply ratio ssr scenarios as shown in fig 1 this approach of pvwf was applicable in countries where the proportion of local food in food consumption is significant as a national boundary scale however it could also be expanded to a global scale with global water basins and global food networks by importing and exporting countries this is a fundamental study to develop a method to bring the pvwf concept into the water food nexus thus we analyzed the food network and vwt by local rice among 47 prefectures in japan and assessed the impacts of ssrs on pvwf in water basins in the kansai region as shown in fig 2 2 methods 2 1 simulation of potential food network of local product through gravity model with ssrs the food network is a key factor in revealing the interaction between rural and urban areas based on production and consumption in japan rice contributed approximately 30 of the daily caloric intake of an average person in 2012 maff 2016 and 90 of total rice consumption 7 1 106 t yr 1 in 2012 was fulfilled by domestic production fao 2018 as shown in table 1 approximately 6 5 106 t yr 1 of rice in japan was produced between 2000 and 2012 with the tohoku region producing 34 of the total in particular niigata prefecture in the tohoku region produced 0 48 106 t yr 1 while consuming only 0 13 106 t yr 1 thus niigata prefecture is considered the main supplier to other prefectures in national food management in contrast metropolitan areas such as tokyo prefecture consumed more rice than they produced and depended on suppliers in other areas however international or local food trade involves various stakeholders policies and environmental issues thus it is limited to predicting food trade therefore we adapted the concept of ideal food trade determined by market size and distance between production and consumption areas as shown in the gravity model the gravity model was first applied to analyze global trade tinbergen 1962 pöyhönen 1963 and was later applied to different types of flows such as commuting migration information capital activities and freight roy and thill 2004 rodrigue 2009 martinez zarzoso 2003 in addition several empirical applications have been reported to improve the performance of gravity models wei 1996 bougheas et al 1999 egger 2002 antonucci and manzocchi 2006 batra 2006 in this study we analyzed the food network to evaluate the impacts of local food policy on the food water nexus we used the gravity model adapting spatial interaction si between food producing and food demanding areas in the gravity model si can be defined as various movements with the basic assumption that flows are a function of the attributes and the distance between the origins and destinations rodrigue et al 2009 for si simulation in the food network we applied the balance of food supply demand as the attraction factor and the distances among prefectures as the friction factor as shown in equation 1 1 si ij ae i ri j r ij α where siij represents the spatial interaction between prefectures i and j ae is the amount of products available for exports ri is the requirement of product import r is the distance between prefectures and α is the friction parameter although an area produces large amounts of food products the availability of products for export to other areas could be low if the food product requirement is significantly large for example if a local area sets a food policy to increase the consumption of local products the amount of exported products could decrease thus we applied ssr the amount of food products consumed within the area to ae and ri in si as shown in eq 2 2 ae i p i 1 ssr i p i c i ri i c i 1 s s r i p i c i where ae is the amount of products available for exports ri is the requirement of product import p is production c is consumption and ssri is the self supply ratio in prefecture i for example a 50 ssr in an area where the consumption is larger than production indicates that 50 of the total production is supplied to people living in that area the distance between prefectures producer and consumer is considered a friction factor in the rice trade although α should be estimated through observed data there is no available data on rice among the prefectures and we assumed an α of 2 for the food network products are transported through roads or trails but transportation systems are largely complex for example road types in road transportation thus we calculated the straight line distance between the center points in prefectures using arcmap 10 1 the validation is the most important process for applying the gravity model to real world in particular the friction parameter α in the model should be decided through the validation process however it is difficult to get the data about local distribution of products including details of origins and destinations in japan the details about the transportation of rice among prefectures were not available but the local distribution of rice should be important factor for water food governance and integrated resource management accordingly we applied several friction parameters from 1 0 to 2 0 increased by 0 1 and realized the friction parameter from 1 0 to 2 0 did not bring big changes in results thus we applied 2 0 as friction parameter in order to emphasize the influence of distance on local trade as potential situation another limitation is the lack of data to validate the food network simulation only local rice production and consumption data are available in each prefecture and there are no data on food networks among local areas accordingly we first simulated the potential amount of trade among prefectures as shown in eq 3 and compared the production and consumption in each prefecture derived from the food network simulation to historical production and consumption finally we re simulated the food network by adjusting the difference between simulated and historical production and consumption as shown in eq 4 3 ex 1 i j si ij i si ij 1 ri j 4 ex 2 n i j ex 2 n 1 i j i ex 2 n 1 i j 1 r i j ex 2 n 1 i j ex 2 n i j j ex 2 n i j 1 a e i where ex i j is the export from prefecture i to prefecture j ri j is the import requirement in prefecture j ae i is the available export in prefecture i ex n i j is the iteration function of exports from prefecture i to prefecture j and n represents the number of iterations we tried to assess the impacts of them on local food distribution through the methodology in this study however the simulation included complex network of 47 prefectures and the gravity model hardly derives accurate results from single simulation therefore we set observed total production and consumption in each prefecture as the control factors and several iterations were conducted until the simulated values were close to the control factors accordingly we iterated these processes until d i and d j reached to the very small number such as 1 for both ae and ri in all prefectures as shown in eq 5 5 d i j ex 2 n i j ae i d j i ex 2 n 1 i j ri j where d i represents the difference between the sum of simulated exports and ae in prefecture i and d j is the difference between the sum of simulated exports and ri in prefecture j 2 2 analysis of degree centralities of food network network analysis helps understand the connectivity among nodes in particular food production is the main driver of the water food energy nexus for instance water for food is the amount of water for producing food products and it should be the main component of the nexus linking water and food policies in other words changes in food production and consumption affect food transportation deriving virtual water flows embedded in food products food transportation is represented by the complex relationship between production and consumption areas and it could be affected by food policies such as preference for local food or national food security accordingly we understood food transportation as a complex food network considering food policy and analyzed it to quantify the impacts of local food self supply on each producing and consuming area as a scenario through the degree centrality of the food network which represents the number of edges incident on a given node degree centrality considers both the number of trade partners and the volume of each flow freeman et al 1979 degree centrality is divided into in and out degrees by network flow for example in degree centrality is analyzed by the amount of food products imported by each trader whereas out degree centrality considers food products exported by each trader the degree centrality of the food network is represented by eq 6 as follows 6 c i j n f i j n 1 where c i is the degree centrality of node i n is the total number of nodes and f i j is the volume of food products transported between the i t h and j t h nodes 2 3 estimation of connected physical virtual water flows to estimate pwf and vwf the water footprint wf m3 t 1 i e the water volume used for producing one ton of product is an essential factor in this study as wf indicated the irrigation water supply it implied blue wf calculated based on crop water requirement m3 t 1 and yield t ha 1 the pwf indicates the irrigation water supply from water resources such as watersheds to crop areas we assumed that crop areas utilize irrigation water from the watershed where they are located thus we extracted the crop area in each watershed and estimated the irrigation water supply from the watershed to the crop area vwf represents the water entailed in the trade of products and is calculated by multiplying the trade by its associated wf as shown in eqs 7 9 7 w f p c bwu p c production p c 8 p w f w p c w f p c p r o d u c t i v i t y p c c a w p c 9 v w f p d c e x p d c w f p c where wf bwu and production represent the water footprint n e blue water use and yield per year respectively of crop c in producing area p pwf w p c is the pwf from watershed w to producing area p ca w p c is the crop area located in both watershed w and producing area p and productivity represents yield per area t ha 1 of crop c vwf p d c is the vwf from producing area p n e to demanding area d embedded in the result of export ex of crop c pwf is bonded in the watershed and vwf has a larger boundary linking food producing and food demanding areas fig 3 each flow is separated highlighting the scarce relationship between the watershed and food demanding areas however the final consumers of food products live in food demanding areas thus watersheds are linked to food demanding areas in terms of pwf and vwf therefore we calculated pvwf which indicated water flow from the watershed to food demanding areas via food producing areas in physical and virtual forms in this study the wft interaction indicated the dependence of a food demanding area on each watershed as the relationship between the food demanding area and watershed as shown in eq 10 a high wft interaction means that the food demanding area depends on water resources in a specific watershed based on the wft interaction we quantified the pvwf from the watershed to the food demanding area via the food producing area as shown in equation 11 10 wtf i n t e r a c t i o n w i d j k pwf w i p k i p w f w i p k vwf p k d j j v w f p k d j 11 p v w f w i d

to the demanding area d and pvwf w i d j is the physical virtual water flow from the watershed w to the demanding area d wft interaction indicates the ratio of pvwf to the total inflow of virtual water in the food demanding area d 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of potential food network of local rice by ssrs in this study we analyzed the food network of local rice among the 47 prefectures in japan using a gravity model based on import requirements available exports and distances among prefectures to validate the food distribution model we compared simulated results to the observed data of the regional self dependency in 2016 which indicates the proportion of consumption of rice produced at own region as shown in fig 4 in case of weighted distribution under 20 ssr scenario the regional self dependency in tohoku region where is the representative paddy rice area was 83 4 and it was 4 difference from the observation data in 2016 in most regions except for kansai region the simulation of regional self dependency through the weighted distribution was closer to observation in comparison to non weighed distribution however shikoku region showed a large difference between simulation and observation under 20 ssr scenarios even the regional self dependency in shikoku region through the weighted distribution under 20 ssr was calculated to 41 9 but it was still large different from observation 77 3 shikoku region is kinds of big island and it is quite limited to access other regions because only 3 bridges are connected to the hiroshima okayama and hyogo prefectures therefore we believe the regional self dependency of rice was higher than 20 ssr scenarios and fig 4 showed that the self dependency simulated through 60 ssr scenario was getting close to observed one however this study did not intend to define the accurate ssr scenario but we showed that the food distribution model developed in this study could assess the various situation relating to local food security through the adaptation of various ssr scenarios based on simulation the degree of the food network of local rice was analyzed using ssr scenarios under the 20 ssr scenario the chubu hokkaido and kanto regions depended on rice produced in the tohoku region in particular the kanto region imported 43 of its total rice requirement from the tohoku region approximately 45 of the total rice consumed originated from prefectures in the chubu region and 29 came from prefectures in the tohoku region despite the ssr being 20 the kyushu and tohoku regions exhibited the highest self dependency levels regarding rice consumption approximately 79 of the total rice consumed in kyushu was obtained from the prefectures within that region therefore the local self sufficiency of this region was higher than that of other regions and the allocation of local resources for rice production could be the main issue concerning trade offs between local food supply and resource usage in contrast the kansai region showed a more evenly distributed import of rice that is only 30 of its total consumed rice originated from its prefectures and 50 of the total came from the chubu tohoku and chugoku regions 21 18 and 11 respectively when the ssr increased to 60 the regional dependencies among all the regions changed for example the chubu hokkaido and kanto regions still showed high dependency in the tohoku region while increasing their regional self dependencies in the kanto region the ratio of rice consumed from the tohoku region to the total consumption of the region slightly increased because the increase in ssr of all prefectures led to decreasing exports from the hokkaido region to the kanto region hence the kanto region required more rice from the tohoku region in contrast in the shikoku and chugoku regions 60 ssr largely increased regional self dependency compared to that of other regions the kyushu and tohoku regions had high levels of regional self dependency in both the 20 and 60 ssrs because the prefectures in these regions produced substantially more rice than they consumed thus increasing ssr could hardly affect regional self dependency through in and out degree centralities of the food network we found that the results of degree centrality revealed which prefecture was more influenced by the changes in ssrs of local rice as all prefectures intended to increase consumption of local rice produced in their area the scale of the food network was reduced and it was shown by the decrease in in and out degree centralities fig 5 however the impact of ssrs on degree centrality was distinguished by the prefecture and direction of centrality for example the changes in in degree centrality representing food network based on the import of local rice showed that the increase of ssrs in the entire food network more affected the in degree centrality in prefectures located from fourth to the ninth rank under 20 ssr such as aichi saitama chiba hyogo fukuoka and hokkaido the in degree centrality of chiba and hokkaido decreased significantly indicating that a large amount of local rice could be circulated inside the prefecture boundary and that they could afford to reduce imports from various prefectures the statistical data on production and consumption supported the results because these prefectures have a larger production than the consumption of local rice however the in degree centrality of the largest market prefectures tokyo kanagawa and osaka were not significantly influenced by changes in ssrs even though prefectures increase the proportion of local rice in total consumption these prefectures need to be supplied by various prefectures because they account for about 25 of the national consumption of local rice in japan and the proportion of local rice produced in their crop area in total consumption was less than 5 in the food network based on exports fig 5 b shows that variation of the changes in out degree centrality by ssrs is larger than in degree centrality and it indicates that the influence of ssr on the export structure of food networks was differential for example the most significant decrease in out degree centrality was shown in hokkaido and chiba which had second to 11th rank under 20 ssr in summary based on 20 ssr the increase in ssr brought about big changes in the food import network to the second rank group rather than the first rank group but the influence of ssr on the export network was more variable by prefecture these changes in the food network by ssr were connected to water resource management in the way of vwt embedded in the food network and these results were considered the main factor for estimating pvwf in the next chapter 3 2 analysis of internal and external virtual water flows embedded in the food networks as the importance of domestic food products increases agricultural water use in producing areas could become an important issue because rice production could be regarded as the main stakeholder in water management that is 90 of the water withdrawn in agriculture is used in paddy rice fields in japan mlit 2018 according to the japanese ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlit 2018 approximately 51 5 109 m3 yr 1 of water was withdrawn from rice paddy fields from 2000 to 2012 table 2 the rice paddy fields in the tohoku region had the largest annual rice production and withdrew 14 9 109 m3 yr 1 of water that is 29 of the national amount however water withdrawal includes water returning to rivers and 70 of the total water withdrawal is estimated to be the return flow in japanese rice paddy fields masumoto and yoshida 2014 therefore we set the blue vw as the water excluding return flows for total water withdrawal in paddy fields in each region table 2 the tohoku region had the largest production area and the smallest wf 1505 m3 t 1 thus increasing rice production in the tohoku region would contribute to national water conservation in contrast the shikoku region had the largest wf 2253 m3 t 1 based on the food network we analyzed the internal and external vwfs in each region under various ssrs from 20 to 100 fig 6 and table 3 internal and external vwf in a region indicates vwfs between prefectures in the same and different regions respectively the largest internal vwf was observed in the kanto region and the internal vwf increased from 1784 to 2026 106 m3 yr 1 under the 20 and 100 ssr scenarios respectively the kyushu region showed the second largest internal vwf 1387 106 m3 yr 1 under 20 ssr which increased to 1691 106 m3 yr 1 under 100 ssr the chubu region showed the largest increase in internal vwfs from 1017 to 1621 106 m3 yr 1 under 20 and 100 ssr respectively as internal vwf is highly related to integrated pwf such as water allocation at regional boundaries prefectures in the chubu region should be more careful regarding sharing water resources among prefectures in addition the relationship between producing and consuming areas would become closer as ssrs increased and the changes in food production or consumption in a specific area in the chubu region could affect water management in other prefectures in the region in contrast the impact of ssr on internal vwf was small in the case of the tohoku and shikoku regions and the tohoku region exhibited the largest external vwf for example 3229 and 3000 106 m3 yr 1 of vw were exported from the tohoku region under the 20 and 100 ssr scenarios respectively in addition the decrease in the outflow ratio of external vw to other regions upon changing ssr from 20 to 100 was smaller in the case of tohoku than in other regions in contrast the hokkaido and chubu regions exhibited the largest decrease in this ratio which indicated the high sensitivity of the external vw outflow to ssr regarding external vw inflow the kanto region imported the most vw 2756 106 m3 yr 1 approximately 37 of the total vw imported in japan followed by kansai which imported 1680 106 m3 yr 1 of vw under a 20 ssr as the ssr increased from 20 to 100 the largest decrease in external vw inflow was observed in the chubu region from 1204 to 614 106 m3 yr 1 however the chugoku hokkaido kyushu shikoku and tohoku regions had almost no external vw inflow from other regions when the ssr was 100 the results showed that these regions have an adequate rice supply which is weakly influenced by water resources in other regions 3 3 analysis of impacts of ssrs of local rice on connected physical virtual water flows in kansai region through the simulation of pwf and vwf in the kansai region we analyzed the wft interaction representing the dependency of food demanding areas on each watershed and estimated pvwfs from watersheds to food demanding areas fig 7 and table 4 interestingly pvwf changed in watershed and food demanding areas by changing ssrs because of complex interlinkages among watershed producing and demanding areas in this study we applied concept of pvwf to specific region with simulation results of vwf in total regions first as the study area of pvwf we considered the area including main food consumption area and production area in addition to several watersheds thus kansai area includes osaka as main food consumption area hyogo as main food production area and 4 watersheds in addition various scale of prefectures such as kyoto shiga nara and wakayama are located in kansai region in particular these prefectures are sharing the watersheds as main water resource for producing rice osaka was directly related to the eastern watershed however osaka s pvwf could indirectly affect the northern watershed because a large amount of rice was imported from hyogo using irrigation water from the northern watershed as the main water resource in the 20 ssr the pvwf was estimated to be 189 17 106 m3 yr 1 from the northern watershed to osaka in the food producing area of the northern watershed and it showed that osaka has a higher wft interaction with the northern watershed than other watersheds in addition osaka has a large amount of pvwf from the eastern watershed even though only 33 4 106 m3 yr 1 of water from the eastern watershed was used for rice production in osaka the pvwf from the eastern watershed to osaka was estimated to be 161 59 106 m3 yr 1 and most of them were flown via producing area in shiga which exported 90 7 106 m3 yr 1 vw to osaka in 20 ssr however as the ssr increased to 100 the dependency on the northern watershed decreased and the dependency on the eastern and southern watersheds increased even though the total pvwf from watersheds in the kansai region decreased from 541 75 106 m3 yr 1 20 ssr to 291 85 106 m3 yr 1 100 ssr because of increasing rice imports from outside the kansai region to osaka the pvwf from the eastern watershed to kyoto and shiga simultaneously increased the pvwf from the eastern watershed to kyoto was estimated to be 56 85 106 m3 yr 1 under the food network with 20 ssr and it increased to 79 81 106 m3 yr 1 with 100 ssr the largest increase was shown in shiga by increasing ssr and the 134 8 106 m3 yr 1 pvwf was increased in addition the pvwf from the watershed to nara also increased accordingly the eastern watershed management should consider the pwf to hyogo and shiga and also the indirect supply through vwf to the predominant consuming prefectures in other words the changes in food policy consumption pattern and population in kyoto shiga and nara should be considered more important in the water management plan of the eastern watershed the northern watershed is an important water resource for the food producing area in hyogo kyoto and other prefectures outside the kansai region thus the conflict of water resources would be an important issue for both the internal and external kansai regions hyogo also had an extensive interaction as a food demanding area with the northern watershed and pvwf from the northern watershed to hyogo was quantified as 135 09 106 m3 yr 1 as the ssr increased the amount of pvwf to hyogo from the northern watershed increased and the pvwf under the food network with 100 ssr was estimated to be 214 12 106 m3 yr 1 in the case of western watersheds the pvwf to hyogo increased from 41 53 106 m3 yr 1 20 ssr to 193 8 106 m3 yr 1 100 ssr therefore the northern and western watersheds were considered the main water resources for food producing areas and significant water resource for food consumers in hyogo as people prefer local food products therefore water management in these watersheds should bring food consumers as indirect stakeholders however an increase in the ssr led to increased pvwf to hyogo in the northern and western watersheds and decreased in the eastern and southern watersheds these results show how each watershed is related to food demanding areas and changes in local food networks affect the relationship between them traditional water management policy in watersheds focusing on water requirements in food producing areas should be extended to include food demanding areas through pvwfs therefore new water management should physically integrate watersheds and irrigation and link watersheds and food trade through the pvwf the changes in local food policy relating to food supply demand preference for local food products food consumption patterns and population should play important roles in water food management accordingly the concept of pvwfs from watershed to food demanding areas via producing areas could be applied to assess the interaction among water food and trade becoming an important factor for the wft nexus even though these results specifically corresponded to the kansai region 4 limitations but possibilities the domestic distribution of food products is more directly related to resource management such as water land and energy concerning governance and integrated water food management it is important to analyze the local distribution of food among prefectures and assess the impacts of local food security in each prefecture on integrated water food management the methodology in this study assumed the potential situation of local distribution of rice and applied several scenarios related to local food security with potential impacts of distances using the gravity model we believe it could show various possibilities and the outcomes could be used as a guideline for integrated national regional local food and water management however there are limitations in methodology validation and application for example we applied different self supply in each prefecture as ssr scenarios which represents local food security policy and we could assess the impacts of them on local food distribution through the methodology however we set observed total production and consumption in each prefecture as the control factors and several iterations were conducted until the simulated values were close to the control factors in order to reduce the bias and error of simulation although this study focused on domestic rice trade with constant international trade the gravity model approach could be adapted to reflect changes in international trade for example the food self sufficiency increases in japan due to national policy would encourage domestic production moreover the market size of production increases in contrast the decrease in paddy fields could decrease domestic production and japan would increase rice imports from other countries thus the changes in international trade could be related to production within the gravity model and the impact of international trade on the local food network could be assessed however we would need to determine which prefectures exhibit the largest increase even though the amount of international import and export could be quantified in other words international trade affects various situations and variables including national and local food supply domestic production changes and the international trade network regarding applicability and contribution this study focused on the food network of domestic rice in japan which seems to be an exclusive case study with little applicability to international cases several studies on international food trade or water security have focused on the interlinkage between countries rather than the downscaled impacts on local or regional areas asian countries such as thailand taiwan vietnam japan and south korea produce large amounts of rice for domestic consumption with a large irrigation water supply furthermore they also have high levels of self sufficiency of rice thus local distribution of rice could be an important factor for managing local regional national food and irrigation water in addition we believe that this approach could be connected to agrarian region where water consumption is very high level and major contributor to the national economies abhishek kinouchi 2021 abhishek et al 2021 for example resource governance or integrated resource management could be considered a way of sustainable management and the distribution of domestic food could be more feasible than international trade concerning resource governance even if great deals of food products are traded between countries it is difficult to apply integrated water food management that include countries because water food are highly dependent upon spatial characteristics and boundaries of management as well as local government however local policy of food security or water management could relate to production in other local areas accordingly we need to analyze the food transportation between local areas and water food dependency on other local areas in addition it is important to understand the gap between the national food policy and local situation especially in the countries where domestic production occupies a large proportion of food security 5 conclusions traditionally integrated water management in a region considered parallel watersheds for example the total water withdrawal in a region is calculated as the sum of the water withdrawal in each watershed in addition urban areas are rarely included in agricultural water management at the regional level thus it was difficult to propose a single transboundary water policy for rural and urban areas this study integrated pwf and vwf through a food network for transboundary water management our results demonstrated that the watershed could be related to the main consumption areas mainly urban areas allowing transboundary water management beyond a physical water boundary to be dynamic depending on the food policy from this study we found that the physical water in watershed was connected to virtual water flow as new transboundary water management the urban area as food consumers could be considered as main stakeholder of water management in rural area physical virtual water flow was highly influenced by the self supply of local food most of the existing research is based on theories such as life cycle focusing on the quantification of pwf and vwf the research method of this paper is a new one which is easier to implement first this study embedded vwt into the water food nexus taking into account the impact of changes in food trading on the entire nexus second as long as there is the total amount of food production and consumption in the study area the local food trading network can be simulated to estimate the water translocation this is a new way of thinking that integrated pwf and vwf which enriched the content of food water linkages and provided a new perspective for water resource management in summary resource governance or integrated resource management would be more feasible on a local or regional scale than international moreover the food network and internal vwfs could be important factors for multiple stakeholders within integrated spatial boundaries despite its limitations this study s attempt to bring food networks to transboundary water management linking physical and virtual water flows may help develop useful frameworks for connecting water and food management and producing and consuming areas credit authorship contribution statement sang hyun lee conceptualization methodology formal analysis visualization

1757,information entropy theory has been largely applied in hydrology and water resource engineering recently entropy theory has received significant attention for describing reactive solute mixing and transport processes in ground water and surface water and for its applications in water quality management however analytical expressions of the entropy index of riverine water quality dynamics are often not included in the literature in this study the analytical expressions of the spatial information entropy index gx in the 1d steady state transport process under full extent observation and tracking observations are derived after the definition of the system boundary and probability space the expressions of gx were successfully validated by field data from two tracer experiments and the different characteristics of gx under different riverine hydraulic situations were uncovered the formula of gx shows a reasonable linkage with the peclet number pe in hydrodynamics this indicates that gx is a physical quantity describing or linking to the real world more than a statistical index and in practice similar decision or management measurements based on entropy theory can be made for rivers with similar pe conditions hydrologists will benefit in many ways from analytical expressions such as theoretical analysis quick calculation of the entropy index preliminary engineering design etc a clearly defined example of maximum entropy time tgmax and its application in water quality evaluation monitoring optimization and pollution source identification are demonstrated these new findings will provide a convenient tool for catchment water quality management keywords analytical expression information entropy solute transport tracer experiments water quality dynamics data availability the field data used can be download in the references of the paper 1 introduction analyzing the transport of water quality components in natural water systems and extracting key spatial and temporal information to characterize pollution can guide the management and control of water in the environment river water quality systems can be characterized by physical chemical and biological water quality variables which can illustrate the input output transport and reactions of pollutants in a typical river lintern et al 2018 solute transport and reactivity are the main drivers contributing to the complexity of water quality systems kirchner 2009 at present riverine water quality dynamics have been extensively investigated by physical process based approaches in hydrology and water resource engineering riverine water quality dynamics pursue the fundamental description of the temporal and spatial distribution of aquatic pollutants i e the reductionism in philosophy methodologies of system theory are emerging as the applications of big data and data science have recently become more prevalent this type of approach includes temporal fractural theory kirchner et al 2000 chaos theory sivakumar 2000 information entropy theory singh 2014 etc they are more or less relative to statistics among them information entropy theory as the measurement of complexity or uncertainty is becoming an effective tool to characterize and analyze the solute transport process both in surface water and ground water chiogna et al 2012 chiogna and rolle 2017 kitanidis 1994 senf 1983 information entropy theory is a sound tool to describe water quality dynamics as a whole shannon 1948 initially laid the foundation of informational entropy theory and used it to quantify the degree of uncertainty for a random variable x that takes on values xi occurring with probability pi i 1 2 n respectively 1 h x i 1 n p i log p i where h is termed informational entropy shannon entropy or simply entropy entropy theory has been more widely applied in hydrology and water resources in practice the application of entropy theory can be classified into two directions one is to use information entropy analysis to build water quality evolution and model evaluation frameworks and the other to use entropy as objective function in water optimization problems in the first direction some scholars have attempted the theoretical analysis of solute transport by information entropy theory it is valuable for uncovering new physical insights and stimulating new management concepts as early as 1983 senf 1983 derived the critical time for functional information to increase to the maximum value in a one dimensional diffusion model and mentioned that there existed an optimal time in the process of information diffusion in measuring diffusion in 1994 kitanidis 1994 introduced the concept of the dilution index based on entropy theory as a quantitative descriptor of informational entropy of concentration in the dilution process and analyzed the change rule of the dilution index under gaussian diffusion following this concept chiogna et al 2012 found that the flux related dilution index can be used as a measurement to quantify mixing in geophysical flows if the derivative of the natural logarithm of the dilution index is negative reactive mixing processes are dominant over dilution processes while dilution is the dominant mechanism when the derivative is positive in 2017 chiogna and rolle 2017 further proposed the idea of the critical dilution index and critical reaction time and analyzed the spatial and temporal changes in the critical dilution index under three flow situations for water quality analysis amiri et al 2014 used entropy to calculate the weight of each physical and chemical parameter and derived a comprehensive parameter i e the entropy weighted water quality index ewqi for groundwater quality assessment xie et al 2022 proposed a correlation coefficient based information criterion ccic for quantifying the dependence characteristics in hydrological time series combining the index of correlation coefficient and the information entropy index neri et al 2022 used transfer entropy to characterize the catchment behavior in the streamflow generation processes the other direction is to consider the information entropy index as an objective function and guide the water environment management and decision making it has been an emerging active research field including measuring the uncertainty in hydrological systems aksentijevic et al 2021 liu et al 2016 hydrometric network design alfonso et al 2012 alfonso et al 2010a alfonso et al 2010b hydrological clustering ridolfi et al 2016 water quality networks in sewers banik et al 2017 khorshidi et al 2018 mahjouri and kerachian 2011 cross section selection for river modeling ridolfi et al 2014 and parameter calibration singh and singh 1985a singh and singh 1985b for river modeling for example bertini et al 2021 gave an entropy based method to optimize an existing rain gauge network and pointed out that the resulting optimal network provides higher joint entropy which means more information captured by as few sensors as possible ursulak and coulibaly 2021 developed a hydrological model integrated with entropy and multi objective optimization for designing streamflow monitoring networks du et al 2022 integrated six entropy indexes based on the reliability and stability to assess the complexity of precipitation as a rapid growth theory in recent years vijay p singh gave several reviews on the application of entropy theory in hydraulic engineering hydrologic systems and engineering singh 2014 singh 2015 singh 2016 among those entropy theory based applications the principle of maximum entropy pome first introduced by jaynes jaynes 1957 jaynes 1980 has been widely used in many scientific and engineering areas in practice such as ecology xing and hao 2011 and statistical physics pressé et al 2013 in water resource areas pome can be applied in the derivation of the probability distribution of hydrological frequency analysis chen et al 1993 maximum entropy spectrum analysis of time series hydrological stochastic process modeling wang and zhu 2001 and aquatic parameter evaluation xiao and song 2010 especially in the field of risk analysis and risk management guo et al 2017 vijay p singh and k singh estimated two parameter distributions commonly used in hydrology gamma distribution singh and singh 1985a and pearson type iii distribution singh and singh 1985b based on pome compared with other parameter estimation methods such as moment estimation maximum likelihood estimation and least square estimation pome does not require the use of the coefficient of skewness which can reduce the bias in the estimation of parameters additionally the calculation of pome is simpler and faster making pome widely used in machine learning gharari et al 2021 wang et al 2007 most often the spatiotemporal distribution of solutes is output by water quality models and then the given entropy index is calculated by the statistical definition of entropy e g eq 1 if the water quality model has an analytical solution it is possible to obtain an analytical expression of the entropy index in many situations analytical solutions of the advection dispersion reaction equation are found after simplification and those analytical solutions are commonly used in catchment management practices singh and woolhiser 2002 zeunert and meon 2020 however few studies have reported on the derivation of analytical expressions of entropy indexes on the area of solute transport in ground or surface water to the best of our knowledge only analytical expressions of the entropy based dilution index e have been reported using objects of uniform flow shear flow and complex flow topology in groundwater chiogna and rolle 2017 there is a knowledge gap in the analytical expressions of the entropy index of riverine water quality dynamics in the literature analytical expressions are important because they allow for building a mathematical description of physical processes as opposed to empirical expressions which are built via data analysis methods to find relationships among variables in addition the provided analytical expressions relate the information entropy index and hydrodynamic parameters making it possible to quickly calculate the information entropy index when the hydrodynamic parameters are known this is significant because the expressions can be used to analyze simple water quality processes for example the analytical expression of the information index can be used to find critical pollution points such as in one dimensional riverine solute transport processes analogous to finding the minima of the oxygen sag curve in the biochemical oxygen demand dissolved oxygen bod do process in surface water quality maleewong and hasadsri 2013 the analytical entropy expressions will also be effective in any domain to which pome is applied as described in the works mentioned above scientists and engineers have always strived to obtain analytical expressions or solutions even when good computational resources are available taking groundwater areas as an example liang et al 2019 developed a novel semianalytical model for solute transport with linear reactions in layered heterogeneous media which could be used to investigate solute transport in layered heterogeneous media in 2d spaces and to interpret the observed btcs in laboratory experiments liang et al 2019 chen et al 2011 and liao et al 2021 developed analytical solutions for the two dimensional advection dispersion equation ade in cylindrical coordinates and three dimensional multispecies situations respectively which brought high efficiency in computing and risk assessment at contaminated groundwater sites therefore the purposes of this study are to derive analytical expressions of the information entropy index of riverine water quality dynamics and discuss their potential applications and advantages the paper first defines the domain discretization of information entropy according to the difference in the concentration gradient in section 2 section 3 illustrates the process of deriving the analytical expressions of the spatial information entropy index in two patterns full extent observation and tracking observation water quality dynamics mainly focus on the one dimensional steady state convection diffusion process since this model generalization is largely used in catchment management practices in section 4 we verify expressions with field tracer experimental data and analyze the characteristics of information entropy indexes under different hydraulic conditions the availability of analytical expressions of other information entropy indexes and applications for water quality management such as monitoring network design and pollutant source identification are then discussed followed by the application of the expressions in a numeric case finally we conclude with our core findings in section 5 with prospects for further research 2 definition of the boundary and domain discretization of entropy 2 1 definition of spatial entropy index gx and physical terms to estimate information entropy the domain under study needs to be discretized in water quality processes it is possible to do this in many ways one is by discretizing the variable according to its values of dispersion of solute plume in space as the dilution index does chiogna et al 2012 chiogna and rolle 2017 another way is to discretize the variable of interest in various subspaces for example by characteristic parameters at different places for example spatial configuration entropy rodríguez iturbe et al 1998 discretizes the number of cells of the domain according to the value of precipitation with respect to a threshold in a certain domain in this study we focus on the second method to define the domain discretization for deriving the spatial entropy index as it is less commonly explored the spatial entropy index gx measures the complexity of spatial pattern diversion a different sequence of spatial parameters e g different concentration levels of one water quality parameter at different monitoring stations we choose the concentration of solute as the characteristic parameter for discretization for one spatial distribution curve at a specific time as shown in fig 1 a consider the river section containing solute plume as the system boundary there exists a minimum concentration c min and a maximum concentration c max in this section we divide the concentration interval c min c max into n parts the end points of the interval are recorded as c 0 c 1 cn c 0 c min cn c max assuming that the concentration record data are discrete and each concentration record belongs to one of these concentration intervals we calculate the ratio of the amount of data in one concentration interval with respect to the whole data and then derive a probability distribution in terms of the concentration gradient distribution according to the difference in the spatial and temporal concentration gradient distributions using the definition equation of information entropy eq 1 we can define the spatial information entropy index eq 2 2 g x t k 1 n p g x k t ln p g x k t where p g x k t is the ratio of the number of records which the concentration c x t belongs to the kth concentration interval ck 1 ck to the number of records in the whole concentration interval c min c max it represents the probability that how records are distributed in different concentration intervals and illustrates the interval gradient uncertainty in the spatial distribution of solute concentrations 3 p g x k t c k 1 c x t c k d x c min c x t c max d x as the number of concentration intervals results of random event is defined by n the spatial entropy index gx has a maximum value g x m a x l n n to make these indexes comparable it is necessary to normalize them therefore we put out normalized spatial entropy index gxn 4 g xn g x ln n where the range of gxn is 0 1 2 2 analytical solutions of 1d steady state solute transport the solute transport process in rivers is the main focus process of this paper here solute refers to relatively stable soluble particles such as bod ammonia tracers rhodamine b etc the premise of deriving the analytical expression of the information entropy index is to obtain the analytical solution of concentrations in the solute transport process which is a necessary condition the partial differential function of the one dimensional river water quality model is presented in eq 5 5 c t d x 2 c x 2 u x c x k c 0 where c concentration of solute mg l dx longitudinal diffusion coefficient m2 s ux advent velocity of the river m s k degradation coefficient of solute s 1 to simplify the real world pollution release and transport processes scientists and engineers have obtained several analytical solutions of eq 5 under particular boundary and initial conditions one of the most commonly used situations is steady state instantaneous point source transport the analytical solution is shown in eq 6 which can be obtained by the laplace transform and inverse transform details can be found in classical literature or course textbooks evans 2010 6 c x t m a 4 π d x t e x u x t 2 4 d x t e k t where c x t concentration of solute at space x and time t

solute s 1 in this study the derivation of the analytical expression of the information entropy index is based on the 1d steady state solute transport case 2 3 derivation of expression for domain discretization for full extent observation different spatial and temporal discretizations have different uses at different scales although they may represent the same physical process on the one hand large scale water quality management problems require full extent observations with large discretization grids in time and space which are the base for conventional monitoring networks on the other hand emergency monitoring and pollutant source identification are issues characterized by variable changes on relatively short spatial and temporal scales thus discretization needs to be made according to the needs below a mathematical definition of the boundary and domain discretization of the spatial entropy index at a particular time t is given under full extent observation with the spatial boundary length x in this condition the time t is a constant the peak of concentration appears at x max u x t the peak value of concentration at the nearest monitoring time the first monitoring time is 7 c x t max 1 m e k t 1 a 4 π d x t 1 where c x t max 1 the peak concentration at the first monitoring time mg l t 1 first monitoring time s dx longitudinal diffusion coefficient m2 s the boundary is defined as the range of concentration i e 0 c x t max 1 the domain is discretized into n intervals c 0 c 1 c 1 c 2 ci ci 1 cn 1 cn where 8 c i i n c x t max 1 i 0 1 n particularly c0 0 cn c x t max 1 in this way the concentration space is divided into n concentration gradient subspaces according to the law of large numbers n shall be generally 20 to be acceptable for statistics of distribution characteristics for a typical solute transport process the spatial distribution curve of the pollutant usually has only one peak defined as x max before with the concentration rising where x x max and falling where x x max under full extent observation the spatial boundary length of the observation system i e the total length of the study area from upstream to downstream is a constant which is marked as x in fig 1a now we divide study area x into several intervals according to the concentration gradient subspaces for the study area where x x max we define 9 i i x i 1 x i 1 1 i 0 1 n 1 where xi 1 xi 1 1 meets c x i 1 t c i i n c x t max 1 c x i 1 1 t c i 1 i 1 n c x t max 1 xi 1 xi 1 1 x max similarly for the study area where x x max we define 10 i 2 n 1 i x i 1 2 x i 2 i 0 1 n 1 where xi 2 xi 1 2 meets c x i 2 t c i i n c x t max 1 c x i 1 2 t c i i 1 n c x t max 1 x max xi 1 2 xi 2 in particular we define x 0 1 0 x 0 2 x xn 1 xn 2 x max in this way we divide study area x into 2 n sub intervals and the concentration of solute in each sub interval falls into only one specified concentration subspace each concentration subspace corresponds to 2 sub intervals the concentration subspace ci ci 1 corresponds to ii xi 1 xi 1 1 and i 2 n 1 i xi 1 2 xi 2 as shown in fig 1a specifically the concentration subspace c 0 c 1 corresponds to i 0 x 0 1 x 1 1 and i 2 n 1 x 1 2 x 0 2 and the concentration subspace cn 1 cn corresponds to in 1 xn 1 1 xn 1 and in xn 2 xn 1 2 eq gives a definition of domain discretization for discrete time series of concentration values by calculating the likelihood that a point on the spatial distribution curve x c falls into each concentration subspace ci ci 1 i 0 1 n 1 let λ i i n be the order fraction of concentration gradients considering eq 11 11 m a 4 π d x t e x u x t 2 4 d x t e k t c i λ i c x t max 1 solving eq 11 we can yield the two roots i e the boundaries of sub intervals 12 x i 1 u x t 4 d x t ln λ i 13 x i 2 u x t 4 d x t ln λ i the difference between the two roots is 14 δ x i x i 2 x i 1 4 d x t ln λ i in eq 3 the probability p g x k t is calculated with discrete concentration records for continuous data time series of concentration values the probability marked as pi 1 i 0 1 n 1 that one record xr cr belongs to a specific concentration subspace ci ci 1 i e ii xi 1 xi 1 1 and i 2 n 1 i xi 1 2 xi 2 can be calculated according to the geometric probability in probability theory the probability pi 1 equals the ratio of the sum of the length of two sub intervals ii xi 1 xi 1 1 i 2 n 1 i xi 1 2 xi 2 and the length of the study area x according to eq 14 we can derive the probability distribution of the spatial entropy index p i 1 p λ i c x t max 1 c x t λ i 1 c x t max 1 x i 1 1 x i 1 x i 2 x i 1 2 x δ x i δ x i 1 x 15 4 d x t x ln λ i ln λ i 1 after calculating the probabilities p corresponding to each concentration subspace ci ci 1 a probability distribution histogram can be drawn as shown in fig 1b 2 4 definition of the boundary and domain discretization of entropy as tracking observation under tracking observations the spatial boundary length of the observation system varies according to different monitoring times usually based on a pollutant plume where the pollutant concentration is significant it is generally believed that the observation range of a pollution plume can be defined by the pollutant concentration in which the concentration is greater than a critical value e g 1 5 of the maximum concentration as is marked x 1 in fig 1a fig 1c shows the difference between the full extent observation and tracking observation tracking observation discards i 0 and i 2 n 1 in the full extent observation and takes the combination of remaining intervals as the boundary of tracking observation we found that the peak value of concentration at the initial time t t 1 is c x t max 1 m e k t 1 a 4 π d x t 1 we divided the concentration range 0 c x t max 1 into n intervals 0 1 n c x t max 1 1 n c x t max 1 2 n c x t max 1 n 1 n c x t max 1 c x t max 1 and make 1 n c x t max 1 the critical value then the length of the tracking observation boundary is fig 1 16 x 1 4 d x t 1 ln n we can derive the probability distribution from eq 15 p i 1 p λ i c x t max 1 c x t λ i 1 c x t max 1 δ x i 1 δ x i 1 1 x 1 17 4 d x t 1 x 1 ln λ i ln λ i 1 where x 1 the length of the observation interval at the first monitoring time under tracking observation m λi λi i n depends on n i 1 2 n 1 3 derivation of an analytical expression of the spatial entropy index 3 1 analytical expression of spatial entropy index gx at initial time t1 as full extent observation since there is a singularity at t 0 there will be a logical error of dividing by 0 in the derivation and the derivation starts at t t 1 the discrete precision of time δt is not considered in fact the entropy index gx is defined as 0 where t 0 first consider the analytical expression of the spatial entropy index gx at the initial time t t 1 generally the spatial boundary length x contains the subintervals i 0 x 0 1 x 1 1 and i 2 n 1 x 1 2 x 0 2 then 18 p 1 1 p 0 c x t λ 1 c x t max 1 x 1 1 x 0 1 x 0 2 x 1 2 x x δ x 1 1 x 1 4 d x t 1 ln λ 1 x according to eq 15 the probability distribution of the spatial entropy index on other concentration gradients is p i 1 1 p λ i c x t max 1 c x t λ i 1 c x t max 1 δ x i 1 δ x i 1 1 x 19 4 d x t 1 x ln λ i ln λ i 1 spatial information entropy is 20 g x 1 1 4 d x t 1 ln λ 1 x ln 1 4 d x t 1 ln λ 1 x i 1 n 1 4 d x t 1 x ln λ i ln λ i 1 ln 4 d x t 1 x ln λ i ln λ i 1 to make it more concise let a and b be defined as a 4 i 1 n 1 ln λ i ln λ i 1 ln 4 ln λ i ln λ i 1 b 4 i 1 n 1 ln λ i ln λ i 1 therefore eq 15 becomes 21 g x 1 1 4 d x t 1 ln n x ln 1 4 d x t 1 ln n x a d x t 1 x b d x t 1 x ln d x t 1 x where x the length of the full extent observation boundary m a b coefficients that are functions of n we can see that the information entropy at the earliest time point closest to release time is a function of d x t 1 x 3 2 analytical expression of spatial entropy index gx at subsequent moments as full extent observation for other moments after t 1 the spatial distribution

power of the peclet number pe which is a dimensionless number in hydrodynamics defined by the ratio of the convection rate to the diffusion rate in the transmission phenomenon 36 pe ul d x where l is the characteristic length herein l can be the interval length of the full extent boundary x thus interestingly the spatial entropy index gx is actually a function of the peclet number and m corresponding only with k see eq 23 in terms of the analytical expression this is an exciting discovery because it means that this statistical index has a physical interpretation that is the correlation of the spatial entropy index and peclet number indicates that different solute transport patterns can be classified by the value of the peclet number which is a quantitative method this implies that two different river catchments with different hydrological parameters and similar entropic evolution patterns have similar peclet numbers if follows decisions based on entropy theory can be made for rivers with similar pe conditions in practice table 1 summarizes the analytical expressions of the spatial entropy index gx under different observations 4 validation and discussion 4 1 validation of the information entropy index by field data from tracer experiments the derived analytical expressions can be further verified by field data from tracer studies to demonstrate the application of the spatial entropy index in the situations of full extent observation and tracking observation two datasets of previous studies were chosen the tracer study on the goldersbach river in southwestern germany in 2013 lemke et al 2013 was selected for the case of full extent observation whereas the tracer study on the coosa river in alabama us in 1984 gardner 1985 was selected for the case of tracking observation 1 tracer test on river goldersbach germany 2013 in 2013 a fluorescent tracer test was conducted in the goldersbach river which is located in stuttgart southwestern germany fig 2 a a combination of fluorescein and resazurin as conservative and reactive tracers respectively was used a total of 8 70 10 3 mol of fluorescein and 1 13 10 1 mol of resazurin were premixed and injected into the river instantaneously monitoring and sampling were performed at ms1 ms2 and ms3 at 830 1075 and 1210 m distances downstream of the injection site the monitoring interval was 5 min and 254 samples of fluorescein and 223 samples of resazurin were collected during the study the time span of this tracer test is 8 5 h but because the tracer test only recorded the data of pollutant concentration in three monitoring stations the space boundary is small so when the concentration data are divided into three space sections the data of three monitoring stations are placed in three space intervals 800 900 m 1000 1100 m and 1100 1200 m the time interval was set as 0 5 h after partitioning the average pollutant concentration data in each time interval of 900 1000 m were obtained by the interpolation method finally the time space distribution heatmap of the concentration is drawn as shown in fig 2b and 2c after interpolation the tracer test data are evenly distributed in a rectangular area with a time interval of 1 5 10 h and a space interval of 800 1200 m this accords with the analysis condition of full extent observation 2 tracer study on the coosa river near childersberg us 1984 a tracer study was performed on the coosa river by the usgs and alabama environment protection agency from oct 27 to 31 1984 the study reach is between the logan martin dam and wilsonville alabama us which is 23 miles long fig 3 a rhodamine wt dye was used as a tracer for this study seventy pounds of rhodamine wt dye was injected from 0810 h and ended at 1625 h on oct 27 1984 forty five sampling cross sections were established at approximately one half mile intervals along the 23 mile study reach and approximately 2 300 samples were collected at these cross sections during the study to see the spatial and temporal distribution of samples directly we sort the samples by dividing them into groups by such intervals 2 h in time and 0 5 miles in space and draw a heat distribution of samples fig 3b the data samples are more evenly distributed around the center of the plume center despite some of the intervals this accords with the analysis condition of tracking observation on the one hand we use a statistical method to calculate the spatial entropy index directly with the real field data after interpolation according to the definition given in section 2 2 on the other hand we can use the field data to estimate parameters such as dx ux and k to determine the analytical curve of gx from the derived expression taking the tracer study on the coosa river as an example with the real field data of the rwt sample gx is calculated by the step by step method that is all field data in two adjacent rows are recorded gx is not calculated if the amount of data is less than eight records otherwise the domain is discretized into 25 subspace intervals according to the maximum concentration value before calculating and gx is calculated by statistical results that the field data fall in the corresponding subspace interval analytical expressions eq 21 for full extent observation and by eq 34 for tracking observation are used to calculate gx in another way the parameters needed are given by the tracer test report as listed in table 2 the number of subspace intervals in probability space n 25 in the calculation the corresponding information entropy indexes were calculated together with the results calculated by analytical expressions of information entropy indexes according to the hydrological conditions provided by the tracer studies the comparison between entropy indexes by data and entropy indexes by analytical expressions is shown in fig 4 from fig 4a and b we can see that the actual value of the information entropy of fluorescein and resazurin is 1 2 nat at 2 h and then it increases the highest value appears at 4 5 h and the maximum value of information entropy is approximately 2 nat after 5 h the information entropy of the two tracers decreased sharply with the passage of time and decreased to 0 at 7 h the first data point in shallow blue in fig 4a and b represents the monitoring timestamp where t 2 h and it is lower than the following points according to the heat distribution shown in fig 2b and 2c the peak value of the pollutant plume for t 2 h should appear at approximately 600 800 m which was not recorded in the dataset and this leads to incomplete origin data the peak value shares a very important proportion in gx therefore the loss of peak value makes gx for t 2 h smaller than expected from fig 4c we can see that the gx by observation data is the highest at 18 h which is 1 8 nat then it decreases gradually with time and decreases to 0 at 80 h the gx derived from observation data is similar to the theoretical value under tracking observation conditions but the actual value is 0 5 nat higher than the theoretical value on average the difference between the theoretical value and actual value may be due to the incomplete record of the tracer data 4 2 changes in the spatial information entropy index gx under different river situations the derived analytical expressions can also be applied in different rivers with diverse hydrological conditions to investigate this we first give the values of the parameters required for the analytical expression eq 28 according to the calibration results of the truckee river tracer test in nevada 2006 crompton 2008 diffusion coefficient d 40 5 m2 s flow velocity u 1 3 m s degradation coefficient k 10 7 then observe the change of spatial information entropy index by changing the value of each parameter in other words we performed a sensitivity analysis of gx to different hydrological conditions highlighted by dx and k as the variable ux does not appear in the analytical expression its value does not affect the entropy value fig 5 shows the changes in the spatial information entropy index under different river situations gx varied proportionally with dx specifically when dx increased or decreased by 10 gx increased or decreased by 4 moreover the ratio of the change in entropy value gx to parameter dx is relatively constant which is not obvious with the change in monitoring time t the change in k affects m and with the change in m coefficients a m and b m also change so the influence of the curve shape is greater than that of dx as m is affected by the monitoring time t the greater t is the more sensitive the entropy gx is to the change in parameter k from the perspective of physical processes diffusion processes and degradation processes have a significant impact on the mixing rate of solutes thus they have a great impact on the spatial information entropy index however the convection process only changes the position of the pollution mass in the river when it reaches a certain mixing state and does not affect the mixing rate of the pollution plume therefore the spatial information entropy index is related to diffusion and degradation but not to convection 4 3 availability of analytical expressions of other information entropy indexes the previous discussion mainly focused on the analytical expression of gx under a 1d steady state solute transport process and whether other analytical expressions for entropy indexes and river scenarios are of interest we wonder if the analytical expression of the dilution index can also be obtained and can be applied in water quality process analysis which is similar to the spatial entropy index to this end we use the dilution index e first introduced by kitanidis 1994 which is defined as eq 37 37 e δ v exp k 1 n p k ln p k the logarithm of dilution index has a familiar expression with entropy however the definition of probability for the dilution index is the ratio of the mass of solute in one spatial interval bins to the total mass in the given boundary which is different from that for gx 38 p x t c x t v c x t d v another difference between e and gx is that e depends only weakly on the discretization methods the number of bins n as δv appears in the definition of e the unit of e is related to the unit of bins e g m3 for δv while gx has nat as the unit a comparison case between the normalized logarithm of dilution index ln en and the normalized spatial information entropy index gxn based on the same solute transport process case is shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows that the normalized logarithm dilution index is increasing over time the decrease in the latter curve is due to the diffusion of solute beyond the boundary and is not accounted for in fact the lager dilution index represents the more uniform mixing with each bin have the same concentration the normalized spatial information entropy index has a process of first increasing and then decreasing and there is a maximum value within the boundary which means various concentration intervals exist within boundary at the time spot chiogna et al 2012 reported that the changes in e refract the time evolution of the thermodynamic system of river water quality the spatial information entropy index is expected to reflect the characteristics of river water quality systems from different perspectives besides e and gx there are other kinds of entropy indexes temporal entropy index gt is similar to gx however it measures the complexity of temporal pattern diversion the expression of gt and the corresponding probability term p g t k x are defined as follows 39 g t x k 1 n p g t k x ln p g t k x 40 p g t k x c k 1 c x t c k d t c min c x t c max d t the meanings of c min c max and ck 1 ck are the same as that in the definition of gx the difference is that the records used for gt are concentration time series at a specific spatial point the probability term p g t k x is still the ratio of the number of records which the concentration c x t belongs to the kth concentration interval ck 1 ck to the number of records in the whole concentration interval c min c max however here it illustrates the interval gradient uncertainty in the temporal distribution of solute concentrations temporal entropy index is often used for time series characteristic analysis some entropy indexes like permutation entropy pe can be seen as a derivative of time information entropy and applied in water quality managements eguiraun et al 2014 in section 2 we derive the analytical expression of the spatial entropy index gx under full extent observation and tracking observation however for temporal entropy index gt the formula contains both square root and logarithm functions making it difficult to obtain an analytical solution directly therefore the analytical expression of the temporal entropy index gt is still unknown fourier transform may be required for deriving an analytical expression of the temporal entropy index the analytical expression of the spatial entropy index gx is for one dimensional steady state transport with a one point pollutant source which is the simplest situation in water transport processes for more complex situations such as multidiscrete sources or continuous sources we can calculate the entropy index for each point source first and then obtain the change in the overall entropy index according to the linear superposition principle another way to obtain an analytical expression of the entropy index is to use fourier analysis to split the complex pollution source into the form of addition of the fourier function calculate the analytical expressions for each fourier function and then add them water quality processes including more than one water quality parameter e g bod do process are complex due to requiring an analytical solution of two parameters however it is expected that analytical expressions of the temporal and spatial changes in the information entropy index of the two water quality parameters will be obtained in the future 4 4 application of analytical expressions in water quality management with a numeric case entropy indexes connect natural processes and management requirements and provide effective macroscopic management tools it has been reported that information entropy theory has been successfully applied in water quality assessment in combination with machine learning methods egbueri 2022 and fuzzy mathematics liu et al 2010 moreover the analytical expressions of entropy indexes connect the known physical process of water quality dynamics and the characteristics of the overall water quality system which build an effective bridge as relative hydrodynamic parameters can be obtained through river morphology remote sensing etc in many scenarios such a bridge can be easily constructed without a large amount of expensive water quality observation data here a numeric case based on a tracer study on the maozhou river shenzhen 2020 with rhodamine wt jiang et al 2023 is brought to illustrate the expected application scenarios of gx analytical expression in water environment management we applied the analytical expressions for full extent observation in this case eqs 21 and 28 the parameters used in the expressions are listed in table 3 the time sequence is set to start from 10 min to 500 min with an interval of 10 min and we set three different n values 50 150 and 500 to calculate the normalized spatial entropy index gxn at different timestamps the result is shown in fig 6a it is noticed that the normalized spatial entropy index gxn is not sensitive to the choice of n however the figure has an obvious zigzag line when the value of n is small with the larger t m becomes larger and q decreases meanwhile q is the number of terms in a m and b m in eq 28 and the decrease in terms leads to the sudden decrease in a m and b m therefore the zigzag points represent that a m and b m have a sudden decrease due to the loss of their terms with the decrease in q the zigzag can be reduced by making n larger as shown in fig 7 as the value of n increases the zigzag gradually becomes less obvious the curve becomes almost smooth when n 500 from fig 7 we find that the peak value of gxn appears at approximately e 270 min and we define it as the maximum entropy point tgmax it is a critical value that measures the diffusion time of the solute affected by dx flow condition k solute characteristic and x boundary condition independent of the location emission time and mass of the source and has little bias with different n the definition of the maximum entropy point inspires us to develop water quality management methods based on the maximum entropy point for different solutes in riverine waterbodies and hydrological conditions for different rivers or seasons the hydrological parameters are different however with the help of analytical expressions the maximum entropy point can be easily accessed therefore water quality management decisions based on the maximum entropy point can also be obtained immediately as mentioned in section 3 1 there is a singularity at t 0 which will lead to a logical error of dividing by 0 in the derivation therefore the derivation starts at t t 1 when the solute has been displaced from the source however the absence of this neglected segment next to the source has little impact on downstream segments far from the source for the same reason the application of gx shall be avoided too close to the source compared with statistical methods based on concentration samples analytical expressions are more convenient for theoretical analysis and estimation and can better reflect the relationship between the parameters in water quality models through the analytical expression of the information entropy index the critical point when the information entropy index reaches the maximum e g maximum entropy point can be deduced the critical point may reflect a critical state of the transport process and provide an eigenvalue for describing the complexity of the transport process in the next step we discuss the water quality management methods based on the maximum entropy point and their application in different scenarios fig 7b 7d 1 water quality evaluation and sampling the setting of sampling points sampling period and frequency is the key to solving water quality evaluation problems the traditional sampling strategy is to cover the whole pollution plume as much as possible which often leads to the excessive collection of samples and increases the cost of sample storage and processing meanwhile it is difficult to obtain similar water quality evaluation results by adopting the same sampling method for different river conditions and pollutants after the introduction of the maximum entropy point it provides a critical point for the diffusion of different river conditions and different pollutants in the river and can be quickly accessed through analytical expressions therefore we can design the sampling strategy purposefully for example as shown in fig 7b one outlet emits two pollutants cod and turbidity and the two pollutants have different maximum entropy points cod is 270 min and turbidity is 120 min then the sampling strategy can be designed as follows the monitoring sensors for cod are set within the range from the outlet to downstream where the travel time is 270 min and for turbidity the range ends downstream where the travel time is 120 min a staggered sampling strategy can be carried out according to the different times when different pollutants reach their maximum entropy points to allocate sampling resources reasonably this can also be applicable for different river conditions such as when the maximum entropy point varies in different months and then the sampling strategy can be adjusted according to different maximum entropy points 2 monitoring optimization for the monitoring network we can set a threshold for gxn to determine the monitoring time range in the monitoring network as shown in fig 7c the sampling time range can be determined where gxn 0 25 or others then the monitoring time range can be accessed through analytical expressions this monitoring time range covers the period with higher entropy i e higher information as the maximum entropy point provides the most water quality information in the solute transport process a few samples collected near the maximum entropy time can obtain enough water quality information for water quality evaluation management which saves costs for monitoring it can be easily adjusted according to different river conditions and pollutants 3 pollutant source identification psi for pollutant source identification it is important to determine how long the sampling time is to obtain enough source information the shortest sampling time range for pollutant source identification can be chosen as an optimization parameter and we call it the relative critical time λ with the calculation of λ under several cases it is discovered that λ has a strong connection with gx both are related to the negative half power of the peclet number fig 7d which indicates that gx can be applied in the determination of sampling time for pollutant source identification after using analytical expressions of information entropy indexes critical points such as the maximum monitoring time can be obtained directly and swiftly and then variables such as the locations of monitoring points can be determined through these critical points thus using these analytical expressions makes the application of environmental management optimization decisions based on information entropy indexes more convenient 5 conclusion in this study we derived the analytical expression of the spatial information entropy index in steady state transport under full extent observation and tracking observation the analytical expression of the spatial information entropy index has the form a d x t x b d x t x ln d x t x and the expression d x t x appears to be the negative half power of the peclet number which is the ratio of the convection rate to the diffusion rate in the transmission phenomenon the information entropy index can be widely applied in theoretical analysis and for evaluation and water management purposes entropy based parameters such as maximum entropy can be applied in water quality assessment monitoring network design and pollutant source identification the information entropy index contains theoretical significance and application value the work is also a review of established classical advection diffusion reaction and provides new insights and knowledge from a systemic point of view in the future the application of the information entropy index in complex water quality processes the establishment of data driven models with the help of big data and further applications in river water management have promising prospects credit authorship contribution statement tianrui pang formal analysis methodology

1757,information entropy theory has been largely applied in hydrology and water resource engineering recently entropy theory has received significant attention for describing reactive solute mixing and transport processes in ground water and surface water and for its applications in water quality management however analytical expressions of the entropy index of riverine water quality dynamics are often not included in the literature in this study the analytical expressions of the spatial information entropy index gx in the 1d steady state transport process under full extent observation and tracking observations are derived after the definition of the system boundary and probability space the expressions of gx were successfully validated by field data from two tracer experiments and the different characteristics of gx under different riverine hydraulic situations were uncovered the formula of gx shows a reasonable linkage with the peclet number pe in hydrodynamics this indicates that gx is a physical quantity describing or linking to the real world more than a statistical index and in practice similar decision or management measurements based on entropy theory can be made for rivers with similar pe conditions hydrologists will benefit in many ways from analytical expressions such as theoretical analysis quick calculation of the entropy index preliminary engineering design etc a clearly defined example of maximum entropy time tgmax and its application in water quality evaluation monitoring optimization and pollution source identification are demonstrated these new findings will provide a convenient tool for catchment water quality management keywords analytical expression information entropy solute transport tracer experiments water quality dynamics data availability the field data used can be download in the references of the paper 1 introduction analyzing the transport of water quality components in natural water systems and extracting key spatial

water quality variables which can illustrate the input output transport and reactions of pollutants in a typical river lintern et al 2018 solute transport and reactivity are the main drivers contributing to the complexity of water quality systems kirchner 2009 at present riverine water quality dynamics have been extensively investigated by physical process based approaches in hydrology and water resource engineering riverine water quality dynamics pursue the fundamental description of the temporal and spatial distribution of aquatic pollutants i e the reductionism in philosophy methodologies of system theory are emerging as the applications of big data and data science have recently become more prevalent this type of approach includes temporal fractural theory kirchner et al 2000 chaos theory sivakumar 2000 information entropy theory singh 2014 etc they are more or less relative to statistics among them information entropy theory as the measurement of complexity or uncertainty is becoming an effective tool to characterize and analyze the solute transport process both in surface water and ground water chiogna et al 2012 chiogna and rolle 2017 kitanidis 1994 senf 1983 information entropy theory is a sound tool to describe water quality dynamics as a whole shannon 1948 initially laid the foundation of informational entropy theory and used it to quantify the degree of uncertainty for a random variable x that takes on values xi occurring with probability pi i 1 2 n respectively 1 h x i 1 n p i log p i where h is termed informational entropy shannon entropy or simply entropy entropy theory has been more widely applied in hydrology and water resources in practice the application of entropy theory can be classified into two directions one is to use information entropy analysis to build water quality evolution and model evaluation frameworks and the other to use entropy as objective function in water optimization problems in the first direction some scholars have attempted the theoretical analysis of solute transport by information entropy theory it is valuable for uncovering new physical insights and stimulating new management concepts as early as 1983 senf 1983 derived the critical time for functional information to increase to the maximum value in a one dimensional diffusion model and mentioned that there existed an optimal time in the process of information diffusion in measuring diffusion in 1994 kitanidis 1994 introduced the concept of the dilution index based on entropy theory as a quantitative descriptor of informational entropy of concentration in the dilution process and analyzed the change rule of the dilution index under gaussian diffusion following this concept chiogna et al 2012 found that the flux related dilution index can be used as a measurement to quantify mixing in geophysical flows if the derivative of the natural logarithm of the dilution index is negative reactive mixing processes are dominant over dilution processes while dilution is the dominant mechanism when the derivative is positive in 2017 chiogna and rolle 2017 further proposed the idea of the critical dilution index and critical reaction time and analyzed the spatial and temporal changes in the critical dilution index under three flow situations for water quality analysis amiri et al 2014 used entropy to calculate the weight of each physical and chemical parameter and derived a comprehensive parameter i e the entropy weighted water quality index ewqi for groundwater quality assessment xie et al 2022 proposed a correlation coefficient based information criterion ccic for quantifying the dependence characteristics in hydrological time series combining the index of correlation coefficient and the information entropy index neri et al 2022 used transfer entropy to characterize the catchment behavior in the streamflow generation processes the other direction is to consider the information entropy index as an objective function and guide the water environment management and decision making it has been an emerging active research field including measuring the uncertainty in hydrological systems aksentijevic et al

for example bertini et al 2021 gave an entropy based method to optimize an existing rain gauge network and pointed out that the resulting optimal network provides higher joint entropy which means more information captured by as few sensors as possible ursulak and coulibaly 2021 developed a hydrological model integrated with entropy and multi objective optimization for designing streamflow monitoring networks du et al 2022 integrated six entropy indexes based on the reliability and stability to assess the complexity of precipitation as a rapid growth theory in recent years vijay p singh gave several reviews on the application of entropy theory in hydraulic engineering hydrologic systems and engineering singh 2014 singh 2015 singh 2016 among those entropy theory based applications the principle of maximum entropy pome first introduced by jaynes jaynes 1957 jaynes 1980 has been widely used in many scientific and engineering areas in practice such as ecology xing and hao 2011 and statistical physics pressé et al 2013 in water resource areas pome can be applied in the derivation of the probability distribution of hydrological frequency analysis chen et al 1993 maximum entropy spectrum analysis of time series hydrological stochastic process modeling wang and zhu 2001 and aquatic parameter evaluation xiao and song 2010 especially in the field of risk analysis and risk management guo et al 2017 vijay p singh and k singh estimated two parameter distributions commonly used in hydrology gamma distribution singh and singh 1985a and pearson type iii distribution singh and singh 1985b based on pome compared with other parameter estimation methods such as moment estimation maximum likelihood estimation and least square estimation pome does not require the use of the coefficient of skewness which can reduce the bias in the estimation of parameters additionally the calculation of pome is simpler and faster making pome widely used in machine learning gharari et al 2021 wang et al 2007 most often the spatiotemporal distribution of solutes is output by water quality models and then the given entropy index is calculated by the statistical definition of entropy e g eq 1 if the water quality model has an analytical solution it is possible to obtain an analytical expression of the entropy index in many situations analytical solutions of the advection dispersion reaction equation are found after simplification and those analytical solutions are commonly used in catchment management practices singh and woolhiser 2002 zeunert and meon 2020 however few studies have reported on the derivation of analytical expressions of entropy indexes on the area of solute transport in ground or surface water to the best of our knowledge only analytical expressions of the entropy based dilution index e have been reported using objects of uniform flow shear flow and complex flow topology in groundwater chiogna and rolle 2017 there is a knowledge gap in the analytical expressions of the entropy index of riverine water quality dynamics in the literature analytical expressions are important because they allow for building a mathematical description of physical processes as opposed to empirical expressions which are built via data analysis methods to find relationships among variables in addition the provided analytical expressions relate the information entropy index and hydrodynamic parameters making it possible to quickly calculate the information entropy index when the hydrodynamic parameters are known this is significant because the expressions can be used to analyze simple water quality processes for example the analytical expression of the information index can be used to find critical pollution points such as in one dimensional riverine solute transport processes analogous to finding the minima of the oxygen sag curve in the biochemical oxygen demand dissolved oxygen bod do process in surface water quality maleewong and hasadsri 2013 the analytical entropy expressions will also be effective in any domain to which pome is applied as described in the works mentioned above scientists and engineers have always strived to obtain analytical expressions or solutions even when good computational resources are available taking groundwater areas as an example liang et al 2019 developed a novel semianalytical model for solute transport with linear reactions in layered heterogeneous media which could be used to investigate solute transport in layered heterogeneous media in 2d spaces and to interpret the observed btcs in laboratory experiments liang et al 2019 chen et al 2011 and liao et al 2021 developed analytical solutions for the two dimensional advection dispersion equation ade in cylindrical coordinates and three dimensional multispecies situations respectively which brought high efficiency in computing and risk assessment at contaminated groundwater sites therefore the purposes of this study are to derive analytical expressions of the information entropy index of riverine water quality dynamics and discuss their potential applications and advantages the paper first defines the domain discretization of information entropy according to the difference in the concentration gradient in section 2 section 3 illustrates the process of deriving the analytical expressions of the spatial information entropy index in two patterns full extent observation and tracking observation water quality dynamics mainly focus on the one dimensional steady state convection diffusion process since this model generalization is largely used in catchment management practices in section 4 we verify expressions with field tracer experimental data and analyze the characteristics of information entropy indexes under different hydraulic conditions the availability of analytical expressions of other information entropy indexes and applications for water quality management such as monitoring network design and pollutant source identification are then discussed followed by the application of the expressions in a numeric case finally we conclude with our core findings in section 5 with prospects for further research 2 definition of the boundary and domain discretization of entropy 2 1 definition of spatial entropy index gx and physical terms to estimate information entropy the domain under study needs to be discretized in water quality processes it is possible to do this in many ways one is by discretizing the variable according to its values of dispersion of solute plume in space as the dilution index does chiogna et al 2012 chiogna and rolle 2017 another way is to discretize the variable of interest in various subspaces for example by characteristic parameters at different places for example spatial configuration entropy rodríguez iturbe et al 1998 discretizes the number of cells of the domain according to the value of precipitation with respect to a threshold in a certain domain in this study we focus on the second method to define the domain discretization for deriving the spatial entropy index as it is less commonly explored the spatial entropy index gx measures the complexity of spatial pattern diversion a different sequence of spatial parameters e g different concentration levels of one water quality parameter at different monitoring stations we choose the concentration of solute as the characteristic parameter for discretization for one spatial distribution curve at a specific time as shown in fig 1 a consider the river section containing solute plume as the system boundary there exists a minimum concentration c min and a maximum concentration c max in this section we divide the concentration interval c min c max into n parts the end points of the interval are recorded as c 0 c 1 cn c 0 c min cn c max assuming that the concentration record data are discrete and each concentration record belongs to one of these concentration intervals we calculate the ratio of the amount of data in one concentration interval with respect to the whole data and then derive a probability distribution in terms of the concentration gradient distribution according to the difference in the spatial and temporal concentration gradient distributions using the definition equation of information entropy eq 1 we can define the spatial information entropy index eq 2 2 g x t k 1 n p g x k t ln p g x k t where p g x k t is the ratio of the number of records which the concentration c x t belongs to the kth concentration interval ck 1 ck to the number of records in the whole concentration interval c min c max it represents the probability that how records are distributed in different concentration intervals and illustrates the interval gradient uncertainty in the spatial distribution of solute concentrations 3 p g x k t c k 1 c x t c k d x c min c x t c max d x as the number of concentration intervals results of random event is defined by n the spatial entropy index gx has a maximum value g x m a x l n n to make these indexes comparable it is necessary to normalize them therefore we put out normalized spatial entropy index gxn 4 g xn g x ln n where the range of gxn is 0 1 2 2 analytical solutions of 1d steady state solute transport the solute transport process in rivers is the main focus process of this paper here solute refers to relatively stable soluble particles such as bod ammonia tracers rhodamine b etc the premise of deriving the analytical expression of the information entropy index is to obtain the analytical solution of concentrations in the solute transport process which is a necessary condition the partial differential function of the one dimensional river water quality model is presented in eq 5 5 c t d x 2 c x 2 u x c x k c 0 where c concentration of solute mg l dx longitudinal diffusion coefficient m2 s ux advent velocity of the river m s k degradation coefficient of solute s 1 to simplify the real world pollution release and transport processes scientists and engineers have obtained several analytical solutions of eq 5 under particular boundary and initial conditions one of the most commonly used situations is steady state instantaneous point source transport the analytical solution is shown in eq 6 which can be obtained by the laplace transform and inverse transform details can be found in classical literature or course textbooks evans 2010 6 c x t m a 4 π d x t e x u x t 2 4 d x t e k t where c x t concentration of solute at space x and time t

solute s 1 in this study the derivation of the analytical expression of the information entropy index is based on the 1d steady state solute transport case 2 3 derivation of expression for domain discretization for full extent observation different spatial and temporal discretizations have different uses at different scales although they may represent the same physical process on the one hand large scale water quality management problems require full extent observations with large discretization grids in time and space which are the base for conventional monitoring networks on the other hand emergency monitoring and pollutant source identification are issues characterized by variable changes on relatively short spatial and temporal scales thus discretization needs to be made according to the needs below a mathematical definition of the boundary and domain discretization of the spatial entropy index at a particular time t is given under full extent observation with the spatial boundary length x in this condition the time t is a constant the peak of concentration appears at x max u x t the peak value of concentration at the nearest monitoring time the first monitoring time is 7 c x t max 1 m e k t 1 a 4 π d x t 1 where c x t max 1 the peak concentration at the first monitoring time mg l t 1 first monitoring time s dx longitudinal diffusion coefficient m2 s the boundary is defined as the range of concentration i e 0 c x t max 1 the domain is discretized into n intervals c 0 c 1 c 1 c 2 ci ci 1 cn 1 cn where 8 c i i n c x t max 1 i 0 1 n particularly c0 0 cn c x t max 1 in this way the concentration space is divided into n concentration gradient subspaces according to the law of large numbers n shall be generally 20 to be acceptable for statistics of distribution characteristics for a typical solute transport process the spatial distribution curve of the pollutant usually has only one peak defined as x max before with the concentration rising where x x max and falling where x x max under full extent observation the spatial boundary length of the observation system i e the total length of the study area from upstream to downstream is a constant which is marked as x in fig 1a now we divide study area x into several intervals according to the concentration gradient subspaces for the study area where x x max we define 9 i i x i 1 x i 1 1 i 0 1 n 1 where xi 1 xi 1 1 meets c x i 1 t c i i n c x t max 1 c x i 1 1 t c i 1 i 1 n c x t max 1 xi 1 xi 1 1 x max similarly for the study area where x x max we define 10 i 2 n 1 i x i 1 2 x i 2 i 0 1 n 1 where xi 2 xi 1 2 meets c x i 2 t c i i n c x t max 1 c x i 1 2 t c i i 1 n c x t max 1 x max xi 1 2 xi 2 in particular we define x 0 1 0 x 0 2 x xn 1 xn 2 x max in this way we divide study area x into 2 n sub intervals and the concentration of solute in each sub interval falls into only one specified concentration subspace each concentration subspace corresponds to 2 sub intervals the concentration subspace ci ci 1 corresponds to ii xi 1 xi 1 1 and i 2 n 1 i xi 1 2 xi 2 as shown in fig 1a specifically the concentration subspace c 0 c 1 corresponds to i 0 x 0 1 x 1 1 and i 2 n 1 x 1 2 x 0 2 and the concentration subspace cn 1 cn corresponds to in 1 xn 1 1 xn 1 and in xn 2 xn 1 2 eq gives a definition of domain discretization for discrete time series of concentration values by calculating the likelihood that a point on the spatial distribution curve x c falls into each concentration subspace ci ci 1 i 0 1 n 1 let λ i i n be the order fraction of concentration gradients considering eq 11 11 m a 4 π d x t e x u x t 2 4 d x t e k t c i λ i c x t max 1 solving eq 11 we can yield the two roots i e the boundaries of sub intervals 12 x i 1 u x t 4 d x t ln λ i 13 x i 2 u x

time series of concentration values the probability marked as pi 1 i 0 1 n 1 that one record xr cr belongs to a specific concentration subspace ci ci 1 i e ii xi 1 xi 1 1 and i 2 n 1 i xi 1 2 xi 2 can be calculated according to the geometric probability in probability theory the probability pi 1 equals the ratio of the sum of the length of two sub intervals ii xi 1 xi 1 1 i 2 n 1 i xi 1 2 xi 2 and the length of the study area x according to eq 14 we can derive the probability distribution of the spatial entropy index p i 1 p λ i c x t max 1 c x t λ i 1 c x t max 1 x i 1 1 x i 1 x i 2 x i 1 2 x δ x i δ x i 1 x 15 4 d x t x ln λ i ln λ i 1 after calculating the probabilities p corresponding to each concentration subspace ci ci 1 a probability distribution histogram can be drawn as shown in fig 1b 2 4 definition of the boundary and domain discretization of entropy as tracking observation under tracking observations the spatial boundary length of the observation system varies according to different monitoring times usually based on a pollutant plume where the pollutant concentration is significant it is generally believed that the observation range of a pollution plume can be defined by the pollutant concentration in which the concentration is greater than a critical value e g 1 5 of the maximum concentration as is marked x 1 in fig 1a fig 1c shows the difference between the full extent observation and tracking observation tracking observation discards i 0 and i 2 n 1 in the full extent observation and takes the combination of remaining intervals as the boundary of tracking observation we found that the peak value of concentration at the initial time t t 1 is c x t max 1 m e k t 1 a 4 π d x t 1 we divided the concentration range 0 c x t max 1 into n intervals 0 1 n c x t max 1 1 n c x t max 1 2 n c x t max 1 n 1 n c x t max 1 c x t max 1 and make 1 n c x t max 1 the critical value then the length of the tracking observation boundary is fig 1 16 x 1 4 d x t 1 ln n we can derive the probability distribution from eq 15 p i 1 p λ i c x t max 1 c x t λ i 1 c x t max 1 δ x i 1 δ x i 1 1 x 1 17 4 d x t 1 x 1 ln λ i ln λ i 1 where x 1 the length of the observation interval at the first monitoring time under tracking observation m λi λi i n depends on n i 1 2 n 1 3 derivation of an analytical expression of the spatial entropy index 3 1 analytical expression of spatial entropy index gx at initial time t1 as full extent observation since there is a singularity at t 0 there will be a logical error of dividing by 0 in the derivation and the derivation starts at t t 1 the discrete precision of time δt is not considered in fact the entropy index gx is defined as 0 where t 0 first consider the analytical expression of the spatial entropy index gx at the initial time t t 1 generally the spatial boundary length x contains the subintervals i 0 x 0 1 x 1 1 and i 2 n 1 x 1 2 x 0 2 then 18 p 1 1 p 0 c x t λ 1 c x t max 1 x 1 1 x 0 1 x 0 2 x 1 2 x x δ x 1 1 x 1 4 d x t 1 ln λ 1 x according to eq 15 the probability distribution of the spatial entropy index on other concentration gradients is p i 1 1 p λ i c x t max 1 c x t λ i 1 c x t max 1 δ x i 1 δ x i 1 1 x 19 4 d x t 1 x ln λ i ln λ i 1 spatial information entropy is 20 g x 1 1 4 d x t 1 ln λ 1 x ln 1 4 d x t 1 ln λ 1 x i 1 n 1 4 d x t 1 x ln λ i ln λ i 1 ln 4 d x t 1 x ln λ i ln λ i 1 to make it more concise let a and b be defined as a 4 i 1 n 1 ln λ i ln λ i 1 ln 4 ln λ i ln λ i 1 b 4 i 1 n 1 ln λ i ln λ i 1 therefore eq 15 becomes 21 g x 1 1 4 d x t 1 ln n x ln 1 4 d x t 1 ln n x a d x t 1 x b d x t 1 x ln d x t 1 x where x the length of the full extent observation boundary m a b coefficients that are functions of n we can see that the information entropy at the earliest time point closest to release time is a function of d x t 1 x 3 2 analytical expression of spatial entropy index gx at subsequent moments as full extent observation for other moments after t 1 the spatial distribution curve and the peak concentration are different from those of t 1 nevertheless the concentration subspaces remain the same c 0 c 1 c 1 c 2 ci ci 1 cn 1 cn where c i i n c x t max 1 i 0 1 n the peak concentrations of t 1 and tj have the following relation j 2 3 22 c x t max 1 c x t max j e k t 1 t j t 1 t j where c x t max j the peak value of concentration at the jth monitoring time mg l tj jth monitoring time s here we define 23 m c x t max 1 c x t max j e k t 1 t j t 1 t j obviously m 1 then eq 11 becomes 24 m a 4 π d x t j e x u x t j 2 4 d x t j e k t j λ i c x t max 1 m λ i c x t max j similarly see eq 14 we can obtain 25 δ x i j 4 d x t j ln m λ i note that because m 1 the ratio mλi may be 1 when i is large enough make m λ q 1 m λ q 1 in which q is an integer smaller than n for integer i q i n the space interval ii xi 1 xi 1 1 and i 2 n 1 i xi 1 2 xi 2 does not exist and we defined the length of these space intervals as zero when calculating the probability similar to eq 15 the probability distribution can be derived as follows p 1 j p 0 c x t λ 1 c x t max j x δ x 1 j x 1 4 d x t j ln m λ 1 x p i 1 j p λ i c x t max j c x t λ i 1 c x t max j δ x i j δ x i 1 j x 4 d x t

j ln m λ 1 x ln 1 4 d x t j ln m λ 1 x a m d x t j x b m d x t j x ln d x t j x we can see that the information entropy at the time spot other than the first one is a function of d x t j x and m a function of k if n is a constant 3 3 analytical expression of the entropy index under 1d steady state transport as tracking observation similarly we can derive the spatial information entropy at the initial time t 1 as 29 g x 1 i 1 n 1 4 d x t 1 x 1 ln λ i ln λ i 1 ln 4 d x t 1 x 1 ln λ i ln λ i 1 to make it more concise let a and b be defined as a 4 i 1 n 1 ln λ i ln λ i 1 ln 4 ln λ i ln λ i 1 b 4 i 1 n 1 ln λ i ln λ i 1 such that information entropy is 30 g x 1 a d x t 1 x 1 b d x t 1 x 1 ln d x t 1 x 1 where x 1 the length of the observation boundary at initial time t 1 under tracking

power of the peclet number pe which is a dimensionless number in hydrodynamics defined by the ratio of the convection rate to the diffusion rate in the transmission phenomenon 36 pe ul d x where l is the characteristic length herein l can be the interval length of the full extent boundary x thus interestingly the spatial entropy index gx is actually a function of the peclet number and m corresponding only with k see eq 23 in terms of the analytical expression this is an exciting discovery because it means that this statistical index has a physical interpretation that is the correlation of the spatial entropy index and peclet number indicates that different solute transport patterns can be classified by the value of the peclet number which is a quantitative method this implies that two different river catchments with different hydrological parameters and similar entropic evolution patterns have similar peclet numbers if follows decisions based on entropy theory can be made for rivers with similar pe conditions in practice table 1 summarizes the analytical expressions of the spatial entropy index gx under different observations 4 validation and discussion 4 1 validation of the information entropy index by field data from tracer experiments the derived analytical expressions can be further verified by field data from tracer studies to demonstrate the application of the spatial entropy index in the situations of full extent observation and tracking observation two datasets of previous studies were chosen the tracer study on the goldersbach river in southwestern germany in 2013 lemke et al 2013 was selected for the case of full extent observation whereas the tracer study on the coosa river in alabama us in 1984 gardner 1985 was selected for the case of tracking observation 1 tracer test on river goldersbach germany 2013 in 2013 a fluorescent tracer test was conducted in the goldersbach river which is located in stuttgart southwestern germany fig 2 a a combination of fluorescein and resazurin as conservative and reactive tracers respectively was used a total of 8 70 10 3 mol of fluorescein and 1 13 10 1 mol of resazurin were premixed and injected into the river instantaneously monitoring and sampling were performed at ms1 ms2 and ms3 at 830 1075 and 1210 m distances downstream of the injection site the monitoring interval was 5 min and 254 samples of fluorescein and 223 samples of resazurin were collected during the study the time span of this tracer test is 8 5 h but because the tracer test only recorded the data of pollutant concentration in three monitoring stations the space boundary is small so when the concentration data are divided into three space sections the data of three monitoring stations are placed in three space intervals 800 900 m 1000 1100 m and 1100 1200 m the time interval was set as 0 5 h after partitioning the average pollutant concentration data in each time interval of 900 1000 m were obtained by the interpolation method finally the time space distribution heatmap of the concentration is drawn as shown in fig 2b and 2c after interpolation the tracer test data are evenly distributed in a rectangular area with a time interval of 1 5 10 h and a space interval of 800 1200 m this accords with the analysis condition of full extent observation 2 tracer study on the coosa river near childersberg us 1984 a tracer study was performed on the coosa river by the usgs and alabama environment protection agency from oct 27 to 31 1984 the study reach is between the logan martin dam and wilsonville alabama us which is 23 miles long fig 3 a rhodamine wt dye was used as a tracer for this study seventy pounds of rhodamine wt dye was injected from 0810 h and ended at 1625 h on oct 27 1984 forty five sampling cross sections were established at approximately one half mile intervals along the 23 mile study reach and approximately 2 300 samples were collected at these cross sections during the study to see the spatial and temporal distribution of samples directly we sort the samples by dividing them into groups by such intervals 2 h in time and 0 5 miles in space and draw a heat distribution of samples fig 3b the data samples are more evenly distributed around the center of the plume center despite some of the intervals this accords with the analysis condition of tracking observation on the one hand we use a statistical method to calculate the spatial entropy index directly with the real field data after interpolation according to the definition given in section 2 2 on the other hand we can use the field data to estimate parameters such as dx ux and k to determine the analytical curve of gx from the derived expression taking the tracer study on the coosa river as an example with the real field data of the rwt sample gx is calculated by the step by step method that is all field data in two adjacent rows are recorded gx is not calculated if the amount of data is less than eight records otherwise the domain is discretized into 25 subspace intervals according to the maximum concentration value before calculating and gx is calculated by statistical results that the field data fall in the corresponding subspace interval analytical expressions eq 21 for full extent observation and by eq 34 for tracking observation are used to calculate gx in another way the parameters needed are given by the tracer test report as listed in table 2 the number of subspace intervals in probability space n 25 in the calculation the corresponding information entropy indexes were calculated together with the results calculated by analytical expressions of information entropy indexes according to the hydrological conditions provided by the tracer studies the comparison between entropy indexes by data and entropy indexes by analytical expressions is shown in fig 4 from fig 4a and b we can see that the actual value of the information entropy of fluorescein and resazurin is 1 2 nat at 2 h and then it increases the highest value appears at 4 5 h and the maximum value of information entropy is approximately 2 nat after 5 h the information entropy of the two tracers decreased sharply with the passage of time and decreased to 0 at 7 h the first data point in shallow blue in fig 4a and b represents the monitoring timestamp where t 2 h and it is lower than the following points according to the heat distribution shown in fig 2b and 2c the peak value of the pollutant plume for t 2 h should appear at approximately 600 800 m which was not recorded in the dataset and this leads to incomplete origin data the peak value shares a very important proportion in gx therefore the loss of peak value makes gx for t 2 h smaller than expected from fig 4c we can see that the gx by observation data is the highest at 18 h which is 1 8 nat then it decreases gradually with time and decreases to 0 at 80 h the gx derived from observation data is similar to the theoretical value under tracking observation conditions but the actual value is 0 5 nat higher than the theoretical value on average the difference between the theoretical value and actual value may be due to the incomplete record of the tracer data 4 2 changes in the spatial information entropy index gx under different river situations the derived analytical expressions can also be applied in different rivers with diverse hydrological conditions to investigate this we first give the values of the parameters required for the analytical expression eq 28 according to the calibration results of the truckee river tracer test in nevada 2006 crompton 2008 diffusion coefficient d 40 5 m2 s flow velocity u 1 3 m s degradation coefficient k 10 7 then observe the change of spatial information entropy index by changing the value of each parameter in other words we performed a sensitivity analysis of gx to different hydrological conditions highlighted by dx and k as the variable ux does not appear in the analytical expression its value does not affect the entropy value fig 5 shows the changes in the spatial information entropy index under different river situations gx varied proportionally with dx specifically when dx increased or decreased by 10 gx increased or decreased by 4 moreover the ratio of the change in entropy value gx to parameter dx is relatively constant which is not obvious with the change in monitoring time t the change in k affects m and with the change in m coefficients a m and b m also change so the influence of the curve shape is greater than that of dx as m is affected by the monitoring time t the greater t is the more sensitive the entropy gx is to the change in parameter k from the perspective of physical processes diffusion processes and degradation processes have a significant impact on the mixing rate of solutes thus they have a great impact on the spatial information entropy index however the convection process only changes the position of the pollution mass in the river when it reaches a certain mixing state and does not affect the mixing rate of the pollution plume therefore the spatial information entropy index is related to diffusion and degradation but not to convection 4 3 availability of analytical expressions of other information entropy indexes the previous discussion mainly focused on the analytical expression of gx under a 1d steady state solute transport process and whether other analytical expressions for entropy indexes and river scenarios are of interest we wonder if the analytical expression of the dilution index can also be obtained and can be applied in water quality process analysis which is similar to the spatial entropy index to this end we use the dilution index e first introduced by kitanidis 1994 which is defined as eq 37 37 e δ v exp k 1 n p k ln p k the logarithm of dilution index has a familiar expression with entropy however the definition of probability for the dilution index is the ratio of the mass of solute in one spatial interval bins to the total mass in the given boundary which is different from that for gx 38 p x t c x t v c x t d v another difference between e and gx is that e depends only weakly on the discretization methods the number of bins n as δv appears in the definition of e the unit of e is related to the unit of bins e g m3 for δv while gx has nat as the unit a comparison case between the normalized logarithm of dilution index ln en and the normalized spatial information entropy index gxn based on the same solute transport process case is shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows that the normalized logarithm dilution index is increasing over time the decrease in the latter curve is due to the diffusion of solute beyond the boundary and is not accounted for in fact the lager dilution index represents the more uniform mixing with each bin have the same concentration the normalized spatial information entropy index has a process of first increasing and then decreasing and there is a maximum value within the boundary which means various concentration intervals exist within boundary at the time spot chiogna et al 2012 reported that the changes in e refract the time evolution of the thermodynamic system of river water quality the spatial information entropy index is expected to reflect the characteristics of river water quality systems from different perspectives besides e and gx there are other kinds of entropy indexes temporal entropy index gt is similar to gx however it measures the complexity of temporal pattern diversion the expression of gt and the corresponding probability term p g t k x are defined as follows 39 g t x k 1 n p g t k x ln p g t k x 40 p g t k x c k 1 c x t c k d t c min c x t c max d t the meanings of c min c max and ck 1 ck are the same as that in the definition of gx the difference is that the records used for gt are concentration time series at a specific spatial point the probability term p g t k x is still the ratio of the number of records which the concentration c x t belongs to the kth concentration interval ck 1 ck to the number of records in the whole concentration interval c min c max however here it illustrates the interval gradient uncertainty in the temporal distribution of solute concentrations temporal entropy index is often used for time series characteristic analysis some entropy indexes like permutation entropy pe can be seen as a derivative of time information entropy and applied in water quality managements eguiraun et al 2014 in section 2 we derive the analytical expression of the spatial entropy index gx under full extent observation and tracking observation however for temporal entropy index gt the formula contains both square root and logarithm functions making it difficult to obtain an analytical solution directly therefore the analytical expression of the temporal entropy index gt is still unknown fourier transform may be required for deriving an analytical expression of the temporal entropy index the analytical expression of the spatial entropy index gx is for one dimensional steady state transport with a one point pollutant source which is the simplest situation in water transport processes for more complex situations such as multidiscrete sources or continuous sources we can calculate the entropy index for each point source first and then obtain the change in the overall entropy index according to the linear superposition principle another way to obtain an analytical expression of the entropy index is to use fourier analysis to split the complex pollution source into the form of addition of the fourier function calculate the analytical expressions for each fourier function and then add them water quality processes including more than one water quality parameter e g bod do process are complex due to requiring an analytical solution of two parameters however it is expected that analytical expressions of the temporal and spatial changes in the information entropy index of the two water quality parameters will be obtained in the future 4 4 application of analytical expressions in water quality management with a numeric case entropy indexes connect natural processes and management requirements and provide effective macroscopic management tools it has been reported that information entropy theory has been successfully applied in water quality assessment in combination with machine learning methods egbueri 2022 and fuzzy mathematics liu et al 2010 moreover the analytical expressions of entropy indexes connect the known physical process of water quality dynamics and the characteristics of the overall water quality system which build an effective bridge as relative hydrodynamic parameters can be obtained through river morphology remote sensing etc in many scenarios such a bridge can be easily constructed without a large amount of expensive water quality observation data here a numeric case based on a tracer study on the maozhou river shenzhen 2020 with rhodamine wt jiang et al 2023 is brought to illustrate the expected application scenarios of gx analytical expression in water environment management we applied the analytical expressions for full extent observation in this case eqs 21 and 28 the parameters used in the expressions are listed in table 3 the time sequence is set to start from 10 min to 500 min with an interval of 10 min and we set three different n values 50 150 and 500 to calculate the normalized spatial entropy index gxn at different timestamps the result is shown in fig 6a it is noticed that the normalized spatial entropy index gxn is not sensitive to the choice of n however the figure has an obvious zigzag line when the value of n is small with the larger t m becomes larger and q decreases meanwhile q is the number of terms in a m and b m in eq 28 and the decrease in terms leads to the sudden decrease in a m and b m therefore the zigzag points represent that a m and b m have a sudden decrease due to the loss of their terms with the decrease in q the zigzag can be reduced by making n larger as shown in fig 7 as the value of n increases the zigzag gradually becomes less obvious the curve becomes almost smooth when n 500 from fig 7 we find that the peak value of gxn appears at approximately e 270 min and we define it as the maximum entropy point tgmax it is a critical value that measures the diffusion time of the solute affected by dx flow condition k solute characteristic and x boundary condition independent of the location emission time and mass of the source and has little bias with different n the definition of the maximum entropy point inspires us to develop water quality management methods based on the maximum entropy point for different solutes in riverine waterbodies and hydrological conditions for different rivers or seasons the hydrological parameters are different however with the help of analytical expressions the maximum entropy point can be easily accessed therefore water quality management decisions based on the maximum entropy point can also be obtained immediately as mentioned in section 3 1 there is a singularity at t 0 which will lead to a logical error of dividing by 0 in the derivation therefore the derivation starts at t t 1 when the solute has been displaced from the source however the absence of this neglected segment next to the source has little impact on downstream segments far from the source for the same reason the application of gx shall be avoided too close to the source compared with statistical methods based on concentration samples analytical expressions are more convenient for theoretical analysis and estimation and can better reflect the relationship between the parameters in water quality models through the analytical expression of the information entropy index the critical point when the information entropy index reaches the maximum e g maximum entropy point can be deduced the critical point may reflect a critical state of the transport process and provide an eigenvalue for describing the complexity of the transport process in the next step we discuss the water quality management methods based on the maximum entropy point and their application in different scenarios fig 7b 7d 1 water quality evaluation and sampling the setting of sampling points sampling period and frequency is the key to solving water quality evaluation problems the traditional sampling strategy is to cover the whole pollution plume as much as possible which often leads to the excessive collection of samples and increases the cost of sample storage and processing meanwhile it is difficult to obtain similar water quality evaluation results by adopting the same sampling method for different river conditions and pollutants after the introduction of the maximum entropy point it provides a critical point for the diffusion of different river conditions and different pollutants in the river and can be quickly accessed through analytical expressions therefore we can design the sampling strategy purposefully for example as shown in fig 7b one outlet emits two pollutants cod and turbidity and the two pollutants have different maximum entropy points cod is 270 min and turbidity is 120 min then the sampling strategy can be designed as follows the monitoring sensors for cod are set within the range from the outlet to downstream where the travel time is 270 min and for turbidity the range ends downstream where the travel time is 120 min a staggered sampling strategy can be carried out according to the different times when different pollutants reach their maximum entropy points to allocate sampling resources reasonably this can also be applicable for different river conditions such as when the maximum entropy point varies in different months and then the sampling strategy can be adjusted according to different maximum entropy points 2 monitoring optimization for the monitoring network we can set a threshold for gxn to determine the monitoring time range in the monitoring network as shown in fig 7c the sampling time range can be determined where gxn 0 25 or others then the monitoring time range can be accessed through analytical expressions this monitoring time range covers the period with higher entropy i e higher information as the maximum entropy point provides the most water quality information in the solute transport process a few samples collected near the maximum entropy time can obtain enough water quality information for water quality evaluation management which saves costs for monitoring it can be easily adjusted according to different river conditions and pollutants 3 pollutant source identification psi for pollutant source identification it is important to determine how long the sampling time is to obtain enough source information the shortest sampling time range for pollutant source identification can be chosen as an optimization parameter and we call it the relative critical time λ with the calculation of λ under several cases it is discovered that λ has a strong connection with gx both are related to the negative half power of the peclet number fig 7d which indicates that gx can be applied in the determination of sampling time for pollutant source identification after using analytical expressions of information entropy indexes critical points such as the maximum monitoring time can be obtained directly and swiftly and then variables such as the locations of monitoring points can be determined through these critical points thus using these analytical expressions makes the application of environmental management optimization decisions based on information entropy indexes more convenient 5 conclusion in this study we derived the analytical expression of the spatial information entropy index in steady state transport under full extent observation and tracking observation the analytical expression of the spatial information entropy index has the form a d x t x b d x t x ln d x t x and the expression d x t x appears to be the negative half power of the peclet number which is the ratio of the convection rate to the diffusion rate in the transmission phenomenon the information entropy index can be widely applied in theoretical analysis and for evaluation and water management purposes entropy based parameters such as maximum entropy can be applied in water quality assessment monitoring network design and pollutant source identification the information entropy index contains theoretical significance and application value the work is also a review of established classical advection diffusion reaction and provides new insights and knowledge from a systemic point of view in the future the application of the information entropy index in complex water quality processes the establishment of data driven models with the help of big data and further applications in river water management have promising prospects credit authorship contribution statement tianrui pang formal analysis methodology

1758,glaciers and rock glaciers are key elements of mountain hydrological systems but their relative influence on the chemical and isotopic conditions of streams within the river continuum is still overlooked during three consecutive years 2019 2021 we studied 24 stream sections in two catchments plima and schnals eastern italian alps with varying cover of glaciers and rock glaciers end member mixing models based on δ2h and d excess revealed a large spatial and temporal variability in the contribution of different water sources to stream runoff overall snowmelt 77 17 and rainwater 5 5 were the largest and the smallest runoff components respectively the ice melt contribution was high in streams fed by glaciers 23 15 and rock glaciers 16 16 in the highly glacierised plima basin the tracer based estimation of annual ice melt fraction matched reasonably well 90 167 the mean annual glacial ice loss estimated by geodetic mass balance in contrast we found a large overestimation of the ice melt component derived from mixing models in the poorly glacierised but rock glacier rich schnals catchment in streams influenced by rock glaciers at both catchments the particular temporal patterns of electrical conductivity resulted in unreliable estimates of the meltwater groundwater fractions of runoff depending on the local lithology concentrations of trace elements sr ni ba mn zn al were high in streams fed by rock glaciers and glaciers and close below the limits of quantification in non glacial streams in alpine areas the abundance of rock glaciers can confound the isotopic and chemical signature imparted by glaciers thus hindering the use of tracer based methods for hydrograph separation under the combined influence from glaciers and rock glaciers concentrations of trace

engel et al 2019 brighenti et al 2019b bearzot et al 2023 in the context of the research gaps and challenges described above the present work has the following aims 1 to quantify the relative importance of the ice melt snowmelt and rainwater to stream runoff over a gradient of glacial periglacial influence using δ2h and d excess in mixing models 2 to compare the ice melt volumes derived from mixing models against the observed loss of glacier volumes calculated with geodetic mass balances 3 to test the use of ec as a proxy for groundwater contribution using site specific values during baseflow conditions to estimate this water source in two member mixing models 4 to estimate the relative influence of glaciers and rock glaciers on the stream chemistry and investigate how the contribution from different runoff components influences water quality at different locations to address these objectives herein we present data from two high elevation catchments located in south tyrol eastern italian alps sampling locations underlain by contrasting glacier and rock glacier cover were investigated during three consecutive years with monthly field campaigns aimed at characterising the ec isotopic composition and elemental concentrations of their water 2 study area the plima and the schnals senales river catchments are located in the vinschgau venosta valley south tyrol eastern italian alps fig 1 the upper plima catchment known as martell martello valley is partly included in the stelvio national park and hosts only few infrastructures related to summer tourism mountain huts and sparse livestock grazing in contrast the schnals valley hosts a ski resort and related infrastructures including glacier geotextiles and cable cars affect several slopes at schnals high elevations areas are used for cattle grazing during summer in both catchments water abstractions and large water reservoirs built for hydropower production drastically modify the hydrological regime and aquatic ecology of streams e g ellis and jones 2013 therefore we investigated relatively undisturbed river networks located upstream from the reservoirs 1850 m a s l both catchments are covered with coniferous forests and above the treeline by alpine meadows and pastures the areas exhibit a comparable continental climate with cold summer and absent dry season dfc according to köppen classification beck et al 2018 but differ in terms of geological and geomorphological conditions the upper schnals valley 39 5 km2 belongs to the southern part of the ötztal unit austroalpine domaine and its bedrock is composed of paragneisses michaschists and heterogeneous gneisses with the presence of sporadic quartzite bands autonomous province of bozen bolzano apb in production the glacierised

landforms such as moraines protalus ramparts and talus slopes are abundant upstream from the vernagt vernago reservoir 44 mapped rock glaciers cover almost the same extent as glaciers 1 8 km2 table 1 we investigated the main schnals river schnals s1 s4 originating from the steinschlag vedretta delle frane glacier and the outlets of its main tributaries these include streams st2 2 st4 st8 with a relatively small glacier cover in their catchments 4 5 21 9 and draining areas abundant in rock glaciers table 1 fig 1 at the lazaun rosshütte sub catchment we also investigated the spring from a little ice age moraine st2 1 and that of an intact rock glacier rg the latter spring was already investigated in other works e g krainer et al 2007 krainer 2011 krainer et al 2015 additional sampling locations include the spring flowing on a wetland st3 and an intermittent stream flowing on a debris flow channel st5 the upper plima river basin 47 km2 is lithologically heterogeneous as it lays where the campo fault and the zebrù scale austroalpine domaine merge montrasio et al 2015 upstream from the zufritt gioveretto reservoir lithotypes are represented by quartzphyllites and michaschists with the presence of amphibolites and sporadic marbles the studied area is highly glacierised 19 2 km2 and the geomorphological importance of past and present glacial processes is testified by the presence of extensive glacial and fluvio glacial deposits glacier fed rivers include the main channel plima m1 m3 originating from the langenferner vedretta lunga glacier and the outlets of its glacierised tributaries ultenmarkt vedretta ultima mt5 zufall vedretta del cevedale mt1 and fürkele vedretta della forcola mt2 the latter was investigated also at the glacier front mt2 1 that receded

investigate a gradient of environmental conditions imparted by a varying cover of glaciers permafrost likelihood and rock glaciers sampling activities involved monthly field campaigns from february 2019 to october 2021 we scheduled the monitoring of sampling locations following the same order during each campaign i e moving downstream from the uppermost sites see supplementary 2 and during the same period and timing among dates and years as suggested by penna et al 2017 sampling locations were monitored when accessible and free from winter snowpack during each visit we recorded the ec µs cm

water dripping or outflowing from snow patches hereafter referred to as snowmelt n 56 and glacier meltwater ice melt n 42 the latter includes the dripping water from the glacier front the supraglacial runoff and the water outflowing from debris covered glacier remnants located at the glacier margins supplementary 3 most of the ice melt samples were obtained at the fürkele glacier at mt2 1 visited monthly whereas only on a few occasions we could sample the ice melt in the schnals basin where we obtained late summer samples from the lazaun n 3 and hochjoch n 2 glaciers at each catchment we placed one built on purpose rainwater collector palmex ltd zagreb croatia at 2000 m a s l during each field visit we measured the ec and the amount of water fallen in each container samples of precipitation n 50 were collected from springtime to autumn because containers were covered with snow during winter to prevent water contamination e g ni cu zn exerted by the brass of the palmex components we used plastic containers to collect precipitation water to be analysed for elemental concentrations all containers were emptied during each visit all water samples were collected in duplicate into new 50 ml for isotopic analyses and 100 ml for multielement analyses pe bottles with double cap vetrotecnica s r l padova italy these containers were rinsed and filled to the brim samples were transported in thermal bags to the laboratories of the free university of bozen bolzano and eco research srl bozen bolzano and they were stored at 4 c before the analyses at the

hydrological conditions of the two catchments we retrieved the data recorded during the years 2019 2021 at the closest automatic weather station aws and automatic hydrological station of the monitoring network managed by the autonomous province of bozen bolzano fig 1 meteorological and hydrological series provided by the apb 2022a and publicly available include air temperature c snow height cm precipitation mm and discharge m3 s 1 at 10 60 min intervals all these variables were recalculated at daily intervals before the analyses we assigned a corresponding hydrological period to each sampling date based on the meteorological and hydrological series fig 2 we distinguished four periods typical of the alpine seasonality winter presence of a continuous snow cover end of october mid of may snowmelt onset of the snowpack thinning discharge rise end of the early summer pulse of discharge mid of may mid of july summer main summer months mid of july end of august and autumn onset of hydrograph recession onset of the winter snowpack september and october based on the available geospatial data we defined for each sampling location a corresponding percentage of glacier gcc based

these analyses were performed with qgis v 2 14 21 thus we categorized the springs and tributaries according to the area covered by different cryospheric components in their catchment glacier fed gcc 5

we used two different approaches firstly we estimated the relative contribution from the snowmelt ice melt and rainwater end members to runoff i e considering that even the baseflow component originates from these sources somers and mckenzie 2020 accordingly we built mixing diagrams based on δ2h and d excess δ2h 8 δ18o for a visual estimation coupled with a numerical method based on bayesian mixing models we used the package mixsiar v 3 1 12 stock and semmens 2016 stock et al 2018 in r v 4 1 2 r core team 2021 these models provide probability estimates associated with the contribution of different end members and the error term is incorporated into the model itself the error structure was set as process error assuming variation in mixture tracer values due to the sampling process and calculations have been made on single samples as all the attempts of using informative priors based on preliminary information on water equivalents of different water sources were unsuccessful problems of convergence unreliable results we informed models with uninformative priors to assess the shifting seasonal contribution of different water sources we performed mixing models separately for each season i e winter snowmelt summer and autumn see above and considered the date as fixed effect we ensured significant differences among different sources with the hotelling t2 test desctools package v 0 99 48 in r signorell et al 2017 a generalization of the student s t test that is used in multivariate hypothesis testing hotelling 1931 the isotopic signature of water sources was considered as time variant i e specific for each season and we referred to the seasonal mean and standard deviation values of δ2h and d excess of the different water sources the autumn isotopic signature of water sources was used also for winter thus assuming that the baseflow during this period resulted from autumn recharge the outcomes of the models were rescaled referring to the spring mspr i e martell spring as a reference location of absent ice melt contribution in fact neither glaciers nor periglacial landforms or permafrost conditions occur in the catchment draining to this spring and thus the estimates of ice melt contribution can be assumed as model shortcomings thus we calibrated the model output for each sampling locations by subtracting the proportion of ice melt contribution calculated at mspr upper boundary of confidence intervals to the ice melt contribution at each location the same value was then added to the calculated snowmelt contribution a second analysis was performed to test the use of ec in two member mixing models we aimed at estimating the groundwater and event water contribution to discharge the first end member corresponds to the contribution from shallow groundwater resources whatever their primary origin the second end member is a combination of the snowmelt ice melt and rainwater fractions that are quickly released to the surface flows we built site specific models using for the groundwater end member the mean and standard deviation values of ec recorded during winter or october for locations that we could not investigate during winter i e during baseflow conditions for the event water end member we used the mean and standard deviation values of ec recorded in rainwater snowmelt and rivulet dripping ice melt waters in fact we did not find significant differences in ec among these water sources see results section for both modelling frameworks sampling locations falling outside the isotopic ec limits for the end members of 5 of the samples were discarded from the analyses because violating a prerequisite of mixing models frenierre and mark 2014 before the analyses we volume weighted the isotopic values of rainwater i e rescaled each value with the amount of rainfall collected in the palmex containers to obtain more precise end member values we discarded precipitation samples that gathered meltwater of snowfall events n 5 as well as snowmelt ice melt samples collected after during rain events n 3 3 4 validation of the models against geodetic glacier mass balance to compare the amount of ice meltwater against the observed glacier loss we used the available data of discharge at the locations m2 and s1 apb 2022b for each seasonal period winter snowmelt summer autumn we calculated the median discharge during the years 2019 2021 then we converted the seasonal ice melt fraction obtained from mixing models into ice melt runoff to do so we used the mean upper and lower confidence intervals of the ice melt fraction during each season the annual ice melt runoff qice in mm was calculated as a weighted mean of ice melt runoff of different seasonal periods accounting for their duration days to obtain the water volumes associated with glacier loss we compared the 2005 and 2016 glacier inventories apb 2022a accordingly we calculated the dod dem of difference i e the digital elevation model resulting from the difference between two digital terrain models dtms based on dtms 2 5 m in spatial resolution and glacier area then based on the total volumetric glacier loss km3 we calculated the average annual glacier loss δvgla mm of water equivalents for the calculations we considered an ice density of 850 kg m 3 and a time interval of 11 years to compare the two outcomes we calculated the ratio of the modelled over the estimated glacier loss r ice δ v gla q ice 100 this approach offers a rough physically based validation of the model mixing model outputs 3 5 hydrochemical dataset we performed multivariate analyses to compare the hydrochemical conditions of different waters non metric multidimensional scaling nmds was chosen because it includes control and response variables in the same analysis a first nmds was performed using the entire dataset to compare different water types snowmelt ice melt rainwater and stream waters then given the distinct lithological setting of the two catchments we performed this analysis separately for schnals and plima before running the analyses we discarded those elements having concentrations below the loq for 95 of the samples v cr mo ag cd sn tl pb for both catchments v cr as mo ag cd sn sb tl pb th u for schnals and normalised i e rescaled to 0 1 the values of the remaining variables to ensure comparability among different scales we removed the outliers hindering nmds interpretation that were identified also with cleveland dotplots and the control variables above the significance level of p 0 01 in the nmds analyses to estimate the correlation among different elements we built a correlation matrix using the corrplot package wei and simko 2021 this step helped to select the subset of elements to be used for further analyses considering that the highly correlated elements had a similar seasonal behaviour when running comparisons among different groups stream type season we used the non parametric kruskall wallis test with post hoc comparisons and bonferroni corrections because of non normal distributions and or inhomogeneous variances among groups persisting even after transformation we used the non parametric correlation test spearman rank to estimate relationships among variables spss statistics software v 27 ibm 2018 4 results 4 1 hydrological end members the precipitation collected at the schnals and plima catchments allowed to build up two overlapping local meteoric water lines δ2h 7 9 δ 18o 10 3 r2 0 98 p 0 001 n 42 supplementary 5 ec was significantly higher p 0 001 in streams than in the snowmelt rainwater and ice melt samples δ2h was significantly different among these water sources p 0 01 with lower values in the snowmelt higher values in rainwater and intermediate values in the ice melt waters fig 3 d excess was significantly higher in the ice melt than in the snowmelt samples p 0 001 the snowmelt and ice melt components had a sharp isotopic seasonality with less negative values of δ2h and increasing d excess from winter and snowmelt towards summer and autumn periods fig 4 a the hotelling t2 test conducted for these end members revealed significant differences p 0 001 among the runoff components in all seasonal periods supplementary 6 4 2 mixing analyses based on δ2h and d excess the isotopic signatures of stream waters were within the isotopic range of the end members and therefore could be used for setting up the three member mixing models although the large variability in isotopic composition of the snowmelt and rainwater components determined relatively large uncertainties of the model outputs in the order of 10 table 2 the results highlight clear differences among stream types fig 4b d and a sharp seasonality of sources contributions to runoff fig 5 fig 6 table 2 supplementary 7 at the gauging locations s1 m2 the ice melt contribution had a unimodal behaviour with late summer maxima and winter

were positively correlated with the groundwater contribution rho 0 54 0 98 p 0 01 the same correlations were not significant at the non glacial springs we did not find significant correlations between groundwater contribution and concentrations of the other elements 5 discussion our work highlights the key hydrological role of the cryosphere in mountain areas where glaciers and rock glaciers drive the isotopic and hydrochemical conditions along the river networks this combined influence is evident even for river sections draining catchments in the order of 30 50 km2 while melting processes drive the water availability at a larger scale local lithological and geomorphological settings influence the quality of the same water with a strong seasonality dictated by the timings of snowmelt glacier ablation and permafrost degradation 5 1 outcomes of the mixing models and their validation in our study we adopted two modelling approaches a first framework based on δ2h and d excess highlighted the different importance of major resources providing water to the catchment i e snow ice and rainfall this method could be investigated for all sampling locations because all mixture values were in the range of the potential sources a second framework aimed at investigating the use of ec as a proxy for groundwater contribution using site specific values during baseflow conditions to represent this end member this approach could be investigated only for the locations fed by glaciers or talus slopes and with low absent rock glacier cover in the catchment at the same time in contrast all rock glacier streams had ec peaks during summer and this prevented the calculation of groundwater contribution because solute enrichment occurred before the onset of baseflow conditions notably if groundwater contribution was estimated taking as a proxy the values of springs with absent glacier rock glacier cover 90 of the stream waters would have exceeded the ec of the groundwater end member in conclusion our results highlight that groundwater contribution cannot be calculated using ec for streams draining rock glacier areas liu et al 2004 we hypothesize that periglacial processes occurring in rock glaciers e g permafrost degradation see colombo et al 2018a are the main drivers confounding the groundwater signal at the reach and at the catchment scales within the isotopic modelling framework snowmelt was the most important water source in the investigated river networks with peaking relative contribution during the snowmelt period and decreasing share of discharge as summer progressed see also penna et al 2017 in general rainwater had a negligible hydrological significance except for springs not influenced by glaciers or rock glaciers at these non glacial springs featuring average flow rates in the order of 0 5 2 l s 1 rainwater accounted for 10 30 of the runoff this agrees with a study on mountain springs in non glacial settings reporting a non negligible importance of the rainwater component lucianetti et al 2020 the ice melt contribution modelled with stable water isotopes was compared against the observed volumetric loss of glaciers however this comparison could provide only an approximation order of magnitudes of the ice melt volumes in fact the geodetic mass budget refers to the period 2005 2016 before the time when the water sampling used for the mixing models was started 2019 also the ice volumes that melt under equilibrium conditions could not be calculated at the plima gauging station m2 the observed glacier loss was within the confidence intervals of the ice melt contribution modelled with stable water isotopes yet with an average overestimation of 47 this overestimation might be related also to the fact that we considered ice melt as the overall glacier melt which is in turn a combination of different cryospheric sources melting on the glacier surface i e old and new snow firn ice see zuecco et al 2019 unfortunately the distinction of these supraglacial sources was outside the scope of this work at the schnals gauging station s1 the overestimation of the ice melt component was too large to be justified by the same methodological issue therefore we hypothesize that the abundance of waters from rock glaciers may have increased the role of the ice melt contribution in the model outcomes thus also mixing models based on stable water isotopes seem to do not adequately describe end members in catchments draining rock glaciers 5 2 what is the ice melt component in rock glacier streams the large ice melt contribution that models returned for rock glacier streams 20 50 is consistent only with hydrological studies on rock glaciers influenced by glacier waters wagner et al 2021b for the lazaun rock glacier feeding rg spring and not influenced by any glacier krainer 2011 estimated a perennially frozen body of 740 000 850 000 m3 and calculated annual ice melting rates corresponding to 1 3 of the spring discharge in contrast melting rates associated to our models 40 70 would have caused the complete loss of perennial ice within 4 7 years in the rock glacier which was still intact in the years of sampling fey and krainer 2020 thus it is highly unlikely that the large ice melt share estimated for rock glacier streams actually reflects the runoff contribution from melting permafrost ice unfortunately this flow component could not be investigated because of the inaccessibility of an ice body buried under several meters of rock debris moreover to be sampled during melt conditions krainer et al 2007 found δ18o values of the ice in an ice cored rock glacier of the austrian alps very similar to those of cirque glacier and associated meltwaters and these values agree with those at rg in our study isotopic studies on rock glacier springs relate the seasonal enrichment in heavy isotopes and d excess to the progressive decrease of depleted snowmelt contribution paralleled by increased contribution from groundwater sources steig et al 1998 williams et al 2006 krainer and mostler 2002 colombo et al 2018b reato et al 2022 if permafrost ice melt should be considered as a negligible contributor to rock glacier outflows krainer 2011 jones et al 2019 wagner et al 2021a we hypothesize key hydrological processes occurring in the active layer as the responsible of very high d excess there percolating water from snowmelt and rainfall experiences multiple cycles of freezing thawing under periglacial conditions williams et al 2006 reato et al 2022 before joining the landform aquifer and being outflowed as such the ice melt component in rock glacier streams can be considered as an indirect proxy for permafrost presence and may be more generally referred to as snow meltwater repeatedly thawed frozen given the abundance of streams that originate from rock glaciers in the study areas not surprisingly we found an indication of their hydrological importance along the entire river networks this is particularly evident in the schnals basin where the little glacier cover is offset by a large rock glacier extent notably we only used rock glacier cover as control variable for isotopic and chemical gradients springs from other periglacial paraglacial features such as protalus ramparts scree slopes and ice embedded moraines abundant in both schnals and plima basins but not inventoried yet may have a water isotopic fingerprint similar to that of rock glaciers reato et al 2022 values of δ2h and d excess similar to those of glacier ice melt can also result from late summer snowmelt because snow undergoes progressive metamorphism as summer progresses along with fractionation processes enhancing isotopic and d excess enrichment of the snowmelt from early summer towards autumn e g taylor et al 2001 liu et al 2004 lee 2014 although snowfields are relatively abundant in the study area they are basically associated with the presence of glaciers above the equilibrium line the meltwaters that we collected during late summer from isolated snow patches even beneath the lazaun rock glacier debris exhibited lower δ2h 103 106 and d excess 6 1 9 3 values when compared with the glacier ice melt δ2h 94 104 d excess 12 9 17 4 thus the modelled ice melt component in rock glacier streams is unlikely determined by the contribution from late summer snowfields that were basically absent in the catchment drained by the rg spring 5 3 isotopic and chemical signatures of spring waters springs of different origin had contrasting isotopic compositions and solute concentrations those fed by glaciers up to 900 µs cm 1 the little ice age moraine and the rock glacier were more enriched in ions the chemical and isotopic similarity of the lazaun glacier during late summer and the moraine springs is not surprising hayashi 2019 as the glacier fed stream seeps into the moraine just 200 m in elevation upstream from the moraine outflow the isotopic similarity of the two wetland springs in the mixing diagrams might indicate similar hydrological processes associated with water retention and release in these systems given their relation with the alluvial zone woods et al 2006 although most of their water was composed of snowmelt and rainwater mixing models suggested some minor contribution from the ice melt because both wetlands lay on plains where also glacier fed streams flow a lateral subsurface exchange between the two systems cannot be excluded however the same process cannot be assumed for the scree spring at plima that in fact was considered as a reference site for model calibration the small seasonality of the isotopic and ec values at this spring suggests that the outflowing water which was mainly composed of snowmelt results from relatively deep subsurface flow paths where the new water is well mixed with the older one before outflowing in contrast the spring laying on the fault line at plima had very high and seasonally variable ec and isotopic signals for this particular spring the contribution to discharge from rainwater was unexpectedly high up to 30 40 there we hypothesize that the enrichment of solutes and trace elements occurring during the snowmelt pulse i e during discharge maxima results from deep flow pathways following the orientation of the fault bense et al 2013 in this particular environment a deep geological weathering would be promoted by the junction between the campo fault and the zebrù scale such a type of weathering may cause the very high ec and concentrations of major ca mg and trace elements e g ni zn ba that we observed at this spring given the little amount of water discharged spring concentrations did not affect the hydrochemistry of the main plima river 5 4 how cryospheric features may influence water chemistry geological and geomorphological settings were major drivers of elemental concentrations at different sampling locations we found more distinct chemical conditions at stations with large glacier and rock glacier cover in particular during summer and autumn see also brighenti et al 2019b this seasonality can be explained by the diminished dilution effect from the snowmelt and a higher contribution from reacted groundwater resources e g penna et al 2017 at plima where the different lithological settings at distinct sub catchments caused a large hydrochemical variability along the river network the madritsch rock glacier stream was unique because of its very high concentrations of sr up to 500 700 µg l 1 for glaciers higher concentrations of manganese were evident for the fürkele and ultenmarkt streams however the export of different solutes from tributaries enhanced the concentrations in the plima stream below the confluence only slightly likely because their discharge was low when compared with that of the main river the highest absolute values of manganese were recorded at the fürkele glacier outflow up to 300 µg l 1 there this element and others like nickel and cobalt peaked during autumn when the modelled groundwater contribution was higher indeed we found a high correlation between the modelled groundwater contribution and the concentrations of these elements at this location concentrations of solutes ec and these trace elements were very low in the supraglacial flows were high at the glacier outlet and decreased when moving downstream along the glacier fed stream thus we suggest that the subglacial weathering was the main driver of high manganese nickel and cobalt concentrations in the fürkele stream tranter et al 2002 tranter 2003 concentrations of iron and aluminium were high in glacier fed streams of plima and close to the lazaun and steinschlag glaciers while the subglacial drainage is considered as the major source also of these metals in glacier waters stachnik et al 2019 a release from melting ice cannot be excluded engel et al 2019 in fact although ice melt samples were depleted in all trace elements there was a strong negative correlation between aluminium iron concentrations which peaked during main summer months and the modelled groundwater contribution in fact ec was not necessarily correlated with concentrations of dissolved elements in our study several trace elements ni zn fe al mn co experienced also different timings in peak concentrations that were anticipated when compared with the timing of ec peaks for example we found a unimodal trend of nickel zinc concentrations as a function of ec this non linear relationship resulting from delayed bulk export of major ions when compared with that of these trace elements suggests that different weathering processes e g carbonate dissolution sulphide oxidation silicate weathering or distinct seasonal flow pathways might preferentially enhance the release of distinct chemical groups for streams fed by rock glaciers a transient increase of solute concentrations during late summer may reveal the seasonal period of major permafrost thawing brighenti et al 2021a at the lazaun rock glacier spring rg this peak was observed for manganese barium zinc and nickel concentrations during autumn but not for ec and other correlated elements ca mg whose concentrations were relatively constant during this period among all the investigated elements nickel reached high values at both catchments with concentrations by far 5 8 times exceeding the european union limits for drinking water quality eu 2020 at plima this element was abundant at the fault spring and in streams with large glacier cover the only exception was the zufall tributary with low nickel concentrations despite high glacier cover this stream is the outlet of a large proglacial lake and chemical processes e g increased ph conditions dillon et al 1988 occurring in the lake may provide hydrochemical buffering for this element likewise other elements such as aluminium and manganese were relatively enriched at the zufall stream during the ablation period thus it is also possible that low nickel concentrations are mostly related to the absence of this heavy metal in the bedrock of the catchment underlain by this tributary in general the geological complexity of the plima catchment makes it difficult to distinguish the single effects from cryospheric drivers and lithological settings on trace element concentrations in the schnals basin the rather uniform lithological conditions represent a common predisposing factor on which cryospheric features enhance nickel export in streams in fact concentrations of this element were low 10 µg l 1 in the non glacial spring and increased exponentially as a function of the glacier and rock glacier covers the weak correlation between nickel and ice melt contribution at glacier fed locations might be caused by the dilution effect from ice melt pulses dampening the contribution from the subglacial drainage the latter is particularly enriched in trace elements when compared with the supraglacial one mitchell et al 2006 however the groundwater event water contribution and their relationship with nickel concentrations could not be calculated at these locations periglacial weathering may enhance nickel concentrations at the lazaun rock glacier spring where the permafrost ice is considered the major source of this heavy metal krainer et al 2011 nickus et al 2023 as well as in stream sections with high rock glacier cover inferred from our mixing models it is unclear if these high concentrations result from weathering processes occurring in the active layer or are released with the permafrost ice melt or result from a combination of both and other phenomena the hydrochemical influence from glaciers and rock glaciers propagates downstream along the river network brighenti et al 2019b in this study concentrations of nickel exceeding the standards for drinking water have been found at the outlet of schnals and this may arise concerns about the quality of water resources further downstream in the vinschgau venosta valley 6 conclusions deglaciating landscapes are highly dynamic hotspots of hydrological and hydrochemical diversity in these rapidly changing environments the complex interplay between lithological settings glacial proglacial and periglacial processes drive the availability and quality of freshwater resources while snowmelt was the dominant runoff contributor in the investigated river networks ice melt accounted for a considerable part of discharge in glacier fed streams confirming the result from the geodetic mass balances for the highly glacierised catchment of plima yet modelling the ice melt contribution can be challenging in areas where the influence from rock glaciers interferes with the isotopic signature of the glaciers in these river networks neither isotopic nor solute based end member mixing models seem to perform well in fact the use of d excess resulted in an overestimation of the glacier ice melt component and electrical conductivity could not be used as a proxy for the groundwater contribution because of the violation of mixing modelling assumptions different weathering processes are responsible for solute enrichment in the alpine river networks where the major solute export is detected during the end of the ablation season in streams influenced by glaciers and during periods of major permafrost degradation for streams influenced by rock glaciers e g brighenti et al 2019b the combined effect from these cryospheric drivers and the partial overlapping of their timings makes it challenging to distinguish the glacial periglacial importance when moving downstream along the river networks under specific lithological settings such cryosphere related processes drive the export of solutes and heavy metals whose concentrations may reach alarming values for drinking water quality and affect aquatic ecology ilyashuk et al 2014 under prolonged deglaciation this may pose new challenges for

1758,glaciers and rock glaciers are key elements of mountain hydrological systems but their relative influence on the chemical and isotopic conditions of streams within the river continuum is still overlooked during three consecutive years 2019 2021 we studied 24 stream sections in two catchments plima and schnals eastern italian alps with varying cover of glaciers and rock glaciers end member mixing models based on δ2h and d excess revealed a large spatial and temporal variability in the contribution of different water sources to stream runoff overall snowmelt 77 17 and rainwater 5 5 were the largest and the smallest runoff components respectively the ice melt contribution was high in streams fed by glaciers 23 15 and rock glaciers 16 16 in the highly glacierised plima basin the tracer based estimation of annual ice melt fraction matched reasonably well 90 167 the mean annual glacial ice loss estimated by geodetic mass balance in contrast we found a large overestimation of the ice melt component derived from mixing models in the poorly glacierised but rock glacier rich schnals catchment in streams influenced by rock glaciers at both catchments the particular temporal patterns of electrical conductivity resulted in unreliable estimates of the meltwater groundwater fractions of runoff depending on the local lithology concentrations of trace elements sr ni ba mn zn al were high in streams fed by rock glaciers and glaciers and close below the limits of quantification in non glacial streams in alpine areas the abundance of rock glaciers can confound the isotopic and chemical signature imparted by glaciers thus hindering the use of tracer based methods for hydrograph separation under the combined influence from glaciers and rock glaciers concentrations of trace

engel et al 2019 brighenti et al 2019b bearzot et al 2023 in the context of the research gaps and challenges described above the present work has the following aims 1 to quantify the relative importance of the ice melt snowmelt and rainwater to stream runoff over a gradient of glacial periglacial influence using δ2h and d excess in mixing models 2 to compare the ice melt volumes derived from mixing models against the observed loss of glacier volumes calculated with geodetic mass balances 3 to test the use of ec as a proxy for groundwater contribution using site specific values during baseflow conditions to estimate this water source in two member mixing models 4 to estimate the relative influence of glaciers and rock glaciers on the stream chemistry and investigate how the contribution from different runoff components influences water quality at different locations to address these objectives herein we present data from two high elevation catchments located in south tyrol eastern italian alps sampling locations underlain by contrasting glacier and rock glacier cover were investigated during three consecutive years with monthly field campaigns aimed at characterising the ec isotopic composition and elemental concentrations of their water 2 study area the plima and the schnals senales river catchments are located in the vinschgau venosta valley south tyrol eastern italian alps fig 1 the upper plima catchment known as martell martello valley is partly included in the stelvio national park and hosts only few infrastructures related to summer tourism mountain huts and sparse livestock grazing in contrast the schnals valley hosts a ski resort and related infrastructures including glacier geotextiles and cable cars affect several slopes at schnals high elevations areas are used for cattle grazing during summer in both catchments water abstractions and large water reservoirs built for hydropower production drastically modify the hydrological regime and aquatic ecology of streams e g ellis and jones 2013 therefore we investigated relatively undisturbed river networks located upstream from the reservoirs 1850 m a s l both catchments are covered with coniferous forests and above the treeline by alpine meadows and pastures the areas exhibit a comparable continental climate with cold summer and absent dry season dfc according to köppen classification beck et al 2018 but differ in terms of geological and geomorphological conditions the upper schnals valley 39 5 km2 belongs to the southern part of the ötztal unit austroalpine domaine and its bedrock is composed of paragneisses michaschists and heterogeneous gneisses with the presence of sporadic quartzite bands autonomous province of bozen bolzano apb in production the glacierised area we hereafter refer to the latest glacier inventory of south tyrol referring to the year 2016 province and of bolzano bozen apb 2022a is relatively small 2 1 km2 table 1 glacial and periglacial landforms such as moraines protalus ramparts and talus slopes are abundant upstream from the vernagt vernago reservoir 44 mapped rock glaciers cover almost the same extent as glaciers 1 8 km2 table 1 we investigated the main schnals river schnals s1 s4 originating from the steinschlag vedretta delle frane glacier and the outlets of its main tributaries these include streams st2 2 st4 st8 with a relatively small glacier cover in their catchments 4 5 21 9 and draining areas abundant in rock glaciers table 1 fig 1 at the lazaun rosshütte sub catchment we also investigated the spring from a little ice age moraine st2 1 and that of an intact rock glacier rg the latter spring was already investigated in other works e g krainer et al 2007 krainer 2011 krainer et al 2015 additional sampling locations include the spring flowing on a wetland st3 and an intermittent stream flowing on a debris flow channel st5 the upper plima river basin 47 km2 is lithologically heterogeneous as it lays where the campo fault and the zebrù scale austroalpine domaine merge montrasio et al 2015 upstream from the zufritt gioveretto reservoir lithotypes are represented by quartzphyllites and michaschists with the presence of amphibolites and sporadic marbles the studied area is highly glacierised 19 2 km2 and the geomorphological importance of past and present glacial processes is testified by the presence of extensive glacial and fluvio glacial deposits glacier fed rivers include the main channel plima m1 m3 originating from the langenferner vedretta lunga glacier and the outlets of its glacierised tributaries ultenmarkt vedretta ultima mt5 zufall vedretta del cevedale mt1 and fürkele vedretta della forcola mt2 the latter was investigated also at the glacier front mt2 1 that receded of about 120 m during the period 2017 2021 comparison of google earth photos fifty rock glaciers occupy the study area at plima most of them 40 are located on the south facing slopes of the madritsch

investigate a gradient of environmental conditions imparted by a varying cover of glaciers permafrost likelihood and rock glaciers sampling activities involved monthly field campaigns from february 2019 to october 2021 we scheduled the monitoring of sampling locations following the same order during each campaign i e moving downstream from the uppermost sites see supplementary 2 and during the same period and timing among dates and years as suggested by penna et al 2017 sampling locations were monitored when accessible and free from winter snowpack during each visit we recorded the ec µs cm 1 and water temperature c by a portable probe cond 3410 wtw gmbh germany precision of 0 1 µs cm 1and 0 1 c respectively and collected water samples of streams and water resources these include the water dripping or outflowing from snow patches hereafter referred to as snowmelt n 56 and glacier meltwater ice melt n 42 the latter includes the dripping water from the glacier front the supraglacial runoff and the water outflowing from debris covered glacier remnants located at the glacier margins supplementary 3 most of the ice melt samples were obtained at the fürkele glacier at mt2 1 visited monthly whereas only on a few occasions we could sample the ice melt in the schnals basin where we obtained late summer samples from the lazaun n 3 and hochjoch n 2 glaciers at each catchment we placed one built on purpose rainwater collector palmex ltd zagreb croatia at 2000 m a s l during each field visit we measured the ec and the amount of water fallen in each container samples of precipitation n 50 were collected from springtime to autumn because containers were covered with snow during winter to prevent water contamination e g ni cu zn exerted by the brass of the palmex components we used plastic containers to collect precipitation water to be analysed for elemental concentrations all containers were emptied during each visit all water samples were collected in duplicate into new 50 ml for isotopic analyses and 100 ml for multielement analyses pe bottles with double cap vetrotecnica s r l padova italy these containers were rinsed and filled to the brim samples were transported in thermal bags to the laboratories of the free university of bozen bolzano and eco research srl bozen bolzano and they were stored at 4 c before the analyses at the university we used a cavity ringdown laser spectroscope crds picarro l2130i ca usa to measure the values of δ2h and δ 18o in the sampled waters we used internal standards and obtained isotopic values

hydrological conditions of the two catchments we retrieved the data recorded during the years 2019 2021 at the closest automatic weather station aws and automatic hydrological station of the monitoring network managed by the autonomous province of bozen bolzano fig 1 meteorological and hydrological series provided by the apb 2022a and publicly available include air temperature c snow height cm precipitation mm and discharge m3 s 1 at 10 60 min intervals all these variables were recalculated at daily intervals before the analyses we assigned a corresponding hydrological period to each sampling date based on the meteorological and hydrological series fig 2 we distinguished four periods typical of the alpine seasonality winter presence of a continuous snow cover end of october mid of may snowmelt onset of the snowpack thinning discharge rise end of the early summer pulse of discharge mid of may mid of july summer main summer months mid of july end of august and autumn onset of hydrograph recession onset of the winter snowpack september and october based on the available geospatial data we defined for each sampling location a corresponding percentage of glacier gcc based on the latest glacier inventory that was performed during 2016 permafrost pcc extent of the permafrost in almost all conditions category and rock glacier rgc cover in the catchment source apb 2022a these analyses were performed with qgis v 2 14 21 thus we categorized the springs and tributaries according to the area covered by different cryospheric components in their catchment glacier fed gcc 5 gcc rgc rock glacier rgc gcc rgc 5 permafrost gcc 5 rgc 5 pcc 5 and non glacial gcc rgc and pcc 5 3 3 end member mixing models to estimate the streamflow contribution from different runoff components we used two different approaches firstly we estimated the relative contribution from the snowmelt ice melt and rainwater end members to runoff i e considering that even the baseflow component originates from these sources somers and mckenzie 2020 accordingly we built mixing diagrams based on δ2h and d excess δ2h 8 δ18o for a visual estimation coupled with a numerical method based on bayesian mixing models we used the package mixsiar v 3 1 12 stock and semmens 2016 stock et al 2018 in r v 4 1 2 r core team 2021 these models provide probability estimates associated with the contribution of different end members and the error term is incorporated into the model itself the error structure was set as process error assuming variation in mixture tracer values due to the sampling process and calculations have been made on single samples as all the attempts of using informative priors based on preliminary information on water equivalents of different water sources were unsuccessful problems of convergence unreliable results we informed models with uninformative priors to assess the shifting seasonal contribution of different water sources we performed mixing models separately for each season i e winter snowmelt summer and autumn see above and considered the date as fixed effect we ensured significant differences among different sources with the hotelling t2 test desctools package v 0 99 48 in r signorell et al 2017 a generalization of the student s t test that is used in multivariate hypothesis testing hotelling 1931 the isotopic signature of water sources was considered as time variant i e specific for each season and we referred to the seasonal mean and standard deviation values of δ2h and d excess of the different water sources the autumn isotopic signature of water sources was used also for winter thus assuming that the baseflow during this period resulted from autumn recharge the outcomes of the models were rescaled referring to the spring mspr i e martell spring as a reference location of absent ice melt contribution in fact neither glaciers nor periglacial landforms or permafrost conditions occur in the catchment draining to this spring and thus the estimates of ice melt contribution can be assumed as model shortcomings thus we calibrated the model output for each sampling locations by subtracting the proportion of ice melt contribution calculated at mspr upper boundary of confidence intervals to the ice melt contribution at each location the same value was then added to the calculated snowmelt contribution a second analysis was performed to test the use of ec in two member mixing models we aimed at estimating the groundwater and event water contribution to discharge the first end member corresponds to the contribution from shallow groundwater resources whatever their primary origin the second end member is a combination of the snowmelt ice melt and rainwater fractions that are quickly released to the surface flows we built site specific models using for the groundwater end member the mean and standard deviation values of ec recorded during winter or october for locations that we could not investigate during winter i e during baseflow conditions for the event water end member we used the mean and standard deviation values of ec recorded in rainwater snowmelt and rivulet dripping ice melt waters in fact we did not find significant differences in ec among these water sources see results section for both modelling frameworks sampling locations falling outside the isotopic ec limits for the end members of 5 of the samples were discarded from the analyses because violating a prerequisite of mixing models frenierre and mark 2014 before the analyses we volume weighted the isotopic values of rainwater i e rescaled each value with the amount of rainfall collected in the palmex containers to obtain more precise end member values we discarded precipitation samples that gathered meltwater of snowfall events n 5 as well as snowmelt ice melt samples collected after during rain events n 3 3 4 validation of the models against geodetic glacier mass balance to compare the amount of ice meltwater against the observed glacier loss we used the available data of discharge at the locations m2 and s1 apb 2022b for each seasonal period winter snowmelt summer autumn we calculated the median discharge during the years 2019 2021 then we converted the seasonal ice melt fraction obtained from mixing models into ice melt runoff to do so we used the mean upper and lower confidence intervals of the ice melt fraction during each season the annual ice melt runoff qice in mm was calculated as a weighted mean of ice melt runoff of different seasonal periods accounting for their duration days to obtain the water volumes associated with glacier loss we compared the 2005 and 2016 glacier inventories apb 2022a accordingly we calculated the dod dem of difference i e the digital elevation model resulting from the difference between two digital terrain models dtms based on dtms 2 5 m in spatial resolution and glacier area then based on the total volumetric glacier loss km3 we calculated the average annual glacier loss δvgla mm of water equivalents for the calculations we considered an ice density of 850 kg m 3 and a time interval of 11 years to compare the two outcomes we calculated the ratio of the modelled over the estimated glacier loss r ice δ v gla q ice 100 this approach offers a rough physically based validation of the model mixing model outputs 3 5 hydrochemical dataset we performed multivariate analyses to compare the hydrochemical conditions of different waters non metric multidimensional scaling nmds was chosen because it includes control and response variables in the same analysis a first nmds was performed using the entire dataset to compare different water types snowmelt ice melt rainwater and stream waters then given the distinct lithological setting of the two catchments we performed this analysis separately for schnals and plima before running the analyses we discarded those elements having concentrations below the loq for 95 of the samples v cr mo ag cd sn tl pb for both catchments v cr as mo ag cd sn sb tl pb th u for schnals and normalised i e rescaled to 0 1 the values of the remaining variables to ensure comparability among different scales we removed the outliers hindering nmds interpretation that were identified also with cleveland dotplots and the control variables above the significance level of p 0 01 in the nmds analyses to estimate the correlation among different elements we built a correlation matrix using the corrplot package wei and simko 2021 this step helped to select the subset of elements to be used for further analyses considering that the highly correlated elements had a similar seasonal behaviour when running comparisons among different groups stream type season we used the non parametric kruskall wallis test with post hoc comparisons and bonferroni corrections because of non normal distributions and or inhomogeneous variances among groups persisting even after transformation we used the non parametric correlation test spearman rank to estimate relationships among variables spss statistics software v 27 ibm 2018 4 results 4 1 hydrological end members the

higher p 0 001 in streams than in the snowmelt rainwater and ice melt samples δ2h was significantly different among these water sources p 0 01 with lower values in the snowmelt higher values in rainwater and intermediate values in the ice melt waters fig 3 d excess was significantly higher in the ice melt than in the snowmelt samples p 0 001 the snowmelt and ice melt components had a sharp isotopic seasonality with less negative values of δ2h and increasing d excess from winter and snowmelt towards summer and autumn periods fig 4 a the hotelling t2 test conducted for these end members revealed significant differences p 0 001 among the runoff components in all seasonal periods supplementary 6 4 2 mixing analyses based on δ2h and d excess the isotopic signatures of stream waters were within the isotopic range of the end members and therefore could be used for setting up the three member mixing models although the large variability in isotopic composition of the snowmelt and rainwater components determined relatively large uncertainties of the model outputs in the order of 10 table 2 the results highlight clear differences among stream types fig 4b d and a sharp seasonality of sources contributions to runoff fig 5 fig 6 table 2 supplementary 7 at the gauging locations s1 m2 the ice melt contribution had a unimodal behaviour with late summer maxima and winter early summer minima fig 7 overall snowmelt was the dominant runoff component at all locations 77 17 with a significantly higher contribution when compared with ice melt and rainwater p 0 001 fig 5 table 2 the snowmelt fraction was significantly higher during the winter and snowmelt periods than during summer and autumn p 0 001 in contrast the rainwater contribution was very low in all periods 5

contribution from the ice melt was generally high at glacier fed sampling locations 23 15 fig 6 we found a strong correlation between the gcc and the ice melt contribution during summer rho 0 77 p 0

relatively large ice melt contribution too 16 17 in fact the ice melt component was strongly correlated to rgc rho 0 74 p 0 001 and pcc rho 0 60 p 0 001 in locations not fed by glaciers this was particularly evident during summer and autumn fig 5 when the rock glacier spring rg runoff was 47 10 composed of ice melt 4 3 geodetic mass balances and ice loss volumes in the period 2005 2016

runoff was 5 1 times median value the observed glacier loss rice 305 701 table 3 4 4 mixing models based on electrical conductivity almost half of the sampling locations 13 over 24 could not be used to perform two member mixing models on groundwater contribution in fact the stream water ec was higher than that of the groundwater end member for 10 70 of the samples depending on the sampling location most of the sampling locations at schnals 7 over 12 were excluded such as the main stream and rock glacier streams at plima we could not perform the models for the two rock glacier tributaries mt6 mt7 and the fault spring mt4 in these discarded locations ec peaked during late summer except at the fault spring where peaks occurred during july fig 8 at the locations where mixing modelling assumptions were not violated ec peaked during the baseflow periods there groundwater contribution was lower 40 60 during the snowmelt and summer periods increased during autumn and had higher values during winter 90 table 2 fig 6 4 5 hydrochemical conditions of water sources and streams the nmds performed using the entire dataset k 3 stress 0 10 r2 0 99 revealed the presence of two

large chemical variability which made it difficult to distinguish them among each other in the nmds space notably the hochjoch and lazaun glacier outflows sampled only a few times during late summer

groundwater contribution was positively correlated with nickel concentrations along the zufall glacier fed tributary rho 0 53 p 0 005 at glacier fed tributaries and the main stream ca mg sr and ba were positively correlated with the groundwater contribution rho 0 54 0 98 p 0 01 the same correlations were not significant at the non glacial springs we did not find significant correlations between groundwater contribution and concentrations of the other elements 5 discussion our work highlights the key hydrological role of the cryosphere in mountain areas where glaciers and rock glaciers drive the isotopic and hydrochemical conditions along the river networks this combined influence is evident even for river sections draining catchments in the order of 30 50 km2 while melting processes drive the water availability at a larger scale local lithological and geomorphological settings influence the quality of the same water with a strong seasonality dictated by the timings of snowmelt glacier ablation and permafrost degradation 5 1 outcomes of the mixing models and their validation in our study we adopted two modelling approaches a first framework based on δ2h and d excess highlighted the different importance of major resources providing water to the catchment i e snow ice and rainfall this method could be investigated for all sampling locations because all mixture values were in the range of the potential sources a second framework aimed at investigating the use of ec as a proxy for groundwater contribution using site specific values during baseflow conditions to represent this end member this approach could be investigated only for the locations fed by glaciers or talus slopes and with low absent rock glacier cover in the catchment at the same time in contrast all rock glacier streams had ec peaks during summer and this prevented the calculation of groundwater contribution because solute enrichment occurred before the onset of baseflow conditions notably if groundwater contribution was estimated taking as a proxy the values of springs with absent glacier rock glacier cover 90 of the stream waters would have exceeded the ec of the groundwater end member in conclusion our results highlight that groundwater contribution cannot be calculated using ec for streams draining rock glacier areas liu et al 2004 we hypothesize that periglacial processes occurring in rock glaciers e g permafrost degradation see colombo et al 2018a are the main drivers confounding the groundwater signal at the reach and at the catchment scales within the isotopic modelling framework snowmelt was the most important water source in the investigated river networks with peaking relative contribution during the snowmelt period and decreasing share of discharge as summer progressed see also penna et al 2017 in general rainwater had a negligible hydrological significance except for springs not influenced by glaciers or rock glaciers at these non glacial springs featuring average flow rates in the order of 0 5 2 l s 1 rainwater accounted for 10 30 of the runoff this agrees with a study on mountain springs in non glacial settings reporting a non negligible importance of the rainwater component lucianetti et al 2020 the ice melt contribution modelled with stable water isotopes was compared against the observed volumetric loss of glaciers however this comparison could provide only an approximation order of magnitudes of the ice melt volumes in fact the geodetic mass budget refers to the period 2005 2016 before the time when the water sampling used for the mixing models was started 2019 also the ice volumes that melt under equilibrium conditions could not be calculated at the plima gauging station m2 the observed glacier loss was within the confidence intervals of the ice melt contribution modelled with stable water isotopes yet with an average overestimation of 47 this overestimation might be related also to the fact that we considered ice melt as the overall glacier melt which is in turn a combination of different cryospheric sources melting on the glacier surface i e old and new snow firn ice see zuecco et al 2019 unfortunately the distinction of these supraglacial sources was outside the scope of this work at the schnals gauging station s1 the overestimation of the ice melt component was too large to be justified by the same methodological issue therefore we hypothesize that the abundance of waters from rock glaciers may have increased the role of the ice melt contribution in the model outcomes thus also mixing models based on stable water isotopes seem to do not adequately describe end members in catchments draining rock glaciers 5 2 what is the ice melt component in rock glacier streams the large ice melt contribution that models returned for rock glacier streams 20 50 is consistent only with hydrological studies on rock glaciers influenced by glacier waters wagner et al 2021b for the lazaun rock glacier feeding rg spring and not influenced by any glacier krainer 2011 estimated a perennially frozen body of 740 000 850 000 m3 and calculated annual ice melting rates corresponding to 1 3 of the spring discharge in contrast melting rates associated to our models 40 70 would have caused the complete loss of perennial ice within 4 7 years in the rock glacier which was still intact in the years of sampling fey and krainer 2020 thus it is highly unlikely that the large ice melt share estimated for rock glacier streams actually reflects the runoff contribution from melting permafrost ice unfortunately this flow component could not be investigated because of the inaccessibility of an ice body buried under several meters of rock debris moreover to be sampled during melt conditions krainer et al 2007 found δ18o values of the ice in an ice cored rock glacier of the austrian alps very similar to those of cirque glacier and associated meltwaters and these values agree with those at rg in our study isotopic studies on rock glacier springs relate the seasonal enrichment in heavy isotopes and d excess to the progressive decrease of depleted snowmelt contribution paralleled by increased contribution from groundwater sources steig et al 1998 williams et al 2006 krainer and mostler 2002 colombo et al 2018b reato et al 2022 if permafrost ice melt should be considered as a negligible contributor to rock glacier outflows krainer 2011 jones et al 2019 wagner et al 2021a we hypothesize key hydrological processes occurring in the active layer as the responsible of very high d excess there percolating water from snowmelt and rainfall experiences multiple cycles of freezing thawing under periglacial conditions williams et al 2006 reato et al 2022 before joining the landform aquifer and being outflowed as such the ice melt component in rock glacier streams can be considered as an indirect proxy for permafrost presence and may be more generally referred to as snow meltwater repeatedly thawed frozen given the abundance of streams that originate from rock glaciers in the study areas not surprisingly we found an indication of their hydrological importance along the entire river networks this is particularly evident in the schnals basin where the little glacier cover is offset by a large rock glacier extent notably we only used rock glacier cover as control variable for isotopic and chemical gradients springs from other periglacial paraglacial features such as protalus ramparts scree slopes and ice embedded moraines abundant in both schnals and plima basins but not inventoried yet may have a water isotopic fingerprint similar to that of rock glaciers reato et al 2022 values of δ2h and d excess similar to those of glacier ice melt can also result from late summer snowmelt because snow undergoes progressive metamorphism as summer progresses along with fractionation processes enhancing isotopic and d excess enrichment of the snowmelt from early summer towards autumn e g taylor et al 2001 liu et al 2004 lee 2014 although snowfields are relatively abundant in the study area they are basically associated with the presence of glaciers above the equilibrium line the meltwaters that we collected during late summer from isolated snow patches even beneath the lazaun rock glacier debris exhibited lower δ2h 103 106 and d excess 6 1 9 3 values when compared with the glacier ice melt δ2h 94 104 d excess 12 9 17 4 thus the modelled ice melt component in rock glacier streams is unlikely determined by the contribution from late summer snowfields that were basically absent in the catchment drained by the rg spring 5 3 isotopic and chemical signatures of spring waters springs of different origin had contrasting isotopic compositions and solute concentrations those fed by glaciers up to 900 µs cm 1 the little ice age moraine and the rock glacier were more enriched in ions the chemical and isotopic similarity of the lazaun glacier during late summer and the moraine springs is not surprising hayashi 2019 as the glacier fed stream seeps into the moraine just 200 m in elevation upstream from the moraine outflow the isotopic similarity of the two wetland springs in the mixing diagrams might indicate similar hydrological processes associated with water retention and release in these systems given their relation with the alluvial zone woods et al 2006 although most of their water was composed of snowmelt and rainwater mixing models suggested some minor contribution from the ice melt because both wetlands lay on plains where also glacier fed streams flow a lateral subsurface exchange between the two systems cannot be excluded however the same process cannot be assumed for the scree spring at plima that in fact was considered as a reference site for model calibration the small seasonality of the isotopic and ec values at this spring suggests that the outflowing water which was mainly composed of snowmelt results from relatively deep subsurface flow paths where the new water is well mixed with the older one before outflowing in contrast the spring laying on the fault line at plima had very high and seasonally variable ec and isotopic signals for this particular spring the contribution to discharge from rainwater was unexpectedly high up to 30 40 there we hypothesize that the enrichment of solutes and trace elements occurring during the snowmelt pulse i e during discharge maxima results from deep flow pathways following the orientation of the fault bense et al 2013 in this particular environment a deep geological weathering would be promoted by the junction between the campo fault and the zebrù scale such a type of weathering may cause the very high ec and concentrations of major ca mg and trace elements e g ni zn ba that we observed at this spring given the little amount of water discharged spring concentrations did not affect the hydrochemistry of the main plima river 5 4 how cryospheric features may influence water chemistry geological and geomorphological settings were major drivers of elemental concentrations at different sampling locations we found more distinct chemical conditions at stations with large glacier and rock glacier cover in particular during summer and autumn see also brighenti et al 2019b this seasonality can be explained by the diminished dilution effect from the snowmelt and a higher contribution from reacted groundwater resources e g penna et al 2017 at plima where the different lithological settings at distinct sub catchments caused a large hydrochemical variability along the river network the madritsch rock glacier stream was unique because of its very high concentrations of sr up to 500 700 µg l 1 for glaciers higher concentrations of manganese were evident for the fürkele and ultenmarkt streams however the export of different solutes from tributaries enhanced the concentrations in the plima stream below the confluence only slightly likely because their discharge was low when compared with that of the main river the highest absolute values of manganese were recorded at the fürkele glacier outflow up to 300 µg l 1 there this element and others like nickel and cobalt peaked during autumn when the modelled groundwater contribution was higher indeed we found a high correlation between the modelled groundwater contribution and the concentrations of these elements at this location concentrations of solutes ec and these trace elements were very low in the supraglacial flows were high at the glacier outlet and decreased when moving downstream along the glacier fed stream thus we suggest that the subglacial weathering was the main driver of high manganese nickel and cobalt concentrations in the fürkele stream tranter et al 2002 tranter 2003 concentrations of iron and aluminium were high in glacier fed streams of plima and close to the lazaun and steinschlag glaciers while the subglacial drainage is considered as the major source also of these metals in glacier waters stachnik et al 2019 a release from melting ice cannot be excluded engel et al 2019 in fact although ice melt samples were depleted in all trace elements there was a strong negative correlation between aluminium iron concentrations which peaked during main summer months and the modelled groundwater contribution in fact ec was not necessarily correlated with concentrations of dissolved elements in our study several trace elements ni zn fe al mn co experienced also different timings in peak concentrations that were anticipated when compared with the timing of ec peaks for example we found a unimodal trend of nickel zinc concentrations as a function of ec this non linear relationship resulting from delayed bulk export of major ions when compared with that of these trace elements suggests that different weathering processes e g carbonate dissolution sulphide oxidation silicate weathering or distinct seasonal flow pathways might preferentially enhance the release of distinct chemical groups for streams fed by rock glaciers a transient increase of solute concentrations during late summer may reveal the seasonal period of major permafrost thawing brighenti et al 2021a at the lazaun rock glacier spring rg this peak was observed for manganese barium zinc and nickel concentrations during autumn but not for ec and other correlated elements ca mg whose concentrations were relatively constant during this period among all the investigated elements nickel reached high values at both catchments with concentrations by far 5 8 times exceeding the european union limits for drinking water quality eu 2020 at plima this element was abundant at the fault spring and in streams with large glacier cover the only exception was the zufall tributary with low nickel concentrations despite high glacier cover this stream is the outlet of a large proglacial lake and chemical processes e g increased ph conditions dillon et al 1988 occurring in the lake may provide hydrochemical buffering for this element likewise other elements such as aluminium and manganese were relatively enriched at the zufall stream during the ablation period thus it is also possible that low nickel concentrations are mostly related to the absence of this heavy metal in the bedrock of the catchment underlain by this tributary in general the geological complexity of the plima catchment makes it difficult to distinguish the single effects from cryospheric drivers and lithological settings on trace element concentrations in the schnals basin the rather uniform lithological conditions represent a common predisposing factor on which cryospheric features enhance nickel export in streams in fact concentrations of this element were low 10 µg l 1 in the non glacial spring and increased exponentially as a function of the glacier and rock glacier covers the weak correlation between nickel and ice melt contribution at glacier fed locations might be caused by the dilution effect from ice melt pulses dampening the contribution from the subglacial drainage the latter is particularly enriched in trace elements when compared with the supraglacial one mitchell et al 2006 however the groundwater event water contribution and their relationship with nickel concentrations could not be calculated at these locations periglacial weathering may enhance nickel concentrations at the lazaun rock glacier spring where the permafrost ice is considered the major source of this heavy metal krainer et al 2011 nickus et al 2023 as well as in stream sections with high rock glacier cover inferred from our mixing models it is unclear if these high concentrations result from weathering processes occurring in the active layer or are released with the permafrost ice melt or result from a combination of both and other phenomena the hydrochemical influence from glaciers and rock glaciers propagates downstream along the river network brighenti et al 2019b in this study concentrations of nickel exceeding the standards for drinking water have been found at the outlet of schnals and this may arise concerns about the quality of water resources further downstream in the vinschgau venosta valley 6 conclusions deglaciating landscapes are highly dynamic hotspots of hydrological and hydrochemical diversity in these rapidly changing environments the complex interplay between lithological settings glacial proglacial and periglacial processes drive the availability and quality of freshwater resources while snowmelt was the dominant runoff contributor in the investigated river networks ice melt accounted for a considerable part of discharge in glacier fed streams confirming the result from the geodetic mass balances for the highly glacierised catchment of plima yet modelling the ice melt contribution can be challenging in areas where the influence from rock glaciers interferes with the isotopic signature of the glaciers in these river networks neither isotopic nor solute based end member mixing models seem to perform well in fact the use of d excess resulted in an overestimation of the glacier ice melt component and electrical conductivity could not be used as a proxy for the groundwater contribution because of the violation of mixing modelling assumptions different weathering processes are responsible for solute enrichment in the alpine river networks where the major solute export is detected during the end of the ablation season in streams influenced by glaciers and during periods of major permafrost degradation for streams influenced by rock glaciers e g brighenti et al 2019b the combined effect from these cryospheric drivers and the partial overlapping of their timings makes it challenging to distinguish the glacial periglacial importance when moving downstream along the river networks under specific lithological settings such cryosphere related processes drive the export of solutes and heavy metals whose concentrations may reach alarming values for drinking water quality and affect aquatic ecology ilyashuk et al 2014 under prolonged deglaciation this may pose new challenges for

1759,human activities are altering global biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen n phosphorus p and biogenic silica bsi in order to reveal nutrient dynamics in response to human disturbances this study explores burial rates and ratios of n p and bsi in 210pb dated sediment cores from eight lakes in the middle yangtze river floodplain mean burial rates of n p and bsi increased substantially from the early 20th century except for a hiatus in the 1970s before the 1960s the stable ratios of n p n bsi and p bsi indicated the nutrient supply from clastic sources while arable land expansion enhanced nutrient burial in lakes although damming increased the retention of n p and bsi in upstream reservoirs after the 1960s anthropogenic n and p release to the lakes outpaced the retention by dams as suggested by continuous increases in n and p burial rates the concurrent increase in bsi burial rate suggested that nutrient enrichment promoted diatom production at the earlier stage while rising n bsi and p bsi ratios and declining bsi burial rate from the 1990s indicated the si depletion with further eutrophication spatial heterogeneities among the lakes were linked to site specific factors such as hydrological connectivity and macrophyte growth synchronous increases in n p and bsi burial rates before the 1960s mainly responded to deforestation and arable land expansion thereafter the decoupling of n p and bsi likely resulted from intensive farming e g fertilizer usage and damming given new dam construction and land use change in river basins the bsi depletion relative to n and p is likely occurring in riverine floodplains worldwide keywords nutrient stoichiometry lacustrine sediment burial rate eutrophication dam construction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rivers provide the primary link between land and sea annually discharging about 36 thousand km3 of freshwater and more than 20 billion tonnes of solid and dissolved material to the ocean milliman and farnsworth 2011 riverine transported material contains nutrients that are essential for sustaining aquatic primary productivity jiang et al 2014 ran et al 2022 among the key constituents of aquatic ecosystems nitrogen n phosphorus p and dissolved silica dsi are essential nutrients for primary productivity wetzel 2001 in natural waters the ratio of essential elements is a nearly constant value which is known as the redfield ratio that phytoplankton tends to require for sustained growth e g 1 1 dsi dissolved inorganic nitrogen din for diatoms brzezinski 1985 the riverine load of n p and dsi carried from rivers to the ocean are 21 3 7 and 194 tg yr 1 respectively turner et al 2003 however land use changes and dam building have altered the fluxes and ratios of n p and dsi along the river continuum during recent decades causing far reaching effects on the structure and function of riverine and coastal ecosystems worldwide chen et al 2022a jiang et al 2014 maavara et al 2020 penuelas et al 2020 ran et al 2022 tong et al 2022 zeng et al 2023 since the early 20th century widespread deforestation and land reclamation due to food demand of an increasing population have enhanced soil erosion and terrigenous nutrient load especially in developing regions gonzalez rodriguez et al 2023 rose et al 2011 in southern rivers south of 20 n with few dams suspended sediment flux increased by 41 due to widespread deforestation from 1984 to 2020 ce while sediment trapping by reservoirs in northern rivers with many dams has contributed to global sediment flux declines to 49 of pre dam conditions dethier et al 2022 taken the yangtze river as an example sediment discharge has decreased from 470 mt yr 1 in 1950 1985 ce to 126 mt yr 1 in 2006 2020 ce zhang et al 2022 meanwhile ongoing dam construction has caused greater removal of silicon si and p over n in riverine discharge to coastal waters maavara et al 2020 since si and p are mainly transported in particulate form which tends to settle scibona et al 2022 based on the global news model it is estimated that annual mass of n p and reactive si trapped in global reservoirs reached 110 42 and 372 gmol respectively akbarzadeh et al 2019 maavara et al 2014 maavara et al 2015 in a world of accelerating dam construction the amount of n p and si trapped in reservoirs will continue to increase especially in rapidly developing countries such as china maavara et al 2020 despite increased nutrient retention by dams n and p can be overcompensated by anthropogenic nutrient inputs such as fertilizer usage and sewage discharge while dsi in surface waters mainly originates from the weathering of sedimentary and crystalline rocks turner et al 2003 therefore the combined effects of anthropogenic nutrient inputs and ongoing dam construction probably caused si depletion relative to n and p maavara et al 2020 which may facilitate the blooms of non siliceous algae and compromise the diatom zooplankton fish food chain humborg et al 1997 jiang et al 2014 li et al 2007 ran et al 2022 turner et al 2003 in order to minimize negative effects of nutrient imbalance on biodiversity ecosystem services and economies it is essential to explore spatiotemporal changes in nutrient fluxes and ratios for sustainable management of aquatic ecosystems recent studies have explored nutrient dynamics in response to human disturbances at global maavara et al 2020 turner et al 2003 and local scibona et al 2022 scales however an accurate estimation of global nutrient transport is limited by the lack of long term greater than100 years observation data at the regional scale akbarzadeh et al 2019 liu et al 2020 maavara et al 2014 maavara et al 2015 further exploration of past nutrient dynamics at the regional scale can not only provide basic data for global estimates but also improve the effectiveness of nutrient management practices in the middle and lower reaches of large rivers depressions in alluvial plains receive lateral overflow water and then form lakes tockner and stanford 2002 in monsoon climate regions water and sediments flow into floodplain lakes during the rainy season when the water level in the mainstream is higher than that of the lakes and flow out during the dry season guo et al 2012 zeng et al 2018 the seasonal variations of flood and drought and the hydrological connectivity between lakes and rivers are the major factors driving the lateral and longitudinal exchange of nutrients tockner and stanford 2002 wang et al 2016 nutrients that accumulate in sediments over time contribute to a legacy effect whereby sediments in floodplain lakes can retain and act as a buffer against riverine nutrient budgets bhattacharya et al 2022 maranger et al 2018 therefore the global land ocean nutrient fluxes must consider the aggregation and buffering effects that operate in riverine floodplains due to the scarcity of long term observation data decadal scale nutrient dynamics in response to watershed disturbances have been less explored in riverine floodplains that are critical zones of nutrient processing along the land sea continuum the middle yangtze river reaches embrace hundreds of shallow freshwater lakes which mostly formed during the holocene due to damming of tributaries by the natural levees of the yangtze river boyle et al 1999 du et al 2011 these lakes not only are the major water source for agricultural and industrial production but also are efficient reservoirs for flood mitigation during the rainy season yin and li 2001 since the mid 20th century these lakes have experienced severe environmental degradation due to human activities niglas 2019 for example the massive construction of new dams has limited free hydrological connectivity between the lakes and the yangtze river wang et al 2016 and hence riverine loads of n p and si from the yangtze river would be blocked from entering the lakes during high flow periods chen et al 2022b zeng et al 2018 meanwhile anthropogenic emissions of n and p to these lakes have increased profoundly due to fertilizer usage and sewage discharge since the 1970s liu et al 2018 ran et al 2022 given that there is a lack of anthropogenic compensation for si it is reasonable to assume that the stoichiometric ratios of n si and p si in the yangtze floodplain lakes would increase in this study n p and biogenic silica bsi were analysed in 210pb dated sediment cores collected from eight lakes in the middle yangtze river reaches sedimentary n and p can reflect nutrient loads from the catchment into lakes cao et al 2020 foucher et al 2020 ruiz fernández et al 2002 villa et al 2023 wu et al 2008 bsi an important proxy reflecting aquatic primary productivity mainly originates from diatoms and phytoliths conley and schelske 2001 ran et al 2016 schelske et al 1983 the aims of this study were 1 to calculate the burial rates and ratios of n p and bsi in sediment cores collected from eight lakes in the middle yangtze river floodplain 2 to explore underlying driving forces for spatiotemporal patterns of nutrient dynamics in these floodplain lakes during the last two centuries 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the middle yangtze river reaches are featured by the plain of hubei and hunan in the centre and mountains around the plain fig 1 and have an area of 6 8 105 km2 accounting for 37 of total area in the yangtze river basin du 2016 the climate in this region is characterised by the east asian summer monsoon with mean annual precipitation of 1200 mm and mean annual temperature ranging from 16 to 18 c moist climate and low lying alluvial plain in this region create the largest group of freshwater lakes in china wang and dou 1998 due to fertile soils favourable climate and immigrants from north china this region has been a major grain producing area since the ming dynasty du 2016 since these lakes have important economic and ecological functions such as water supply flood mitigation fisheries and biodiversity conservation this region has been designated as one of the global 200 conservation priority ecoregions du 2016 in particular the three gorges dam tgd and the danjiangkou reservoir i e water source area of the middle route of the south to north water transfer project are constructed in the middle yangtze river reaches and hence water environment protection has profound implications for drinking water safety at regional to national scales du 2016 with rapid population growth and economic development anthropogenic disturbances have caused environmental degradation of these lakes during recent decades niglas 2019 su et al 2023 for example lake area in this region has shrunk more than 5000 km2 since the 1950s du et al 2011 due to excess nutrient release from sewage discharge and fertilizer usage most lakes are suffering from eutrophication with frequent cyanobacteria blooms niglas 2019 wang et al 2016 zeng et al 2023 2 2 sampling and laboratory analysis sediment cores were collected using a gravity corer from the central part of eight lakes including east dongting edt honghu hh futou ft luhu lh shahu sh yanxi yx wanghu wh and poyang py lakes fig 1 and table 1 previous studies suggested that the single sediment core collected from the central part of floodplain lakes could provide a representative record of their history sun et al 2020 zeng et al 2022 each sediment core was sectioned at 1 cm intervals in the field and then samples were transported to the laboratory for further analysis for chronological and geochemical analyses samples were processed at every second 1 cm interval using standard procedures to establish the chronologies of the eight sediment cores measurements of 210pb and 137cs were combined with counts of spheroidal carbonaceous particles scps chen et al 2019 wet sediment samples were treated with 30 h2o2 and 10 hcl to remove organic matter and carbonate and then sedimentary particle size spectra were measured at 1 cm intervals using a malvern automated laser optical particle size analyser mastersizer 2000 the analytical range of the analyser was between 0 02 and 2000 μm with an analytical error of less than 3 fractions of clay and fine silts are shown to indicate sedimentary environment in the lakes nitrogen was measured by combustion using a chn elemental analyser

an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes profile dv after digestion in a mixture of hf hcl hno3 and hclo4 precision and accuracy of the icp aes measurement was checked by repeated measurements of the certified reference material gsd 11 the precision was generally better than 5 bsi content in the sediment was estimated using a rapid wet alkaline extraction procedure huang et al 2020 mortlock and froelich 1989 samples were treated using 10 h2o2 and 1 n hcl in order to remove all organic and carbonate components treated with 40 ml of 2 m na2co3 and then placed in a constant temperature water bath at 85 c for 5 h bsi in the clear supernatant was measured using the molybdate blue spectrophotometric method at 810 nm fanning and pilson 1973 the standard si solutions gbw08642 gbw08649 of five different concentrations 0 12 5 25 50 and 100 μmol l 1 were used for calibration the precision for duplicate sample measurements was better than 5 2 3 statistical analyses given potential effects of other sediment components e g organic matter and clay minerals on concentration data nutrient burial rates and stoichiometric ratios have advantages over bulk concentrations as useful proxies for past nutrient dynamics engstrom and rose 2013 wu et al 2008 based on the chronologies of each core the mass accumulation rate mar g m 2 yr 1 at depth x can be calculated as 1 mar x m x t where m x is the sediment mass per unit area g m 2 at depth x and t is the interval time yr between the upper layer x 1 and the bottom layer x 1 burial rate br is a proxy for the historical variation of nutrients in water column dumped into sediment and br g m 2 yr 1 of n p and bsi at depth x can be obtained as 2 br mar x c x 1000 where c x is the concentration mg g 1 of n p and bsi at depth x nutrient stoichiometric ratios are independent of sedimentation rates and chronologies and hence they can be used to infer catchment and within lake processes such as nutrient source and primary production knoll et al 2014 schelske et al 1986 molar ratios of n p n bsi p bsi and zn al were calculated for each sediment core al is a typical inert element mainly derived from bedrock and soil erosion while zn is a heavy metal sourced from both catchment erosion and industrial sewage liu et al 2012 xian et al 2022 therefore ratio of zn al can be a reliable proxy indicating industrial pollution trends in burial rates and ratios at 10 year intervals from 1850 to 2016 ce n 17 were fitted using a locally weighted polynomial regression model lowess with a span of 0 4 to the data heathcote and downing 2012 the lowess smoothing was performed using the stats package in r studio r core team 2021 in order to explore underlying driving forces of nutrient dynamics historical documents of the study region were gathered including climate data at wuhan station fertilizer usage in the yangtze river basin ran et al 2022 arable land area in hubei province cao et al 2014 ge et al 2003 he et al 2023 zhou 2001 and sedimentary pollen records in liangzi lake ge et al 2021 and taibai lake xiao et al 2013 percentage of pinus pollen can be a proxy for the development of secondary forest in relation to deforestation such as the slash and burn activities xiao et al 2013 both liangzi and taibai lakes are located in hubei province and hence the combination of arable land area and pollen records can be indicative of historical land cover changes in the middle yangtze river reaches 3 results 3 1 elemental concentrations and burial rates sediments of the eight lakes are mainly composed of fine silts 4 16 μm and clays 4 μm with their average percentages ranging from 60 to 97 in the eight sediment cores fig 2 the dominance of fine sediments indicated the deposition of suspended particles in relatively steady hydrological conditions with slow current velocity moreira turcq et al 2004 limnetic deposits in this broad and low elevation plain different from alluvial deposits can preserved the history of past environmental changes boyle et al 1999 however potential effects of physical and biotic perturbations on sedimentary records cannot be ruled out in these shallow lakes chen et al 2019 chronologies of the eight sediment cores were calculated using the constant rate of supply model appleby 2001 and validated using the scp time marker i e the start of the rapid increase in 1970 ce or the 1963 ce fallout peak of 137cs for each core fig 2 mean sedimentation rates ranged from 1667 g m 2 yr 1 in wh to 8852 g m 2 yr 1 in edt table 1 detailed results of chronologies are presented in chen et al 2019 before the 1950s concentrations of n p al and zn in the eight lakes were relatively stable and less than 2 mg g 1 for n 0 75 mg g 1 for p 120 mg g 1 for

especially in hh lake spatially n enrichment was more obvious in sh ft and hh than other lakes while p enrichment was more obvious in sh and wh bsi concentration generally fluctuated between 10 and 24 mg g 1 in the eight lakes without directional trends except recent decreases in lh and hh burial rates of n p and bsi in most lakes increased to peak values around 1960 ce and then declined sharply fig 4 from the 1980s burial rates of p and bsi in most lakes increased to the maxima at around 2000 ce and then decreased slightly differently n burial rates continued to increase in most lakes after the 1980s fig 4 3 2 nutrient stoichiometry stoichiometric ratios of n p n bsi p bsi zn al remained relatively low before the 1960s and then registered rapid increases in most lakes fig 5 the n p ratio increased dramatically in hh ft lh sh and yx lakes after the 1960s but remained relatively stable in edt wh and py lakes fig 5 after the 1960s the n bsi ratio increased slightly in the two hydrologically open lakes i e edt and py while the ratio increased more than twice the level of the pre 1960 period in the other six lakes fig 5b concurrently the p bsi ratio increased substantially in most lakes such as lh wh and sh except a recent decrease in hh lake fig 5c the zn al ratio registered a rising trend in all lakes particularly in sh lake fig 5d 3 3 comparison with historical records based on the lowess regression mean burial rates of n p and bsi in the eight lakes increased gradually to peak values in the 1950s and then decreased slightly in the 1970s fig 6 a thereafter mean burial rate of n increased gradually while mean burial rates of p and bsi increased to the maxima in the 1990s and then decreased meanwhile mean ratios of n p n bsi and p bsi remained relatively stable before the 1960s and increased gradually thereafter fig 6b monitoring data showed that the dsi flux of the yangtze river increased to a peak in the mid 1960s and then registered a declining trend before a recent rebound from 2010 ce ran et al 2022 fig 6c the middle yangtze river reaches have experienced two major periods of warming i e 1910 1940 and post 1980 ce while annual precipitation fluctuated between 1000 and 1600 mm without a monotonic upward or downward trend during the last century fig 6d the usage of n and p fertilizer increased substantially to the maxima in 2000 ce and then followed by slight decreases ran et al 2022 fig 6e similarly mean ratio of zn al a proxy of industrial pollution increased rapidly from 1960 ce with a slight decrease after 2000 ce fig 6e arable land area in hubei province central china increased from 40 000 km2 in 1850 ce to 52 000 km2 in 1930 ce fig 6f and remained relatively high between 1930 and 1960 ce cao et al 2014 ge et al 2003 zhou 2001 thereafter arable land area decreased to a trough in 1980 ce and then rebounded slightly interestingly increasing percentage of pinus pollen in taibai lake xiao et al 2013 and liangzi lake ge et al 2021 were consistent with arable land expansion fig 6f 4 discussion 4 1 nutrient dynamics linked to land use change n burial in lake sediments mainly originates from biological nitrogen fixation e g n fixing bacteria and sewage discharge with minor contribution from lightning and rock weathering fowler et al 2013 different from n sedimentary p mainly originates from terrestrial detritus agricultural and industrial sewage with minor contribution from atmospheric deposition bhattacharya et al 2022 nie et al 2022 bsi in lake sediments mainly originates from diatoms and phytoliths from aquatic macrophytes schelske et al 1983 schoelynck et al 2010 as well as catchment soil and vegetation ran et al 2016 it is important to note that n p and bsi might be recycled at the sediment water interface and transformation in surface sediments such as nitrogen release from the sediments through pore water denitrification or ammonification processes villa et al 2023 wang et al 2021 p in active forms e g fe al bound p release from surface sediments under anoxic waters nie et al 2022 villa et al 2023 and bsi recycling in si depleted waters conley and schelske 2001 despite post depositional recycling processes in lake sediments sedimentary fluxes of n p and bsi are generally proportional to nutrient loading into the lakes conley and schelske 2001 liu et al 2012 ruiz fernández et al 2002 wu et al 2008 between the 1850s and the 1920s burial rates of n p and bsi were relatively low but registered slight increases in most lakes except lh and ft lakes fig 4 suggesting that terrigenous nutrient load and in lake primary production increased slightly this is consistent with slight increases in arable land area and pinus pollen during this period xiao et al 2013 ge et al 2021 fig 6f meanwhile stoichiometric ratios of n p n bsi and p bsi remained at relatively low values before the 1920s fig 5 indicating that nutrients were mainly supplied by clastic sources under natural conditions with low human disturbance between the 1920s and the 1960s rapid increases in the burial rates of n p and bsi mainly responded to enhanced soil erosion due to large scale land reclamation except for a transient decrease in the 1940s rising percentage of pinus pollen suggested widespread deforestation and arable land expansion in the catchment ge et al 2021 xiao et al 2013 probably accelerating soil erosion and increasing the load of terrestrial detritus into the lakes especially during the great leap forward from 1958 to 1961 ce chen et al 2019 wu et al 2008 stoichiometric ratios of n p and bsi remained relatively stable in most lakes except sh lake before the 1960s fig 5 suggesting that terrestrial detritus was still the major source for lake sediments notably burial rates of n p and bsi increased substantially after the 1980s concurrent with rapid increases in the ratios of n p n bsi and p bsi fig 6 suggestive of excess inputs of n and p from other sources besides terrestrial detritus one potential explanation is that the widespread application of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers from the 1980s fig 6e has dramatically increased n and p load into the lakes foucher et al 2020 li et al 2007 maranger et al 2018 wu et al 2023 it is estimated that agricultural sources to the yangtze river increased 31 fold from 221 to 6791 gg n yr 1 and 10 fold from 58 to 587 gg p yr 1 between 1970 and 2010 ce liu et al 2018 in addition rising zn al ratios indicated rapid industrialization from the late 1970s fig 6e suggesting that industrial sewage would increase nutrient supply n and p enrichment could promote production of diatoms that can absorb significant amounts of dsi during their growth to build durable and silicified frustules ran et al 2022 schelske et al 1983 turner et al 2003 subsequently increasing bsi burial in these lakes as the dominant primary producers diatoms have an intracellular dsi din of 1 1 and a regeneration dsi din of 1 1 turner et al 1998 excess anthropogenic inputs of n and p caused the depletion of dsi relative to n and p subsequently causing a shift in algal communities from diatoms to non siliceous algae such as chlorophytes and cyanobacteria in these lakes during recent decades niglas 2019 wang and dou 1998 zeng et al 2023 table 1 sedimentary diatom records revealed that the dominance of aulacoseira species with a high si p preference shifted towards the dominance of small cyclotella species with a low si p preference since the 1990s providing further evidence for the si depletion in these lakes chen et al 2022a the observation data in the yangtze river estuary also revealed that n and p enrichment relative to si promoted the proliferation of non siliceous algae such as cyanobacteria li et al 2007 jiang et al 2014 similarly sedimentary bsi and diatom records in ontario erie and michigan lakes revealed that rising p loads promoted diatom production at the earlier stages while diatom production decreased with further p enrichment when si inputs and recycling were less than the si demand by diatoms schelske et al 1983 4 2 potential effects of hydrological regulation unexpectedly the rising trends of n p and bsi burial rates were punctuated in the 1970s fig 4 one potential explanation is that the massive dam building activity during the cultural revolution period 1966 1975 ce had reduced riverine load as suggested by a synchronous decrease in suspended sediment load of the yangtze river wu et al 2020 local dams on the inlets of these floodplain lakes would reduce the influx of riverine suspended sediment chen et al 2022b zeng et al 2018 provided that terrestrial detritus is an important source of lake sediments terrigenous supply of n p and bsi would continue to decrease due to nutrient retention by a growing number of new dams however nutrient retention efficiency is different among n p and si in general p and si are more easily trapped by dams and have higher retention rates than n which has a several orders of magnitude greater solubility relative to p and si maranger et al 2018 scibona et al 2022 wu et al 2023 this means that n is more easily transported into the dammed lakes during the post damming period partly accounting for the increases in n p and n bsi ratios the two largest lakes i e edt and py had higher burial rates but lower ratios of n p and n bsi relative to other lakes figs 4 and 5 presently both edt and py lakes have free hydrological connectivity with the yangtze river with a mean water residence time of less than 30 days niglas 2019 therefore high riverine load can increase the supply of suspended particles that are rich in p and si nie et al 2022 ran et al 2022 meanwhile fast hydraulic flushing rates would accelerate n loss through the outlets in the two hydrologically open lakes due to greater solubility of n relative to p and si maranger et al 2018 scibona et al 2022 in contrast low riverine load reduced p and si supply in other dammed lakes where prolonged water residence time would promote n accumulation likely causing further increases in ratios of n p and n bsi during the post damming period 4 3 linkage to climate variability and site specific factors the rate of bedrock weathering is closely linked to temperature as suggested by the positive correlations between air temperature and concentrations of major cations e g k ca2 and mg2 in water column of the yangtze river ran et al 2022 rapid warming in the first half of the 20th century fig 6d could enhance physical and chemical weathering processes in the catchment ran et al 2022 and hence increase the supply of terrigenous nutrients into these lakes as suggested by gradual increases in burial rates of n p and bsi during this period fig 6a on the contrary a cooling climate in the 1970s would weaken weathering rates and hence reduce terrigenous nutrient loads to these lakes partly accounting for the trough in nutrient burial rates during this period fig 6a and 6d however the decreases in p and bsi burial rates were inconsistent with rising temperature after 2000 ce suggesting that effects of climate warming on nutrient burial rates become minor previous studies revealed that nutrient dynamics in riverine continuum are closely linked to precipitation derived runoff liu et al 2020 ran et al 2016 shen and liu 2009 in this study past nutrient dynamics did not follow the pattern of precipitation variability fig 6 one potential explanation is that effects of precipitation change on nutrient burial rates and ratios might be masked by intense human disturbances in this densely populated region liu et al 2012 xiao et al 2013 zeng et al 2023 besides the long term general trends in fluxes and ratios of nutrients large heterogeneities existed among the eight lakes figs 4 and 5 probably resulting from site specific factors chen et al 2022b heathcote and downing 2012 villa et al 2023 zeng et al 2023 the two largest lakes i e edt and py had higher burial rates of n p and bsi than other lakes fig 4 probably due to higher allochthonous load from their larger catchments in this study mean sedimentation rate was significantly correlated with lake area r 0 81 p 0 019 table 1 suggesting that the lakes with a larger catchment area receive larger quantities of terrigenous sediments and nutrients knoll et al 2014 in sh lake located at the centre of wuhan city fig 1 n release from domestic sewage due to the urbanization probably contributed to the earlier increases in ratios of n p and n bsi after the 1940s cao et al 2020 in addition zn al ratios were much higher in sh lake than other lakes after the 1960s probably resulting from sewage discharge linked to rapid industrialization and urbanization in wuhan city fig 5d in the macrophyte dominated lakes i e hh and ft damming and nutrient inputs have caused the shifts in macrophyte communities from low growing submerged plants to tall growing macrophytes such as potamogeton maackianus and ceratophyllum demersum song et al 2016 zeng et al 2018 since n is preferentially absorbed by shoots and leaves of these macrophytes su et al 2017 the upper strata rich in plant macrofossils have higher ratios of n p and n bsi in hh and ft lakes fig 5 5 conclusions sedimentary records from eight lakes in the middle yangtze river floodplain revealed that mean burial rates of nutrients increased from 1 5 g n m 2 yr 1 to 9 9 g n m 2 yr 1 from 0 62 g p m 2 yr 1 to 3 36 g p m 2 yr 1 and from 21 4 g bsi m 2 yr 1 to 68 4 g bsi m 2 yr 1 for the period from 1850 to 2010 ce present mean ratios of n p n bsi and p bsi are 0 6 to 2 0 times higher than the levels of the pre 1960 period temporal changes in nutrient burial rates and ratios mainly responded to land use practices and hydrological regulation the depletion of bsi relative to n and p witnessed in the yangtze river floodplain is probably occurring in similar riverine floodplains worldwide with the ever increasing construction of new dams and land use change the resultant effects of nutrient imbalance on biogeochemical cycles and aquatic food web structure are poorly known but potentially devastating in floodplain lakes and hence have to be further explored in order to improve stoichiometric balance of nutrients in these ecologically important lakes anthropogenic n and p inputs should be controlled through improving fertilizer usage efficiency and sewage treatment meanwhile restoration of river lake connectivity will be an effective means to increase riverine supply of si and to reduce n and p accumulation through accelerating hydraulic flushing rates taken together sedimentary records in floodplain lakes make an important contribution to the understanding of past biogeochemical processes in response to land use change and hydrological alterations given spatial heterogeneity in large shallow lakes further multiple core records are

1759,human activities are altering global biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen n phosphorus p and biogenic silica bsi in order to reveal nutrient dynamics in response to human disturbances this study explores burial rates and ratios of n p and bsi in 210pb dated sediment cores from eight lakes in the middle yangtze river floodplain mean burial rates of n p and bsi increased substantially from the early 20th century except for a hiatus in the 1970s before the 1960s the stable ratios of n p n bsi and p bsi indicated the nutrient supply from clastic sources while arable land expansion enhanced nutrient burial in lakes although damming increased the retention of n p and bsi in upstream reservoirs after the 1960s anthropogenic n and p release to the lakes outpaced the retention by dams as suggested by continuous increases in n and p burial rates the concurrent increase in bsi burial rate suggested that nutrient enrichment promoted diatom production at the earlier stage while rising n bsi and p bsi ratios and declining bsi burial rate from the 1990s indicated the si depletion with further eutrophication spatial heterogeneities among the lakes were linked to site specific factors such as hydrological connectivity and macrophyte growth synchronous increases in n p and bsi burial rates before the 1960s mainly responded to deforestation and arable land expansion thereafter the decoupling of n p and bsi likely resulted from intensive farming e g fertilizer usage and damming given new dam construction and land use change in river basins the bsi depletion relative to n and p is likely occurring in riverine floodplains worldwide keywords nutrient stoichiometry lacustrine sediment burial rate eutrophication dam construction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rivers provide the primary link between land and sea annually discharging about 36 thousand km3 of freshwater and more than 20 billion tonnes of solid and dissolved material to the ocean milliman and farnsworth 2011 riverine transported material contains nutrients that are essential for sustaining aquatic primary productivity jiang et al 2014 ran et al 2022 among the key constituents of aquatic ecosystems nitrogen n phosphorus p and dissolved silica dsi are essential nutrients for primary productivity wetzel 2001 in natural waters the ratio of essential elements is a nearly constant value which is known as the redfield ratio that phytoplankton tends to require for sustained growth e g 1 1 dsi dissolved inorganic nitrogen din for diatoms brzezinski 1985 the riverine load of n p and dsi carried from rivers to the ocean are 21 3 7 and 194 tg yr 1 respectively turner et al 2003 however land use changes and dam building have altered the fluxes and ratios of n p and dsi along the river continuum during recent decades causing far reaching effects on the structure and function of riverine and coastal ecosystems worldwide chen et al 2022a jiang et al 2014 maavara et al 2020 penuelas et al 2020 ran et al 2022 tong et al 2022 zeng et al 2023 since the early 20th century widespread deforestation and land reclamation due to food demand of an increasing population have enhanced soil erosion and terrigenous nutrient load especially in developing regions gonzalez rodriguez et al 2023 rose et al 2011 in southern rivers south of 20 n with few dams suspended sediment flux increased by 41 due to widespread deforestation from 1984 to 2020 ce while sediment trapping by reservoirs in northern rivers with many dams has contributed to global sediment flux declines to 49 of pre dam conditions dethier et al 2022 taken the yangtze river as an example sediment discharge has decreased from 470 mt yr 1 in 1950 1985 ce to 126 mt yr 1 in 2006 2020 ce zhang et al 2022 meanwhile ongoing dam construction has caused greater removal of silicon si and p over n in riverine discharge to coastal waters maavara et al 2020 since si and p are mainly transported in particulate form which tends to settle scibona et al 2022 based on the global news model it is estimated that annual mass of n p and reactive si trapped in global reservoirs reached 110 42 and 372 gmol respectively akbarzadeh et al 2019 maavara et al 2014 maavara et al 2015 in a world of accelerating dam construction the amount of n p and si trapped in reservoirs will continue to increase especially in rapidly developing countries such as china maavara et al 2020 despite increased nutrient retention by dams n and p can be overcompensated by anthropogenic nutrient inputs such as fertilizer usage and sewage discharge while dsi in surface waters mainly originates from the weathering of sedimentary and crystalline rocks turner et al 2003 therefore the combined effects of anthropogenic nutrient inputs and ongoing dam construction probably caused si depletion relative to n and p maavara et al 2020 which may facilitate the blooms of non siliceous algae and compromise the diatom zooplankton fish food chain humborg et al 1997 jiang et al 2014 li et al 2007 ran et al 2022 turner et al 2003 in order to minimize negative effects of nutrient imbalance on biodiversity ecosystem services and economies it is essential to explore spatiotemporal changes in nutrient fluxes and ratios for sustainable management of aquatic ecosystems recent studies have explored nutrient dynamics in response to human disturbances at global maavara et al 2020 turner et al 2003 and local scibona et al 2022 scales however an accurate estimation of global nutrient transport is limited by the lack of long term greater than100 years observation data at the regional scale akbarzadeh et al 2019 liu et al 2020 maavara et al 2014 maavara et al 2015 further exploration of past nutrient dynamics at the regional scale can not only provide basic data for global estimates but also improve the effectiveness of nutrient management practices in the middle and lower reaches of large rivers depressions in alluvial plains receive lateral overflow water and then form lakes tockner and stanford 2002 in monsoon climate regions water and sediments flow into floodplain lakes during the rainy season when the water level in the mainstream is higher than that of the lakes and flow out during the dry season guo et al 2012 zeng et al 2018 the seasonal variations of flood and drought and the hydrological connectivity between lakes and rivers are the major factors driving the lateral and longitudinal exchange of nutrients tockner and stanford 2002 wang et al 2016 nutrients that accumulate in sediments over time contribute to a legacy effect whereby sediments in floodplain lakes can retain and act as a buffer against riverine nutrient budgets bhattacharya et al 2022 maranger et al 2018 therefore the global land ocean nutrient fluxes must consider the aggregation and buffering effects that operate in riverine floodplains due to the scarcity of long term observation data decadal scale nutrient dynamics in response to watershed disturbances have been less explored in riverine floodplains that are critical zones of nutrient processing along the land sea continuum the middle yangtze river reaches embrace hundreds of shallow freshwater lakes which mostly formed during the holocene due to damming of tributaries by the natural levees of the yangtze river boyle et al 1999 du et al 2011 these lakes not only are the major water source for agricultural and industrial production but also are efficient reservoirs for flood mitigation during the rainy season yin and li 2001 since the mid 20th century these lakes have experienced severe environmental degradation due to human activities niglas 2019 for example the massive construction of new dams has limited free hydrological connectivity between the lakes and the yangtze river wang et al 2016 and hence riverine loads of n p and si from the yangtze river would be blocked from entering the lakes during high flow periods chen et al 2022b zeng et al 2018 meanwhile anthropogenic emissions of n and p to these lakes have increased profoundly due to fertilizer usage and sewage discharge since the 1970s liu et al 2018 ran et al 2022 given that there is a lack of anthropogenic compensation for si it is reasonable to assume that the stoichiometric ratios of n si and p si in the yangtze floodplain lakes would increase in this study n p and biogenic silica bsi were analysed in 210pb dated sediment cores collected from eight lakes in the middle yangtze river reaches sedimentary n and p can reflect nutrient loads from the catchment into lakes cao et al 2020 foucher et al 2020 ruiz fernández et al 2002 villa et al 2023 wu et al 2008 bsi an important proxy reflecting aquatic primary productivity mainly originates from diatoms and phytoliths conley and schelske 2001 ran et al 2016 schelske et al 1983 the aims of this study were 1 to calculate the burial rates and ratios of n p and bsi in sediment cores collected from eight lakes in the middle yangtze river floodplain 2 to explore underlying driving forces for spatiotemporal patterns of nutrient dynamics in these floodplain lakes during the last two centuries 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the middle yangtze river reaches are featured by the plain of hubei and hunan in the centre and mountains around the plain fig 1 and have an area of 6 8 105 km2 accounting for 37 of total area in the yangtze river basin du 2016 the climate in this region is characterised by the east asian summer monsoon with mean annual precipitation of 1200 mm and mean annual temperature ranging from 16 to 18 c moist climate and low lying alluvial plain in this region create the largest group of freshwater lakes in china wang and dou 1998 due to fertile soils favourable climate and immigrants from north china this region has been a major grain producing area since the ming dynasty du 2016 since these lakes have important economic and ecological functions such as water supply flood mitigation fisheries and biodiversity conservation this region has been designated as one of the global 200 conservation priority ecoregions du 2016 in particular the three gorges dam tgd and the danjiangkou reservoir i e water source area of the middle route of the south to north water transfer project are constructed in the middle yangtze river reaches and hence water environment protection has profound implications for drinking water safety at regional to national scales du 2016 with rapid population growth and economic development anthropogenic disturbances have caused environmental degradation of these lakes during recent decades niglas 2019 su et al 2023 for example lake area in this region has shrunk more than 5000 km2 since the 1950s du et al 2011 due to excess nutrient release from sewage discharge and fertilizer usage most lakes are suffering from eutrophication with frequent cyanobacteria blooms niglas 2019 wang et al 2016 zeng et al 2023 2 2 sampling and laboratory analysis sediment cores were collected using a gravity corer from the central part of eight lakes including east dongting edt honghu hh futou ft luhu lh shahu sh yanxi yx wanghu wh and poyang py lakes fig 1 and table 1 previous studies suggested that the single sediment core collected from the central part of floodplain lakes could provide a representative record of their history sun et al 2020 zeng et al 2022 each sediment core was sectioned at 1 cm intervals in the field and then samples were transported to the laboratory for further analysis for chronological and geochemical analyses samples were processed at every second 1 cm interval using standard procedures to establish the chronologies of the eight sediment cores measurements of 210pb and 137cs were combined with counts of spheroidal carbonaceous particles scps chen et al 2019 wet sediment samples were treated with 30 h2o2 and 10 hcl to remove organic matter and carbonate and then sedimentary particle size spectra were measured at 1 cm intervals using a malvern automated laser optical particle size analyser mastersizer 2000 the analytical range of the analyser was between 0 02 and 2000 μm with an analytical error of less than 3 fractions of clay and fine silts are shown to indicate sedimentary environment in the lakes nitrogen was measured by combustion using a chn elemental analyser vario el cube elementar with reference to acetanilide and low organic content soil oas catno b2152 replicate analyses gave a 1σ precision of 1 5 for tn concentrations of al zn and p were analysed by an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes profile dv after digestion in a mixture of hf hcl hno3 and hclo4 precision and accuracy of the icp aes measurement was checked by repeated measurements of the certified reference material gsd 11 the precision was generally better than 5 bsi content in the sediment was estimated using a rapid wet alkaline extraction procedure huang et al 2020 mortlock and froelich 1989 samples were treated using 10 h2o2 and 1 n hcl in order to remove all organic and carbonate components treated with 40 ml of 2 m na2co3 and then placed in a constant temperature water bath at 85 c for 5 h bsi in the clear supernatant was measured using the molybdate blue spectrophotometric method at 810 nm fanning and pilson 1973 the standard si solutions gbw08642 gbw08649 of five different concentrations 0 12 5 25 50 and 100 μmol l 1 were used for calibration the precision for duplicate sample measurements was better than 5 2 3 statistical analyses given potential effects of other sediment components e g organic matter and clay minerals on concentration data nutrient burial rates and stoichiometric ratios have advantages over bulk concentrations as useful proxies for past nutrient dynamics engstrom and rose 2013 wu et al 2008 based on the chronologies of each core the mass accumulation rate mar g m 2 yr 1 at depth x can be calculated as 1 mar x m x t where m x is the sediment mass per unit area g m 2 at depth x and t is the interval time yr between the upper layer x 1 and the bottom layer x 1 burial rate br is a proxy for the historical variation of nutrients in water column dumped into sediment and br g m 2 yr 1 of n p and bsi at depth x can be obtained as 2 br mar x c x 1000 where c x is the concentration mg g 1 of n p and bsi at depth x nutrient stoichiometric ratios are independent of sedimentation rates and chronologies and hence they can be used to infer catchment and within lake processes such as nutrient source and primary production knoll et al 2014 schelske et al 1986 molar ratios of n p n bsi p bsi and zn al were calculated for each sediment core al is a typical inert element mainly derived from bedrock and soil erosion while zn is a heavy metal sourced from both catchment erosion and industrial sewage liu et al 2012 xian et al 2022 therefore ratio of zn al can be a reliable proxy indicating industrial pollution trends in burial rates and ratios at 10 year intervals from 1850 to 2016 ce n 17 were fitted using a locally weighted polynomial regression model lowess with a span of 0 4 to the data heathcote and downing 2012 the lowess smoothing was performed using the stats package in r studio r core team 2021 in order to explore underlying driving forces of nutrient dynamics historical documents of the study region were gathered including climate data at wuhan station fertilizer usage in the yangtze river basin ran et al 2022 arable land area in hubei province cao et al 2014 ge et al 2003 he et al 2023 zhou 2001 and sedimentary pollen records in liangzi lake ge et al 2021 and taibai lake xiao et al 2013 percentage of pinus pollen can be a proxy for the development of secondary forest in relation to deforestation such as the slash and burn activities xiao et al 2013 both liangzi and taibai lakes are located in hubei province and hence the combination of arable land area and pollen records can be indicative of historical land cover changes in the middle yangtze river reaches 3 results 3 1 elemental concentrations and burial rates sediments of the eight lakes are mainly composed of fine silts 4 16 μm and clays 4 μm with their average percentages ranging from 60 to 97 in the eight sediment cores fig 2 the dominance of fine sediments indicated the deposition of suspended particles in relatively steady hydrological conditions with slow current velocity moreira turcq et al 2004 limnetic deposits in this broad and low elevation plain different from alluvial deposits can preserved the history of past environmental changes boyle et al 1999 however potential effects of physical and biotic perturbations on sedimentary records cannot be ruled out in these shallow lakes chen et al 2019 chronologies of the eight sediment cores were calculated using the constant rate of supply model appleby 2001 and validated using the scp time marker i e the start of the rapid increase in 1970 ce or the 1963 ce fallout peak of 137cs for each core fig 2 mean sedimentation rates ranged from 1667 g m 2 yr 1 in wh to 8852 g m 2 yr 1 in edt table 1 detailed results of chronologies are presented in chen et al 2019 before the 1950s concentrations of n p al and zn in the eight lakes were relatively stable and less than 2 mg g 1 for n 0 75 mg g 1 for p 120 mg g 1 for al and 0 15 mg g 1 for zn fig 3 thereafter concentrations of n p and zn increased substantially except recent decreases in p and zn in hh lake al concentration decreased in all lakes after 1960 ce especially in hh lake spatially n enrichment was more obvious in sh ft and hh than other lakes while p enrichment was more obvious in sh and wh bsi concentration generally fluctuated between 10 and 24 mg g 1 in the eight lakes without directional trends except recent decreases in lh and hh burial rates of n p and bsi in most lakes increased to peak values around 1960 ce and then declined sharply fig 4 from the 1980s burial rates of p and bsi in most lakes increased to the maxima at around 2000 ce and then decreased slightly differently n burial rates continued to increase in most lakes after the 1980s fig 4 3 2 nutrient stoichiometry stoichiometric ratios of n p n bsi p bsi zn al remained relatively low before the 1960s and then registered rapid increases in most lakes fig 5 the n p ratio increased dramatically in hh ft lh sh and yx lakes after the 1960s but remained relatively stable in edt wh and py lakes fig 5 after the 1960s the n bsi ratio increased slightly in the two hydrologically open lakes i e edt and py while the ratio increased more than twice the level of the pre 1960 period in the other six lakes fig 5b concurrently the p bsi ratio increased substantially in most lakes such as lh wh and sh except a recent decrease in hh lake fig 5c the zn al ratio registered a rising trend in all lakes particularly in sh lake fig 5d 3 3 comparison with historical records based on the lowess regression mean burial rates of n p and bsi in the eight lakes increased gradually to peak values in the 1950s and then decreased slightly in the 1970s fig 6 a thereafter mean burial rate of n increased gradually while mean burial rates of p and bsi increased to the maxima in the 1990s and then decreased meanwhile mean ratios of n p n bsi and p bsi remained relatively stable before the 1960s and increased gradually thereafter fig 6b monitoring data showed that the dsi flux of the yangtze river increased to a peak in the mid 1960s and then registered a declining trend before a recent rebound from 2010 ce ran et al 2022 fig 6c the middle yangtze river reaches have experienced two major periods of warming i e 1910 1940 and post 1980 ce while annual precipitation fluctuated between 1000 and 1600 mm without a monotonic upward or downward trend during the last century fig 6d the usage of n and p fertilizer increased substantially to the maxima in 2000 ce and then followed by slight decreases ran et al 2022 fig 6e similarly mean ratio of zn al a proxy of industrial pollution increased rapidly from 1960 ce with a slight decrease after 2000 ce fig 6e arable land area in hubei province central china increased from 40 000 km2 in 1850 ce to 52 000 km2 in 1930 ce fig 6f and remained relatively high between 1930 and 1960 ce cao et al 2014 ge et al 2003 zhou 2001 thereafter arable land area decreased to a trough in 1980 ce and then rebounded slightly interestingly increasing percentage of pinus pollen in taibai lake xiao et al 2013 and liangzi lake ge et al 2021 were consistent with arable land expansion fig 6f 4 discussion 4 1 nutrient dynamics linked to land use change n burial in lake sediments mainly originates from biological nitrogen fixation e g n fixing bacteria and sewage discharge with minor contribution from lightning and rock weathering fowler et al 2013 different from n sedimentary p mainly originates from terrestrial detritus agricultural and industrial sewage with minor contribution from atmospheric deposition bhattacharya et al 2022 nie et al 2022 bsi in lake sediments mainly originates from diatoms and phytoliths from aquatic macrophytes schelske et al 1983 schoelynck et al 2010 as well as catchment soil and vegetation ran et al 2016 it is important to note that n p and bsi might be recycled at the sediment water interface and transformation in surface sediments such as nitrogen release from the sediments through pore water denitrification or ammonification processes villa et al 2023 wang et al 2021 p in active forms e g fe al bound p release from surface sediments under anoxic waters nie et al 2022 villa et al 2023 and bsi recycling in si depleted waters conley and schelske 2001 despite post depositional recycling processes in lake sediments sedimentary fluxes of n p and bsi are generally proportional to nutrient loading into the lakes conley and schelske 2001 liu et al 2012 ruiz fernández et al 2002 wu et al 2008 between the 1850s and the 1920s burial rates of n p and bsi were relatively low but registered slight increases in most lakes except lh and ft lakes fig 4 suggesting that terrigenous nutrient load and in lake primary production increased slightly this is consistent with slight increases in arable land area and pinus pollen during this period xiao et al 2013 ge et al 2021 fig 6f meanwhile stoichiometric ratios of n p n bsi and p bsi remained at relatively low values before the 1920s fig 5 indicating that nutrients were mainly supplied by clastic sources under natural conditions with low human disturbance between the 1920s and the 1960s rapid increases in the burial rates of n p and bsi mainly responded to enhanced soil erosion due to large scale land reclamation except for a transient decrease in the 1940s rising percentage of pinus pollen suggested widespread deforestation and arable land expansion in the catchment ge et al 2021 xiao et al 2013 probably accelerating soil erosion and increasing the load of terrestrial detritus into the lakes especially during the great leap forward from 1958 to 1961 ce chen et al 2019 wu et al 2008 stoichiometric ratios of n p and bsi remained relatively stable in most lakes except sh lake before the 1960s fig 5 suggesting that terrestrial detritus was still the major source for lake sediments notably burial rates of n p and bsi increased substantially after the 1980s concurrent with rapid increases in the ratios of n p n bsi and p bsi fig 6 suggestive of excess inputs of n and p from other sources besides terrestrial detritus one potential explanation is that the widespread application of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers from the 1980s fig 6e has dramatically increased n and p load into the lakes foucher et al 2020 li et al 2007 maranger et al 2018 wu et al 2023 it is estimated that agricultural sources to the yangtze river increased 31 fold from 221 to 6791 gg n yr 1 and 10 fold from 58 to 587 gg p yr 1 between 1970 and 2010 ce liu et al 2018 in addition rising zn al ratios indicated rapid industrialization from the late 1970s fig 6e suggesting that industrial sewage would increase nutrient supply n and p enrichment could promote production of diatoms that can absorb significant amounts of dsi during their growth to build durable and silicified frustules ran et al 2022 schelske et al 1983 turner et al 2003 subsequently increasing bsi burial in these lakes as the dominant primary producers diatoms have an intracellular dsi din of 1 1 and a regeneration dsi din of 1 1 turner et al 1998 excess anthropogenic inputs of n and p caused the depletion of dsi relative to n and p subsequently causing a shift in algal communities from diatoms to non siliceous algae such as chlorophytes and cyanobacteria in these lakes during recent decades niglas 2019 wang and dou 1998 zeng et al 2023 table 1 sedimentary diatom records revealed that the dominance of aulacoseira species with a high si p preference shifted towards the dominance of small cyclotella species with a low si p preference since the 1990s providing further evidence for the si depletion in these lakes chen et al 2022a the observation data in the yangtze river estuary also revealed that n and p enrichment relative to si promoted the proliferation of non siliceous algae such as cyanobacteria li et al 2007 jiang et al 2014 similarly sedimentary bsi and diatom records in ontario erie and michigan lakes revealed that rising p loads promoted diatom production at the earlier stages while diatom production decreased with further p enrichment when si inputs and recycling were less than the si demand by diatoms schelske et al 1983 4 2 potential effects of hydrological regulation unexpectedly the rising trends of n p and bsi burial rates were punctuated in the 1970s fig 4 one potential explanation is that the massive dam building activity during the cultural revolution period 1966 1975 ce had reduced riverine load as suggested by a synchronous decrease in suspended sediment load of the yangtze river wu et al 2020 local dams on the inlets of these floodplain lakes would reduce the influx of riverine suspended sediment chen et al 2022b zeng et al 2018 provided that terrestrial detritus is an important source of lake sediments terrigenous supply of n p and bsi would continue to decrease due to nutrient retention by a growing number of new dams however nutrient retention efficiency is different among n p and si in general p and si are more easily trapped by dams and have higher retention rates than n which has a several orders of magnitude greater solubility relative to p and si maranger et al 2018 scibona et al 2022 wu et al 2023 this means that n is more easily transported into the dammed lakes during the post damming period partly accounting for the increases in n p and n bsi ratios the two largest lakes i e edt and py had higher burial rates but lower ratios of n p and n bsi relative to other lakes figs 4 and 5 presently both edt and py lakes have free hydrological connectivity with the yangtze river with a mean water residence time of less than 30 days niglas 2019 therefore high riverine load can increase the supply of suspended particles that are rich in p and si nie et al 2022 ran et al 2022 meanwhile fast hydraulic flushing rates would accelerate n loss through the outlets in the two hydrologically open lakes due to greater solubility of n relative to p and si maranger et al 2018 scibona et al 2022 in contrast low riverine load reduced p and si supply in other dammed lakes where prolonged water residence time would promote n accumulation likely causing further increases in ratios of n p and n bsi during the post damming period 4 3 linkage to climate variability and site specific factors the rate of bedrock weathering is closely linked to temperature as suggested by the positive correlations between air temperature and concentrations of major cations e g k ca2 and mg2 in water column of the yangtze river ran et al 2022 rapid warming in the first half of the 20th century fig 6d could enhance physical and chemical weathering processes in the catchment ran et al 2022 and hence increase the supply of terrigenous nutrients into these lakes as suggested by gradual increases in burial rates of n p and bsi during this period fig 6a on the contrary a cooling climate in the 1970s would weaken weathering rates and hence reduce terrigenous nutrient loads to these lakes partly accounting for the trough in nutrient burial rates during this period fig 6a and 6d however the decreases in p and bsi burial rates were inconsistent with rising temperature after 2000 ce suggesting that effects of climate warming on nutrient burial rates become minor previous studies revealed that nutrient dynamics in riverine continuum are closely linked to precipitation derived runoff liu et al 2020 ran et al 2016 shen and liu 2009 in this study past nutrient dynamics did not follow the pattern of precipitation variability fig 6 one potential explanation is that effects of precipitation change on nutrient burial rates and ratios might be masked by intense human disturbances in this densely populated region liu et al 2012 xiao et al 2013 zeng et al 2023 besides the long term general trends in fluxes and ratios of nutrients large heterogeneities existed among the eight lakes figs 4 and 5 probably resulting from site specific factors chen et al 2022b heathcote and downing 2012 villa et al 2023 zeng et al 2023 the two largest lakes i e edt and py had higher burial rates of n p and bsi than other lakes fig 4 probably due to higher allochthonous load from their larger catchments in this study mean sedimentation rate was significantly correlated with lake area r 0 81 p 0 019 table 1 suggesting that the lakes with a larger catchment area receive larger quantities of terrigenous sediments and nutrients knoll et al 2014 in sh lake located at the centre of wuhan city fig 1 n release from domestic sewage due to the urbanization probably contributed to the earlier increases in ratios of n p and n bsi after the 1940s cao et al 2020 in addition zn al ratios were much higher in sh lake than other lakes after the 1960s probably resulting from sewage discharge linked to rapid industrialization and urbanization in wuhan city fig 5d in the macrophyte dominated lakes i e hh and ft damming and nutrient inputs have caused the shifts in macrophyte communities from low growing submerged plants to tall growing macrophytes such as potamogeton maackianus and ceratophyllum demersum song et al 2016 zeng et al 2018 since n is preferentially absorbed by shoots and leaves of these macrophytes su et al 2017 the upper strata rich in plant macrofossils have higher ratios of n p and n bsi in hh and ft lakes fig 5 5 conclusions sedimentary records from eight lakes in the middle yangtze river floodplain revealed that mean burial rates of nutrients increased from 1 5 g n m 2 yr 1 to 9 9 g n m 2 yr 1 from 0 62 g p m 2 yr 1 to 3 36 g p m 2 yr 1 and from 21 4 g bsi m 2 yr 1 to 68 4 g bsi m 2 yr 1 for the period from 1850 to 2010 ce present mean ratios of n p n bsi and p bsi are 0 6 to 2 0 times higher than the levels of the pre 1960 period temporal changes in nutrient burial rates and ratios mainly responded to land use practices and hydrological regulation the depletion of bsi relative to n and p witnessed in the yangtze river floodplain is probably occurring in similar riverine floodplains worldwide with the ever increasing construction of new dams and land use change the resultant effects of nutrient imbalance on biogeochemical cycles and aquatic food web structure are poorly known but potentially devastating in floodplain lakes and hence have to be further explored in order to improve stoichiometric balance of nutrients in these ecologically important lakes anthropogenic n and p inputs should be controlled through improving fertilizer usage efficiency and sewage treatment meanwhile restoration of river lake connectivity will be an effective means to increase riverine supply of si and to reduce n and p accumulation through accelerating hydraulic flushing rates taken together sedimentary records in floodplain lakes make an important contribution to the understanding of past biogeochemical processes in response to land use change and hydrological alterations given spatial heterogeneity in large shallow lakes further multiple core records are
