8750,traditionally industrial processes produce wastes that even though often containing useful materials are discarded contributing to environmental pollution and depletion of natural resources an example of such wastes are brines flows of concentrated salts produced in water treatment processes which are now routinely discharged into receiving water bodies brines however can also be considered as flows of reusable materials which should be recovered and the zero brine cooperation project aims to develop processes for that purpose for a demineralized water production plant in the port of rotterdam the netherlands a closed water processing cycle was proposed to treat the large volume of spent ion exchange iex regenerant brine which apart from recovering demineralized water is also intended to produce magnesium mg2 and calcium ca2 salts with the highest purity possible from the otherwise discharged brine the process scheme includes nanofiltration nf for separating mono and multivalent ions followed by sequential chemical precipitation of mg2 and ca2 ions from the nf concentrate and production of demineralized water by evaporation of the nf permeate the concentrate of monovalent ions produced in the evaporator essentially a concentrated sodium chloride solution in its turn might be reused for iex regeneration part of the supernatant of the sequential precipitation may be fed to the evaporator as well but bleeding the other part of this supernatant is essential in order to maintain process stability avoid accumulation of minor pollutants and reduce scaling in this study various scenarios to operate the process were modeled using phreeqc and excel according to the simulation results recovery of 97 of mg2 and ca2 is possible the latter with a higher purity than the former the main factors affecting the results are the concentration of carbonate present in the spent iex regenerant as well as characteristics of the nf membrane and the dosing of sodium hydroxide in the sequential precipitation steps the results of the simulations were used for the design and operation of a pilot plant comprising all mentioned process steps keywords brines sequential crystallisation phreeqc closed cycle metal recovery 1 introduction the botlek is an industrial district of the port of rotterdam the netherlands with plants of a variety of large chemical companies as well as transshipping facilities demineralized water is an essential commodity here because it is required for many production processes reverse osmosis ro has become one of the main processes for producing demineralized water but ro alone is not enough to produce water of the required purity from the available water fresh surface water and several pre and post treatment processes are used like for instance ion exchange softening iex 1 at the demineralized water plant chosen for the demonstration project described here demineralized water is produced from surface water withdrawn from the brielse meer the netherlands this water is pretreated by means of coagulation flocculation dissolved air flotation daf and filtration before entering the actual demineralized water plant the pretreated water has the same ion strength as the surface water but may contain a low residual concentration of fe iii as fecl3 is used as coagulant the iex softening unit unit a in fig 2 in the materials and methods section removes bivalent cations like calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 amongst others substituting them for na ions the reverse osmosis ro unit unit b then separates the softened feed water into a permeate flow 14 and a concentrate stream flow 05 this concentrate that will be disposed of in most cases includes most of the ions of the feed water but at higher concentrations and with part of the cations substituted for na ions it also contains small amounts of residual dissolved organic pollutants the permeate flow 14 although essentially almost pure water still contains low concentrations of monovalent salts and is therefore still not suitable to be distributed as demineralized water 2 3 typically polishing steps are used to remove the trace of salts in this permeate to make it suitable to be used as demineralized water as indicated iex softening is used as one of the pretreatment steps before ro to remove bivalent ions and enhance the recovery of ro frequent regeneration of the iex resin is an essential procedure to maintain the required efficiency of this process in this plant regenerating the iex resin occurs daily by counter current passing of a concentrated salt solution nacl brine and the effluent from this iex regenerating contains valuable ions such as mg2 and ca2 amongst others disposing of the iex regeneration solution could be costly and harmful to the environment zero brine is a cooperation project run with support of the european union and its main aim is to stimulate the development of technologies to treat brines that otherwise would be discharged into the environment and recover valuable minerals and salts as well as water from these flows at the demineralized water plant under study aim is to treat the regeneration solution of the iex unit spent regenerant and to recover water and mg and ca salts using several technologies including nanofiltration nf sequential crystallization and evaporation as shown in fig 2 to begin the nf installation will produce a nacl rich solution with a nacl purity of around 96 as its permeate 06 by rejecting a major part of the multivalent ions present in the regenerant solution the nf concentrate will then be a concentrated solution of salts of mainly multivalent ions the operation of this nf process has been studied before 4 5 the characteristics of the permeate depend on parameters like permeate and reject flows and reject percentages of different ions which depend on the membrane used amongst others recovery of the metal ions from the nf reject flow should then be possible by precipitating their low solubility sulphates carbonates or hydroxides as represented by thin dotted solid and thick dotted lines respectively in fig 1 the least soluble compound is camg co3 2 dolomite but precipitating this compound will not lead to separation of mg and ca and should thus be avoided by keeping the bi carbonate concentration in the crystallization reactor as low as possible fortunately dolomite precipitation is a very slow process due to it being a reaction with third order kinetics and a high energy of activation and will not occur under normal conditions 6 the second least soluble compound however is brucite mg oh 2 of which the solubility thick dotted line closed markers differs greatly from that of portlandite lime ca oh 2 thinner dotted line open markers and thus permits sequential precipitation sequential crystallization of the sulphates should also be possible but these are much more soluble and sulphate would remain in the supernatant making this a less suitable option interference may result from the low solubilities of several carbonates solid lines marker depends on cation the nf concentrate will thus pass through a two stage crystallization process in the first stage magnesium and in the second stage calcium will be recovered as metal hydroxides by slowly dosing stoichiometric amounts of naoh to avoid contamination of the produced mg oh 2 and ca oh 2 the concentration of hydroxide ions but also of other anions will be shown to be of importance the joined nf permeate essentially a slightly polluted nacl brine and the membrane crystallization supernatant will then be treated with an evaporator in the evaporator the solution will be separated into a condensate essentially distilled water and a solution with a high salinity the condensate of the evaporator will be virtually free of any ions and can be used as demineralized water which is needed as well for the regeneration of the iex columns the high salinity brine will contain mostly nacl and might thus be used for regeneration of the iex columns but depending on conditions unlimited recycling of the supernatant may deem this brine too polluted with other cations this study has thus two objectives first objective is to quantify sequential precipitation of magnesium and calcium hydroxides and the expected purity of the product second objective is to analyze the consequences and im possibility of recycling of the supernatant in order to do so the chemical reactions that are expected to take place during passing of the spent regenerant through the different processes are quantified using a solubility constant based computer model phreeqc developed by the usgs 8 9 2 material and methods 2 1 data acquisition the data used as a starting point for the modeling were determined from two sampling campaigns at a large demineralized water plant in the port of rotterdam the netherlands samples were taken in december 2017 and in march 2018 after each ion exchange column to determine not only the average concentrations of the individual ions but also the effect of operating time of the ion exchange resin on the presence of secondary pollutants cations other than h na ca2 and mg2 the samples were stored at 4 c and analyzed at the delft university of technology water laboratory using icp ms plasma quant ms analytik jena germany for the cations and ic metrohm 881 ic metrohm switzerland equipped with a supp 5150 4 0 column for the anions using standard procedures bicarbonate not measured by ic was determined by titration of samples with 0 100 m hcl until a ph of 4 30 using a metrohm 702sm titrino automatic titrator temperature was determined on site and ph was measured in the samples by means of a hand held ph meter wtw multi 3410 total dissolved solids tds were determined gravimetrically 2 2 process scheme demineralized water is produced in the plant by means of a sequence of processes including daf iex and ro the latter indicated as a and b in fig 2 periodically the iex columns are regenerated using a concentrated nacl brine flow 03 and this results in a flow of spent iex regenerant flow 04 objective of the zero brine project is recovery of the salts and water from this flow for which the additional process steps c to f fig 2 are planned process unit c is a nf unit intended to reject bivalent anions and cations experiments were performed by the supplier of the nf membranes prior to modeling the process flow and given the results of these experiments rejections of 46 80 for mono and bivalent anions and of 30 60 for mono and bivalent cations were assumed at a 70 recovery the assumptions regarding the nf performance as used in the modeling are presented in table 1 as a result of this the permeate flow 06 is basically a flow of concentrated nacl whereas the multivalent ions present in the spent iex regenerant are concentrated in the reject flow flow 07 these ions include the mg2 and ca2 ions which are then to be precipitated in the crystallization units d and e respectively after crystallization of mg and ca salts in units d and e the supernatant can either be discarded or recycled to the evaporator f which produces distilled pure water and a brine containing mainly nacl 2 3 modeling the calculations concerning the chemical reactions were performed using excel for making initial estimations of flows and rejects and using phreeqc interactive 3 4 0 for detailed calculations of chemical equilibria and solubility and precipitation crystallization phreeqc is a modeling program developed by the usgs 8 10 which has several databases including solubility products of different groups of minerals which are used for determining speciation of elements involved in the system under different conditions given the species present in the brine and expected to be relevant the minteq v 4 database that can be found among the databases provided with phreeqc interactive 3 4 0 was used rather than the smaller pitzer or phreeqc generic databases because it contains most measured elements the input values used for the phreeqc simulations were not exactly the values obtained during the data acquisition phase for practical reasons the following simplifications were made 1 to simplify simulations elements with concentrations 1 μg l 1 were neglected which can be justified as salt concentrations in the samples were close to 30 g l 1 2 cobalt co and molybdenum mo were not included in phreeqc s minteq database and were therefore excluded from the simulations 3 notably for both samples the concentration of sulphur s as reported by icp ms is higher than the molar concentration of sulphate so4 2 as reported by ion chromatography the same occurs for phosphorous p and phosphate po4 3 the phreeqc simulations were conducted assuming that all sulphur is present as s vi i e as sulphate so4 2 and assuming that all phosphorus p is present as p v i e as phosphate po4 3 using the higher concentrations as obtained from icp ms 4 as for the species that were already supersaturated in the feed presented as phosphates sulphates and carbonates the arbitrary assumption was made that these compounds will already have precipitated before entering the nf module consequently concentrations of relevant elements including ca2 mg2 and ba2 and phosphate sulphate and bicarbonate were modified by setting the saturation indices si of those compounds to si 0 0 and subtracting the amount of apparently precipitated ions from the nf feed flow 04 thus the feed solution used as input for phreeqc simulations was in saturated but not in supersaturated state considering the four basic assumptions above the feed solution for the nf process was defined as presented in table 2 with an overall composition slightly different than that obtained from the actual samples for the flows 04 06 07 08 and 10 as indicated in fig 2 the ion product ip of different minerals was calculated as well as the si saturation index according to equation 1 below eq 1 si log ip pksp in this equation pksp is the log of the solubility product as provided by the phreeqc database when si 0 the solution is saturated when si 0 saturation has not yet been reached and when si 0 a supersaturated solution is observed and salt is expected to precipitate until si 0 again however minerals will not immediately precipitate from a supersaturated solution and very small colloidal particles may be present without precipitation occurring thus solutions with 0 si 0 1 are considered to be in a subsaturated state as well and not considered to produce precipitation the amount actually leaving the system after precipitating may be difficult to calculate as the possibility to separate solids and remove them from the system depends on crystal size this is especially so for salts with a very low solubility which may produce extremely small crystals colloids as nucleation speed depends stronger on the si than the speed of crystal growth favoring the formation of huge amounts of very small crystals already at a very small supersaturation in order to obtain larger and more handleable crystals seeding is often applied in which small crystals are provided to the mother liquor in the simulations variations of process operating conditions like reject and permeate flows operating ph and temperature were tested in order to optimize the process with regard to maximizing mg and ca salt production and minimizing secondary pollutant levels in the iex regenerant solution nf performance is an important parameter in the first step the spent iex regenerant will be subjected to nanofiltration which tends to reject polyvalent ions and permit passage of monovalent ions thus the reject will be enriched in ions like ca2 and mg2 whilst the permeate will be enriched in monovalent ions like na and k to simulate the reject and permeate flows of the nf unit the following two assumptions were made 1 the overall recovery of the nf process was assumed to be 70 based on results from lab scale experiments by the supplier of the nf unit and corresponding to the membrane foreseen to be used this recovery corresponds to various salinity levels of the feed as well regardless the impact of module configuration 2 it was assumed that the nf membranes used are typical nf membranes meaning negatively charged in an aqueous environment therefore and confirmed by ongoing laboratory tests with membranes likely to be used in the pilot setup rejection of multivalent anions was considered to be 80 and rejection of multivalent cations slightly less decreasing with feed concentration the rejection of monovalent anions was then adjusted in order to maintain charge conservation and avoid a negatively charged permeate and a positively charged reject see table 1 almost inevitably the concentrate flow will contain combinations of ions that will exceed their solubility products in practice this may lead to scaling of the membrane if the unknown residence time in the membrane module is long enough for the phreeqc simulations this problem was dealt with by considering precipitation of the species with the highest si value given the fact that most of the potentially supersaturated species contain ca2 and mg2 this also means a potential loss of target mass and a lower recovery of the target compounds in the subsequent crystallization processes location and effects of any precipitation of salts in the nf unit were disregarded though as within the scope of this project it is not possible to foresee what exactly will happen inside the nf modules the use of antiscalants to avoid precipitation and scaling was not considered during calculations as i the effect of these compounds on solubility products cannot be modeled adequately using phreeqc and ii the actual use of such compounds in a system with a closed loop water cycle will result in an undesirable accumulation of these compounds in the cycle and should thus be avoided as much as possible after calculating the permeate and reject flows from nf the recovery of magnesium and calcium in the crystallization units as their respective hydroxides was calculated for this purpose 1 in two separate crystallization units d and e in fig 2 sodium hydroxide naoh is injected required chemical in the scheme as informed by the supplier of the crystallization units the amount of injected naoh is calculated via a stoichiometric approach that is to precipitate 1 mol of either magnesium or calcium 2 mol of naoh are injected 2 to quantify the amount of salts that can be recovered a phreeqc simulation was conducted in which the si value of brucite mg oh 2 or portlandite ca oh 2 was simply set to a value of 0 0 the calculated concentration of mg2 and ca2 for these situations can then be subtracted from the concentration entering the process unit giving the amounts expected to precipitate as for the evaporator unit simulation two scenarios were considered first only the nf permeate flow 06 as the input to the evaporator unit and second a mix of nf permeate flow 06 and crystallizer supernatant flow 10 as the input for both scenarios the overall recovery of distilled water from the evaporator unit was assumed to be 42 i e 58 water remaining as nacl brine flow 13 which should then be suitable for reuse as iex regenerant based on this ion concentrations were recalculated and put into phreeqc to estimate if there is a potential scaling problem a preliminary estimation of these two types of feed was conducted to check if some species were supersaturated and if so si values of supersaturated species were set to 0 0 to ensure no specie exceeded its solubility in the evaporator input a schematic representation of the modeling approach is presented in fig 3 below 3 results and discussion 3 1 composition of the analyzed samples two series of measurements were obtained for spent iex regenerant as shown in table 3 and fig 4 the major cations present in the samples are na ca2 and mg2 the concentration of ca2 is around 3 5 times the concentration of mg2 with the ratio between na and the bivalent cations depending on the stage of the regeneration process also lower concentrations of potassium k as well as minor concentrations 0 1 of other metals most notably strontium sr2 iron fe3 and barium ba2 were found trace amounts of elements like arsenic as5 boron b3 manganese mn4 copper cu2 zinc zn2 and cadmium cd2 are present in sample 1 but not in sample 2 whereas sample 2 contains around 100 times more iron fe3 and manganese mn2 then sample 1 chloride cl is the most abundant anion 96 next to much lower concentrations of bicarbonate hco3 sulphate so4 2 and phosphate po4 3 as elements were measured using icp ms their oxidation state in the samples is not confirmed given the origin of the raw water and the processes involved elements were assumed to be present in the oxidation state predominant in aerobic aqueous environments as indicated as discussed above samples 1 and 2 differed significantly however without additional data it is arbitrary to attribute the variations in concentrations of each element to seasonal effects as operational conditions for example the time of use of the iex resin and the amount of water used during the regeneration process may also lead to different compositions of spent regenerants the fact that for both samples the calculated tds concentration sum of weights of identified anions and cations is slightly higher than the tds concentration measured by gravimetry confirms that no or very little additional organic reagents coagulants flocculants anti scaling agents etc were present in the samples as these would increase the measured tds but not the calculated tds after obtaining these results a problem was detected as several combinations of ions most notably involving ca2 ba2 co3 2 and so4 2 result in solubility products being exceeded preliminary phreeqc simulations showed that species that may precipitate in the nf module si 0 1 are different between the samples not all predicted precipitations however are relevant in sample 2 for instance magnetite fe3o4 exhibits the highest scaling potential si 23 75 but at a concentration level of 1 μg l 1 when considering only species with precipitation potentials above 1 μg l 1 levels eight species remain of which the si values are generally below 2 00 table 4 in sample 1 in total 24 species are supersaturated amongst which five species with si values 10 in this case again fe is the most sensitive element due to its low solubility in the water matrix in practice though only eight species are capable of precipitating more than 1 μg l 1 and only three species will actually precipitate from both samples more detailed information can be found in table 4 as can be seen only very small amounts of minerals in general sulphates or carbonates are expected to precipitate 3 2 phreeqc modeling results 3 2 1 nf concentrate composition for each sample based on the assumptions made regarding recovery and anion and cation reject as well as the mass balance the concentration of each element can be calculated for each stream concentrate and permeate a summary of concentrate quality of the two samples is shown in table 5 as a result of concentrating the ions present in the feed in a smaller volume of concentrate for some species the solubility product may be exceeded resulting in a supersaturated solution subject to precipitation the value of the saturation index si eq 1 shown in table 4 indicates if this is expected to be the case however the effect is only relevant if not only the si exceeds a minimum value but also the amount of material available for precipitation is significant some ions are present in such low concentrations that the amount that might precipitate would be only in the order of micrograms per liter species that both have a saturation index si 0 1 and a concentration level of mg l 1 rather than μg l 1 are listed in table 6 in the case of sample 2 four species will become supersaturated in the nf concentrate stream with hydroxyapatite being the most saturated si 2 94 for sample 1 the number of supersaturated species is five with again hydroxyapatite being the most supersaturated compound with si 10 53 as the amount of hydroxyapatite precipitating is very small though the most serious scaling might actually occur by precipitation of aragonite in sample 1 or anhydrite in sample 2 the latter as a result of the higher sulphate concentration in that sample in this last case it can be argued that gypsum rather than anhydrite will precipitate 11 but as the solubility products of both salts are of the same order of magnitude we accepted the outcome of phreeqc calculations in which anhydrite precipitates first regardless the practical implications of precipitating either anhydrite of gypsum in terms of removal of ions from solution and amount mass of solids precipitated in the system will be roughly the same and the beforementioned paper also shows that at increased salinity gypsum precipitation is reduced in favor of anhydrite and bassanite precipitation 11 it can be seen that some 5 of calcium would precipitate as a result of the presence of sulphate in sample 2 which would cause scaling of process equipment this means the nf process may experience more severe calcium scaling when fed with sample 2 because most of the potentially supersaturated species contain ca2 and mg2 this also means a potential loss of target mass and lower recovery of the target compounds in the subsequent crystallization processes 3 2 2 salt recovery amounts and purity table 7 presents the amounts of brucite and portlandite that are supposed to be recovered and their respective purities the overall recovery of ca and mg for each liter of spent iex regenerant fed to the nf is listed in table 8 results for both samples are consistent both suggest that more than 50 of the amount of target salts can be recovered and with high quality especially for calcium with more than 97 purity for both samples some low solubility species listed in table 9 may be co precipitated when the si of such a compound has a value of si 0 this may occur especially in the first crystallizer d intended for magnesium recovery resulting in a slightly lower purity of magnesium still mg2 will be of 96 4 purity even in the worst case sample 2 with ca oh 2 and caco3 the major pollutants 1 8 each of the precipitate in moles in the second crystallizer the situation is inverted now ca oh 2 is the predominant material and mg oh 2 is the main impurity but in this case the best quality product is obtained from sample 2 99 1 purity and a lesser quality product obtained from sample 1 97 4 purity with mg oh 2 the main pollutant more detailed information can be found in table 8 the effect of running the process under conditions of different temperature and ph were not calculated as not deemed very relevant as can be seen in fig 1 solubilities of key precipitates brucite and portlandite hardly vary in the range of temperatures of 10 35 c and lower temperatures negatively affect membrane filtration where higher temperatures incur costs of heating large volumes of dilute solutions making it likely that the process will be run at available water temperature the effect of altering the ph was not studied as adding any additional amount of base will increase precipitation of species later on increasing impurities in the product whereas dosing less hydroxide or adding acid to decrease the amount of hydroxide ions will reduce the amount of minerals precipitated hydroxide dosing in the crystallization reactors will need to be done stoichiometrically considering the amounts of cations to be precipitated rather than aiming at a specific ph 3 2 3 evaporator feed and product to close the water cycle an evaporation step was foreseen which produces distilled pure water and a brine containing predominantly sodium chloride nacl this evaporation step as mentioned before can be fed in two ways besides receiving only the nf permeate a mix of nf permeate and the crystallizer effluent can also be defined as the input to the evaporator a summary of the composition of the two mixed feeds is listed in table 10 since 42 of the water will be evaporated a concentrated solution will be obtained table 11 presents an estimation of the composition of this concentrated solution for both situations feeding the evaporator only with the nf permeate or feeding the evaporator with a mix of nf permeate and crystallization supernatant for both samples sodium and chloride are the dominant cation and anion respectively ca2 is the second most abundant cation in the product with 3 sample 2 or 6 sample 1 of the total cation concentration when using only the nf permeate as feed these percentages actually become slightly higher thus alternatives for reusing this brine for iex regeneration have to be studied when it comes to the foreseeable scaling in the evaporator if nf permeate is the only influent no scaling will be detected for either sample however when using the mixed feed the situation is different some species will become supersaturated in the evaporator see table 12 and consequently scaling becomes a possibility in this respect the presence of calcium is the main risk factor regarding this possible scaling problem in the evaporator unit 4 conclusions magnesium and calcium may be separated with efficiently from spent iex regenerant however complete 99 recovery of these materials is not possible especially in the case of calcium a small part of the material can also end up as scaling before reaching the crystallization step although theoretically selective precipitation of mg oh 2 and ca oh 2 is possible producing them in pure form is almost impossible because together with these hydroxides depending on the anions present also carbonates sulphates and other minerals may co precipitate given the widely varying concentrations of anions found in the different samples the amount of impurities in the precipitates will vary but precipitates will contain mg and ca with at least 97 purity in all cases studied the amount of hydroxides recovered is directly dependent on the amount of hydroxide dosed hydroxide dosing should therefore be carefully controlled as especially in the first crystallization reactor excess naoh dosed might cause ca oh 2 to precipitate prematurely control of hydroxide dosing for mg2 and ca2 precipitation can most likely be based on supernatant ph as in the case of correct stoichiometric dosing this ph will be around 9 7 and 12 5 after mg2 and ca2 precipitation respectively for both samples practically independent of initial metal ion concentration evaporator performance depends greatly on the feed if only nf permeate is fed no scaling occurs at the evaporator unit while when feeding a mixture of nf permeate and crystallization supernatant calcium scaling may occur there in the same way when feeding only nf permeate the quality of the brine produced with respect to the abundance of sodium and chlorine ions is higher than when compared to the situation that a mixture of nf permeate and crystallizer effluent is fed to the evaporator when using this mixture as feed the brine produced by the evaporator cannot be used for regeneration of the iex columns because in this case accumulating impurities will cause a faster exhausting of the iex columns a need for more frequent regeneration of these columns more frequent replacement of the resin and consequently higher operational and environmental costs it will be essential to carefully study the crystallizer effluent and consider other options before deciding on mixing this effluent with the nf permeate as the feed for the evaporator in spite of the great detail of the modeling results the exact effect of closing the water cycle in the process cannot yet be calculated completely in the first place because a large variation between samples process cycle input was observed and in the second place because the exact process scheme and process control strategy have not yet been defined even with the limited amount of data the modeling study shows that a completely closed cycle is not a realistic goal and some type of bleed will need to be present without a bleed all ions present in the feed but not removed as product like for instance ni2 zn2 sr2 and nitrate to name a few will over time accumulate in the regeneration cycle causing deterioration of the process and product specifications in the long run bleeding however may be as simple as releasing part of the mother liquor of ca precipitation or releasing part of the nf permeate author contributions conception and design of study h spanjers a

rotterdam the netherlands a closed water processing cycle was proposed to treat the large volume of spent ion exchange iex regenerant brine which apart from recovering demineralized water is also intended to produce magnesium mg2 and calcium ca2 salts with the highest purity possible from the otherwise discharged brine the process scheme includes nanofiltration nf for separating mono and multivalent ions followed by sequential chemical precipitation of mg2 and ca2 ions from the nf concentrate and production of demineralized water by evaporation of the nf permeate the concentrate of monovalent ions produced in the evaporator essentially a concentrated sodium chloride solution in its turn might be reused for iex regeneration part of the supernatant of the sequential precipitation may be fed to the evaporator as well but bleeding the other part of this supernatant is essential in order to maintain process stability avoid accumulation of minor pollutants and reduce scaling in this study various scenarios to operate the process were modeled using phreeqc and excel according to the simulation results recovery of 97 of mg2 and ca2 is possible the latter with a higher purity than the former the main factors affecting the results are the concentration of carbonate present in the spent iex regenerant as well as characteristics of the nf membrane and the dosing of sodium hydroxide in the sequential precipitation steps the results of the simulations were used for the design and operation of a pilot plant comprising all mentioned process steps keywords brines sequential crystallisation phreeqc closed cycle metal recovery 1 introduction the botlek is an industrial district of the port of rotterdam the netherlands with plants of a variety of large chemical companies as

producing demineralized water but ro alone is not enough to produce water of the required purity from the available water fresh surface water and several pre and post treatment processes are used like

pretreated water has the same ion strength as the surface water but may contain a low residual concentration of fe iii as fecl3 is used as coagulant the iex softening unit unit a in fig 2 in the materials and methods section removes bivalent cations like calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 amongst others substituting them for na ions the reverse osmosis ro unit unit b then separates the softened feed water into a permeate flow 14 and a concentrate stream flow 05 this concentrate that will be disposed of in most cases includes most of the ions of the feed water but at higher concentrations and with part of the cations substituted for na ions it also contains small amounts of residual dissolved organic pollutants the permeate flow 14 although essentially almost pure water still contains low concentrations of monovalent salts and is therefore still not suitable to be distributed as demineralized water 2 3 typically polishing steps are used to remove the trace of salts in this permeate to make it suitable to be used as demineralized water as indicated iex softening is used as one of the pretreatment steps before ro to remove bivalent ions and enhance the recovery of ro frequent

otherwise would be discharged into the environment and recover valuable minerals and salts as well as water from these flows at the demineralized water plant under study aim is to treat the regeneration solution of the iex unit spent regenerant and to recover water and mg and ca salts using several technologies including nanofiltration nf sequential crystallization and evaporation as shown in fig 2 to begin the nf installation will produce a nacl rich solution with a nacl purity of around 96 as its permeate 06 by rejecting a major part of the multivalent ions present in the regenerant solution the nf concentrate will then be a concentrated solution of salts of mainly multivalent ions the operation of this nf process has been studied before 4 5 the characteristics of the permeate depend on parameters like permeate and reject flows and reject percentages of different ions which depend on the membrane used amongst others recovery of the metal ions from the nf reject flow should then be possible by precipitating their low solubility sulphates carbonates or hydroxides as represented by thin dotted solid and thick dotted lines respectively in fig 1 the least soluble compound is camg co3 2 dolomite but precipitating this compound will not lead to separation of mg and ca and should thus be avoided by keeping the bi carbonate concentration in the crystallization reactor as low as possible fortunately dolomite precipitation is a very slow process due to it being a reaction with third order kinetics and a high energy of activation and will not occur under normal conditions 6 the second least soluble compound however is brucite mg oh 2 of which the solubility thick dotted line closed markers differs greatly from that of portlandite lime ca oh 2 thinner dotted line open markers and thus permits sequential precipitation sequential crystallization of the sulphates should also be possible but these are much more soluble and sulphate would remain in the supernatant making this a less suitable option interference may result from the low solubilities of several carbonates solid lines marker depends on cation the nf concentrate will thus pass through a two stage crystallization process in the first stage magnesium and in the second stage calcium will be recovered as metal hydroxides by slowly dosing stoichiometric amounts of naoh to avoid contamination of the produced mg oh 2 and ca oh 2 the concentration of hydroxide ions but also of other anions will be shown to be of importance the joined nf permeate essentially a slightly polluted nacl brine and the membrane crystallization supernatant will then be treated with an evaporator in the evaporator the solution will be separated into a condensate essentially distilled water and a solution with a high salinity the condensate of the evaporator will be virtually free of any ions and can be used as demineralized water which is needed as well for the regeneration of the iex columns the high salinity brine will contain mostly nacl and might thus be used for regeneration of the iex columns but depending on conditions unlimited recycling of the supernatant may deem this brine too polluted with other cations this study has thus two objectives first objective is to quantify sequential precipitation of magnesium and calcium hydroxides and the expected purity of the product second objective is to analyze the consequences and im possibility of recycling of the supernatant in order to do so the chemical reactions that are expected to take place during passing of the spent regenerant through the different processes are quantified using a solubility constant based computer model phreeqc developed by the usgs 8 9 2 material and methods 2 1 data acquisition the data used as a starting point for the modeling were determined from two sampling campaigns at a large demineralized water plant in the port of rotterdam the netherlands samples were taken in december 2017 and in march 2018 after each ion exchange column to determine not only the average concentrations of the individual ions but also the effect of operating time of the ion exchange resin on the presence of secondary pollutants cations other than h na ca2 and mg2 the samples were stored at 4 c and analyzed at the delft university of technology water laboratory using icp ms plasma quant ms analytik jena germany for the cations and ic metrohm 881 ic metrohm switzerland equipped with a supp 5150 4 0 column for the anions using standard procedures bicarbonate not measured by ic was determined by titration of samples with 0 100 m hcl until a ph of 4 30 using a metrohm 702sm titrino automatic titrator temperature was determined on site and ph was measured in the samples by means of a hand held ph meter wtw multi 3410 total dissolved solids tds were determined gravimetrically 2 2 process scheme demineralized water is produced in the plant by means of a sequence of processes including daf iex and ro the latter indicated as a and b in fig 2 periodically the iex columns are regenerated using a concentrated nacl brine flow 03 and this results in a flow of spent iex regenerant flow 04 objective of the zero brine project is recovery of the salts and water from this flow for which the additional process steps c to f fig 2 are planned process unit c is a nf unit intended to reject bivalent anions and cations experiments were performed by the supplier of the nf membranes prior to modeling the process flow and given the results of these experiments rejections of 46 80 for mono and bivalent anions and of 30 60 for mono and bivalent cations were assumed at a 70 recovery the assumptions regarding the nf performance as used in the modeling are presented in table 1 as a result of this the permeate flow 06 is basically a flow of concentrated nacl whereas the multivalent ions present in the spent iex regenerant are concentrated in the reject flow flow 07 these ions include the mg2 and ca2 ions which are then to be precipitated in the crystallization units d and e respectively after crystallization of mg and ca salts in units d and e the supernatant can either be discarded or recycled to the evaporator f which produces distilled pure water and a brine containing mainly nacl 2 3 modeling the calculations concerning the chemical reactions were performed using excel for making initial estimations of flows and rejects and using phreeqc interactive 3 4 0 for detailed calculations of chemical equilibria and solubility and precipitation crystallization phreeqc is a modeling program developed by the usgs 8 10 which has several databases including solubility products of different groups of minerals which are used for determining speciation of elements involved in the system under different conditions given the species present in the brine and expected to be relevant the minteq v 4 database that can be found among the databases provided with phreeqc interactive 3 4 0 was used rather than the smaller pitzer or phreeqc generic databases because it contains most measured elements the input values used for the phreeqc simulations were not exactly the values obtained during the data acquisition phase for practical reasons the following simplifications were made 1 to simplify simulations elements with concentrations 1 μg l 1 were neglected which can be justified as salt concentrations in the samples were close to 30 g l 1 2 cobalt co and molybdenum mo were not included in phreeqc s minteq database and were therefore excluded from the simulations 3 notably for both samples the concentration of sulphur s as reported by icp ms is higher than the molar concentration of sulphate so4 2 as reported by ion chromatography the same occurs for phosphorous p and phosphate po4 3 the phreeqc simulations were conducted assuming that all sulphur is present as s vi i e as sulphate so4 2 and assuming that all phosphorus p is present as p v i e as phosphate po4 3 using the higher concentrations as obtained from icp ms 4 as for the species that were already supersaturated in the feed presented as phosphates sulphates and carbonates the arbitrary assumption was made that these compounds will already have precipitated before entering the nf module consequently concentrations of relevant elements including ca2 mg2 and ba2 and phosphate sulphate and bicarbonate were modified by setting the saturation indices si of those compounds to si 0 0 and subtracting the amount of apparently precipitated ions from the nf feed flow 04 thus the feed solution used as input for phreeqc simulations was in saturated but not in supersaturated state considering the four basic assumptions above the feed solution for the nf process was defined as presented in table 2 with an overall composition slightly different than that obtained from the actual samples for the flows 04 06 07 08 and 10 as indicated in fig 2 the ion product ip of different minerals was calculated as well as the si saturation index according to equation 1 below eq 1 si log ip pksp in this equation pksp is the log of the solubility product as provided by the phreeqc database when si 0 the solution is saturated when si 0 saturation has not yet been reached and when si 0 a supersaturated solution is observed and salt is expected to precipitate until si 0 again however minerals will not immediately precipitate from a supersaturated solution and very small colloidal particles may be present without precipitation occurring thus solutions with 0 si 0 1 are considered to be in a subsaturated state as well and not considered to produce precipitation the amount actually leaving the system after precipitating may be difficult to calculate as the possibility to separate solids and remove them from the system depends on crystal size this is especially so for salts with a very low solubility which may produce extremely small crystals colloids as nucleation speed depends stronger on the si than the speed of crystal growth favoring the formation of huge amounts of very small crystals already at a very small supersaturation in order to obtain larger and more handleable crystals seeding is often applied in which small crystals are provided to the mother liquor in the simulations variations of process operating conditions like reject and permeate flows operating ph and temperature were tested in order to optimize the process with regard to maximizing mg and ca salt production and minimizing secondary pollutant levels in the iex regenerant solution nf performance is an important parameter in the first step the spent iex regenerant will be subjected to nanofiltration which tends to reject polyvalent ions and permit passage of monovalent ions thus the reject will be enriched in ions like ca2 and mg2 whilst the permeate will be enriched in monovalent ions like na and k to simulate the reject and permeate flows of the nf unit the following two assumptions were made 1 the overall recovery of the nf process was assumed to be 70 based on results from lab scale experiments by the supplier of the nf unit and corresponding to the membrane foreseen to be used this recovery corresponds to various salinity levels of the feed as well regardless the impact of module configuration 2 it was assumed that the nf membranes used are typical nf membranes meaning negatively charged in an aqueous environment therefore and confirmed by ongoing laboratory tests with membranes likely to be used in the pilot setup rejection of multivalent anions was considered to be 80 and rejection of multivalent cations slightly less decreasing with feed concentration the rejection of monovalent anions was then adjusted in order to maintain charge conservation and avoid a negatively charged permeate and a positively charged reject see table 1 almost inevitably the concentrate flow will contain combinations of ions that will exceed their solubility products in practice this may lead to scaling of the membrane if the unknown residence time in the membrane module is long enough for the phreeqc simulations this problem was dealt with by considering precipitation of the species with the highest si value given the fact that most of the potentially supersaturated species contain ca2 and mg2 this also means a potential loss of target mass and a lower recovery of the target compounds in the subsequent crystallization processes location and effects of any precipitation of salts in the nf unit were disregarded though as within the scope of this project it is not possible to foresee what exactly will happen inside the nf modules the use of antiscalants to avoid precipitation and scaling was not considered during calculations as i the effect of these compounds on solubility products cannot be modeled adequately using phreeqc and ii the actual use of such compounds in a system with a closed loop water cycle will result in an undesirable accumulation of these compounds in the cycle and should thus be avoided as much as possible after calculating the permeate and reject flows from nf the recovery of magnesium and calcium in the crystallization units as their respective hydroxides was calculated for this purpose 1 in two separate crystallization units d and e in fig 2 sodium hydroxide naoh is injected required chemical in the scheme as informed by the supplier of the crystallization units the amount of injected naoh is calculated via a stoichiometric approach that is to precipitate 1 mol of either magnesium or calcium 2 mol of naoh are injected 2 to quantify the amount of salts that can be recovered a phreeqc simulation was conducted in which the si value of brucite mg oh 2 or portlandite ca oh 2 was simply set to a value of 0 0 the calculated concentration of mg2 and ca2 for these situations can then be subtracted from the concentration entering the process unit giving the amounts expected to precipitate as for the evaporator unit simulation two scenarios were considered first only the nf permeate flow 06 as the input to the evaporator unit and second a mix of nf permeate flow 06 and crystallizer supernatant flow 10 as the input for both scenarios the overall recovery of distilled water from the evaporator unit was assumed to be 42 i e 58 water remaining as nacl brine flow 13 which should then be suitable for reuse as iex regenerant based on this ion concentrations were recalculated and put into phreeqc to estimate if there is a potential scaling problem a preliminary estimation of these two types of feed was conducted to check if some species were supersaturated and if so si values of supersaturated species were set to 0 0 to ensure no specie exceeded its solubility in the evaporator input a schematic representation of the modeling approach is presented in fig 3 below 3 results and discussion 3 1 composition of the analyzed samples two series of measurements were obtained for spent iex regenerant as shown in table 3 and fig 4 the major cations present in the samples are na ca2 and mg2 the concentration of ca2 is around 3 5 times the concentration of mg2 with the ratio between na and the bivalent cations depending on the stage of the regeneration process also lower concentrations of potassium k as well as minor concentrations 0 1 of other metals most notably strontium sr2 iron fe3 and barium ba2 were found trace amounts of elements like arsenic as5 boron b3 manganese mn4 copper cu2 zinc zn2 and cadmium cd2 are present in sample 1 but not in sample 2 whereas sample 2 contains around 100 times more iron fe3 and manganese mn2 then sample 1 chloride cl is the most abundant anion 96 next to much lower concentrations of bicarbonate hco3 sulphate so4 2 and phosphate po4 3 as elements were measured using icp ms their oxidation state in the samples is not confirmed given the origin of the raw water and the processes involved elements were assumed to be present in the oxidation state predominant in aerobic aqueous environments as indicated as discussed above samples 1 and 2 differed significantly however without additional data it is arbitrary to attribute the variations in concentrations of each element to seasonal effects as operational conditions for example the time of use of the iex resin and the amount of water used during the regeneration process may also lead to different compositions of spent regenerants the fact that for both samples the calculated tds concentration sum of weights of identified anions and cations is slightly higher than the tds concentration measured by gravimetry confirms that no or very little additional organic reagents coagulants flocculants anti scaling agents etc were present in the samples as these would increase the measured tds but not the calculated tds after obtaining these results a problem was detected as several combinations of ions most notably involving ca2 ba2 co3 2 and so4 2 result in solubility products being exceeded preliminary phreeqc simulations showed that species that may precipitate in the nf module si 0 1 are different between the samples not all predicted precipitations however are relevant in sample 2 for instance magnetite fe3o4 exhibits the highest scaling potential si 23 75 but at a concentration level of 1 μg l 1 when considering only species with precipitation potentials above 1 μg l 1 levels eight species remain of which the si values are generally below 2 00 table 4 in sample 1 in total 24 species are supersaturated amongst which five species with si values 10 in this case again fe is the most sensitive element due to its low solubility in the water matrix in practice though only eight species are capable of precipitating more than 1 μg l 1 and only three species will actually precipitate from both samples more detailed information can be found in table 4 as can be seen only very small amounts of minerals in general sulphates or carbonates are expected to precipitate 3 2 phreeqc modeling results 3 2 1 nf concentrate composition for each sample based on the assumptions made regarding recovery and anion and cation reject as well as the mass balance the concentration of each element can be calculated for each stream concentrate and permeate a summary of concentrate quality of the two samples is shown in table 5 as a result of concentrating the ions present in the feed in a smaller volume of concentrate for some species the solubility product may be exceeded resulting in a supersaturated solution subject to precipitation the value of the saturation index si eq 1 shown in table 4 indicates if this is expected to be the case however the effect is only relevant if not only the si exceeds a minimum value but also the amount of material available for precipitation is significant some ions are present in such low concentrations that the amount that might precipitate would be only in the order of micrograms per liter species that both have a saturation index si 0 1 and a concentration level of mg l 1 rather than μg l 1 are listed in table 6 in the case of sample 2 four species will become supersaturated in the nf concentrate stream with hydroxyapatite being the most saturated si 2 94 for sample 1 the number of supersaturated species is five with again hydroxyapatite being the most supersaturated compound with si 10 53 as the amount of hydroxyapatite precipitating is very small though the most serious scaling might actually occur by precipitation of aragonite in sample 1 or anhydrite in sample 2 the latter as a result of the higher sulphate concentration in that sample in this last case it can be argued that gypsum rather than anhydrite will precipitate 11 but as the solubility products of both salts are of the same order of magnitude we accepted the outcome of phreeqc calculations in which anhydrite precipitates first regardless the practical implications of precipitating either anhydrite of gypsum in terms of removal of ions from solution and amount mass of solids precipitated in the system will be roughly the same and the beforementioned paper also shows that at increased salinity gypsum precipitation is reduced in favor of anhydrite and bassanite precipitation 11 it can be seen that some 5 of calcium would precipitate as a result of the presence of sulphate in sample 2 which would cause scaling of process equipment this means the nf process may experience more severe calcium scaling when fed with sample 2 because most of the potentially supersaturated species contain ca2 and mg2 this also means a potential loss of target mass and lower recovery of the target compounds in the subsequent crystallization processes 3 2 2 salt recovery amounts and purity table 7 presents the amounts of brucite and portlandite that are supposed to be recovered and their respective purities the overall recovery of ca and mg for each liter of spent iex regenerant fed to the nf is listed in table 8 results for both samples are consistent both suggest that more than 50 of the amount of target salts can be recovered and with high quality especially for calcium with more than 97 purity for both samples some low solubility species listed in table 9 may be co precipitated when the si of such a compound has a value of si 0 this may occur especially in the first crystallizer d intended for magnesium recovery resulting in a slightly lower purity of magnesium still mg2 will be of 96 4 purity even in the worst case sample 2 with ca oh 2 and caco3 the major pollutants 1 8 each of the precipitate in moles in the second crystallizer the situation is inverted now ca oh 2 is the predominant material and mg oh 2 is the main impurity but in this case the best quality product is obtained from sample 2 99 1 purity and a lesser quality product obtained from sample 1 97 4 purity with mg oh 2 the main pollutant more detailed information can be found in table 8 the effect of running the process under conditions of different temperature and ph were not calculated as not deemed very relevant as can be seen in fig 1 solubilities of key precipitates brucite and portlandite hardly vary in the range of temperatures of 10 35 c and lower temperatures negatively affect membrane filtration where higher temperatures incur costs of heating large volumes of dilute solutions making it likely that the process will be run at available water temperature the effect of altering the ph was not studied as adding any additional amount of base will increase precipitation of species later on increasing impurities in the product whereas dosing less hydroxide or adding acid to decrease the amount of hydroxide ions will reduce the amount of minerals precipitated hydroxide dosing in the crystallization reactors will need to be done stoichiometrically considering the amounts of cations to be precipitated rather than aiming at a specific ph 3 2 3 evaporator feed and product to close the water cycle an evaporation step was foreseen which produces distilled pure water and a brine containing predominantly sodium chloride nacl this evaporation step as mentioned before can be fed in two ways besides receiving only the nf permeate a mix of nf permeate and the crystallizer effluent can also be defined as the input to the evaporator a summary of the composition of the two mixed feeds is listed in table 10 since 42 of the water will be evaporated a concentrated solution will be obtained table 11 presents an estimation of the composition of this concentrated solution for both situations feeding the evaporator only with the nf permeate or feeding the evaporator with a mix of nf permeate and crystallization supernatant for both samples sodium and chloride are the dominant cation and anion respectively ca2 is the second most abundant cation in the product with 3 sample 2 or 6 sample 1 of the total cation concentration when using only the nf permeate as feed these percentages actually become slightly higher thus alternatives for reusing this brine for iex regeneration have to be studied when it comes to the foreseeable scaling in the evaporator if nf permeate is the only influent no scaling will be detected for either sample however when using the mixed feed the situation is different some species will become supersaturated in the evaporator see table 12 and consequently scaling becomes a possibility in this respect the presence of calcium is the main risk factor regarding this possible scaling problem in the evaporator unit 4 conclusions magnesium and calcium may be separated with efficiently from spent iex regenerant however complete 99 recovery of these materials is not possible especially in the case of calcium a small part of the material can also end up as scaling before reaching the crystallization step although theoretically selective precipitation of mg oh 2 and ca oh 2 is possible producing them in pure form is almost impossible because together with these hydroxides depending on the anions present also carbonates sulphates and other minerals may co precipitate given the widely varying concentrations of anions found in the different samples the amount of impurities in the precipitates will vary but precipitates will contain mg and ca with at least 97 purity in all cases studied the amount of hydroxides recovered is directly dependent on the amount of hydroxide dosed hydroxide dosing should therefore be carefully controlled as especially in the first crystallization reactor excess naoh dosed might cause ca oh 2 to precipitate prematurely control of hydroxide dosing for mg2 and ca2 precipitation can most likely be based on supernatant ph as in the case of correct stoichiometric dosing this ph will be around 9 7 and 12 5 after mg2 and ca2 precipitation respectively for both samples practically independent of initial metal ion concentration evaporator performance depends greatly on the feed if only nf permeate is fed no scaling occurs at the evaporator unit while when feeding a mixture of nf permeate and crystallization supernatant calcium scaling may occur there in the same way when feeding only nf permeate the quality of the brine produced with respect to the abundance of sodium and chlorine ions is higher than when compared to the situation that a mixture of nf permeate and crystallizer effluent is fed to the evaporator when using this mixture as feed the brine produced by the evaporator cannot be used for regeneration of the iex columns because in this case accumulating impurities will cause a faster exhausting of the iex columns a need for more frequent regeneration of these columns more frequent replacement of the resin and consequently higher operational and environmental costs it will be essential to carefully study the crystallizer effluent and consider other options before deciding on mixing this effluent with the nf permeate as the feed for the evaporator in spite of the great detail of the modeling results the exact effect of closing the water cycle in the process cannot yet be calculated completely in the first place because a large variation between samples process cycle input was observed and in the second place because the exact process scheme and process control strategy have not yet been defined even with the limited amount of data the modeling study shows that a completely closed cycle is not a realistic goal and some type of bleed will need to be present without a bleed all ions present in the feed but not removed as product like for instance ni2 zn2 sr2 and nitrate to name a few will over time accumulate in the regeneration cycle causing deterioration of the process and product specifications in the long run bleeding however may be as simple as releasing part of the mother liquor of ca precipitation or releasing part of the nf permeate author contributions conception and design of study h spanjers a

8751,bioelectrochemical systems bess are considered as the potential approaches to remediate the environments contaminated by hydrocarbons this review addresses the application of bess particularly microbial fuel cells mfcs in degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons including btexs from soil water wastewater and sediments details on reactor design and critical issues are discussed aspects on electrodes redox mediators and membranes are evaluated including economic feasibility the microbial community is considered in detail it can be concluded that comparing to classic configurations single chamber air cathode reactors are more cost effective secondly systems based on small scale units are recommended for future developments graphical abstract image 1 keywords petroleum hydrocarbons microbial fuel cell biochemical engineering sustainability clean energy 1 introduction petroleum hydrocarbons phs is the name given to a wide range of chemical compounds found in crude oil diesel and gasoline as their primary constituents phs can be divided into 4 groups i aliphatics such as alkanes alkenes and alkynes ii cycloaliphatics such as cycloalkanes iii aromatics such as monoaromatics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and iv other components such as asphaltenes waxes tar and resins as shown in table 1 1 phs are identified as carcinogenic compounds 2 the physicochemical properties of these recalcitrant compounds make them extremely portable in the environment ubiquitous in air soil and water bodies due to their certain characteristics such as lipophilicity and electrochemical stability phs tend to bioaccumulate in organic tissues causing harmful and chronic effects 3 4 there are many sources of these hardly biodegradable substances in the environment the major one is associated with spills and emissions including releases of petroleum products such as diesel fuel gasoline and lubricants among others 5 furthermore anthropogenic practices such as municipal and industrial runoffs coal mining transportation storage and onshore and offshore petroleum industry operations induce phs pollution 6 the us environmental protection agency usepa has categorized these phs as priority pollutants of natural resources 7 therefore any contamination from phs turns into a burning issue both for direct such as inhalation of their vapors and indirect such as the presence of these compounds in water bodies contact 5 till now different methods have been applied for hydrocarbon remediation such as biodegradation membrane processes electrocoagulation adsorption and advanced oxidation processes aops 8 12 however each of these methods suffers from some disadvantages for example biodegradation is a significantly slow process that requires long reaction times even lasting for days thus exceedingly large treatment facilities are needed membranes encounter fouling problems in full scale operations and high energy requirements adsorption on activated carbon a phase change technique is complex and expensive since the saturated activated carbon demands interval regeneration and sometimes the method suffers from the interference of other pollutants similarly aops are costly and complicated to install and operate they are predominantly adequate for low pollution medium electrocoagulation produces large quantities of sludge insecure and unrecoverable operating costs and high capital on industrial level scaling up have made electrocoagulation a non appropriate approach 8 13 in the past decade bioelectrochemical systems bess have shown promising niches compared with the aforementioned techniques the bes refers to employing microbial electrochemical technologies met in which microorganisms in the form of catalysts decompose organic compounds and generate electrons the electrons can produce electricity and other value added compounds 14 several applications such as microbial fuel cell mfc microbial electrolysis cell mec microbial desalination cell mdc and microbial electrosynthesis cell mes come under the bess unlike many conventional methods bes has rather mild and simple operating conditions it has successfully dealt with a wide variety of stubborn pollutants ranging from highly contaminated wastewater to polluted soil and sediment moreover precious and exhaustible electrodes as well as expensive chemicals are rarely used in bes thereby proposing an inexpensive and reliable method without any negative impact on the environment 15 bes has also the advantage of integration feasibility with other technologies for example bes can be coupled with aops constructed wetlands membranes adsorption electrochemical cells etc 16 20 in addition the electrochemical setup of bes superbly controls the released electrons from microbial metabolism 21 mfc is a system that sustainably produces energy from biodegradable compounds and simultaneously treats contaminated media such as soil sediments or wastewater generally it consists of two chambers an anodic and a cathodic and an ion exchange membrane iem separating the chambers on the surface of anode the substrate organic matter or biomass is being consumed and oxidized by microorganisms thereby producing electrons and protons electrons via an external electrical circuit and protons through the membrane are transferred from the anodic compartment to the cathodic one where the reduction of an oxidant usually oxygen takes place chemical reactions with the aid of protons and electrons occur on the cathode surface and finally form stable reduction products in a system organics follow equations 1 3 22 at anode 1 nch 2 o nh 2 o nco 2 4 ne 4 nh at cathode 2 no 2 4 ne 4 nh 2 nh 2 o 3 no 2 2 ne 2 nh nh 2 o 2 in a bes microbial or biotic degradation is the main mechanism to remediate a contaminated environment anode functions as an electron acceptor and promotes oxidation reactions complex organic compounds such as pahs are initially broken down into smaller molecules via degrading bacteria e g hydrocarbon degradation bacteria hdb and then the intermediates are degraded further via exoelectrogenic bacteria eb e g proteobacteria at the surface of anode generated electrons are subsequently released to the anode directly or through mediators 23 the presence of eb not only hampers the accumulation of mid products but also progresses the efficiency of extracellular electron transfer to complete the biodegradation process in this framework wang et al 24 discerned an increased number of hdb by nearly two orders of magnitude 373 56 103 colony forming unit per gram of soil cfu g soil close to the anode in the soil mfc than that in the open circuit control 8 2 103 cfu g soil indicating strong evidence for the biostimulation of hdb and synergy between hdb and eb to degrade petroleum pollutants moreover according to kumar et al 25 degradation of volatile organic compounds such as benzene ethylbenzene toluene and xylene in the mfc occurs through three steps i mass transfer of compounds from gaseous phase to liquid phase ii compounds diffusion into the biofilm and iii their degradation by microbes present in the biofilm in fact the primary difference between this system and conventional biotechnology comes from dissimilar exploitation of electron acceptors viz electrode and oxygen respectively in mfc the attached biofilm on the electrode enables fast and in situ electron transfer from the microorganisms to the electrode as a result it facilitates biodegradation and harnesses the existing chemical energy of the organic load 26 fig 1 represents the structural design working principle and mechanism of a microbial fuel cell it should be noted that mfcs are of interest since they do not require an external power supply while treating organic wastes 15 27 mfcs release 50 90 less sludge than that in other bioprocesses hence they reduce the ultimate cost of sludge disposal furthermore they benefit from simple structure operational stability little impact on the microbes and negligible impact on the environment in addition microorganisms in mfcs are rather resistant to toxicity and ph inconsistency compared with other methods mfcs have become an efficient and eco friendly candidate for removing phs 28 several excellent review articles have been published about the application of bess 29 33 yet to the best of our knowledge there is a limited discussion to specially refer to the mfcs applied for phs treatment a field of great potential and value in this perspective this review attempts to compile contemporary information of bes application for degradation of phs and is dedicated to the most practical type of bes the mfcs it includes i design of mfcs ii electrodes iii redox mediators iv membranes v microbial community vi co substrate vii energy consumption and electricity generation viii optimal process parameters ix mfc applications for the phs removal x cost analysis and xi future outlook and conclusion understanding these issues is of critical importance to stimulate more thinking and exploration regarding future promotion in practical applications 2 design of microbial fuel cells mfcs numerous mfc reactor configurations have been developed to degrade hydrocarbons and acquire an acceptable quality of the effluent from a cost effective situation 34 the most common configuration for degradation of hydrocarbons is a two compartment mfc which includes h type fig 2 a cubic fig 2b tubular fig 2c or u type mfc fig 2d generally these systems consist of a cathodic and an anodic chamber separated by a membrane 35 36 researchers have studied these systems at laboratory scale to treat polluted hydrocarbon media 24 37 38 however the complicated structure and extra cost of these reactors hinder the system from being scaled up and used in real case scenarios with the purpose of developing bes mfc sustainably several column type single chamber air cathode reactors were constructed to remove hydrocarbons from the soil wastewater marine sediments as well as anaerobic sludge stemming from petroleum wastewater 39 in soil and sediment function the anode was embedded in the soil or sediment while the cathode was always suspended in the overlying aqueous part 40 41 to improve the efficiency of the mfcs in terms of their phs removal capabilities a multianode system has been developed 42 li et al 42 have designed a soil sediment mfc smfc with three parallel anode layers and activated carbon ac air cathode at the bottom it was observed that the multianode mfc has higher efficiency of phs removal than a single anode system the larger the activated surface area of this system the easier the transmission of h and e in the process liu et al 43 deployed multiple compacted carbon cloth roll anodes in the ocean water and sediment fig 3 a this system with three electron collectors maintained a favorable performance of the single anode but also promoted the effective surface area per sediment footprint and preserved high power density in an associated study prakash et al 44 constructed three discrete reactors in different configurations by installing anode in single horizontal and vertical arrangements fig 3b they observed that the multi vertical electrode system has higher performance and lower internal resistance than the horizontal one the single chamber systems take advantage of the direct transfer of oxygen from the air to the cathode and thus do not impair the anaerobic environment of the process in the anaerobic trend anode microbial communities are not affected by the reductive effect of oxygen thereby enhancing the microbial operation however in a sleeve type single column reactor fig 4 a where cathodic biofilms act as a separator the biofilm overgrowth at the cathode would likely diminish the electron transfer and inhibit the degradation process furthermore hydrocarbon compounds which are required to be reduced by the cathode are simultaneously influenced by the anode that induces disruption in the system performance hollow type single chambers fig 4b solved this issue and provided an oxygen source for the cathode at the same time hence it would be an acceptable option for an efficient degradation 46 although the lab scale mfcs successfully treated phs from polluted media the produced current in comparison to the chemical energy contained in the wastewater is limited hence the coulombic efficiency obtained through laboratory mfc is poor applying the approach of using a plurality of units on the other hand has demonstrated optimal power output a number of significant issues such as the mfc size optimized anode surface the hydraulic retention time hrt cascade length and series or parallel connections should be considered to attain the highest economically feasible power output 48 in general desirable surface area to volume sa v ratios in small units maintain diffusion distances near the electrodes and facilitate the achievement of electrical power from organic substances small scale mfc also has more capability for wastewater treatment due to the fact that higher power brings about faster metabolic rates and organic transformation for a determined anode surface area and length the power density increases in accordance with the higher sa v ratio in a comparison of cascade mfcs in a steady diameter tube walter et al 49 revealed that increasing lengths from 2 fold to 8 fold result in equal power density and raise absolute power in the stacking arrangement of several small reactors allometric scaling the outlet of one unit is the following unit s inlet power generation is expected to decline more quickly at final units in terms of cascade length or number of mfcs inside a cascade the feedstock units that have already been treated provide less power output in this regard researchers demonstrated that providing a uniform substrate utilization along with the cells can address this issue 48 50 the uniformity conditions in the reactor are controlled by supplying external mixing preserving equal flow profile and increasing the flow rate that leads to the decrease of hrt 51 based on the desired purpose mfcs can be connected either in series or parallel to increase the total voltage or current respectively as predicted setting the mfcs connected electrically demonstrated lower current and greater operating voltage hence while cascade structure makes it possible to set a number of extended mfcs in parallel or series to raise current or voltage it hardly has an effect on power density 52 liu et al 53 evaluated the performance of benzene degradation from groundwater using vertically three air cathodes in both series connection and parallel connection tubular stack mfc the system reduced benzene degradation time by half compared to a single tubular cell with the same anode capacity while series connection revealed the highest open circuit voltage and had showed efficient pollutant degradation parallel mode demonstrated increased power density and thus consumed less energy 53 3 electrodes for hydrocarbon degradation the performance of mfcs is strongly influenced by the selection of anode and cathode materials in addition to the effectiveness of the catalyst an appropriate electrode material generally possess i high electrical conductivity to accelerate the electron transfer and ii a large surface area to enhance the sorption effect as the effective surface area of the biological electrode increases the mass transfer capacity of the system and thus the microbial activity increase 54 furthermore electrode materials have an impact on the ultimate products obtained during the degradation process hence the selection of environmentally friendly electrodes makes them more useful for large scale applications properties of the anode affect not only the activity rate of microbial adhesion but also the rate of electron transmission in the cell among various anode materials that have been proposed for constructing efficienct mfcs carbonaceous materials are superb due to their beneficial properties such as good biocompatibility chemical stability and conductivity carbon based materials consist of carbon cloth cc carbon felt cf carbon paper cp carbon brush cb granule graphite gg graphite plate graphite sheet and graphite rod the deployment of carbon materials as electrodes has revealed a satisfactory degradation of total petroleum hydrocarbons tphs from contaminated sites 36 55 56 venkidusamy et al 57 demonstrated that the carbon anode cathode presents 83 4 elimination of diesel with power generation of 90 81 mw m2 in a single cell mfc the results of adelaja et al 58 also accounted for more than 90 of phs degradation for both in situ and ex situ mfc utilization with cf electrodes the obtained results confirmed that this system is an advantageous over other complicated and expensive technologies even in anoxic environments under harsh conditions regarding graphite material for the anode graphite felt gf obtained more outstanding performance than other types this outstanding performance of gf anode was attributed to its larger surface area and greater adsorption potential yu et al 59 constructed soil sediment mfc smfc in a plexiglass reactor equipped with alternative electrodes made of five different materials gf cc activated carbon fiber felt acff graphite paper and aluminum sheet but carbon veil was not tested the authors revealed that gf anode provided the best result of 59 14 tphs removal in petroleum polluted soil after 115 days of operation 59 this relatively higher removal tphs by gf anode was attributed to the larger surface area of gf which resulted in greater attachment of organics on the surface of anode greater mass transfer of substrate and less internal resistance the internal resistance owing to the cell components causes interference to the electron and proton transfer 60 moreover metals have been used to overcome the electron transfer barrier yan et al 41 constructed bioreactors in which anode was made up of two stainless steel cylinders 80 meshes with 1 mm thickness and cathode was prepared from a stainless steel cylinder 4 cm height and 9 6 cm diameter and obtained more than 90 degradation of phenanthrene and pyrene carbon veil electrodes have already been proved for maximized electricity production and benefits in large scale mfcs veil microchannels due to their high porosity facilitate nutrition transport via perfusion in addition carbon veil electrodes offer less internal resistance due to their consistent thread structure as compared to other carbon materials with inconsistent strands liu et al 61 evaluated several carbon based materials as working electrodes in a conventional three electrode half cell system containing 150 ml reaction solution graphite rod and ag agcl electrode were used as counter electrode and reference electrode respectively carbon veil revealed roughly 40 higher current density than graphite and carbon rods this higher current density of carbon veil electrode was attributed to the formation of microbial biofilms on it the authors evaluated bet surface area of the materials and found that the real surface area of carbon fiber veil and carbon paper electrodes was about 10 times greater than other tested electrodes graphite rod and carbon rod also showed higher bet surface area than expected the bet surface area measurement may only reflect the fine interior pores of the materials which are not available to the microbe as a result the values are unreliable and material structure properties played a more important role using electron microscopy images the authors demonstrated that despite the thick and dense biofilms on graphite rod carbon fiber veil creates a porous structure which colonizes the biofilm on carbon fibers having more than 10 μm thickness the porous structure may also offer improved substrate access thereby achieving higher current density 61 apart from the basic materials described above both cathode and anode structures can be modified to increase the removal efficiency catalysts have been used in several works to accelerate the reduction rate liang et al 60 used porous and conductive gf as the anode while the gf cathode was painted with pt catalyst 0 5 mg pt cm2 electrode modification by catalysts could compensate for the poor kinetics of oxygen reduction in the cathodic compartment which led to higher removal rate of benzo a pyrene from polluted soil 60 carbon materials can be amalgamated with metals such as mn2 3 62 63 in a relevant study nandy et al 62 compared mno2 coated anode with pristine carbon anode in an h type dual chamber system to investigate the degradation of hydrocarbons crude oil components they found that coated anode compared to pristine anode generated higher power density 47 mw m2 vs 38 mw m2 and showed higher alkane removal 36 vs 25 5 due to the better adhesion of microorganisms on the coated anode surface 62 nevertheless use of pt loading was not an economical manner the integration of nanocomposites such as nanotube polyaniline on anodic carbon was discovered as a promising material in mfcs 64 65 in this regard liang et al modified the gf anode applying three kinds of carbon nanomaterials graphene graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes 60 the economic modification enormously enhanced the extracellular electron transfer rate contaminant removal and power output because of high conductivity high surface area increased biomass content and excellent electrochemical characteristics of nanomaterials 66 potentiality of the modified electrodes due to their better conductivities biocompatibilities and optimal reasonable costs make this technology suitable for large scale operations 67 4 redox mediators the existence of both endogenous self production and exogenous externally supplied mediators accelerate mobile electrons transfer between microbes and electron acceptors the redox mediators were applied in several mfcs to speed up the microbial activity of the system however external mediators are not commonly used in wastewater treatment due to the complicated and costly separation procedure of mediators from treated solution 68 69 recently exoelectrogens electricity generating microbes which are able to transfer intracellular electrons without external assistance to terminal electron acceptors have been identified as a driving force for electron transmission via electroactive molecules and membranes similarly ferricyanide fecn could also be used as a soluble and stable redox mediator in mfcs in a related study neutral red nr and fecn have been used as redox mediators for toluene degradation in a waste remediation cell 70 the desirable characteristics of effective mediators have been reviewed in detail by evelyn et al 71 these desirable characteristics of mediators include the capability to form redox couples ability to pass the membrane stability in both oxidized and reduced form a nontoxic character in respect to biological species low cost non biodegradability and sufficient capacity for electron acceptor role 70 72 an appropriate range of added mediators enables microorganisms to use electrical power for growth as well as metabolite generation the commonly used redox mediators are compiled in table 2 adelaja et al 38 investigated the impact of introducing 30 μm of riboflavin into the anolyte medium as a redox mediator the riboflavin has significantly increased the power generation and coulombic efficiencies in comparison to mediator free mfc the maximum power density and coulombic efficiency were increased by 30 times and 3 times respectively when riboflavin was added to anolyte medium nature derived quinone redox mediators ndqrm natural products have proved significant potential in the electron exchange and formation of biofilms biochar a representative of ndqrm has been tested for tphs removal it was found that biochar has increased the removal rate of tphs by 17 in comparison to non biochar smfc 76 77 under this operation the physicochemical properties of biochar and the formation of different microbial communities of bacteria established an appropriate environment for soil remediation several mediators such as fecn and nr have been reported to be toxic to the enzymes and thus hinder cell growth 75 therefore favorable temperature and control ph should be used to achieve efficient degradation of target pollutants while using 500 μm fecn and 200 μm nr as redox mediators in mfc fed with 11 09 mg l toluene the output voltage was increased from 53 5 mv to 88 2 mv and 109 2 mv respectively i e an increase of 39 and 51 was observed 75 however due to the interference of nr and fecn in cellular respiration the degradation time of toluene was 1 56 2 15 times and 2 1 times lengthier for the fecn and nr containing mfc respectively as compared to unmediated mfc 75 in summary due to the adverse effects of redox mediators and the possibility of washing away soluble redox mediators in high amount they are not suitable for industrial applications 5 membranes in a mfc system generally a proton exchange membrane pem separates anodic and cathodic zones and is responsible for the diffusion of protons from the anode to the cathode mass transfer ohmic losses power generation and pollutant removal are greatly affected by the performance of membranes as they can inhibit electrode contact and merging of both compartments solutions in case of lack of membrane the solution from the anode chamber could move to the cathode side it could cause serious biofouling on the cathode surface thereby deteriorating system s performance on the other side o2 from the cathode chamber could reach the anaerobic anode chamber causing inhibition of the anaerobic fermentation process at the anode durability low cost and resistance to fouling are the most significant requirements for a suitable membrane lower amount of fuel crossover oxygen diffusion and ionic resistance are always favorable parameters for attaining higher power generation 78 mostly nafion membranes are used in mfcs because of their adequate ion exchange capacity durability and high proton conductivity nafion is a perfluorosulfonic acid membrane composed of hydrophobic fluorocarbon backbone cf2 cf2 to which hydrophilic sulfonate groups so3 are linked they have been introduced in different thicknesses thin membranes encounter higher reactant crossover e g substrate crossover substrate loss and oxygen leakage and lower mechanical strength although thick membranes surmount these problems they have high resistance and thus low current density however nafions experience some problems they are not suitable under neutral ph conditions and preferentially transport cation species such as k na nh4 ca2 and mg2 rather than h which are typically 105 times higher than protons in concentration in wastewater 79 this cationic species transport process leads to increase in ph of the cathodic compartment salt precipitation on cathode and therefore diminishes the catalytic performance of the cathode several studies have explored the use of alternative membranes such as anion exchange membrane aem cation exchange membrane cem and bipolar membrane bpm fig 5 some of these materials are generally cheaper than nafion but are still quite expensive difficult to handle and sometimes produce lower power generation owing to high internal resistance the difference between aem and cem is in positively charged and negatively charged functional groups which are attached to the membrane polymeric backbone and accomplish the selective transfer of anions or cations respectively cem which allows the transfer of cations from one chamber to the other is made of weak or strong acids in a polymeric sheet aem is selectively permeable to anions and likewise made from weak or strong bases structure of the sheets is inversely correlated with the transferred ion type for example negative charges in the case of cem form a matrix of covalent linkage to a polymer and thus exclude anions in the same way aem carries positively charged fixed groups and permits the passage of anions only the basic polymer matrix and the fixed ionic charges are the two main parameters that define the characteristics of ion exchange membrane chemical mechanical and thermal stability of the membrane are determined by the basic polymer matrix wheras the type and concentration of the fixed ionic group in the polymer matrix specify the electric qualities and selectivity of the membrane carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid groups are weak and strong acids respectively which are frequently used for cems preparation in the case of aems quaternary ammonium qa is used as a strong basic group tertiary secondary and primary amines as well as phosphonium and sulfonium groups form less strongly functional bases despite better buffering less corrosive environment lower resistance and restricted ph drop aems are rarely used in mfcs due to their poorer chemical stability and susceptibility to substrate losses especially in alkaline conditions compared to cems bpm combines both anion exchange and cation exchange layers in a laminated structure and dissociates water molecules to h and oh afterward protons through cem and hydroxide ions through aem transfer to cathode and anode respectively 15 27 this membrane can resolve ph or ionic imbalance which usually takes place between the cells in mfcs even though bpm holds a relatively high polarization resistance it offers a technology for recovery of acids and bases from salt solutions bpms are specially developed for saltwater treatment and desalination due to their easy fabrication high conductivity low density and chemical stability stainless steel and graphite have been widely employed for this type of bipolar plate membranes 78 80 looking for an affordable and natural alternative to commercial membranes porous ceramic materials have gained great interest in recent years earthenware terracotta and clayware membranes facilitate practical application by dropping the cost of the overall system interestingly the internal structure in ceramic membranes can be customized by changing both the raw materials and firing cycles in fact modification in the composition of raw materials including alumina zirconia mullite pyrophyllite and other oxides as well as variation in the kilning method such as curing time and temperature yield comparable or even better performance to those of the polymeric separators 81 this modification in the composition of raw materials and carefully controlling the kilning process tunes the ceramic properties such as porosity permeability internal resistance water absorption and cationic transfer selectivity which finally affect the flux of ions and solvent through it 82 as an important feature the porous material can be made in a uniform structure which could show resistant to chemical and microbiological degradation aside from exclusive chemical mechanical and thermal stabilities ceramics are operative for long time processes and even reusable after cleansing with harsh agents 83 however despite their multiple benefits employing ceramic membranes is accompanied by low ion conductivity which could fade its privileges in addition oxygen diffusion through the membrane could negatively affect anodic respiration where oxygen incorrectly acts as the terminal electron acceptor 84 this may lead to a future development trend to find novel materials and or new surface modification techniques accordingly published articles on the usage of ceramic membranes in phs treatment are still limited it has to be taken into account that deformation and biofilm development on the membrane is almost an inevitable process during long term operations chemical cleansing agents may help the removal of these formed biofilms from the surface or inside the membrane resistance of membrane structure to the agents is a required feature to recover conductivity ion exchange capacity and performance loss 78 however the perfect type and material of a separator have not been found yet each one has its own advantages and constraints considering the operating conditions a suitable membrane should be selected for practical applications 79 it is noteworthy that smfcs do not usually need cem or pem which noticeably decrease the construction overall cost of the systems 85 zhou et al 86 however exploited a cem in their dual chamber mfc design for hydrocarbon contaminated soil to produce electric current morris and jin 87 did the same with a nafion perfluorinated resin in a sediment based mfc in water and wastewater phs treatment adelaja et al 88 presented a robust design of the system with a cem other researchers employed pem 89 cem 88 and nafion proton exchange membranes 90 93 morris and jin 94 constructed vinyl tube proton bridges having various lengths and diameters to link anode and cathode compartments in two cell mfc composed of potassium chloride copper sulfate and ultrapure agar mixed in deionized water which was boiled and then solidified in tubes they concluded that the largest diameter 1 9 cm and the shortest length 0 7 m provided highest cell potential 6 microbial community the removal efficiency of hydrocarbons in a mfc depends on two factors adsorption and microbial degradation the activity of microorganisms has a significant impact on the degradation rate of recalcitrant compounds biache et al 95 found that the type of microbial communities was the major factor for the polycyclic aromatic compound pac degradation in soil and slurry it should be pointed out that the biofilms which grow on the anode surface contain degradative and fermentative microorganisms to begin the degradation process organic pollutants such as phenolic compounds toluene or benzoic acid are subjected to anaerobic reactions resulting in the formation of organic acids then electroactive microorganisms breakdown the acids into carbon dioxide and electrons 75 the biodegradability potential of pahs depends on their molecular weight the reports indicated that the microorganisms found it has been reported that low molecular weight lmw compounds are more appropriate as a sole source of carbon for microorganisms than high molecular weight hmw compounds as result lmw compounds were found to be mineralized degraded faster than hmw compounds 39 95 the performance of mfcs is significantly influenced by the interactions of different microbial species 96 both synergistic and antagonistic interactions are possible among different microbial species leading to the enhancement and reduction respectively of the power density output and removal rate of hydrocarbons in this aspect guo et al 96 reported that the best mfc performance in terms of electricity generation and oil removal rate was observed for the combined application of deinococcus sp and paenibacillus sp due to their synergistic interaction for this mfc the power density output and the oil removal rate were calculated to be 102 93 mw m3 and 85 56 respectively deinococcus sp converted phs to simple fatty acids and esters these simple fatty acids and esters were further degraded by paenibacillus sp thereby both species worked in cooperation and thus improved the electricity generation and wastewater treatment performances similarly zhou et al 39 and qin et al 97 enhanced the removal rate of pahs including benzo a pyrene with the addition of lmw naphthalene and phenanthrene respectively on contrary the antagonistic effect s of microbial strains can adversely affect the process for example guo et al 96 observed that the microbacterium sp interaction with paenibacillus sp and deinococcus sp limited the microbial electron transfer to the anode surface as a result the internal resistance was increased and the system operation output was decreased yu et al 59 and liang et al 60 studied the richness abundance of a microbial community at the phylum and genus levels the possible paramount phylum in pah polluted soils was found to be proteobacteria 59 moreover the process of benzo a pyrene degradation was promoted by the existence of gammaproteobacteria and clostridia which had significant abundance in the graphite felt anode 60 exoelectrogen microorganisms or anode respiring bacteria which transfer electrons to extracellular acceptors can apply organic and inorganic substances as carbon sources and inoculate for the degradation and fermentation of products in the polluted hydrocarbon sites in parallel zhou et al 86 directly adopted phs contaminated soil to enrich exoelectrogenic bacteria in the mfc system meanwhile they successfully identified and isolated two species of exoelectrogenic strains belonging to the geobacter sp and ochrobactrum sp 86 wang et al 24 venkidusamy et al 57 zhou et al 86 and zafar et al 98 found the geobacter flavobacterium rhodopseudomonas ochrobactrum and stenotrophomonas as major exoelectrogens in the anode of mfcs microbial immobilization is a reusable technology that encapsulates microorganisms in a fixed area to control microbial activity and community precisely confinement of cells and enzymes inside or on the appropriate carrier plays a significant role in the performance of microbial immobilization 99 100 an immobilized nontoxic carrier not only increases the attachment area with degrading bacteria but also provides a harmless environment for the growth of exogenous bacteria the carriers that are used for the microbial immobilization process are categorized into natural organic and inorganic materials 101 annie et al 102 indicated that the bio carrier coconut coir pith is regarded as a suitable amendment for the remediation of crude oil in polluted soil partovinia et al 103 modified polyvinyl alcohol and alginate with halloysite nanotubes hnts to improve the surface area and provide a harmless physical method resulting in a reliable and low cost matrix for cell stabilization researchers suggested that usage of immobilized bacteria increased acclimatization of the bacteria with the environment and reduced lag phases and reaction time in this regard the start up time which is the main issue of mfcs could be resolved and enable this technology to achieve the highest removal rate 104 105 it is critical to explore the mechanisms of anodic biofilm communities develop a better way to facilitate the electrochemical activities of the anodic microorganisms and improve the reactor performance it has been reported that the electrical power output is directly related to the biofilm population number of adherent cells in a steady state anodic biofilm system however the cell population quantity is not the only controlling factor for power output it is axiomatic that there would be no power generation if all cells were dead with zero metabolic rate hence the metabolic rate of the cells plays a more critical role in power output 106 in a steady state continuous flow the metabolic rate is proportional to the growth rate of the cells which in turn is related to the electrons source particularly carbon energy substrate microorganisms act as biocatalysts that influence power output by overcoming total internal resistance degrading the feed and transporting electrons to the anode 107 108 hou et al 108 utilized electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and cyclic voltammetry cv to investigate the anodic biofilm growth effect on power generation the experiments were conducted on the abiotic and open circuit conditions for 30 days the authors found that the growth of biofilm greatly enhanced the power production through increasing the rate of electrochemical reactions via enhancing the extracellular electron transfer from microorganism to anode biofilm growth has also reduced the anodic polarization impedance and activation losses the biofilm structure inside an mfc relies on numerous factors resulting in either a thick diffusion limiting or thin perfusion limiting structure the thick biofilm matrix does not contain the impervious electrode substratum so the formation of a thick biofilm leads to matrix heterogeneity under such conditions there is very low nutrients diffusion rate leading to the starvation of the inner cells which will then fight for their survival rather than growth on contrary a thin perfusable biofilm made up of permanently adherent cells have access to flowing nutrients as a result there is greater chances for cells to mutate however these mutant progeny will have minimal benefit in microbial cells since they are washed away by shear stress or natural cycles and are unable to aggregate 106 regarding the microbial community s abundance the simpson index measures the community diversity while the shannon index represents both evenness and richness of the community thus the great shannon or low simpson index illustrates the less microbial diversity yu et al 59 categorized the microbial communities of different anode materials into two groups i less richness and higher evenness including aluminum sheet as and graphite plate gp and ii higher richness and less evenness containing graphite felt gf activated carbon fibre felt acff and carbon cloth cc anode materials 59 jiang et al 109 compared the microbial community of the anode biofilms in the dual chamber and single chamber mfcs the target dna extracted from the microbes on the anode carbon brushes was analyzed using the pyrosequencing technique the total estimated number of operational taxonomic units otu were 1117 and 843 for single and dual chamber mfc respectively the results indicated that the single mfc was richer with a higher shannon index 3 94 than dual chamber mfc 3 65 on the other hand the simpson index was greater in dual chamber 0 0844 than single mfc 0 0476 representing better and more even distribution of microbes different electron acceptors which impacted the extracellular electron transfer speed were apparently the source of the difference in the microbial community of the anode biofilm hence there is a need to screen and monitor the microbial biofilm to determine the best microbial strains for specific wastewater considering the operating reliability and reduced cost of single mfc it has a brighter future in real world applications 109 7 co substrate co metabolism is regarded as one of the efficienct methods to enhance the degradation rate of refractory compounds in mfcs co substrate has the potential to contribute to the proliferation of bacteria and induction of oxidizing enzymes providing biodegradable carbon sources indeed the addition of a co substrate establishes beneficial synergisms in the digestive media and provides deficient nutrients by generating more electrons thus improving biogas production 110 using biodegradable organic compounds as co substrates led to the increase in bacterial metabolism and accelerated the degradation procedure it has been shown that the use of labaneh whey lw wastewater as a co substrate due to its high organic and biodegradable contents boosted the electrons generated in the dual chambered mfc contained petroleum refinery wastewater the extra organic matters provided by lw along with greater amounts of total dissolved solids tds increased electron transfer in the anode chamber and thus have achieved enhanced power generation and higher substrate degradation 110 111 the previous studies revealed that the use of acetate as a co substrate in a single chamber mfc based on microbial communities of pseudomonas geobacter and shewanella resulted in electricity generation and phenol removal simultaneously xy in this regard the promising ability of methanol and acetate as co substrates in anaerobic biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in marine sediments was confirmed 112 the results demonstrated that various co substrates led to distinct structures of the microbial community which subsequently impacted the tph degradation the impact of acetate on the degradation of tph was more promising than that of methanol zhang and lo indicated above 95 phenol degradation within 60 h in an mfc with an aqueous air cathode using glucose as co substrate that incited the growth of whole populations of bacteria in the anode chamber in addition glucose phenol mixture minimized potential phenol toxicity during shock load or temperature fluctuations 112 8 energy consumption and electricity generation in an mfc system the catalytic activity of microbes converts organic matters chemical energy present in c c bonds into electricity 113 from this perspective mfcs are theoretically considered energy profitable because i they can be operated under ambient environmental conditions ii they directly produce electricity from substrate energy with a high conversion efficiency and iii they produce less amount of sludge 113 it is estimated that the system consumes only about 0 024 kw or 0 076 kwh kg cod on average primarily for reactor feeding and mixing 29 on the other hand the activated sludge based aerobic process consumes about 0 3 kw or 0 6 kwh kg cod 29 in addition mfcs can be operated at low 15 c ambient 15 35 c and high 50 60 c temperature ranges without aeration 29 moreover mfcs produce low fossil related co2 because of their low energy consumption interestingly conversion of biogas e g h2 or ch4 into electricity results in a considerable energy loss more than 60 whereas mfcs could produce electricity directly from organic matter present in wastewater with a high energy conversion rate 29 the term exoelectrogens refers to microorganisms with the capability of transferring electrons from outside of the cell to a solid insoluble extracellular electron acceptor in mfcs only exoelectrogens are responsible for the electricity generation currently α β γ and δ proteobacteria e g geobacter sulfurreducens shewanella oneidensis escherichia coli geobacter metallireducens rhodopseudomonaspalustris are the most studied exoelectrogens 29 previous studies have enriched mfcs with a wide range of feedstocks electron donors and innovations to produce electricity such as palm oil mill effluent 1648 7 mw m3 and 1280 56 mw m3 from pretreated and untreated effluent respectively glucose 1499 mw m3 rice mill wastewater 656 10 mw m3 sewage 13 65 mw m3 potato chips processing waste water 612 5 mw m3 municipal wastewater 41 4 mw m3 young leachate 6817 4 mw m3 aged leachate 78 1 mw m3 cassava mill wastewater 18 2 w m3 brewery wastewater 24 1 w m3 fresh human urine 6 93 w m3 sewage sludge 8 5 w m3 and domestic wastewater 12 8 w m3 113 125 yet the amounts are too weak to be used except for some small devices or ingenious sensors 126 it is proposed that mfcs should have an output of at least 400 w m3 in order to compete with traditional anaerobic digestion as a substitute at an organic loading rate of 5 25 kg cod m3 day 127 and be able to produce 1 kw m3 to fulfill energy self sufficiency 128 abbasi et al 129 observed a positive correlation between chemical oxygen demand cod concentration and generated voltage possibly due to the increase in organic substrates and higher solution conductivity at low cod concentration anode restricted electricity generation due to kinetic limitations whereas at high cod concentration cathode demonstrated a more significant impact than the anode on electricity generation 113 mohanakrishna et al 130 measured 2150 mg l for cod value in petroleum refinery wastewater on the other hand the formation of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 during the cathodic reduction of oxygen decreases the attainable power of mfcs especially with carbon electrodes it will be better if h2o2 formation is avoid during mfc operation as it could deteriorate the reactor internally owing to its high oxidizing power 131 some researchers found that a larger current in smfcs accelerated the degradation rate this may be because of i the metabolism rate of anaerobic bacteria could be enhanced by the electrons generated by electrogenic bacteria ii the electric field which possibly affects certain enzymes in electrogenic bacteria to enhance the removal efficiency of organic compounds and iii the electric field influencing the permeability of cell membranes thus resulting in increased absorption of extracellular substances and thereby promoting the metabolism of microorganisms 28 higher generation of power density is subject to several important considerations including configuration development anode and cathode function modification with material biological factors and redox potential optimization of microbial colonization decrease in internal cell resistance and proper selection of the size number of units temperature retention time and fuel quality as an effective solution incorporating current collectors into electrodes necessarily increases electron transfer and power generation in mfcs 132 studies have reported maximum current power voltage in phs treatment in a variety of setups which is mentioned throughout the article solution conditions high internal resistance low degradability of substrate and slow biofilm kinetics mainly account for low power density 133 generally small reactors achieve high currents voltages for example decreasing the size of a fuel cell from liter or cubic meter scale to milliliter scale substantially increases the volumetric power density by 2 4 orders of magnitude 29 first inhomogeneity or unbalanced substrate distribution is evident in large sized mfcs which are identified by different hydraulic pressures and substrate concentrations in different cell sections it would suppress both the energy output and the system s efficiency additionally extending the volume of mfc increases the internal resistance hence innovative designs are introduced to optimize power output levels for mfc scale up in this context stacking cascading of small scale mfc units is being pursued reducing the size of consecutive downstream mfcs while avoiding supply recirculation within a cascade is one of the effective strategies for enhancing the power generation walter et al 49 employed two cascade stacks consisting of constant size units control cascade cc and variable size units with decreasing width test cascade tc with the same volumetric flow rate the results showed that a cascade comprising mfcs of tc optimizes the received power for a given volume of feed 400 h power monitoring of the mentioned units showed that the absolute power of the cc stack 5 75 0 08 mw was more than that of tc stack 3 50 0 05 mw however the power density of the cc stack 8 00 wm 3 was lower than that of tc stack 10 00 wm 3 i e a 25 increase for tc stack this 25 rise in the power density of tc was attributed to an increase in power density of each row in the tc stack however the power density in a cc stack dropped as every row moved through the cascade 49 9 optimal process parameters 9 1 ph in mfc systems the substrates are oxidized to release protons and electrons so they combine with oxygen to generate water in the cathodic section the reactor media such as soil sediment or wastewater might have an internal resistance that impedes the protons transfer resulting in a ph gradient from anode to the cathode same time determining appropriate ph values for the effective microbial activity of both degrading and electrogenic microorganisms is essential 134 the anodic ph affects both anodic and cathodic compartments since it directly controls the rate of the microorganisms transfer thereby the proton and electron concentration the optimal ph range has a great impact on the bioavailability of substrates and thus hydrocarbon elimination and electricity production 135 in this regard the ph spectrum for electricity generation is usually neutral maximizing electrogenic bacteria s operation for instance ph 6 80 is ideal for the geobacter sp moreover ph 6 7 and ph 7 are the most propitious limits for alkanes and pahs biodegradation respectively 39 136 hassan et al indicated that with the potential of electroactive dechlorinative bacteria such as b subtilis the optimized values for chlorophenols degradation was achieved at anode ph 7 5 and cathode ph 6 6 137 when ph is too low in the catholyte the propelling force for proton distribution through the membrane will be reduced resulting in protons accumulation in the anolyte it should be noted that due to sufficient release of protons in the moderate level of ph more current generation occurred and required current density diminished see table 3 briefly while the ph of the anode zone increased up to the optimal amounts the current density decreased and in reverse 134 variation between ph values of the anode and the cathode is a dominant factor affecting the activity of microorganisms and thus the internal resistance of the system to tackle this issue in systems with acid base differentiation a relatively acidic catholyte can be added to the cathode and similarly alkaline substrates can be added to the anode the results of monitoring the ph alteration during the process revealed that after a slight ph reduction at the beginning of the process and ultimate marginal ph increase in the anodic chamber was observed it might be derived from balanced ion transfer other than h and oh during the operation li et al proved that the slow transfer of anodic proton resulted in hydroxyl anions accumulation close to air cathode and ended up with a ph increase in the soil 138 9 2 temperature temperature is a significant parameter affecting microbial kinetics mass transfer capacity and oxygen reaction in the reactor 139 140 different mfc performances have been observed in relation to various starting up temperatures a decrease in current density was clearly detected with a reduction in operating temperature 141 according to related studies lower initial temperatures would slow or impede the system from being properly initiated lower operating temperature influenced the microbial communities which rely on increasing start up time and mfc efficiency a power production enhancement took place when the mfc was run at a higher temperature about 40 c and then it was adjusted to a lower one 142 143 results of temperature changes during the process in the anodic compartment are more noticeable than the cathodic one in the anode biofilm the temperature rise is correlated with the growth of microbial communities studies have shown that the cathodic biofilms are more stable even at low temperatures and are also capable of providing great redox activities involved in electron transmission this adaptation in low temperature is generally attributed to the high metabolic activity of cathodic microbial communities which are different from those that functioned at ambient temperature 144 specific ranges of temperature have been defined for the efficient operation of different microorganisms thus a suitable temperature range enhances system performance in terms of substrate degradation rate and electricity generation as demonstrated in many studies 35 40 c was recognized as an optimal temperature for hydrocarbon degradation and electricity generation 140 relatively high temperature facilitates biofilm formation electron transfer therefore current generation an investigation about the influence of temperature for phs degradation ranging from 20 to 50 c confirmed a doubled rate of degradation at 40 c in comparison with 20 c however an evident decrease in substrate consumption rate and performance was observed at 50 c see table 3 this decrease in high temperature resulted from the inactivation of some microbial communities 38 139 the results correlated to the distinct phases of microbial growth which determines the microorganisms growth rate temperature is also regarded as a major environmental factor that has an obvious impact on the archaeal distribution present in petroleum reservoirs and thus the hydrocarbon degradation in this regard liang et al 145 investigated the archaeal community of high temperature petroleum reservoirs and revealed that a wide variety of archaeal was active in high temperature environments in addition they posed that temperature rise was directly related to the presence of more archaea in petroleum reservoirs and thereby it was more beneficial for hydrocarbon degradation 9 3 conductivity of media conductivity acts efficiently in a bes to improve microorganisms activity and generate electricity for sediment and soil as significant sites of hydrocarbon pollution enhancing porosity moisture and salinity are the available strategies that can increase the electron transfer rate of mfcs deploying materials including ac and carbon fiber increases the conductivity of media that promotes the function of electrogenic microorganisms resulting in greater performance of the process 146 guo et al reported that the cell equipped with gg had better microbial activity and thus pollutant removal than the one with granule activated carbon gac anode 92 it follows from the higher conductivity of g compared to gac furthermore when mfcs were applied in groundwater or sediment with contaminants such as nitrates sulfates or metals oxide the ions present played the role of electron acceptors thereby increasing the conductivity of the system 38 147 rising ion concentration in both aqueous media such as polluted wastewater and solid media such as sediment and soil is a common way to directly decrease the internal resistance of the bes in this regard adding appropriate type and concentration of ions to biodegradation cells of phs or saline environments facilitates electron transfer and thus the production of electricity related studies demonstrated a direct relation between salinity and charge transfer within mfcs 38 139 148 however it is worth mentioning that further increase of salinity might have a detrimental effect on microbial metabolism and thereby result in lower performance results of tremouli et al indicated that although the system took advantage of utilizing optimal salinity 4 1 gkcl l the higher salt concentration 5 4 and 6 7 g l had an adverse impact on the operation table 3 139 similarly askari et al revealed that applying a medium range concentration of nacl 165 g l improved the density of the biofilm layer on the cf electrode and thus enhanced the mfc performance for the treatment of saline sediment 149 this result is in line with luqueño et al daghio et al and adeleja et al studies 38 150 151 moreover raising the water content of saline soil or sediment diminishes salinity stress and increases mass transfer 10 mfc applications for the phs removal 10 1 soil hydrocarbons mainly damage the soil environment by changing the composition and structure of the soil poisoning the medium disturbing the plants growth and altering the soil microbial communities mfcs have been applied in recent years for remediation to resolve serious soil phs pollution the main degradation mechanism is based on the redox gradient between the contaminants and the electrodes 15 wang et al applied for the first time a u tube soil mfc and obtained tphs removal enhancement by 120 adjacent to the anode 1 cm in 25 days of operation however lower soil moisture or larger distances from the anode decreased the performance 24 lu et al attempted to extend the radius of influence by new configurations in a pilot scale installation column type design worked well beyond the area close to the electrode enhanced to the edge of the reactor and shortened the remediation period they indicated that the radius of influence probably reaches 90 300 cm which means 11 12 times the column radius 152 with the aim of testing the practicability of long range bioremediation li et al applied extended smfc in phs removal by utilizing multilayer anodes in saline soils the three anodes system with single cathode was identified as efficient in increasing the degradation rates in each layer and the bacterial communities which played a key role in the process 42 mohanakrishna et al studied soil microenvironment where phs and carbon electrodes performed electron donors and electron acceptors roles respectively the results demonstrated that the average tphs degradation reached 46 in three cycles of operation this showed an increase of 40 in comparison with the reactor without electrodes 55 li et al investigated the effect of the addition of carbon source supplementation glucose for mfc biodegradation of aged phs in saline soils aged phs are confronted with a deficiency in electron acceptors weak electron transfer and low activity of microbes the research indicated promising results especially for soils in extreme environments or barren areas 153 zhao et al introduced plants and surfactants into the mfc system therefore the plants directly acted as electron donors for the microorganisms absorbed organic contaminants and helped the transformation and fixation of contaminants in addition surfactants were used to pass the electron transfer barrier and desorb contaminants from soil by increasing the solubility of hydrophobic pollutants the results suggested a plant surfactant combination in order to boost the mfc performance 154 another research by li et al was carried out examining the addition of five kinds of surfactants anionic cationic nonionic ampholytic and biosurfactant to the aged phs which are depleted of easily biodegradable hydrocarbons they found the most effective one the ampholytic surfactant for hydrocarbon degradation and bioelectricity generation 155 li et al promoted mass transport in soil mfcs by the addition of sand which could enlarge soil porosity 45 51 reduce ohmic resistance by 46 and increase charge output 2 5 3 5c g soil this significantly accelerated the degradation rate of hydrocarbons 138 similarly li et al overcame the difficulty of mass transfer by amendment of contaminated soil and compared three different biochars with a mass ratio of 2 derived from poultry agriculture and forestry industries with the aim of improving soil properties they deduced variant removal efficiencies related to diverse fractions of phs agriculture and poultry wastes were suited for high removal of aromatics and alkanes respectively due to their physicochemical properties 76 in another research li et al assessed the effectiveness of mfc with 1 conductive carbon fiber mixed with the contaminated soil to reduce the tremendous internal resistance and assist the anode in gathering electrons this could meaningfully lead to 15 fold bioelectricity generation and improve the effective range of hydrocarbon remediation from 6 to 20 cm 156 the mfc for in situ soil bioremediation using two different arrangements of anodes horizontal or vertical was evaluated by zhang et al the superior performance for hydrocarbon removal was obtained using a configuration with anodes horizontally arranged which removed tphs about 50 more than the vertically arranged reactor 157 yu et al tried to discover the underlying mechanism of electricity generation and the pahs removal emphasizing the electrodes interval and the anode s microbial community structure and composition testing from 4 cm to 10 cm they achieved more favorable results when electrodes were positioned closer because of smaller internal resistances besides according to their analysis the system enriched and promoted growth of microbes at the anode surface owing to electric stimulation 158 li et al inquired into electrode aging in mfcs arising from long term remediation period through examining the surface profile changes of electrode element accumulation on its surface and element migration between mfc electrodes in soil the aging phenomenon undoubtedly reduces self generated biocurrent and disturbs the operational process after 300 days they observed accumulation of cations on cathode 52 of increment and anode 35 of increment the stacking of fe and ca played a key role in soil hardening besides the accumulation of na resulted in electrode corrosion 159 several studies developed the remediation system to phs contaminated saline alkali soil since salt influence soils constitute approximately 40 of the earth s lands this common polluted environment typically occurs in coastal areas because big oilfields are often located there the salts impose unpleasant high osmotic potential and subsequently circumscribe the metabolic activity 160 furthermore they are exposed to high internal resistance in this sample li et al found the suppressing effect of extreme salinity with soil blended with carbon fiber the system filled with soil via rinsed salt and mixed with carbon fiber expedited the degradation rate of tphs pahs and n alkanes 161 accordingly mfcs have shown satisfactory application prospects to treat phs polluted soil 10 2 water wastewater to address serious water pollution by hydrocarbons usually caused by spillages and leakages from storage tanks researchers struggled to develop strategies and scopes of mfc systems morris and jin conducted a study with both single cell and two cell mfc design harvesting electricity by utilizing hydrocarbons as the sole substrate in the groundwater which is depleted of oxygen except at or near the surface their preliminary data held the view that the mfc technology made groundwater remediation possible under anaerobic conditions and eliminated conventional in situ aeration 94 in 2009 the authors implemented a double cell design for the biodegradation of diesel compounds c8 c25 hydrocarbons in water the results suggested increasing biodegradation by 165 over 21 days as compared to an open circuit control 89 gambino et al explored single chamber air cathode mfc for pahs degradation and detoxification in the water environment resulting in 90 decrease in pahs concentration 162 venkidusamy et al documented the influence of pre enrichment of the anode community in diesel fed single chamber mediator less mfc the pre cultured anode through former long term culture in comparison with freshly inoculated new one confirmed excellent performance in terms of the current generation and hydrocarbon contaminant degradation more precisely 6 times power generation and complete removal vs 83 removal of diesel 57 adelaja et al published a report on a range of inocula that degrade phenanthrene a model hydrocarbon through co metabolism all the inocula revealed high degradation potentials higher than 97 mentioned in table 4 88 the use of wastewater as a low grade substrate and an electron source in mfc method likewise has attracted attention during years for this purpose mohanakrishna et al ascertained the decontamination ability of single and dual chamber mfc for significant amounts of residual phs in produced water with respect to cod degradation bioelectrogenesis and tphs removal dual chamber mfc evidenced superior function 91 luo et al determined the contribution of mfcs to phenol degradation in the presence of a co substrate glucose in order to reduce toxicity of phenol during temperature changes or shock load a distinctive twin voltage peaks pattern at phenol degradation rates of 20 and 90 was observed in glucose phenol mixture as the fuel besides all the experiments concluded above 95 degradation efficiency within 60 h 90 guo et al inspected the influence of packing material characteristics on the system efficiency utilizing petroleum refinery wastewater in the role of fuel in the anode chamber packing materials would expand the superficial anode area and accordingly raise microbial enrichment as well as power density output gg with excellent electrical conductivity improved petroleum pollutants decomposition electricity generation and microbial community diversity meanwhile gac promoted the stability of operation and preferential removal of volatile benzene and phenols due to strong adsorption ability 92 mohanakrishna et al aimed to boost petroleum refinery wastewater treatment with the aid of externally applied voltage in the range 100 500 mv for the initial 24 h the supplemented potential was identified as effective on bioelectrogenesis and substrate degradation the 500 mv voltage exhibited the maximum power density substrate and diesel range organics straight chain alkanes removal efficiency much higher than 300 mv 100 mv and control mfcs 130 10 3 sediment recently sediment mfcs have become competitive technology for removing hydrocarbons many researchers have reported higher removal efficiencies of the technology compared to in situ natural biodegradation in contaminated sediments sediment s complex composition of various organic matters microbial populations and mineral particles beside water and air affects the internal resistance and therefore the performance of mfc systems in the process there is no need for mobilization or transport of sediment thus reducing co2 emissions and low adverse effect on the environment has been observed 85 it had been reported that mfcs arouse aromatic hydrocarbons degradation with one or two aromatic rings e g benzene toluene and naphthalene in sediments 163 morris and jin tested a modified single cell mfc setup appearing to enhance the degradation rate of tphs by nearly 12 fold over natural biodegradation 87 yan et al proposed construction of plexiglass columns as sediment bioreactors that are greatly capable of pahs biodegradation in a combined approach smfc and fe iii addition with about 95 removal efficiencies of phenanthrene and pyrene they affirmed the opinion that in such treatment organic matters present in freshwater sediments could adsorb remaining pahs with less bioavailability 41 nastro et al proved the high potential of mfcs for in situ remediation of marine sediments among all according to the complexity of pah types degradation rates ranged from 10 to 86 after four weeks for indenol 1 2 3 c d pyrene and naphthalene respectively in terms of power density the systems reached their highest performance after two weeks 40 sherafatmand and ng did detailed research into the capability of smfc for bioremediation of pahs under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the cathodic compartment the results demonstrated more than 3 times removal rate compared with those in the smfcs without electric current and better performance with 67 toc removal in the anaerobic reactor as well 164 permana et al executed a comparative study between single chamber and dual chamber mfc in sediment remediation they realized that the single chamber system can not only degrade more phs than the dual chamber system but also produce higher electrical energy on average to the other one 66 therefore mfcs have been successfully investigated in sediment remediation fig 6 exhibits schematic diagrams of mfcs in environmental applications moreover table 4 represents more accurate information of the reported studies on mfcs in different applications 11 cost analysis worldwide an enormous amount of research effort is allocated to treatment processes to certify the economic viability of each method in this regard economic analysis of mfcs has been done since 2005 166 many considerations have to be taken into account about the evaluation of mfcs cost including capital and operating costs which are two main areas of focus for any development of this technology into real world implementation mfcs operating costs including tax rates electricity labor services and membrane replacement are incurred during the process and are estimated to be 4 of the capital cost the large capital costs of mfc modules mainly appear from the high priced construction materials associated with the electricity membrane and electrodes some researchers inferred that the anode accounts for further electrode cost 167 168 however rozendal et al presumed up to 47 of capital costs of bess related to the price of cathode materials 169 abourached et al also dedicated 84 5 of the capital cost to the electrodes for a single chamber laboratory size mfc 168 it is clear that catalyst and current collector which is made of metal materials invariably cause extra cost besides the electrode the high configuration cost is attributed to the overpriced separator material the result of ge and he demonstrated that the membrane and electrodes accounted for more than 60 and 19 of material cost for a dual chamber mfc respectively 170 if the technology is to be commercially viable all changes in the design of the electrode or the reactor structure described above must be aligned with the low cost goal hence researchers have made strides to reduce the system s overall expenses while maintaining the same outputs of electricity ceramic and different fibers as a low cost and scalable iem highly efficient and less expensive electrode nanomaterials and catalyzed biocathodes can considerably increase reaction effectiveness at lower operating costs 171 ghasemi et al acknowledged sulfonated polyether ketone speek as a great substitute for nafion membranes results of cost estimation revealed that although mfc with speek produced lower power than nafion 117 speek 595 w is about twice as cost efficient as nafion 117 1134 w 172 similarly yousefi et al compared the cost of ceramic membranes 2 5 3 5 m2 with nafion 117 2300 m2 173 in the matter of revenue it is said that an mfc could return about 0 0005 kg cod assuming a net energy recovery rate of 0 004 kwh kg cod and based on an average electricity price of 0 12 kwh 29 it should be considered whether improving power output or applying the least expensive electrode materials is a cost attractive approach stoll et al reported that an overall income of 0 08 m3 for power generation is not economical according to the average cost of electricity in the u s 0 12 kwh supposing an mfc reactor with about 2 m3 volume the generated power from hydrocarbons degradation is below 30 w m3 and thus the revenue of the system is very low furthermore while applying inexpensive anode materials decreases power generation the cost of hydrocarbon elimination in an mfc will be significantly reduced so reducing expenses is more economical 174 in recent decades several pilot scale studies of the stacked mfcs have been conducted and tried to optimize the technical performance related to pollutant removal coulombic efficiency power output and hrt 53 175 overall it has been said that the capital cost of the mfc system is 30 times higher on average in comparison with the traditional activated sludge process 133 it is estimated at 6064 3300 and 36 000 for 96 tubular modules 18 stacked and 50 modules respectively 170 176 177 jadhav et al reported a capital cost of 4386 for electrode material and toilet assembly construction to treat 1 5 m3 capacity of septage wastewater and generate electricity 169 however considering the savings related to water consumption reuse of treated water and generation of electricity revealed a payback period of 10 years for this system 12 future outlook and conclusion former studies of mfcs for the degradation of hydrocarbons from polluted environments can be applied as references for the real usage of this technology previous successful met cases demonstrated that a single chamber reactor with modified carbon based electrode materials has great potential in the remediation of recalcitrant compounds the data derived from laboratory and in situ tests reported more than 97 hydrocarbon elimination in 60 days from a polluted sewage treatment plant in marine sediments 86 removal efficiency was declared after four weeks in the same way mfcs achieved about 90 efficiency in hydrocarbon contaminated soils in 120 days laboratory scale mfc successfully provoked anaerobic microbial activity and improved degradation efficiency in comparison with open circuit mfc in environmentally benign conditions microbial bes has also enhanced the function of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria by increasing the adsorption of pollutants on the surface of the electrodes and raising the microbial community proteobacteria are a common kind of bacteria that affect both power generation and activity of the microbial community in polluted soil scalability requires to be backed by cost effectiveness chemical stability against material deterioration and biofouling and excellent long term performance to accomplish commercialization of the technology studies have mainly focused on continuous flow mfcs in three categories including large size units stackable individual cells and or multi anode cathode systems common configurations embrace both single and dual chamber reactors and the majority of studies agree that stack modules potentially perform better than other configurations additionally small scale and package wastewater treatment plants are likely the most suitable options to initially install full scale units one should take into account that operational factors e g feeding substrate temperature hydraulic retention time and organic loading rate as well as specific design and materials can change the optimal large scale application for instance the stacked assembly may hold an optimum number of units in one stack beyond that there is not a significant improvement further some aspects should be noticed to scale up the optimal cascade systems continuous flow mode in mfcs may overcome the development of harmful byproducts prevent the reduction of electricity generation over time and enable high productivity per unit volume with less labor altogether it is more practical than batch culture systems generally the selection of overall setup is a trade off between a cost effective design and enhanced efficiency in terms of removal and power generation however the real scale up application of this method is confronted with many challenges that need to be addressed thereby more attention should be paid to the following cases to surmount shortcomings i in terms of system cost it must be considered that the main expense is related to reactor electrodes and its income is covered by the energy and power production hence managing a subset of the reactor cathode anode redox mediator and membrane can provide a great chance for wide scale use of mfc moreover in order to attain economic justification we propose to concentrate on reducing capital expenses instead of increasing the income of power generation 174 ii arrangement and conductivity amendment of electrode materials can promote effective areas of remediation utilizing low cost and great performance electrodes and redox mediators ensures the real use of mfcs iii microorganisms play a crucial role in the enhancement of hydrocarbon degradation when functional microbes are applied at the appropriate temperature resulting biofilms guarantee their profitable lifetime hence these stable bacteria are more practical and economical than chemical catalysts 38 145 iv synergic systems by combining mfcs with other technologies particularly as a pretreatment are a priority for future research it would inhibit the transfer of complex compositions to the cell and shorten the execution time of pollutant elimination depending on the purpose one may attain high effluent quality or more commercial value from mfc based synergic modes v membranes should minimize or stop the transport of oxygen into the anode because of the anaerobic process of an anodic cell this requirement would be difficult to control as to when the membrane gets wet water through the membrane structure would diffuse oxygen imposing a differential pressure e g a small flow of liquid from the anode to the cathode can prevent oxygen transfer 78 vi external energy needed to launch the circuit of mfc is one of the main challenges in system scale up energy loss can be improved by designing integrated highly efficient circuits and also by collecting electrical energy produced from the system 143 in summary this technology same as other prosperous methods needs to be further investigated to realize fundamentals and functional barriers in the development of the process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
8751,bioelectrochemical systems bess are considered as the potential approaches to remediate the environments contaminated by hydrocarbons this review addresses the application of bess particularly microbial fuel cells mfcs in degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons including btexs from soil water wastewater and sediments details on reactor design and critical issues are discussed aspects on electrodes redox mediators and membranes are evaluated including economic feasibility the microbial community is considered in detail it can be concluded that comparing to classic configurations single chamber air cathode reactors are more cost effective secondly systems based on small scale units are recommended for future developments graphical abstract image 1 keywords petroleum hydrocarbons microbial fuel cell biochemical engineering sustainability clean energy 1 introduction petroleum hydrocarbons phs is the name given to a wide range of chemical compounds found in crude oil diesel and gasoline as their primary constituents phs can be divided into 4 groups i aliphatics such as alkanes alkenes and alkynes ii cycloaliphatics such as cycloalkanes iii aromatics such as monoaromatics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and iv other components such as asphaltenes waxes tar and resins as shown in table 1 1 phs are identified as carcinogenic compounds 2 the physicochemical properties of these recalcitrant compounds make them extremely portable in the environment ubiquitous in air soil and water bodies due to their certain characteristics such as lipophilicity and electrochemical stability phs tend to bioaccumulate in organic tissues causing harmful and chronic effects 3 4 there are many sources of these hardly biodegradable substances in the environment the major one is associated with spills and emissions including releases of petroleum products such as diesel fuel gasoline and lubricants among others 5 furthermore anthropogenic practices such as municipal and industrial runoffs coal mining transportation storage and onshore and offshore petroleum industry operations induce phs pollution 6 the us environmental protection agency usepa has categorized these phs as priority pollutants of natural resources 7 therefore any contamination from phs turns into a burning issue both for direct such as inhalation of their vapors and indirect such as the presence of these compounds in water bodies contact 5 till now different methods have been applied for hydrocarbon remediation such as biodegradation membrane processes electrocoagulation adsorption and advanced oxidation processes aops 8 12 however each of these methods suffers from some disadvantages for example biodegradation is a significantly slow process that requires long reaction times even lasting for days thus exceedingly large treatment facilities are needed membranes encounter fouling problems in full scale operations and high energy requirements adsorption on activated carbon a phase change technique is complex and expensive since the saturated activated carbon demands interval regeneration and sometimes the method suffers from the interference of other pollutants similarly aops are costly and complicated to install and operate they are predominantly adequate for low pollution medium electrocoagulation produces large quantities of sludge insecure and unrecoverable operating costs and high capital on industrial level scaling up have made electrocoagulation a non appropriate approach 8 13 in the past decade bioelectrochemical systems bess have shown promising niches compared with the aforementioned techniques the bes refers to employing microbial electrochemical technologies met in which microorganisms in the form of catalysts decompose organic compounds and generate electrons the electrons can produce electricity and other value added compounds 14 several applications such as microbial fuel cell mfc microbial electrolysis cell mec microbial desalination cell mdc and microbial electrosynthesis cell mes come under the bess unlike many conventional methods bes has rather mild and simple operating conditions it has successfully dealt with a wide variety of stubborn pollutants ranging from highly contaminated wastewater to polluted soil and sediment moreover precious and exhaustible electrodes as well as expensive chemicals are rarely used in bes thereby proposing an inexpensive and reliable method without any negative impact on the environment 15 bes has also the advantage of integration feasibility with other technologies for example bes can be coupled with aops constructed wetlands membranes adsorption electrochemical cells etc 16 20 in addition the electrochemical setup of bes superbly controls the released electrons from microbial metabolism 21 mfc is a system that sustainably produces energy from biodegradable compounds and simultaneously treats contaminated media such as soil sediments or wastewater generally it consists of two chambers an anodic and a cathodic and an ion exchange membrane iem separating the chambers on the surface of anode the substrate organic matter or biomass is being consumed and oxidized by microorganisms thereby producing electrons and protons electrons via an external electrical circuit and protons through the membrane are transferred from the anodic compartment to the cathodic one where the reduction of an oxidant usually oxygen takes place chemical reactions with the aid of protons and electrons occur on the cathode surface and finally form stable reduction products in a system organics follow equations 1 3 22 at anode 1 nch 2 o nh 2 o nco 2 4 ne 4 nh at cathode 2 no 2 4 ne 4 nh 2 nh 2 o 3 no 2 2 ne 2 nh nh 2 o 2 in a bes microbial or biotic degradation is the main mechanism to remediate a contaminated environment anode functions as an electron acceptor and promotes oxidation reactions complex organic compounds such as pahs are initially broken down into smaller molecules via degrading bacteria e g hydrocarbon degradation bacteria hdb and then the intermediates are degraded further via exoelectrogenic bacteria eb e g proteobacteria at the surface of anode generated electrons are subsequently released to the anode directly or through mediators 23 the presence of eb not only hampers the accumulation of mid products but also progresses the efficiency of extracellular electron transfer to complete the biodegradation process in this framework wang et al 24 discerned an increased number of hdb by nearly two orders of magnitude 373 56 103 colony forming unit per gram of soil cfu g soil close to the anode in the soil mfc than that in the open circuit control 8 2 103 cfu g soil indicating strong evidence for the biostimulation of hdb and synergy between hdb and eb to degrade petroleum pollutants moreover according to kumar et al 25 degradation of volatile organic compounds such as benzene ethylbenzene toluene and xylene in the mfc occurs through three steps i mass transfer of compounds from gaseous phase to liquid phase ii compounds diffusion into the biofilm and iii their degradation by microbes present in the biofilm in fact the primary difference between this system and conventional biotechnology comes from dissimilar exploitation of electron acceptors viz electrode and oxygen respectively in mfc the attached biofilm on the electrode enables fast and in situ electron transfer from the microorganisms to the electrode as a result it facilitates biodegradation and harnesses the existing chemical energy of the organic load 26 fig 1 represents the structural design working principle and mechanism of a microbial fuel cell it should be noted that mfcs are of interest since they do not require an external power supply while treating organic wastes 15 27 mfcs release 50 90 less sludge than that in other bioprocesses hence they reduce the ultimate cost of sludge disposal furthermore they benefit from simple structure operational stability little impact on the microbes and negligible impact on the environment in addition microorganisms in mfcs are rather resistant to toxicity and ph inconsistency compared with other methods mfcs have become an efficient and eco friendly candidate for removing phs 28 several excellent review articles have been published about the application of bess 29 33 yet to the best of our knowledge there is a limited discussion to specially refer to the mfcs applied for phs treatment a field of great potential and value in this perspective this review attempts to compile contemporary information of bes application for degradation of phs and is dedicated to the most practical type of bes the mfcs it includes i design of mfcs ii electrodes iii redox mediators iv membranes v microbial community vi co substrate vii energy consumption and electricity generation viii optimal process parameters ix mfc applications for the phs removal x cost analysis and xi future outlook and conclusion understanding these issues is of critical importance to stimulate more thinking and exploration regarding future promotion in practical applications 2 design of microbial fuel cells mfcs numerous mfc reactor configurations have been developed to degrade hydrocarbons and acquire an acceptable quality of the effluent from a cost effective situation 34 the most common configuration for degradation of hydrocarbons is a two compartment mfc which includes h type fig 2 a cubic fig 2b tubular fig 2c or u type mfc fig 2d generally these systems consist of a cathodic and an anodic chamber separated by a membrane 35 36 researchers have studied these systems at laboratory scale to treat polluted hydrocarbon media 24 37 38 however the complicated structure and extra cost of these reactors hinder the system from being scaled up and used in real case scenarios with the purpose of developing bes mfc sustainably several column type single chamber air cathode reactors were constructed to remove hydrocarbons from the soil wastewater marine sediments as well as anaerobic sludge stemming from petroleum wastewater 39 in soil and sediment function the anode was embedded in the soil or sediment while the cathode was always suspended in the overlying aqueous part 40 41 to improve the efficiency of the mfcs in terms of their phs removal capabilities a multianode system has been developed 42 li et al 42 have designed a soil sediment mfc smfc with three parallel anode layers and activated carbon ac air cathode at the bottom it was observed that the multianode mfc has higher efficiency of phs removal than a single anode system the larger the activated surface area of this system the easier the transmission of h and e in the process liu et al 43 deployed multiple compacted carbon cloth roll anodes in the ocean water and sediment fig 3 a this system with three electron collectors maintained a favorable performance of the single anode but also promoted the effective surface area per sediment footprint and preserved high power density in an associated study prakash et al 44 constructed three discrete reactors in different configurations by installing anode in single horizontal and vertical arrangements fig 3b they observed that the multi vertical electrode system has higher performance and lower internal resistance than the horizontal one the single chamber systems take advantage of the direct transfer of oxygen from the air to the cathode and thus do not impair the anaerobic environment of the process in the anaerobic trend anode microbial communities are not affected by the reductive effect of oxygen thereby enhancing the microbial operation however in a sleeve type single column reactor fig 4 a where cathodic biofilms act as a separator the biofilm overgrowth at the cathode would likely diminish the electron transfer and inhibit the degradation process furthermore hydrocarbon compounds which are required to be reduced by the cathode are simultaneously influenced by the anode that induces disruption in the system performance hollow type single chambers fig 4b solved this issue and provided an oxygen source for the cathode at the same time hence it would be an acceptable option for an efficient degradation 46 although the lab scale mfcs successfully treated phs from polluted media the produced current in comparison to the chemical energy contained in the wastewater is limited hence the coulombic efficiency obtained through laboratory mfc is poor applying the approach of using a plurality of units on the other hand has demonstrated optimal power output a number of significant issues such as the mfc size optimized anode surface the hydraulic retention time hrt cascade length and series or parallel connections should be considered to attain the highest economically feasible power output 48 in general desirable surface area to volume sa v ratios in small units maintain diffusion distances near the electrodes and facilitate the achievement of electrical power from organic substances small scale mfc also has more capability for wastewater treatment due to the fact that higher power brings about faster metabolic rates and organic transformation for a determined anode surface area and length the power density increases in accordance with the higher sa v ratio in a comparison of cascade mfcs in a steady diameter tube walter et al 49 revealed that increasing lengths from 2 fold to 8 fold result in equal power density and raise absolute power in the stacking arrangement of several small reactors allometric scaling the outlet of one unit is the following unit s inlet power generation is expected to decline more quickly at final units in terms of cascade length or number of mfcs inside a cascade the feedstock units that have already been treated provide less power output in this regard researchers demonstrated that providing a uniform substrate utilization along with the cells can address this issue 48 50 the uniformity conditions in the reactor are controlled by supplying external mixing preserving equal flow profile and increasing the flow rate that leads to the decrease of hrt 51 based on the desired purpose mfcs can be connected either in series or parallel to increase the total voltage or current respectively as predicted setting the mfcs connected electrically demonstrated lower current and greater operating voltage hence while cascade structure makes it possible to set a number of extended mfcs in parallel or series to raise current or voltage it hardly has an effect on power density 52 liu et al 53 evaluated the performance of benzene degradation from groundwater using vertically three air cathodes in both series connection and parallel connection tubular stack mfc the system reduced benzene degradation time by half compared to a single tubular cell with the same anode capacity while series connection revealed the highest open circuit voltage and had showed efficient pollutant degradation parallel mode demonstrated increased power density and thus consumed less energy 53 3 electrodes for hydrocarbon degradation the performance of mfcs is strongly influenced by the selection of anode and cathode materials in addition to the effectiveness of the catalyst an appropriate electrode material generally possess i high electrical conductivity to accelerate the electron transfer and ii a large surface area to enhance the sorption effect as the effective surface area of the biological electrode increases the mass transfer capacity of the system and thus the microbial activity increase 54 furthermore electrode materials have an impact on the ultimate products obtained during the degradation process hence the selection of environmentally friendly electrodes makes them more useful for large scale applications properties of the anode affect not only the activity rate of microbial adhesion but also the rate of electron transmission in the cell among various anode materials that have been proposed for constructing efficienct mfcs carbonaceous materials are superb due to their beneficial properties such as good biocompatibility chemical stability and conductivity carbon based materials consist of carbon cloth cc carbon felt cf carbon paper cp carbon brush cb granule graphite gg graphite plate graphite sheet and graphite rod the deployment of carbon materials as electrodes has revealed a satisfactory degradation of total petroleum hydrocarbons tphs from contaminated sites 36 55 56 venkidusamy et al 57 demonstrated that the carbon anode cathode presents 83 4 elimination of diesel with power generation of 90 81 mw m2 in a single cell mfc the results of adelaja et al 58 also accounted for more than 90 of phs degradation for both in situ and ex situ mfc utilization with cf electrodes the obtained results confirmed that this system is an advantageous over other complicated and expensive technologies even in anoxic environments under harsh conditions regarding graphite material for the anode graphite felt gf obtained more outstanding performance than other types this outstanding performance of gf anode was attributed to its larger surface area and greater adsorption potential yu et al 59 constructed soil sediment mfc smfc in a plexiglass reactor equipped with alternative electrodes made of five different materials gf cc activated carbon fiber felt acff graphite paper and aluminum sheet but carbon veil was not tested the authors revealed that gf anode provided the best result of 59 14 tphs removal in petroleum polluted soil after 115 days of operation 59 this relatively higher removal tphs by gf anode was attributed to the larger surface area of gf which resulted in greater attachment of organics on the surface of anode greater mass transfer of substrate and less internal resistance the internal resistance owing to the cell components causes interference to the electron and proton transfer 60 moreover metals have been used to overcome the electron transfer barrier yan et al 41 constructed bioreactors in which anode was made up of two stainless steel cylinders 80 meshes with 1 mm thickness and cathode was prepared from a stainless steel cylinder 4 cm height and 9 6 cm diameter and obtained more than 90 degradation of phenanthrene and pyrene carbon veil electrodes have already been proved for maximized electricity production and benefits in large scale mfcs veil microchannels due to their high porosity facilitate nutrition transport via perfusion in addition carbon veil electrodes offer less internal resistance due to their consistent thread structure as compared to other carbon materials with inconsistent strands liu et al 61 evaluated several carbon based materials as working electrodes in a conventional three electrode half cell system containing 150 ml reaction solution graphite rod and ag agcl electrode were used as counter electrode and reference electrode respectively carbon veil revealed roughly 40 higher current density than graphite and carbon rods this higher current density of carbon veil electrode was attributed to the formation of microbial biofilms on it the authors evaluated bet surface area of the materials and found that the real surface area of carbon fiber veil and carbon paper electrodes was about 10 times greater than other tested electrodes graphite rod and carbon rod also showed higher bet surface area than expected the bet surface area measurement may only reflect the fine interior pores of the materials which are not available to the microbe as a result the values are unreliable and material structure properties played a more important role using electron microscopy images the authors demonstrated that despite the thick and dense biofilms on graphite rod carbon fiber veil creates a porous structure which colonizes the biofilm on carbon fibers having more than 10 μm thickness the porous structure may also offer improved substrate access thereby achieving higher current density 61 apart from the basic materials described above both cathode and anode structures can be modified to increase the removal efficiency catalysts have been used in several works to accelerate the reduction rate liang et al 60 used porous and conductive gf as the anode while the gf cathode was painted with pt catalyst 0 5 mg pt cm2 electrode modification by catalysts could compensate for the poor kinetics of oxygen reduction in the cathodic compartment which led to higher removal rate of benzo a pyrene from polluted soil 60 carbon materials can be amalgamated with metals such as mn2 3 62 63 in a relevant study nandy et al 62 compared mno2 coated anode with pristine carbon anode in an h type dual chamber system to investigate the degradation of hydrocarbons crude oil components they found that coated anode compared to pristine anode generated higher power density 47 mw m2 vs 38 mw m2 and showed higher alkane removal 36 vs 25 5 due to the better adhesion of microorganisms on the coated anode surface 62 nevertheless use of pt loading was not an economical manner the integration of nanocomposites such as nanotube polyaniline on anodic carbon was discovered as a promising material in mfcs 64 65 in this regard liang et al modified the gf anode applying three kinds of carbon nanomaterials graphene graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes 60 the economic modification enormously enhanced the extracellular electron transfer rate contaminant removal and power output because of high conductivity high surface area increased biomass content and excellent electrochemical characteristics of nanomaterials 66 potentiality of the modified electrodes due to their better conductivities biocompatibilities and optimal reasonable costs make this technology suitable for large scale operations 67 4 redox mediators the existence of both endogenous self production and exogenous externally supplied mediators accelerate mobile electrons transfer between microbes and electron acceptors the redox mediators were applied in several mfcs to speed up the microbial activity of the system however external mediators are not commonly used in wastewater treatment due to the complicated and costly separation procedure of mediators from treated solution 68 69 recently exoelectrogens electricity generating microbes which are able to transfer intracellular electrons without external assistance to terminal electron acceptors have been identified as a driving force for electron transmission via electroactive molecules and membranes similarly ferricyanide fecn could also be used as a soluble and stable redox mediator in mfcs in a related study neutral red nr and fecn have been used as redox mediators for toluene degradation in a waste remediation cell 70 the desirable characteristics of effective mediators have been reviewed in detail by evelyn et al 71 these desirable characteristics of mediators include the capability to form redox couples ability to pass the membrane stability in both oxidized and reduced form a nontoxic character in respect to biological species low cost non biodegradability and sufficient capacity for electron acceptor role 70 72 an appropriate range of added mediators enables microorganisms to use electrical power for growth as well as metabolite generation the commonly used redox mediators are compiled in table 2 adelaja et al 38 investigated the impact of introducing 30 μm of riboflavin into the anolyte medium as a redox mediator the riboflavin has significantly increased the power generation and coulombic efficiencies in comparison to mediator free mfc the maximum power density and coulombic efficiency were increased by 30 times and 3 times respectively when riboflavin was added to anolyte medium nature derived quinone redox mediators ndqrm natural products have proved significant potential in the electron exchange and formation of biofilms biochar a representative of ndqrm has been tested for tphs removal it was found that biochar has increased the removal rate of tphs by 17 in comparison to non biochar smfc 76 77 under this operation the physicochemical properties of biochar and the formation of different microbial communities of bacteria established an appropriate environment for soil remediation several mediators such as fecn and nr have been reported to be toxic to the enzymes and thus hinder cell growth 75 therefore favorable temperature and control ph should be used to achieve efficient degradation of target pollutants while using 500 μm fecn and 200 μm nr as redox mediators in mfc fed with 11 09 mg l toluene the output voltage was increased from 53 5 mv to 88 2 mv and 109 2 mv respectively i e an increase of 39 and 51 was observed 75 however due to the interference of nr and fecn in cellular respiration the degradation time of toluene was 1 56 2 15 times and 2 1 times lengthier for the fecn and nr containing mfc respectively as compared to unmediated mfc 75 in summary due to the adverse effects of redox mediators and the possibility of washing away soluble redox mediators in high amount they are not suitable for industrial applications 5 membranes in a mfc system generally a proton exchange membrane pem separates anodic and cathodic zones and is responsible for the diffusion of protons from the anode to the cathode mass transfer ohmic losses power generation and pollutant removal are greatly affected by the performance of membranes as they can inhibit electrode contact and merging of both compartments solutions in case of lack of membrane the solution from the anode chamber could move to the cathode side it could cause serious biofouling on the cathode surface thereby deteriorating system s performance on the other side o2 from the cathode chamber could reach the anaerobic anode chamber causing inhibition of the anaerobic fermentation process at the anode durability low cost and resistance to fouling are the most significant requirements for a suitable membrane lower amount of fuel crossover oxygen diffusion and ionic resistance are always favorable parameters for attaining higher power generation 78 mostly nafion membranes are used in mfcs because of their adequate ion exchange capacity durability and high proton conductivity nafion is a perfluorosulfonic acid membrane composed of hydrophobic fluorocarbon backbone cf2 cf2 to which hydrophilic sulfonate groups so3 are linked they have been introduced in different thicknesses thin membranes encounter higher reactant crossover e g substrate crossover substrate loss and oxygen leakage and lower mechanical strength although thick membranes surmount these problems they have high resistance and thus low current density however nafions experience some problems they are not suitable under neutral ph conditions and preferentially transport cation species such as k na nh4 ca2 and mg2 rather than h which are typically 105 times higher than protons in concentration in wastewater 79 this cationic species transport process leads to increase in ph of the cathodic compartment salt precipitation on cathode and therefore diminishes the catalytic performance of the cathode several studies have explored the use of alternative membranes such as anion exchange membrane aem cation exchange membrane cem and bipolar membrane bpm fig 5 some of these materials are generally cheaper than nafion but are still quite expensive difficult to handle and sometimes produce lower power generation owing to high internal resistance the difference between aem and cem is in positively charged and negatively charged functional groups which are attached to the membrane polymeric backbone and accomplish the selective transfer of anions or cations respectively cem which allows the transfer of cations from one chamber to the other is made of weak or strong acids in a polymeric sheet aem is selectively permeable to anions and likewise made from weak or strong bases structure of the sheets is inversely correlated with the transferred ion type for example negative charges in the case of cem form a matrix of covalent linkage to a polymer and thus exclude anions in the same way aem carries positively charged fixed groups and permits the passage of anions only the basic polymer matrix and the fixed ionic charges are the two main parameters that define the characteristics of ion exchange membrane chemical mechanical and thermal stability of the membrane are determined by the basic polymer matrix wheras the type and concentration of the fixed ionic group in the polymer matrix specify the electric qualities and selectivity of the membrane carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid groups are weak and strong acids respectively which are frequently used for cems preparation in the case of aems quaternary ammonium qa is used as a strong basic group tertiary secondary and primary amines as well as phosphonium and sulfonium groups form less strongly functional bases despite better buffering less corrosive environment lower resistance and restricted ph drop aems are rarely used in mfcs due to their poorer chemical stability and susceptibility to substrate losses especially in alkaline conditions compared to cems bpm combines both anion exchange and cation exchange layers in a laminated structure and dissociates water molecules to h and oh afterward protons through cem and hydroxide ions through aem transfer to cathode and anode respectively 15 27 this membrane can resolve ph or ionic imbalance which usually takes place between the cells in mfcs even though bpm holds a relatively high polarization resistance it offers a technology for recovery of acids and bases from salt solutions bpms are specially developed for saltwater treatment and desalination due to their easy fabrication high conductivity low density and chemical stability stainless steel and graphite have been widely employed for this type of bipolar plate membranes 78 80 looking for an affordable and natural alternative to commercial membranes porous ceramic materials have gained great interest in recent years earthenware terracotta and clayware membranes facilitate practical application by dropping the cost of the overall system interestingly the internal structure in ceramic membranes can be customized by changing both the raw materials and firing cycles in fact modification in the composition of raw materials including alumina zirconia mullite pyrophyllite and other oxides as well as variation in the kilning method such as curing time and temperature yield comparable or even better performance to those of the polymeric separators 81 this modification in the composition of raw materials and carefully controlling the kilning process tunes the ceramic properties such as porosity permeability internal resistance water absorption and cationic transfer selectivity which finally affect the flux of ions and solvent through it 82 as an important feature the porous material can be made in a uniform structure which could show resistant to chemical and microbiological degradation aside from exclusive chemical mechanical and thermal stabilities ceramics are operative for long time processes and even reusable after cleansing with harsh agents 83 however despite their multiple benefits employing ceramic membranes is accompanied by low ion conductivity which could fade its privileges in addition oxygen diffusion through the membrane could negatively affect anodic respiration where oxygen incorrectly acts as the terminal electron acceptor 84 this may lead to a future development trend to find novel materials and or new surface modification techniques accordingly published articles on the usage of ceramic membranes in phs treatment are still limited it has to be taken into account that deformation and biofilm development on the membrane is almost an inevitable process during long term operations chemical cleansing agents may help the removal of these formed biofilms from the surface or inside the membrane resistance of membrane structure to the agents is a required feature to recover conductivity ion exchange capacity and performance loss 78 however the perfect type and material of a separator have not been found yet each one has its own advantages and constraints considering the operating conditions a suitable membrane should be selected for practical applications 79 it is noteworthy that smfcs do not usually need cem or pem which noticeably decrease the construction overall cost of the systems 85 zhou et al 86 however exploited a cem in their dual chamber mfc design for hydrocarbon contaminated soil to produce electric current morris and jin 87 did the same with a nafion perfluorinated resin in a sediment based mfc in water and wastewater phs treatment adelaja et al 88 presented a robust design of the system with a cem other researchers employed pem 89 cem 88 and nafion proton exchange membranes 90 93 morris and jin 94 constructed vinyl tube proton bridges having various lengths and diameters to link anode and cathode compartments in two cell mfc composed of potassium chloride copper sulfate and ultrapure agar mixed in deionized water which was boiled and then solidified in tubes they concluded that the largest diameter 1 9 cm and the shortest length 0 7 m provided highest cell potential 6 microbial community the removal efficiency of hydrocarbons in a mfc depends on two factors adsorption and microbial degradation the activity of microorganisms has a significant impact on the degradation rate of recalcitrant compounds biache et al 95 found that the type of microbial communities was the major factor for the polycyclic aromatic compound pac degradation in soil and slurry it should be pointed out that the biofilms which grow on the anode surface contain degradative and fermentative microorganisms to begin the degradation process organic pollutants such as phenolic compounds toluene or benzoic acid are subjected to anaerobic reactions resulting in the formation of organic acids then electroactive microorganisms breakdown the acids into carbon dioxide and electrons 75 the biodegradability potential of pahs depends on their molecular weight the reports indicated that the microorganisms found it has been reported that low molecular weight lmw compounds are more appropriate as a sole source of carbon for microorganisms than high molecular weight hmw compounds as result lmw compounds were found to be mineralized degraded faster than hmw compounds 39 95 the performance of mfcs is significantly influenced by the interactions of different microbial species 96 both synergistic and antagonistic interactions are possible among different microbial species leading to the enhancement and reduction respectively of the power density output and removal rate of hydrocarbons in this aspect guo et al 96 reported that the best mfc performance in terms of electricity generation and oil removal rate was observed for the combined application of deinococcus sp and paenibacillus sp due to their synergistic interaction for this mfc the power density output and the oil removal rate were calculated to be 102 93 mw m3 and 85 56 respectively deinococcus sp converted phs to simple fatty acids and esters these simple fatty acids and esters were further degraded by paenibacillus sp thereby both species worked in cooperation and thus improved the electricity generation and wastewater treatment performances similarly zhou et al 39 and qin et al 97 enhanced the removal rate of pahs including benzo a pyrene with the addition of lmw naphthalene and phenanthrene respectively on contrary the antagonistic effect s of microbial strains can adversely affect the process for example guo et al 96 observed that the microbacterium sp interaction with paenibacillus sp and deinococcus sp limited the microbial electron transfer to the anode surface as a result the internal resistance was increased and the system operation output was decreased yu et al 59 and liang et al 60 studied the richness abundance of a microbial community at the phylum and genus levels the possible paramount phylum in pah polluted soils was found to be proteobacteria 59 moreover the process of benzo a pyrene degradation was promoted by the existence of gammaproteobacteria and clostridia which had significant abundance in the graphite felt anode 60 exoelectrogen microorganisms or anode respiring bacteria which transfer electrons to extracellular acceptors can apply organic and inorganic substances as carbon sources and inoculate for the degradation and fermentation of products in the polluted hydrocarbon sites in parallel zhou et al 86 directly adopted phs contaminated soil to enrich exoelectrogenic bacteria in the mfc system meanwhile they successfully identified and isolated two species of exoelectrogenic strains belonging to the geobacter sp and ochrobactrum sp 86 wang et al 24 venkidusamy et al 57 zhou et al 86 and zafar et al 98 found the geobacter flavobacterium rhodopseudomonas ochrobactrum and stenotrophomonas as major exoelectrogens in the anode of mfcs microbial immobilization is a reusable technology that encapsulates microorganisms in a fixed area to control microbial activity and community precisely confinement of cells and enzymes inside or on the appropriate carrier plays a significant role in the performance of microbial immobilization 99 100 an immobilized nontoxic carrier not only increases the attachment area with degrading bacteria but also provides a harmless environment for the growth of exogenous bacteria the carriers that are used for the microbial immobilization process are categorized into natural organic and inorganic materials 101 annie et al 102 indicated that the bio carrier coconut coir pith is regarded as a suitable amendment for the remediation of crude oil in polluted soil partovinia et al 103 modified polyvinyl alcohol and alginate with halloysite nanotubes hnts to improve the surface area and provide a harmless physical method resulting in a reliable and low cost matrix for cell stabilization researchers suggested that usage of immobilized bacteria increased acclimatization of the bacteria with the environment and reduced lag phases and reaction time in this regard the start up time which is the main issue of mfcs could be resolved and enable this technology to achieve the highest removal rate 104 105 it is critical to explore the mechanisms of anodic biofilm communities develop a better way to facilitate the electrochemical activities of the anodic microorganisms and improve the reactor performance it has been reported that the electrical power output is directly related to the biofilm population number of adherent cells in a steady state anodic biofilm system however the cell population quantity is not the only controlling factor for power output it is axiomatic that there would be no power generation if all cells were dead with zero metabolic rate hence the metabolic rate of the cells plays a more critical role in power output 106 in a steady state continuous flow the metabolic rate is proportional to the growth rate of the cells which in turn is related to the electrons source particularly carbon energy substrate microorganisms act as biocatalysts that influence power output by overcoming total internal resistance degrading the feed and transporting electrons to the anode 107 108 hou et al 108 utilized electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and cyclic voltammetry cv to investigate the anodic biofilm growth effect on power generation the experiments were conducted on the abiotic and open circuit conditions for 30 days the authors found that the growth of biofilm greatly enhanced the power production through increasing the rate of electrochemical reactions via enhancing the extracellular electron transfer from microorganism to anode biofilm growth has also reduced the anodic polarization impedance and activation losses the biofilm structure inside an mfc relies on numerous factors resulting in either a thick diffusion limiting or thin perfusion limiting structure the thick biofilm matrix does not contain the impervious electrode substratum so the formation of a thick biofilm leads to matrix heterogeneity under such conditions there is very low nutrients diffusion rate leading to the starvation of the inner cells which will then fight for their survival rather than growth on contrary a thin perfusable biofilm made up of permanently adherent cells have access to flowing nutrients as a result there is greater chances for cells to mutate however these mutant progeny will have minimal benefit in microbial cells since they are washed away by shear stress or natural cycles and are unable to aggregate 106 regarding the microbial community s abundance the simpson index measures the community diversity while the shannon index represents both evenness and richness of the community thus the great shannon or low simpson index illustrates the less microbial diversity yu et al 59 categorized the microbial communities of different anode materials into two groups i less richness and higher evenness including aluminum sheet as and graphite plate gp and ii higher richness and less evenness containing graphite felt gf activated carbon fibre felt acff and carbon cloth cc anode materials 59 jiang et al 109 compared the microbial community of the anode biofilms in the dual chamber and single chamber mfcs the target dna extracted from the microbes on the anode carbon brushes was analyzed using the pyrosequencing technique the total estimated number of operational taxonomic units otu were 1117 and 843 for single and dual chamber mfc respectively the results indicated that the single mfc was richer with a higher shannon index 3 94 than dual chamber mfc 3 65 on the other hand the simpson index was greater in dual chamber 0 0844 than single mfc 0 0476 representing better and more even distribution of microbes different electron acceptors which impacted the extracellular electron transfer speed were apparently the source of the difference in the microbial community of the anode biofilm hence there is a need to screen and monitor the microbial biofilm to determine the best microbial strains for specific wastewater considering the operating reliability and reduced cost of single mfc it has a brighter future in real world applications 109 7 co substrate co metabolism is regarded as one of the efficienct methods to enhance the degradation rate of refractory compounds in mfcs co substrate has the potential to contribute to the proliferation of bacteria and induction of oxidizing enzymes providing biodegradable carbon sources indeed the addition of a co substrate establishes beneficial synergisms in the digestive media and provides deficient nutrients by generating more electrons thus improving biogas production 110 using biodegradable organic compounds as co substrates led to the increase in bacterial metabolism and accelerated the degradation procedure it has been shown that the use of labaneh whey lw wastewater as a co substrate due to its high organic and biodegradable contents boosted the electrons generated in the dual chambered mfc contained petroleum refinery wastewater the extra organic matters provided by lw along with greater amounts of total dissolved solids tds increased electron transfer in the anode chamber and thus have achieved enhanced power generation and higher substrate degradation 110 111 the previous studies revealed that the use of acetate as a co substrate in a single chamber mfc based on microbial communities of pseudomonas geobacter and shewanella resulted in electricity generation and phenol removal simultaneously xy in this regard the promising ability of methanol and acetate as co substrates in anaerobic biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in marine sediments was confirmed 112 the results demonstrated that various co substrates led to distinct structures of the microbial community which subsequently impacted the tph degradation the impact of acetate on the degradation of tph was more promising than that of methanol zhang and lo indicated above 95 phenol degradation within 60 h in an mfc with an aqueous air cathode using glucose as co substrate that incited the growth of whole populations of bacteria in the anode chamber in addition glucose phenol mixture minimized potential phenol toxicity during shock load or temperature fluctuations 112 8 energy consumption and electricity generation in an mfc system the catalytic activity of microbes converts organic matters chemical energy present in c c bonds into electricity 113 from this perspective mfcs are theoretically considered energy profitable because i they can be operated under ambient environmental conditions ii they directly produce electricity from substrate energy with a high conversion efficiency and iii they produce less amount of sludge 113 it is estimated that the system consumes only about 0 024 kw or 0 076 kwh kg cod on average primarily for reactor feeding and mixing 29 on the other hand the activated sludge based aerobic process consumes about 0 3 kw or 0 6 kwh kg cod 29 in addition mfcs can be operated at low 15 c ambient 15 35 c and high 50 60 c temperature ranges without aeration 29 moreover mfcs produce low fossil related co2 because of their low energy consumption interestingly conversion of biogas e g h2 or ch4 into electricity results in a considerable energy loss more than 60 whereas mfcs could produce electricity directly from organic matter present in wastewater with a high energy conversion rate 29 the term exoelectrogens refers to microorganisms with the capability of transferring electrons from outside of the cell to a solid insoluble extracellular electron acceptor in mfcs only exoelectrogens are responsible for the electricity generation currently α β γ and δ proteobacteria e g geobacter sulfurreducens shewanella oneidensis escherichia coli geobacter metallireducens rhodopseudomonaspalustris are the most studied exoelectrogens 29 previous studies have enriched mfcs with a wide range of feedstocks electron donors and innovations to produce electricity such as palm oil mill effluent 1648 7 mw m3 and 1280 56 mw m3 from pretreated and untreated effluent respectively glucose 1499 mw m3 rice mill wastewater 656 10 mw m3 sewage 13 65 mw m3 potato chips processing waste water 612 5 mw m3 municipal wastewater 41 4 mw m3 young leachate 6817 4 mw m3 aged leachate 78 1 mw m3 cassava mill wastewater 18 2 w m3 brewery wastewater 24 1 w m3 fresh human urine 6 93 w m3 sewage sludge 8 5 w m3 and domestic wastewater 12 8 w m3 113 125 yet the amounts are too weak to be used except for some small devices or ingenious sensors 126 it is proposed that mfcs should have an output of at least 400 w m3 in order to compete with traditional anaerobic digestion as a substitute at an organic loading rate of 5 25 kg cod m3 day 127 and be able to produce 1 kw m3 to fulfill energy self sufficiency 128 abbasi et al 129 observed a positive correlation between chemical oxygen demand cod concentration and generated voltage possibly due to the increase in organic substrates and higher solution conductivity at low cod concentration anode restricted electricity generation due to kinetic limitations whereas at high cod concentration cathode demonstrated a more significant impact than the anode on electricity generation 113 mohanakrishna et al 130 measured 2150 mg l for cod value in petroleum refinery wastewater on the other hand the formation of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 during the cathodic reduction of oxygen decreases the attainable power of mfcs especially with carbon electrodes it will be better if h2o2 formation is avoid during mfc operation as it could deteriorate the reactor internally owing to its high oxidizing power 131 some researchers found that a larger current in smfcs accelerated the degradation rate this may be because of i the metabolism rate of anaerobic bacteria could be enhanced by the electrons generated by electrogenic bacteria ii the electric field which possibly affects certain enzymes in electrogenic bacteria to enhance the removal efficiency of organic compounds and iii the electric field influencing the permeability of cell membranes thus resulting in increased absorption of extracellular substances and thereby promoting the metabolism of microorganisms 28 higher generation of power density is subject to several important considerations including configuration development anode and cathode function modification with material biological factors and redox potential optimization of microbial colonization decrease in internal cell resistance and proper selection of the size number of units temperature retention time and fuel quality as an effective solution incorporating current collectors into electrodes necessarily increases electron transfer and power generation in mfcs 132 studies have reported maximum current power voltage in phs treatment in a variety of setups which is mentioned throughout the article solution conditions high internal resistance low degradability of substrate and slow biofilm kinetics mainly account for low power density 133 generally small reactors achieve high currents voltages for example decreasing the size of a fuel cell from liter or cubic meter scale to milliliter scale substantially increases the volumetric power density by 2 4 orders of magnitude 29 first inhomogeneity or unbalanced substrate distribution is evident in large sized mfcs which are identified by different hydraulic pressures and substrate concentrations in different cell sections it would suppress both the energy output and the system s efficiency additionally extending the volume of mfc increases the internal resistance hence innovative designs are introduced to optimize power output levels for mfc scale up in this context stacking cascading of small scale mfc units is being pursued reducing the size of consecutive downstream mfcs while avoiding supply recirculation within a cascade is one of the effective strategies for enhancing the power generation walter et al 49 employed two cascade stacks consisting of constant size units control cascade cc and variable size units with decreasing width test cascade tc with the same volumetric flow rate the results showed that a cascade comprising mfcs of tc optimizes the received power for a given volume of feed 400 h power monitoring of the mentioned units showed that the absolute power of the cc stack 5 75 0 08 mw was more than that of tc stack 3 50 0 05 mw however the power density of the cc stack 8 00 wm 3 was lower than that of tc stack 10 00 wm 3 i e a 25 increase for tc stack this 25 rise in the power density of tc was attributed to an increase in power density of each row in the tc stack however the power density in a cc stack dropped as every row moved through the cascade 49 9 optimal process parameters 9 1 ph in mfc systems the substrates are oxidized to release protons and electrons so they combine with oxygen to generate water in the cathodic section the reactor media such as soil sediment or wastewater might have an internal resistance that impedes the protons transfer resulting in a ph gradient from anode to the cathode same time determining appropriate ph values for the effective microbial activity of both degrading and electrogenic microorganisms is essential 134 the anodic ph affects both anodic and cathodic compartments since it directly controls the rate of the microorganisms transfer thereby the proton and electron concentration the optimal ph range has a great impact on the bioavailability of substrates and thus hydrocarbon elimination and electricity production 135 in this regard the ph spectrum for electricity generation is usually neutral maximizing electrogenic bacteria s operation for instance ph 6 80 is ideal for the geobacter sp moreover ph 6 7 and ph 7 are the most propitious limits for alkanes and pahs biodegradation respectively 39 136 hassan et al indicated that with the potential of electroactive dechlorinative bacteria such as b subtilis the optimized values for chlorophenols degradation was achieved at anode ph 7 5 and cathode ph 6 6 137 when ph is too low in the catholyte the propelling force for proton distribution through the membrane will be reduced resulting in protons accumulation in the anolyte it should be noted that due to sufficient release of protons in the moderate level of ph more current generation occurred and required current density diminished see table 3 briefly while the ph of the anode zone increased up to the optimal amounts the current density decreased and in reverse 134 variation between ph values of the anode and the cathode is a dominant factor affecting the activity of microorganisms and thus the internal resistance of the system to tackle this issue in systems with acid base differentiation a relatively acidic catholyte can be added to the cathode and similarly alkaline substrates can be added to the anode the results of monitoring the ph alteration during the process revealed that after a slight ph reduction at the beginning of the process and ultimate marginal ph increase in the anodic chamber was observed it might be derived from balanced ion transfer other than h and oh during the operation li et al proved that the slow transfer of anodic proton resulted in hydroxyl anions accumulation close to air cathode and ended up with a ph increase in the soil 138 9 2 temperature temperature is a significant parameter affecting microbial kinetics mass transfer capacity and oxygen reaction in the reactor 139 140 different mfc performances have been observed in relation to various starting up temperatures a decrease in current density was clearly detected with a reduction in operating temperature 141 according to related studies lower initial temperatures would slow or impede the system from being properly initiated lower operating temperature influenced the microbial communities which rely on increasing start up time and mfc efficiency a power production enhancement took place when the mfc was run at a higher temperature about 40 c and then it was adjusted to a lower one 142 143 results of temperature changes during the process in the anodic compartment are more noticeable than the cathodic one in the anode biofilm the temperature rise is correlated with the growth of microbial communities studies have shown that the cathodic biofilms are more stable even at low temperatures and are also capable of providing great redox activities involved in electron transmission this adaptation in low temperature is generally attributed to the high metabolic activity of cathodic microbial communities which are different from those that functioned at ambient temperature 144 specific ranges of temperature have been defined for the efficient operation of different microorganisms thus a suitable temperature range enhances system performance in terms of substrate degradation rate and electricity generation as demonstrated in many studies 35 40 c was recognized as an optimal temperature for hydrocarbon degradation and electricity generation 140 relatively high temperature facilitates biofilm formation electron transfer therefore current generation an investigation about the influence of temperature for phs degradation ranging from 20 to 50 c confirmed a doubled rate of degradation at 40 c in comparison with 20 c however an evident decrease in substrate consumption rate and performance was observed at 50 c see table 3 this decrease in high temperature resulted from the inactivation of some microbial communities 38 139 the results correlated to the distinct phases of microbial growth which determines the microorganisms growth rate temperature is also regarded as a major environmental factor that has an obvious impact on the archaeal distribution present in petroleum reservoirs and thus the hydrocarbon degradation in this regard liang et al 145 investigated the archaeal community of high temperature petroleum reservoirs and revealed that a wide variety of archaeal was active in high temperature environments in addition they posed that temperature rise was directly related to the presence of more archaea in petroleum reservoirs and thereby it was more beneficial for hydrocarbon degradation 9 3 conductivity of media conductivity acts efficiently in a bes to improve microorganisms activity and generate electricity for sediment and soil as significant sites of hydrocarbon pollution enhancing porosity moisture and salinity are the available strategies that can increase the electron transfer rate of mfcs deploying materials including ac and carbon fiber increases the conductivity of media that promotes the function of electrogenic microorganisms resulting in greater performance of the process 146 guo et al reported that the cell equipped with gg had better microbial activity and thus pollutant removal than the one with granule activated carbon gac anode 92 it follows from the higher conductivity of g compared to gac furthermore when mfcs were applied in groundwater or sediment with contaminants such as nitrates sulfates or metals oxide the ions present played the role of electron acceptors thereby increasing the conductivity of the system 38 147 rising ion concentration in both aqueous media such as polluted wastewater and solid media such as sediment and soil is a common way to directly decrease the internal resistance of the bes in this regard adding appropriate type and concentration of ions to biodegradation cells of phs or saline environments facilitates electron transfer and thus the production of electricity related studies demonstrated a direct relation between salinity and charge transfer within mfcs 38 139 148 however it is worth mentioning that further increase of salinity might have a detrimental effect on microbial metabolism and thereby result in lower performance results of tremouli et al indicated that although the system took advantage of utilizing optimal salinity 4 1 gkcl l the higher salt concentration 5 4 and 6 7 g l had an adverse impact on the operation table 3 139 similarly askari et al revealed that applying a medium range concentration of nacl 165 g l improved the density of the biofilm layer on the cf electrode and thus enhanced the mfc performance for the treatment of saline sediment 149 this result is in line with luqueño et al daghio et al and adeleja et al studies 38 150 151 moreover raising the water content of saline soil or sediment diminishes salinity stress and increases mass transfer 10 mfc applications for the phs removal 10 1 soil hydrocarbons mainly damage the soil environment by changing the composition and structure of the soil poisoning the medium disturbing the plants growth and altering the soil microbial communities mfcs have been applied in recent years for remediation to resolve serious soil phs pollution the main degradation mechanism is based on the redox gradient between the contaminants and the electrodes 15 wang et al applied for the first time a u tube soil mfc and obtained tphs removal enhancement by 120 adjacent to the anode 1 cm in 25 days of operation however lower soil moisture or larger distances from the anode decreased the performance 24 lu et al attempted to extend the radius of influence by new configurations in a pilot scale installation column type design worked well beyond the area close to the electrode enhanced to the edge of the reactor and shortened the remediation period they indicated that the radius of influence probably reaches 90 300 cm which means 11 12 times the column radius 152 with the aim of testing the practicability of long range bioremediation li et al applied extended smfc in phs removal by utilizing multilayer anodes in saline soils the three anodes system with single cathode was identified as efficient in increasing the degradation rates in each layer and the bacterial communities which played a key role in the process 42 mohanakrishna et al studied soil microenvironment where phs and carbon electrodes performed electron donors and electron acceptors roles respectively the results demonstrated that the average tphs degradation reached 46 in three cycles of operation this showed an increase of 40 in comparison with the reactor without electrodes 55 li et al investigated the effect of the addition of carbon source supplementation glucose for mfc biodegradation of aged phs in saline soils aged phs are confronted with a deficiency in electron acceptors weak electron transfer and low activity of microbes the research indicated promising results especially for soils in extreme environments or barren areas 153 zhao et al introduced plants and surfactants into the mfc system therefore the plants directly acted as electron donors for the microorganisms absorbed organic contaminants and helped the transformation and fixation of contaminants in addition surfactants were used to pass the electron transfer barrier and desorb contaminants from soil by increasing the solubility of hydrophobic pollutants the results suggested a plant surfactant combination in order to boost the mfc performance 154 another research by li et al was carried out examining the addition of five kinds of surfactants anionic cationic nonionic ampholytic and biosurfactant to the aged phs which are depleted of easily biodegradable hydrocarbons they found the most effective one the ampholytic surfactant for hydrocarbon degradation and bioelectricity generation 155 li et al promoted mass transport in soil mfcs by the addition of sand which could enlarge soil porosity 45 51 reduce ohmic resistance by 46 and increase charge output 2 5 3 5c g soil this significantly accelerated the degradation rate of hydrocarbons 138 similarly li et al overcame the difficulty of mass transfer by amendment of contaminated soil and compared three different biochars with a mass ratio of 2 derived from poultry agriculture and forestry industries with the aim of improving soil properties they deduced variant removal efficiencies related to diverse fractions of phs agriculture and poultry wastes were suited for high removal of aromatics and alkanes respectively due to their physicochemical properties 76 in another research li et al assessed the effectiveness of mfc with 1 conductive carbon fiber mixed with the contaminated soil to reduce the tremendous internal resistance and assist the anode in gathering electrons this could meaningfully lead to 15 fold bioelectricity generation and improve the effective range of hydrocarbon remediation from 6 to 20 cm 156 the mfc for in situ soil bioremediation using two different arrangements of anodes horizontal or vertical was evaluated by zhang et al the superior performance for hydrocarbon removal was obtained using a configuration with anodes horizontally arranged which removed tphs about 50 more than the vertically arranged reactor 157 yu et al tried to discover the underlying mechanism of electricity generation and the pahs removal emphasizing the electrodes interval and the anode s microbial community structure and composition testing from 4 cm to 10 cm they achieved more favorable results when electrodes were positioned closer because of smaller internal resistances besides according to their analysis the system enriched and promoted growth of microbes at the anode surface owing to electric stimulation 158 li et al inquired into electrode aging in mfcs arising from long term remediation period through examining the surface profile changes of electrode element accumulation on its surface and element migration between mfc electrodes in soil the aging phenomenon undoubtedly reduces self generated biocurrent and disturbs the operational process after 300 days they observed accumulation of cations on cathode 52 of increment and anode 35 of increment the stacking of fe and ca played a key role in soil hardening besides the accumulation of na resulted in electrode corrosion 159 several studies developed the remediation system to phs contaminated saline alkali soil since salt influence soils constitute approximately 40 of the earth s lands this common polluted environment typically occurs in coastal areas because big oilfields are often located there the salts impose unpleasant high osmotic potential and subsequently circumscribe the metabolic activity 160 furthermore they are exposed to high internal resistance in this sample li et al found the suppressing effect of extreme salinity with soil blended with carbon fiber the system filled with soil via rinsed salt and mixed with carbon fiber expedited the degradation rate of tphs pahs and n alkanes 161 accordingly mfcs have shown satisfactory application prospects to treat phs polluted soil 10 2 water wastewater to address serious water pollution by hydrocarbons usually caused by spillages and leakages from storage tanks researchers struggled to develop strategies and scopes of mfc systems morris and jin conducted a study with both single cell and two cell mfc design harvesting electricity by utilizing hydrocarbons as the sole substrate in the groundwater which is depleted of oxygen except at or near the surface their preliminary data held the view that the mfc technology made groundwater remediation possible under anaerobic conditions and eliminated conventional in situ aeration 94 in 2009 the authors implemented a double cell design for the biodegradation of diesel compounds c8 c25 hydrocarbons in water the results suggested increasing biodegradation by 165 over 21 days as compared to an open circuit control 89 gambino et al explored single chamber air cathode mfc for pahs degradation and detoxification in the water environment resulting in 90 decrease in pahs concentration 162 venkidusamy et al documented the influence of pre enrichment of the anode community in diesel fed single chamber mediator less mfc the pre cultured anode through former long term culture in comparison with freshly inoculated new one confirmed excellent performance in terms of the current generation and hydrocarbon contaminant degradation more precisely 6 times power generation and complete removal vs 83 removal of diesel 57 adelaja et al published a report on a range of inocula that degrade phenanthrene a model hydrocarbon through co metabolism all the inocula revealed high degradation potentials higher than 97 mentioned in table 4 88 the use of wastewater as a low grade substrate and an electron source in mfc method likewise has attracted attention during years for this purpose mohanakrishna et al ascertained the decontamination ability of single and dual chamber mfc for significant amounts of residual phs in produced water with respect to cod degradation bioelectrogenesis and tphs removal dual chamber mfc evidenced superior function 91 luo et al determined the contribution of mfcs to phenol degradation in the presence of a co substrate glucose in order to reduce toxicity of phenol during temperature changes or shock load a distinctive twin voltage peaks pattern at phenol degradation rates of 20 and 90 was observed in glucose phenol mixture as the fuel besides all the experiments concluded above 95 degradation efficiency within 60 h 90 guo et al inspected the influence of packing material characteristics on the system efficiency utilizing petroleum refinery wastewater in the role of fuel in the anode chamber packing materials would expand the superficial anode area and accordingly raise microbial enrichment as well as power density output gg with excellent electrical conductivity improved petroleum pollutants decomposition electricity generation and microbial community diversity meanwhile gac promoted the stability of operation and preferential removal of volatile benzene and phenols due to strong adsorption ability 92 mohanakrishna et al aimed to boost petroleum refinery wastewater treatment with the aid of externally applied voltage in the range 100 500 mv for the initial 24 h the supplemented potential was identified as effective on bioelectrogenesis and substrate degradation the 500 mv voltage exhibited the maximum power density substrate and diesel range organics straight chain alkanes removal efficiency much higher than 300 mv 100 mv and control mfcs 130 10 3 sediment recently sediment mfcs have become competitive technology for removing hydrocarbons many researchers have reported higher removal efficiencies of the technology compared to in situ natural biodegradation in contaminated sediments sediment s complex composition of various organic matters microbial populations and mineral particles beside water and air affects the internal resistance and therefore the performance of mfc systems in the process there is no need for mobilization or transport of sediment thus reducing co2 emissions and low adverse effect on the environment has been observed 85 it had been reported that mfcs arouse aromatic hydrocarbons degradation with one or two aromatic rings e g benzene toluene and naphthalene in sediments 163 morris and jin tested a modified single cell mfc setup appearing to enhance the degradation rate of tphs by nearly 12 fold over natural biodegradation 87 yan et al proposed construction of plexiglass columns as sediment bioreactors that are greatly capable of pahs biodegradation in a combined approach smfc and fe iii addition with about 95 removal efficiencies of phenanthrene and pyrene they affirmed the opinion that in such treatment organic matters present in freshwater sediments could adsorb remaining pahs with less bioavailability 41 nastro et al proved the high potential of mfcs for in situ remediation of marine sediments among all according to the complexity of pah types degradation rates ranged from 10 to 86 after four weeks for indenol 1 2 3 c d pyrene and naphthalene respectively in terms of power density the systems reached their highest performance after two weeks 40 sherafatmand and ng did detailed research into the capability of smfc for bioremediation of pahs under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the cathodic compartment the results demonstrated more than 3 times removal rate compared with those in the smfcs without electric current and better performance with 67 toc removal in the anaerobic reactor as well 164 permana et al executed a comparative study between single chamber and dual chamber mfc in sediment remediation they realized that the single chamber system can not only degrade more phs than the dual chamber system but also produce higher electrical energy on average to the other one 66 therefore mfcs have been successfully investigated in sediment remediation fig 6 exhibits schematic diagrams of mfcs in environmental applications moreover table 4 represents more accurate information of the reported studies on mfcs in different applications 11 cost analysis worldwide an enormous amount of research effort is allocated to treatment processes to certify the economic viability of each method in this regard economic analysis of mfcs has been done since 2005 166 many considerations have to be taken into account about the evaluation of mfcs cost including capital and operating costs which are two main areas of focus for any development of this technology into real world implementation mfcs operating costs including tax rates electricity labor services and membrane replacement are incurred during the process and are estimated to be 4 of the capital cost the large capital costs of mfc modules mainly appear from the high priced construction materials associated with the electricity membrane and electrodes some researchers inferred that the anode accounts for further electrode cost 167 168 however rozendal et al presumed up to 47 of capital costs of bess related to the price of cathode materials 169 abourached et al also dedicated 84 5 of the capital cost to the electrodes for a single chamber laboratory size mfc 168 it is clear that catalyst and current collector which is made of metal materials invariably cause extra cost besides the electrode the high configuration cost is attributed to the overpriced separator material the result of ge and he demonstrated that the membrane and electrodes accounted for more than 60 and 19 of material cost for a dual chamber mfc respectively 170 if the technology is to be commercially viable all changes in the design of the electrode or the reactor structure described above must be aligned with the low cost goal hence researchers have made strides to reduce the system s overall expenses while maintaining the same outputs of electricity ceramic and different fibers as a low cost and scalable iem highly efficient and less expensive electrode nanomaterials and catalyzed biocathodes can considerably increase reaction effectiveness at lower operating costs 171 ghasemi et al acknowledged sulfonated polyether ketone speek as a great substitute for nafion membranes results of cost estimation revealed that although mfc with speek produced lower power than nafion 117 speek 595 w is about twice as cost efficient as nafion 117 1134 w 172 similarly yousefi et al compared the cost of ceramic membranes 2 5 3 5 m2 with nafion 117 2300 m2 173 in the matter of revenue it is said that an mfc could return about 0 0005 kg cod assuming a net energy recovery rate of 0 004 kwh kg cod and based on an average electricity price of 0 12 kwh 29 it should be considered whether improving power output or applying the least expensive electrode materials is a cost attractive approach stoll et al reported that an overall income of 0 08 m3 for power generation is not economical according to the average cost of electricity in the u s 0 12 kwh supposing an mfc reactor with about 2 m3 volume the generated power from hydrocarbons degradation is below 30 w m3 and thus the revenue of the system is very low furthermore while applying inexpensive anode materials decreases power generation the cost of hydrocarbon elimination in an mfc will be significantly reduced so reducing expenses is more economical 174 in recent decades several pilot scale studies of the stacked mfcs have been conducted and tried to optimize the technical performance related to pollutant removal coulombic efficiency power output and hrt 53 175 overall it has been said that the capital cost of the mfc system is 30 times higher on average in comparison with the traditional activated sludge process 133 it is estimated at 6064 3300 and 36 000 for 96 tubular modules 18 stacked and 50 modules respectively 170 176 177 jadhav et al reported a capital cost of 4386 for electrode material and toilet assembly construction to treat 1 5 m3 capacity of septage wastewater and generate electricity 169 however considering the savings related to water consumption reuse of treated water and generation of electricity revealed a payback period of 10 years for this system 12 future outlook and conclusion former studies of mfcs for the degradation of hydrocarbons from polluted environments can be applied as references for the real usage of this technology previous successful met cases demonstrated that a single chamber reactor with modified carbon based electrode materials has great potential in the remediation of recalcitrant compounds the data derived from laboratory and in situ tests reported more than 97 hydrocarbon elimination in 60 days from a polluted sewage treatment plant in marine sediments 86 removal efficiency was declared after four weeks in the same way mfcs achieved about 90 efficiency in hydrocarbon contaminated soils in 120 days laboratory scale mfc successfully provoked anaerobic microbial activity and improved degradation efficiency in comparison with open circuit mfc in environmentally benign conditions microbial bes has also enhanced the function of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria by increasing the adsorption of pollutants on the surface of the electrodes and raising the microbial community proteobacteria are a common kind of bacteria that affect both power generation and activity of the microbial community in polluted soil scalability requires to be backed by cost effectiveness chemical stability against material deterioration and biofouling and excellent long term performance to accomplish commercialization of the technology studies have mainly focused on continuous flow mfcs in three categories including large size units stackable individual cells and or multi anode cathode systems common configurations embrace both single and dual chamber reactors and the majority of studies agree that stack modules potentially perform better than other configurations additionally small scale and package wastewater treatment plants are likely the most suitable options to initially install full scale units one should take into account that operational factors e g feeding substrate temperature hydraulic retention time and organic loading rate as well as specific design and materials can change the optimal large scale application for instance the stacked assembly may hold an optimum number of units in one stack beyond that there is not a significant improvement further some aspects should be noticed to scale up the optimal cascade systems continuous flow mode in mfcs may overcome the development of harmful byproducts prevent the reduction of electricity generation over time and enable high productivity per unit volume with less labor altogether it is more practical than batch culture systems generally the selection of overall setup is a trade off between a cost effective design and enhanced efficiency in terms of removal and power generation however the real scale up application of this method is confronted with many challenges that need to be addressed thereby more attention should be paid to the following cases to surmount shortcomings i in terms of system cost it must be considered that the main expense is related to reactor electrodes and its income is covered by the energy and power production hence managing a subset of the reactor cathode anode redox mediator and membrane can provide a great chance for wide scale use of mfc moreover in order to attain economic justification we propose to concentrate on reducing capital expenses instead of increasing the income of power generation 174 ii arrangement and conductivity amendment of electrode materials can promote effective areas of remediation utilizing low cost and great performance electrodes and redox mediators ensures the real use of mfcs iii microorganisms play a crucial role in the enhancement of hydrocarbon degradation when functional microbes are applied at the appropriate temperature resulting biofilms guarantee their profitable lifetime hence these stable bacteria are more practical and economical than chemical catalysts 38 145 iv synergic systems by combining mfcs with other technologies particularly as a pretreatment are a priority for future research it would inhibit the transfer of complex compositions to the cell and shorten the execution time of pollutant elimination depending on the purpose one may attain high effluent quality or more commercial value from mfc based synergic modes v membranes should minimize or stop the transport of oxygen into the anode because of the anaerobic process of an anodic cell this requirement would be difficult to control as to when the membrane gets wet water through the membrane structure would diffuse oxygen imposing a differential pressure e g a small flow of liquid from the anode to the cathode can prevent oxygen transfer 78 vi external energy needed to launch the circuit of mfc is one of the main challenges in system scale up energy loss can be improved by designing integrated highly efficient circuits and also by collecting electrical energy produced from the system 143 in summary this technology same as other prosperous methods needs to be further investigated to realize fundamentals and functional barriers in the development of the process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

conducted studies showed that removal of 1h btr with more than 80 efficiency is possible at effluent concentrations not exceeding 200 μg l 1 higher concentrations of 1h btr in wastewater lead to a

respectively the aeration phase was superior in terms of 1h btr removal regardless of the benzotriazole doze in the raw wastewater in the anaerobic mixing phases i and ii in the sbr the decomposition of the 1h btr was 5 3 and 4 9 times slower respectively compared to aerobic conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords 1h benzotriazole corrosion inhibitor heterocyclic organic compound industrial wastewater treatment sbr activated sludge 1 introduction the development of civilization causes an increase in the amount and types of chemicals used by people medicines personal care products plastics and a large number of other materials facilitate and improve the quality of life however the use production and disposal of these substances are corelated with their unintentional release to the environment in recent years the presence of many chemical compounds has been found in various elements of the environment the constant presence of these substances even at very low concentration levels entails the risk of harmful effects on living organisms including humans 1 4 these substances are most often referred to as contaminants of emerging concern cecs 5 7 cecs includes among others benzotriazoles btrs it is a group of heterocyclic organic containing in its structure a benzene ring and an attached triazole ring 1h benzotriazole 1h btr is the simplest and most basic representative

the main applications of 1h btr and at the same time the source from which it is introduced into the environment are aircraft deicing fluids adfs and cleaning agents for dishwashing machines and anticorrosive agents 18 29 30 btrs are referred as the most commonly found micropollutants in the aquatic environment 31 1h btr is commonly detected in the human surroundings water resources and the

that dishwasher wastewater contains 99 of benzotriazoles from dishwasher tablets and dishwasher wastewater contributes to as much as 30 of the total btrs load in the wastewater treatment system 1h btr is fairly soluble in water does not readily biodegrade and has a limited tendency to sorb making it a compound not very amenable to wastewater treatment processes which results in its widespread distribution in the environment 9 15 many studies have demonstrated the presence of btrs in human organisms including adipose tissues amniotic fluids and urine 20 32 34 the concentrations of 1h btr identified in the environment and reported in literature are shown in table 2 btrs are characterized by high toxicity cancerogenicity and can also cause long term adverse effects on aquatic

best of our knowledge there is no systematic data on the removal of 1h btr in different process phases of sbr and none on the efficiency comparison depending on the dosage in raw wastewater and technological parameters of wastewater treatment process the studies on 1h btr removal conducted in a mbrs were and mainly focused on activated sludge microbiology 51 52 the influence of various

sample volume was 1 μl the oven temperature was programmed from 80 c increased by 10 c min to 180 c and by 20 c min to 280 c the working conditions of the ms detector were as follows the electron

quantification 161 and confirmation ions 133 119 were selected based on the spectrum recorded in the scanning mode fig 2 the retention time of 1h btr equals 8 0 min the determination of the concentrations of the tested compound was carried out using the calibration graph method in order to record a calibration graph a series of aqueous working solutions of 1h btr in concentration range 0 1 1000 μg l 1 were subjected to extraction procedure and the obtained extracts were analysed by gc ms device a linear relationship between the concentration of compounds and the analytical signal was obtained in the whole considered range the coefficient of benzotriazole determination was higher than 0 99 which guaranteed determination correctness the limit of detection lod was established as the concentration giving a signal to noise s n ratio of 3 and it equals 0 02 μg l 1 the concentration corresponding to the lowest point of the calibration plot that is 0 1 μg l 1 was established as the limit of quantification loq value the relative standard deviation rsd used as the measure of precision equals 7 the recovery value calculated comparing nominal concentration with the value determined based on calibration plot was 110 3 results and discussion during the conducted experiment the assumed concentration of 1h btr in raw wastewater was from 50 to 1000 μg l 1 the addition of appropriate standard doses resulted in obtaining the required amounts of 1h btr in raw wastewater to control the wastewater treatment process during all test series i iii sbr 1 was operated as a control without the addition of the 1h btr standard in wastewater a major surprise confirmed repeatedly in the studies was the presence of 1h btr 0 6 1 4 μg l 1 in the raw sewage without the addition of the standard fed into the control sbr it is very probably that the 1h btr in the model influent was derived from tap water as confirmed by the results of 45 additional confirmation of the above is provided by the concentration of 1h btr in raw wastewater with the addition of the standard where the recorded concentrations always exceeded by a value ranging from 0 51 to 1 68 μg l 1 the assumed concentration the presence of 1h btr in wastewater without 1h btr standard dose may also be related to the use of plastic packaged reagents for the preparation of model wastewater such packaging usually contains benzotriazole group buvs additives which prevent plastic degradation under uv radiation 1h btr could be a product of chemical decomposition of buvs 39 and this issue will receive special attention in our future studies the concentrations of 1h btr in raw wastewater with and without standard addition and its changes after successive sbr process phases are shown in table 5 in series i the concentration of 1h btr in wastewater entering the sbr was assumed to be slightly higher than that recorded in raw wastewater worldwide table 2 it amounted to 50 100 and 200 μg l 1 in series ii and iii higher concentrations of 1h btr in raw wastewater were assumed table 5 and therefore the duration of denitrification e f was extended from 30 to 60 min table 3 the highest concentration of 1h btr in raw sewage entering the sbr was 1000 μg l 1 this concentration was often adopted in studies by scientists 11 14 19 57 it has been reported in literature that due to high loading of wastewater with a given organic pollutant the biological chamber can start to act as a primary substrate provided it does not cause inhibition for certain groups of bacteria the biodegradation of 1h btr under very high loading conditions can be significantly accelerated which means that this substance is most probably the main substrate for certain groups of bacteria in the activated sludge biomass it should be noted that several bacterial species isolated from mbr were able to utilise 1h btr as the only source of carbon and energy 52 the efficiency of 1h btr removal from wastewater as a result of the sbr filling phase a b ranged from 36 series iii to 89 series i the highest value was obtained at the dose of 1h btr of 50 and the lowest at the dose of 600 μg l 1 it is worth noting that the efficiency of dilution phase of raw sewage with sbr contents mixture of activated sludge and sewage treated in the previous cycle under anaerobic conditions was dependent on the concentration of 1h btr and decreased with growing concentration of analysed micropollutant in raw sewage the removal efficiencies of 1h btr in sbr taking into account the dilution of raw wastewater with biological chamber content from the previous cycle only biochemical processes including biodegradation and biotransformation involving enzymatic reactions are shown in fig 3 during the filling phase 1h btr removal was mainly affected by dilution of wastewater remaining in the sbr after treatment process with raw sewage inflowing to reactor at the beginning of the subsequent operating cycle a similar pattern in studies on the removal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in a sequencing batch reactor with aerobic granular activated sludge gsbr was reported by ref 58 it was observed that a 20 min mixing i phase b c with the lowest dose of 1h btr in raw wastewater 50 μg l 1 contributed to an increase in its concentration at this stage to the value of 20 41 μg l 1 and therefore the effectiveness of the removal has not been recorded 0 on fig 3 the same pattern was observed in the control sbr where an increase to the value of 5 78 μg l 1 occurred it is most probable that 1h btr was released from the activated sludge at this wastewater treatment stage it was also found that at higher concentrations of analysed compound in raw wastewater there was a reduction of 1h btr in the wastewater after the defosfatation phase b c the efficiency of this process phase ranged from 1 68 dose of 1h btr 500 μg l 1 to 12 36 dose of 1h btr 150 μg l 1 and was not proportional to the concentration of 1h btr in raw wastewater it was also noted that the first half of the 300 min of aeration and mixing phase c d contributed to the reduction of 1h btr concentration in wastewater in all sbrs the aeration process most likely also influenced the removal efficiency which for the first 150 min of the aeration mixing process ranged from 1 8 1h btr dose 300 μg l 1 to 24 41 1h btr dose 150 μg l 1 and was not proportional to the concentration of tested compound in raw wastewater in the control sbr effluent without the addition of 1h btr standard after the first 150 min the concentration of 1h btr ranged from 1 48 to 8 81 μg l 1 the increase in the concentration of 1h btr to a value of 8 81 μg l 1 testified to a further release of this benzotriazole accumulated during the previous sbr cycles in activated sludge a further 150 min of aeration and mixing phase of wastewater and activated sludge in the sbr d e resulted in a significantly higher removal of 1h btr from the wastewater during all test series this pattern was observed both in the sbrs to which the effluent with 1h btr was fed and in the control reactor concentration reduction of up to 47 22 the efficiency of 1h btr removal from wastewater during the second half of the aeration and mixing phase d e in sbrs ranged from 12 45 1h btr dose 300 μg l 1 to 40 48 1h btr dose 600 μg l 1 there was no proportional increase noted in the removal efficiency of 1h btr in this process phase when the dose of test compound in raw wastewater was increased it was found during the 300 min aeration and mixing phase c e that its effectiveness varied greatly and ranged from 30 to 52 9 the only exception was the sbr fed with an effluent dose of 300 μg l 1 and in this particular sbr only the next process phase contributed to the effective removal of the tested compound the removal of 1h btr from wastewater in the aeration phase combined with the mixing of the sbr contents using flocculent activated sludge occurred most effectively at concentrations of 1h btr in raw wastewater in the range 100 200 and 600 1000 μg l 1 table 5 in this study hydroxylation and or methylation of the benzene and triazole ring most likely occurred in the aerated activated sludge as confirmed in literature 59 an important fact is that the methylated and hydroxylated products appear after the same time which most likely indicates the simultaneous occurrence of several metabolic pathways of benzotriazole transformation 60 have identified 27 potential benzotriazole transformation products six of which demonstrate the highest analytical signal intensity from a tandem mass spectrometer a comparison of 1h btr efficiency removal from wastewater during the first and second half of the aeration phase is shown in fig 4 the removal of 1h btr from wastewater by aerobic microbiological processes not taking into account dilution of raw wastewater with sbr content b e had high efficiency from 40 to 56 for 5 out of 9 assumed doses of 1h btr despite maintaining identical technological parameters of the treatment process concentration of activated sludge biomass dissolved oxygen concentration length and sequence of process phases volume exchange ratio etc in wastewater containing a dose of 1h btr between 250 and 500 μg l 1 the efficiency oscillated around 30 however in the sbr with the lowest assumed concentration of the tested compound it was probably the microbiological processes which caused an increase in the concentration of 1h btr in wastewater from 5 77 in the wastewater after filling the sbr to 14 47 μg l 1 after the end of the aeration phase it was found that the mixing ii phase e f in the sbr operation cycle denitrification lasting 30 min series i contributed to further removal of 1h btr from wastewater the efficiency of its removal at this stage of treatment process was inversely proportional to the dose of 1h btr introduced into the raw wastewater 50 μg l 1 27 09 and 200 μg l 1 4 89 no increase of 1h btr concentration was observed in wastewater in any sbr which indicates correct assumptions for the anoxic mixing phase ii duration e f in contrast an increase in effluent 1h btr concentration was observed in series ii and iii of the study at the same stage of wastewater treatment process the exception was the sbr in which wastewater was fed with a dose of 1h btr of 300 μg l 1 capturing of the increase in concentration of tested benzotriazole in wastewater was possible due to a detailed analysis of the entire cycle of the sbr operation and may have resulted from the extension of the mixing phase ii from 30 to 60 min series ii and iii it should be stressed that during the studies in series i when the time of the e f phase was half as long 30 min no increases in the concentration of 1h btr were recorded it is extremely important that literature shows the total efficiency of the biological wastewater treatment process and not partial values at the end of the individual stages it is likely that a complete elimination or shortening of the mixing phase after aeration would prevent an increase in the concentration of 1h btr in wastewater the effectiveness of mixing phases i and ii are compared in fig 5 during the flocculent activated sludge settling phase and the decantation of the sbr treated effluent f g the concentration of 1h btr in the effluent was further reduced the gradual decrease of 1h btr in sbr during each experimental cycle is shown in fig s1 the quality of the treated wastewater with standard deviation is shown in fig s2 despite the same technological parameters the quality of the treated wastewater differed significantly this was related to the different initial dose of 1h btr in raw wastewater in the sbr the efficiency of this process phase ranged from 1 to 32 it should be noted that the 40 min settling phase did not lead to the release of 1h btr from activated sludge into the treated effluent in the concentration range from 50 to 500 μg l 1 table 5 this indicates the urgent need to change technological assumptions of treatment processes with high doses of benzotriazole a similar situation was reported by ref 39 and it could be explained by the varying sorption of target compounds in activated sludge and their subsequent desorption by successive portions of wastewater as can be seen in figs 3 5 the results obtained in the control sbr differed significantly from the results in the other sbrs this was related to the much lower concentration of 1h btr in sbr1 wastewater the range of concentrations of 1h btr in the influent and effluent with corresponding total removal efficiencies of this micropollutant are shown in fig 6 the process of 1h btr removal from sewage in sbr with flocculent activated sludge had the highest efficiency 80 with analysed compound concentration in raw wastewater of 50 200 μg l 1 fig 6 it should be emphasized that the concentration of 1h btr of 200 μg l 1 is the limit for highly efficient removal of 1h btr from wastewater in biological processes and with even higher concentration the activated sludge method becomes definitely less effective the relevant biodegradation kinetics of 1h btr removal for each sbr phases are shown in table s2 the efficiency of 1h btr removal in sbr obtained in this study was higher than that reported for cas by refs 19 49 from 13 to 62 52 from 0 to 72 and 39 37 3 it was also higher than that reported for mbrs 61 18 it is noteworthy that the obtained efficiency of 1h btr removal from wastewater in sbr is very similar to that reported by ref 52 the researchers noted that the removal of btr by biodegradation in their study was 84 while the removal by sorption on activated sludge flocs was only 0 5 the researchers explained the difference between determined and calculated efficiencies about 13 as resulting from mbr reactor filtration the removal efficiency of 1h btr in sbr in wwtp was 46 1 39 the reason for the lower efficiencies may be the fact that raw wastewater flowing into the wwtp contains various btr derivatives which are degraded by treatment processes taking place thus increasing the concentration of 1h btr in the effluent the reason for obtaining such high efficiency of 1h btr removal in model sbrs in this study could also be caused by well chosen technological parameters of the wastewater treatment process activated sludge that adapted to increased doses of 1h btrs in wastewater another reason could be the absence of complex compounds containing btrs in their structure drugs dyes buvs antimicrobial agents etc in significant concentrations in synthetic wastewater such high efficiency of 1h btr removal from wastewater may have also been influenced by very favourable environmental conditions stable temperature adapted insolation etc according to ref 27 different environmental conditions influence differences in photochemical transformation processes hydrolysis and microbial degradation pathways high removal efficiency of 1h btr in laboratory sbrs in this study could be caused by the long srt which favoured the presence of slow growing microorganisms adapted to the disposal of poorly degradable pollutants 52 51 61 also highlighted the advantages of maintaining a long srt in biological chambers and consequently the development of microorganisms capable of degrading 1h btr as well as a sufficiently long hrt which additionally had a beneficial effect on the removal of degradable organic compounds it is worth noting that no deterioration of activated sludge parameters settleability odour colour and floc structure was observed over the 137 days of testing in the model sbrs 22 show no major effect of 1h btr on zebrafish at a concentration of 1197 μg l 1 while a study by ref 31 proved no effect on microalgae growth at a 1h btr concentration of 200 μg l 1 in wastewater in addition the wastewater treatment process took place in sbr which is a technology known for its flexibility and wide range of applications another reason influencing the high efficiency of 1h btr removal from wastewater could be the correct adaptation time of activated sludge biomass literature reports that at low concentrations of btrs in raw wastewater these micropollutants can be degraded by cometabolic processes 62 while when they are at high concentrations they can be degraded catabolically 52 an adequate adaptation time was necessary and provided in the conducted research 52 reported very high total btr removal efficiency in an mbr reactor 97 20 2 59 however three periods of unstable operation and two periods of stable operation were evident during their experiment periods of unstable operation were not observed in studies conducted in the sbrs even with the highest doses of 1h btr the treatment system operated in a stable way throughout the study period which means that the flocculent activated sludge in the sbrs was not shocked and the biomass was able to adapt to the presence of this micropollutant the transformation pathways of 1h btr by biodegradation and biotransformation under aerobic and anaerobic conditions are known 11 51 52 57 63 57 reported five products under aerobic conditions such as phenol phthalic acid 1 methylbenzotriazole 1h benzotriazole 4 methoxy and 1h benzotriazole 5 methoxy and four degradation products under anaerobic conditions such as phenol 1 methylbenzotriazole dimethyl benzylamine and carbazole authors pointed the main processes of 1h btr transformation to be methylaton on nitrogen atom of the triazole chain addition of o ch3 group to the para and meta position carbon atom of benzene ring formation via scission of triazole chain and then acidification of benzene ring and formation by n n bond scission followed by polymerization it is worth emphasising that initial methylation of 1h btr occurring under aerobic and anaerobic conditions 51 52 identified the following compounds as products of 1h btr transformations 4 hydroxybenzotriazole 1 hydroxybenzotriazole dihydroxybenzotriazole the attachment site of the hydroxyl groups could not be unequivocally indicated 1 methylbenzotriazole 4 methylbenzotriazole and or 5 methylbenzotriazole and 5 hydroxy 1 2 3 triazole 51 identified hydroxylation and methylation as the most important transformation processes of 1h btr and noted poor sorption of 1h btr on activated sludge flocs 52 63 identified cleavage of the benzene ring while 11 57 the benzene or and the triazole ring of 1h btr as critical for further mineralization of this compound 11 reported that redox conditions changing from aerobic to anaerobic including nitrate reducing sulphate reducing and methanogenic conditions could have a significant effect on the biodegradation of organic compounds cleavage of the aromatic ring and oxidation hydroxylation polymerization methylation and methoxylation leading to the formation of products such as phenols carboxylic acids aldeydes ketones and amines 64 31 has highlighted biodegradation bioaccumulation and bioadsorption as key processes contributing to the removal of organic micropollutants along with enzymes and heterotrophic metabolism of algae 31 also identified hydroxylation oxidation and methylation as the main reaction mechanisms for btrs 51 proved that transformation of 1h btr via biological pathway by bacteria of the pseudomonas putida and raoultella ornithinolytica species and their mixture occurred slowly and inefficiently which demonstrated the adverse effects of this compound on the mentioned microorganisms it also confirmed that a complex and adapted consortium of microorganisms such as activated sludge biomass is necessary for the metabolism and transformation of 1h btr autotrophs which are relative to heterotrophs are a more sensitive group of microorganisms to 1h btr 51 59 highlighted that at least two phototransformation pathways of 1h btr have been observed the first involving the opening of the triazole ring and the formation of 2 aminophenol followed by further transformations the second pathway involved the opening of the triazole ring and the formation of phenazine by coupling of the resulting derivatives it should be highlighted that the transformation pathway of 1h btr was not crucial for the conducted research however the removal efficiency of this compound in aerobic and anaerobic phases of subsequent operating cycle in sbr depended on the concentration of this micropollutant in raw wastewater 4 conclusions the study was undertaken to analyse in detail the removal of 1h btr from wastewater in sbr with activated sludge technology a number of technological parameters were used in the study consistent with those used in real wastewater treatment plants modifications to the sbr operating cycle were also undertaken the conducted research has shown 1 the concentration of 1h btr in wastewater changed in individual phases of the treatment process in sbr with flocculated activated sludge 2 in the aerobic phase in sbr the degradation of 1h btr occurred with higher efficiency than under anoxic and anaerobic conditions regardless of the dose of benzotriazole in the raw wastewater 3 in the anaerobic mixing phases i defosfatation and ii denitrification the decomposition of the organic compound 1h btr was 5 3 and 4 9 times slower respectively compared to aerobic conditions 4 in the vast majority of test cycles increasing the mixing phase ii denitrification from 30 to 60 min contributed to the release of 1h btr from activated sludge into wastewater treated in sbr 5 even the highest dose of 1h btr in raw wastewater 1000 μg l 1 fed to the sbr three times daily for a period of 105 days did not stop the treatment process and did not deteriorate the properties of the activated sludge 6 it was found that removal of 1h btr with more than 80 efficiency is possible at effluent concentrations not exceeding 200 μg l 1 and with long hrt and srt higher concentrations of 1h btr in wastewater lead to a sharp decrease in removal efficiency the higher the concentration of 1h btr the lower the removal

conducted studies showed that removal of 1h btr with more than 80 efficiency is possible at effluent concentrations not exceeding 200 μg l 1 higher concentrations of 1h btr in wastewater lead to a sharp decrease in removal efficiency the lowest removal efficiency 56 6 was recorded at the initial 1h btr concentration of 100 μg l 1 on the other hand the highest efficiency 88 2 at the initial concentration of 1000 μg l 1 the concentration of 1h btr in treated wastewater was 1 1 μg l 1 in the control reactor and from 7 2 to 434 0 μg l 1 for an initial concentration from 50 to 1000 μg l 1 respectively the aeration phase was superior in terms of 1h btr removal regardless of the benzotriazole doze in the raw wastewater in the anaerobic mixing phases i and ii in the sbr the decomposition

wastewater treatment sbr activated sludge 1 introduction the development of civilization causes an increase in the amount and types of chemicals used by people medicines personal care products plastics and a large number of other materials facilitate and improve the quality of life however the use production and disposal of these substances are corelated with their unintentional release to the environment in recent years the presence of many chemical compounds has been found in various elements of the environment the constant presence of these substances even at very low concentration levels entails the risk of harmful effects on living organisms including humans 1 4 these substances are most often referred to as contaminants of emerging concern cecs 5 7 cecs includes among others benzotriazoles btrs it is a group of heterocyclic organic containing in its structure a benzene ring and an attached triazole ring 1h benzotriazole 1h btr is the simplest and most basic representative of compounds belonging to the btrs group the characteristics chemical structure and applications of 1h btr are shown in table 1 btrs are present in numerous products of everyday use as well as in production processes aimed at protection against corrosion evaporation freezing etc or improvement of product properties uv resistance accelerated vulcanisation of rubber materials cooling etc 8 17 they have complexing and anti corrosive properties for metals both in industry to protect or cool installations as antifogging agents in photography in dry cleaning equipment and in households dishwasher detergents building materials btrs are also used as vulcanizing accelerators for rubber materials pigments and in automotive textiles they possess anti freezing anti icing de icing properties and therefore are used in airplane defogging fluids and engine coolants btrs are also found in various plastics lubricants brake fluids body cosmetics paints biocides and medicines 12 18 28 the main applications of 1h btr and at the same time the source from which it is introduced into the environment are aircraft deicing fluids adfs and cleaning agents for dishwashing machines and anticorrosive agents 18 29 30 btrs are referred as the most commonly found micropollutants in the aquatic environment 31 1h btr is commonly detected in the human surroundings water resources and the environment researchers have confirmed the presence of 1h btr in wastewater treatment plants wwtps influents and effluents high loads in industrial wastewater surface water ground water river water lake water canal water small streams creeks that received surface runoff from airports sewage sludge sediment agricultural and industrial soils indoor air house and print shop dust animals 12 reported that dishwasher wastewater contains 99 of benzotriazoles from dishwasher tablets and dishwasher wastewater contributes to as much as 30 of the total btrs load in the wastewater treatment system 1h btr is fairly soluble in water does not readily biodegrade and has a limited tendency to sorb making it a compound not very amenable to wastewater treatment processes which results in its widespread distribution in the environment 9 15 many studies have demonstrated the presence of btrs in human organisms including adipose tissues amniotic fluids and urine 20 32 34 the concentrations of 1h btr identified in the environment and reported in literature are shown in table 2 btrs are characterized by high toxicity cancerogenicity and can also cause long term adverse effects on aquatic environment 21 a study by ref 48 proved negative effects of btrs on the reproduction of marine medaka ozyrias melastigma 1h btr is toxic to luminescent bacteria plants and aquatic animals 49 exposure to 1h btr also increases bioaccumulation of cd in living organisms 50 people are exposed to btrs through inhalation skin contact and along with water and food 25 34 btrs cause endocrine disruption including thyroid hormones cause oxidative stress and disrupting mitochondrial function 49 1h btr is also classified as a probable human carcinogen chen et al 2020 various technologies and methods

process aops nanofiltration 14 18 26 31 51 54 biological removal of 1h btr has not been fully studied despite it s importance as the most commonly used wastewater treatment method in the world to the best of our knowledge there is no systematic data on the removal of 1h btr in different process phases of sbr and none on the efficiency comparison depending on the dosage in raw wastewater and technological parameters of wastewater treatment process the studies on 1h btr removal conducted in a mbrs were and mainly focused on activated sludge microbiology 51 52 the influence of various conditions anaerobic aerobic and anoxic were not considered in the wastewater treatment process the novelty of this study was to analyse in detail the quantitative changes of 1h btr in wastewater

made to make them similar to those used in technical scale wwtps where this micropollutant is not analysed the doses of 1h btr assumed in this study are close to the concentration that may be found in industrial wastewater data obtained from this study can be a useful guideline for both municipal and industrial wwtps in adapting their processes to address the threat of 1h btr presence and hazardous

concentrations of the tested compound was carried out using the calibration graph method in order to record a calibration graph a series of aqueous working solutions of 1h btr in concentration range 0

obtained in the whole considered range the coefficient of benzotriazole determination was higher than 0 99 which guaranteed determination correctness the limit of detection lod was established as the concentration giving a signal to noise s n ratio of 3 and it equals 0 02 μg l 1 the concentration corresponding to the lowest point of the calibration plot that is 0 1 μg l 1 was established as the limit of quantification loq value the relative standard deviation rsd used as the measure of precision equals 7 the recovery value calculated comparing nominal concentration with the value determined based on calibration plot was 110 3 results and discussion during the conducted experiment the assumed concentration of 1h btr in raw wastewater was from 50 to 1000 μg l 1 the addition of appropriate standard doses resulted in obtaining the required amounts of 1h btr in raw wastewater to control the wastewater treatment process during all test series i iii sbr 1 was operated as a control without the addition of the 1h btr standard in wastewater a major surprise confirmed repeatedly in the studies was the presence of 1h btr 0 6 1 4 μg l 1 in the raw sewage without the addition of the standard fed into the control sbr it is very probably that the 1h btr in the model influent was derived from tap water as confirmed by the results of 45 additional confirmation of the above is provided by the concentration of 1h btr in raw wastewater with the addition of the standard where the recorded concentrations always exceeded by a value ranging from 0 51 to 1 68 μg l 1 the assumed concentration the presence of 1h btr in wastewater without 1h btr standard dose may also be related to the use of plastic packaged reagents for the preparation of model wastewater such packaging usually contains benzotriazole group buvs additives which prevent plastic degradation under uv radiation 1h btr could be a product of chemical decomposition of buvs 39 and this issue will receive special attention in our future studies the concentrations of 1h btr in raw wastewater with and without standard addition and its changes after successive sbr process phases are shown in table 5 in series i the concentration of 1h btr in wastewater entering the sbr was assumed to be slightly higher than that recorded in raw wastewater worldwide table 2 it amounted to 50 100 and 200 μg l 1 in series ii and iii higher concentrations of 1h btr in raw wastewater were assumed table 5 and therefore the duration of denitrification e f was extended from 30 to 60 min table 3 the highest concentration of 1h btr in raw sewage entering the sbr was 1000 μg l 1 this concentration was often adopted in studies by scientists 11 14 19 57 it has been reported in literature that due to high loading of wastewater with a given organic pollutant the biological chamber can start to act as a primary substrate provided it does not cause inhibition for certain groups of bacteria the biodegradation of 1h btr under very high loading conditions can be significantly accelerated which means that this substance is most probably the main substrate for certain groups of bacteria in the activated sludge biomass it should be noted that several bacterial species isolated from mbr were able to utilise 1h btr as the only source of carbon and energy 52 the efficiency of 1h btr removal from wastewater as a result of the sbr filling phase a b ranged from 36 series iii to 89 series i the highest value was obtained at the dose of 1h btr of 50 and the lowest at the dose of 600 μg l 1 it is worth noting that the efficiency of dilution phase of raw sewage with sbr contents mixture of activated sludge and sewage treated in the previous cycle under anaerobic conditions was dependent on the concentration of 1h btr and decreased with growing concentration of analysed micropollutant in raw sewage the removal efficiencies of 1h btr in sbr taking into account the dilution of raw wastewater with biological chamber content from the previous cycle only biochemical processes including biodegradation and biotransformation involving enzymatic reactions are shown in fig 3 during the filling phase 1h btr removal was mainly affected by dilution of wastewater remaining in the sbr after treatment process with raw sewage inflowing to reactor at the beginning of the subsequent operating cycle a similar pattern in studies on the removal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in a sequencing batch reactor with aerobic granular activated sludge gsbr was reported by ref 58 it was observed that a 20 min mixing i phase b c with the lowest dose of 1h btr in raw wastewater 50 μg l 1 contributed to an increase in its concentration at this stage to the value of 20 41 μg l 1 and therefore the effectiveness of the removal has not been recorded 0 on fig 3 the same pattern was observed in the control sbr where an increase to the value of 5 78 μg l 1 occurred it is most probable that 1h btr was released from the activated sludge at this wastewater treatment stage it was also found that at higher concentrations of analysed compound in raw wastewater there was a reduction of 1h btr in the wastewater after the defosfatation phase b c the efficiency of this process phase ranged from 1 68 dose of 1h btr 500 μg l 1 to 12 36 dose of 1h btr 150 μg l 1 and was not proportional to the concentration of 1h btr in raw wastewater it was also noted that the first half of the 300 min of aeration and mixing phase c d contributed to the reduction of 1h btr concentration in wastewater in all sbrs the aeration process most likely also influenced the removal efficiency which for the first 150 min of the aeration mixing process ranged from 1 8 1h btr dose 300 μg l 1 to 24 41 1h btr dose 150 μg l 1 and was not proportional to the concentration of tested compound in raw wastewater in the control sbr effluent without the addition of 1h btr standard after the first 150 min the concentration of 1h btr ranged from 1 48 to 8 81 μg l 1 the increase in the concentration of 1h btr to a value of 8 81 μg l 1 testified to a further release of this benzotriazole accumulated during the previous sbr cycles in activated sludge a further 150 min of aeration and mixing phase of wastewater and activated sludge in the sbr d e resulted in a significantly higher removal of 1h btr from the wastewater during all test series this pattern was observed both in the sbrs to which the effluent with 1h btr was fed and in the control reactor concentration reduction of up to 47 22 the efficiency of 1h btr removal from wastewater during the second half of the aeration and mixing phase d e in sbrs ranged from 12 45 1h btr dose 300 μg l 1 to 40 48 1h btr dose 600 μg l 1 there was no proportional increase noted in the removal efficiency of 1h btr in this process phase when the dose of test compound in raw wastewater was increased it was found during the 300 min aeration and mixing phase c e that its effectiveness varied greatly and ranged from 30 to 52 9 the only exception was the sbr fed with an effluent dose of 300 μg l 1 and in this particular sbr only the next process phase contributed to the effective removal of the tested compound the removal of 1h btr from wastewater in the aeration phase combined with the mixing of the sbr contents using flocculent activated sludge occurred most effectively at concentrations of 1h btr in raw wastewater in the range 100 200 and 600 1000 μg l 1 table 5 in this study hydroxylation and or methylation of the benzene and triazole ring most likely occurred in the aerated activated sludge as confirmed in literature 59 an important fact is that the methylated and hydroxylated products appear after the same time which most likely indicates the simultaneous occurrence of several metabolic pathways of benzotriazole transformation 60 have identified 27 potential benzotriazole transformation products six of which demonstrate the highest analytical signal intensity from a tandem mass spectrometer a comparison of 1h btr efficiency removal from wastewater during the first and second half of the aeration phase is shown in fig 4 the removal of 1h btr from wastewater by aerobic microbiological processes not taking into account dilution of raw wastewater with sbr content b e had high efficiency from 40 to 56 for 5 out of 9 assumed doses of 1h btr despite maintaining identical technological parameters of the treatment process concentration of activated sludge biomass dissolved oxygen concentration length and sequence of process phases volume exchange ratio etc in wastewater containing a dose of 1h btr between 250 and 500 μg l 1 the efficiency oscillated around 30 however in the sbr with the lowest assumed concentration of the tested compound it was probably the microbiological processes which caused an increase in the concentration of 1h btr in wastewater from 5 77 in the wastewater after filling the sbr to 14 47 μg l 1 after the end of the aeration phase it was found that the mixing ii phase e f in the sbr operation cycle denitrification lasting 30 min series i contributed to further removal of 1h btr from wastewater the efficiency of its removal at this stage of treatment process was inversely proportional to the dose of 1h btr introduced into the raw wastewater 50 μg l 1 27 09 and 200 μg l 1 4 89 no increase of 1h btr concentration was observed in wastewater in any sbr which indicates correct assumptions for the anoxic mixing phase ii duration e f in contrast an increase in effluent 1h btr concentration was observed in series ii and iii of the study at the same stage of wastewater treatment process the exception was the sbr in which wastewater was fed with a dose of 1h btr of 300 μg l 1 capturing of the increase in concentration of tested benzotriazole in wastewater was possible due to a detailed analysis of the entire cycle of the sbr operation and may have resulted from the extension of the mixing phase ii from 30 to 60 min series ii and iii it should be stressed that during the studies in series i when the time of the e f phase was half as long 30 min no increases in the concentration of 1h btr were recorded it is extremely important that literature shows the total efficiency of the biological wastewater treatment process and not partial values at the end of the individual stages it is likely that a complete elimination or shortening of the mixing phase after aeration would prevent an increase in the concentration of 1h btr in wastewater the effectiveness of mixing phases i and ii are compared in fig 5 during the flocculent activated sludge settling phase and the decantation of the sbr treated effluent f g the concentration of 1h btr in the effluent was further reduced the gradual decrease of 1h btr in sbr during each experimental cycle is shown in fig s1 the quality of the treated wastewater with standard deviation is shown in fig s2 despite the same technological parameters the quality of the treated wastewater differed significantly this was related to the different initial dose of 1h btr in raw wastewater in the sbr the efficiency of this process phase ranged from 1 to 32 it should be noted that the 40 min settling phase did not lead to the release of 1h btr from activated sludge into the treated effluent in the concentration range from 50 to 500 μg l 1 table 5 this indicates the urgent need to change technological assumptions of treatment processes with high doses of benzotriazole a similar situation was reported by ref 39 and it could be explained by the varying sorption of target compounds in activated sludge and their subsequent desorption by successive portions of wastewater as can be seen in figs 3 5 the results obtained in the control sbr differed significantly from the results in the other sbrs this was related to the much lower concentration of 1h btr in sbr1 wastewater the range of concentrations of 1h btr in the influent and effluent with corresponding total removal efficiencies of this micropollutant are shown in fig 6 the process of 1h btr removal from sewage in sbr with flocculent activated sludge had the highest efficiency 80 with analysed compound concentration in raw wastewater of 50 200 μg l 1 fig 6 it should be emphasized that the concentration of 1h btr of 200 μg l 1 is the limit for highly efficient removal of 1h btr from wastewater in biological processes and with even higher concentration the activated sludge method becomes definitely less effective the relevant biodegradation kinetics of 1h btr removal for each sbr phases are shown in table s2 the efficiency of 1h btr removal in sbr obtained in this study was higher than that reported for cas by refs 19 49 from 13 to 62 52 from 0 to 72 and 39 37 3 it was also higher than that reported for mbrs 61 18 it is noteworthy that the obtained efficiency of 1h btr removal from wastewater in sbr is very similar to that reported by ref 52 the researchers noted that the removal of btr by biodegradation in their study was 84 while the removal by sorption on activated sludge flocs was only 0 5 the researchers explained the difference between determined and calculated efficiencies about 13 as resulting from mbr reactor filtration the removal efficiency of 1h btr in sbr in wwtp was 46 1 39 the reason for the lower efficiencies may be the fact that raw wastewater flowing into the wwtp contains various btr derivatives which are degraded by treatment processes taking place thus increasing the concentration of 1h btr in the effluent the reason for obtaining such high efficiency of 1h btr removal in model sbrs in this study could also be caused by well chosen technological parameters of the wastewater treatment process activated sludge that adapted to increased doses of 1h btrs in wastewater another reason could be the absence of complex compounds containing btrs in their structure drugs dyes buvs antimicrobial agents etc in significant concentrations in synthetic wastewater such high efficiency of 1h btr removal from wastewater may have also been influenced by very favourable environmental conditions stable temperature adapted insolation etc according to ref 27 different environmental conditions influence differences in photochemical transformation processes hydrolysis and microbial degradation pathways high removal efficiency of 1h btr in laboratory sbrs in this study could be caused by the long srt which favoured the presence of slow growing microorganisms adapted to the disposal of poorly degradable pollutants 52 51 61 also highlighted the advantages of maintaining a long srt in biological chambers and consequently the development of microorganisms capable of degrading 1h btr as well as a sufficiently long hrt which additionally had a beneficial effect on the removal of degradable organic compounds it is worth noting that no deterioration of activated sludge parameters settleability odour colour and floc structure was observed over the 137 days of testing in the model sbrs 22 show no major effect of 1h btr on zebrafish at a concentration of 1197 μg l 1 while a study by ref 31 proved no effect on microalgae growth at a 1h btr concentration of 200 μg l 1 in wastewater in addition the wastewater treatment process took place in sbr which is a technology known for its flexibility and wide range of applications another reason influencing the high efficiency of 1h btr removal from wastewater could be the correct adaptation time of activated sludge biomass literature reports that at low concentrations of btrs in raw wastewater these micropollutants can be degraded by cometabolic processes 62 while when they are at high concentrations they can be degraded catabolically 52 an adequate adaptation time was necessary and provided in the conducted research 52 reported very high total btr removal efficiency in an mbr reactor 97 20 2 59 however three periods of unstable operation and two periods of stable operation were evident during their experiment periods of unstable operation were not observed in studies conducted in the sbrs even with the highest doses of 1h btr the treatment system operated in a stable way throughout the study period which means that the flocculent activated sludge in the sbrs was not shocked and the biomass was able to adapt to the presence of this micropollutant the transformation pathways of 1h btr by biodegradation and biotransformation under aerobic and anaerobic conditions are known 11 51 52 57 63 57 reported five products under aerobic conditions such as phenol phthalic acid 1 methylbenzotriazole 1h benzotriazole 4 methoxy and 1h benzotriazole 5 methoxy and four degradation products under anaerobic conditions such as phenol 1 methylbenzotriazole dimethyl benzylamine and carbazole authors pointed the main processes of 1h btr transformation to be methylaton on nitrogen atom of the triazole chain addition of o ch3 group to the para and meta position carbon atom of benzene ring formation via scission of triazole chain and then acidification of benzene ring and formation by n n bond scission followed by polymerization it is worth emphasising that initial methylation of 1h btr occurring under aerobic and anaerobic conditions 51 52 identified the following compounds as products of 1h btr transformations 4 hydroxybenzotriazole 1 hydroxybenzotriazole dihydroxybenzotriazole the attachment site of the hydroxyl groups could not be unequivocally indicated 1 methylbenzotriazole 4 methylbenzotriazole and or 5 methylbenzotriazole and 5 hydroxy 1 2 3 triazole 51 identified hydroxylation and methylation as the most important transformation processes of 1h btr and noted poor sorption of 1h btr on activated sludge flocs 52 63 identified cleavage of the benzene ring while 11 57 the benzene or and the triazole ring of 1h btr as critical for further mineralization of this compound 11 reported that redox conditions changing from aerobic to anaerobic including nitrate reducing sulphate reducing and methanogenic conditions could have a significant effect on the biodegradation of organic compounds cleavage of the aromatic ring and oxidation hydroxylation polymerization methylation and methoxylation leading to the formation of products such as phenols carboxylic acids aldeydes ketones and amines 64 31 has highlighted biodegradation bioaccumulation and bioadsorption as key processes contributing to the removal of organic micropollutants along with enzymes and heterotrophic metabolism of algae 31 also identified hydroxylation oxidation and methylation as the main reaction mechanisms for btrs 51 proved that transformation of 1h btr via biological pathway by bacteria of the pseudomonas putida and raoultella ornithinolytica species and their mixture occurred slowly and inefficiently which demonstrated the adverse effects of this compound on the mentioned microorganisms it also confirmed that a complex and adapted consortium of microorganisms such as activated sludge biomass is necessary for the metabolism and transformation of 1h btr autotrophs which are relative to heterotrophs are a more sensitive group of microorganisms to 1h btr 51 59 highlighted that at least two phototransformation pathways of 1h btr have been observed the first involving the opening of the triazole ring and the formation of 2 aminophenol followed by further transformations the second pathway involved the opening of the triazole ring and the formation of phenazine by coupling of the resulting derivatives it should be highlighted that the transformation pathway of 1h btr was not crucial for the conducted research however the removal efficiency of this compound in aerobic and anaerobic phases of subsequent operating cycle in sbr depended on the concentration of this micropollutant in raw wastewater 4 conclusions the study was undertaken to analyse in detail the removal of 1h btr from wastewater in sbr with activated sludge technology a number of technological parameters were used in the study consistent with those used in real wastewater treatment plants modifications to the sbr operating cycle were also undertaken the conducted research has shown 1 the concentration of 1h btr in wastewater changed in individual phases of the treatment process in sbr with flocculated activated sludge 2 in the aerobic phase in sbr the degradation of 1h btr occurred with higher efficiency than under anoxic and anaerobic conditions regardless of the dose of benzotriazole in the raw wastewater 3 in the anaerobic mixing phases i defosfatation and ii denitrification the decomposition of the organic compound 1h btr was 5 3 and 4 9 times slower respectively compared to aerobic conditions 4 in the vast majority of test cycles increasing the mixing phase ii denitrification from 30 to 60 min contributed to the release of 1h btr from activated sludge into wastewater treated in sbr 5 even the highest dose of 1h btr in raw wastewater 1000 μg l 1 fed to the sbr three times daily for a period of 105 days did not stop the treatment process and did not deteriorate the properties of the activated sludge 6 it was found that removal of 1h btr with more than 80 efficiency is possible at effluent concentrations not exceeding 200 μg l 1 and with long hrt and srt higher concentrations of 1h btr in wastewater lead to a sharp decrease in removal efficiency the higher the concentration of 1h btr the lower the removal

8753,this paper presents a hybrid advanced oxidation process aop based on sonocavitational activation of persulfate ps for degradation of 1 4 dioxane during wastewater treatment application of sono cavitation effectively convert ps to radical species demonstrating synergistic effect by increasing the reaction rate and reducing the required energy for activation it is economically feasible and deployed alternative to the direct thermal activation method a single and two stage injection of ps were compared to eliminate self scavenging effects related to excess of oxidant in system a gc ms analysis was used to determine the degradation products of dioxane and to propose the degradation mechanism the studies revealed that the degradation was significantly enhanced by the addition of ps at molar ratio of oxidant to pollutant 4 with a two stage injection under optimal conditions at us density of 105 w cm2 dioxane with an initial concentration of 100 mg l was completely degraded in 120 min graphical abstract image 1 keywords persulfate ultrasound cavitation mineralization wastewater treatment radicals 1 introduction 1 4 dioxane dioxane is a one of the emerging micropollutants in wastewater groundwater and drinking water due to its widespread use in the production of paint surface coatings detergent cosmetics cleaning agents corrosion inhibitors etc dioxane is a human carcinogen classified as a potential carcinogenic compound b2 class by the international agency for research on cancer iarc the presence of ppm levels of dioxane in water may cause severe health issues 1 2 recent water purification method such as reverse osmosis is inefficient to reject dioxane and its derivatives some studies reported that activated sludge process as well as sewage treatment plants could remove the dioxane with 30 80 efficiency 3 4 recently several attempts have been made to remove dioxane from various water resources using biofiltration method 5 microbial based degradation 6 advanced oxidation processes aops 7 including tio2 h2o2 uv process h2o2 fe ii 8 9 metal oxide catalyst 10 solar photolysis with n doped immobilized photocatalyst 11 fenton like catalyst combination of fe0 and uv light electrochemical oxidation 12 ceramic membrane based removal 13 etc however only the partial removal of dioxane was reported in most of the aops and therefore it requires the combination of two or more methods most of aops require high energy input large catalyst loadings complex configuration of the reactor system which prohibit the implementation of these methods on industrial scale application of persulfate ps in wastewater treatment is getting increasing attention due to high stability low cost and non selective reaction chemistry paths that can achieve complete mineralization of treated contaminants 14 17 compared to h2o2 the consumption of ps over the moles of the contaminant was found lower as the reaction stoichiometric efficiency rse of ps is higher 18 21 thus studies on activation of ps using iron powder and fe based metal organic frameworks mofs resulted in rse of 5 and 40 respectively 18 20 in the case of uv 254 and heat activated ps the values of rse were up to 55 and 60 respectively 21 22 as a part of aops ps was highlighted effective in the degradation of chloramphenicol 23 benzoic acid 24 heat activated ps engenders sulfate so4 and hydroxyl ho radicals which are more commanding activator capable to effectively oxidize the organic content in wastewater 25 26 heat activated ps was used in industrial wastewater for removal of dinitrodiazophenol 27 bisphenol 28 29 chloramphenicol 23 carbon tetrachloride 28 lindane 30 31 chloroxylenol 32 mono and dichlorobenzenes 31 33 etc independently the process based on ps activation has certain limitations derived from the higher activation energy ranging from 140 to 180 kj mol this factor raises the issues which enforce to heat the wastewater 40 80 c and introduce large quantity of ps to increase the reaction rate however the above issues can be addressed by the use of combination of ps with cavitation based aops cavitation is the process which generates a variety of reactive species by generating high local temperature 5000 k and pressure 6 104 kpa through the collapse of cavitating bubbles 34 35 the cavitation conditions facilitate mass transport and the generated radicals are responsible for oxidation of pollutants some of the successful attempts were reported for degradation of benzene toluene ethylbenzene o xylene btex mixture using hydrodynamic cavitation and ps 16 the cavitation can also be combined with catalysts such as zero valent iron zno znfe2o4 nano size copper asphaltenes carbon black in the ps activation to intensify the oxidation processes 36 41 there are very few reports found on us assisted dioxane degradation 42 they reported the degradation of dioxane using four different frequencies and reported that us frequencies 358 khz showed better performance son et al reported the degradation kinetics of dioxane using us with the addition of fe0 fe2 and s2o8 2 43 they reported that addition of oxidants not only increased the rate of reaction but also change the kinetic models the solvents such as ethanol and ccl4 had a significant effect on the dioxane degradation through the decrease in the thermal effect of cavitation and the generation of reactive chlorine species respectively 44 in addition the sono cavitation processes were effective in the simultaneous degradation of dioxane and trichloroethane degradation 45 they reported that dioxane and trichloroethane degradation is higher at 15 c with ps concertation of 1 50 mmol l at the frequency of 400 khz with power 100 w briefly most of reports shows that ps is being used for degradation of different organic compounds from wastewater with aops such as catalyst 39 46 mofs 20 zero valent metals 18 19 47 48 ozone 49 or hydrodynamic cavitation 16 further there are few reports were found which report the dioxane degradation with us and ps therefore this work was carried out with the following objectives firstly to study the effect of us assisted ps activation in an ultrasonic processor optimize ps dose comparing single and dual stage oxidant addition next to study the kinetics of degradation and to identify the intermediate products to propose the degradation pathway 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals 1 4 dioxane c4h8o2 sodium persulfate na2s2o8 dichloromethane and methanol were purchased from poch poland tert butyl alcohol was purchased from sigma aldrich germany all chemicals and solvents were of analytical grade and used without further purification 2 2 experimental procedures dioxane degradation experiments were performed in ultrasonic probe reactor hielscher 400th fig 1 the degradation was performed at an operating fixed frequency of 24 khz and sonotrode tip diameter of 22 mm s24d22d acoustic power is 180 w the ultrasound tip active area was 3 8 cm2 the power output of ultrasound probe was 400 w hence 105 w cm2 was effective ultrasound intensity for each experiment the main variable in the process is amplitude that can be varied from 0 to 100 in a typical procedure 500 ml of aqueous solution containing 100 mg l of dioxane was placed in us steel reactor the reactor was circulated with cold water supplied from refrigerated bath chrompack rte 110b neslab instruments usa to maintain the temperature at 25 2 c the details of experimental setup are shown in fig 1 ps concentration was varied depending on the ratio between oxidant and dioxane r ox aliquots of samples with an approximate volume of 20 ml were taken before the beginning of treatment every 20 min in the first hour and each hour within 120 min all experiments were conducted in deionized water without ph adjustment ph was measured by merck non bleeding ph paper strips 2 3 process control by means of gas chromatography a dispersive liquid liquid microextraction dllme method was used to preconcentrate the sample of dioxane 50 51 briefly a 10 g of the sample was weighed in a vial and 5 mg of the internal standard cyclohexanone was injected into each sample the mixture is then vigorously shaken then 0 5 ml of solvent mixture of dichloromethane and acetone 60 40 was added into the sample further shaking was carried out for 1 min followed by centrifugation eba 8s hettich germany carried at 5000 rpm for 10 min a 200 μl of the organic phase was placed into 2 ml vials with 300 μl micro inserts the vials were sealed with screw caps equipped with a ptfe lined silicone septum the quantitative analysis of dioxane was performed by clarus 580 perkinelmer usa gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector gc fid the gc fid settings were as follows temperature program 50 c 5 min ramped at 10 c min to 275 c 5 min detector temperature 275 c a nitrogen was used as carrier gas with volumetric flowrate of 5 ml min detector gases flow rate air 450 ml min hydrogen 40 ml min each sample was tested 2 times with injection volume of 2 μl a gcmsqp2010se shimadzu japan was employed for the identification of dioxane degradation by products a capillary column dha column 100 m 0 2 mm id 0 1 um was used to perform gc ms analysis under following settings hydrogen was used as carrier gas 1 ml min injection port temperature was 300 c and gc ms transfer line temperature was 310 c the oven temperature program was 40 c isothermal for 5 min ramped at 5 c min to 220 c ion source ei 70 ev temperature was 200 c a mass to charge ratio of 34 220 m z was selected for scan mode analysis of byproducts 3 results and discussion 3 1 role of ultrasound and oxygen during the degradation the experiments were performed with 500 ml solution with concentration of 100 ppm of dioxane and taking the samples after each 20 min time initially the experiments were carried out under sole acoustic sono cavitation as can be seen from fig 2 less than 25 of dioxane was degraded after 120 min of sonication and no further degradation was observed hence all the batch experiments were carried out for 120 min the results indicate that sonocavitation alone is not sufficient to degrade dioxane the possible reason is that the dioxane is highly hydrophilic the molecules remain mainly in aqueous phase and do not tend to reach the cavitation bubble region where the most of radical species are formed during the bubbles collapse hence almost 70 of dioxane remains in the solution the presence of oxygen in the system has also impact on dioxane degradation during sonication 43 the oxygen has less thermal conductivity thus during the bubble collapse the heat is not properly dissipated to the surrounding whatever the degradation is observed it is because of thermolysis of water to form reactive radicals 1 h 2 o h ho 2 h o 2 ho 2 3 ho ho h 2 o o 3 2 effect of persulfate addition on dioxane degradation several reports postulated that the addition of ps generates radicals which are giving faster and higher degradation rate compared to sole use of sonocavitation 52 54 therefore an attempt was made to understand the synergistic effect of sonocavitation and ps addition the molar ratio of oxidant to organic pollutant is defined as r ox 4 r o x m o l e s o f o x i d a n t m o l e s o f p o l l u t a n t in this study the degradation of dioxane was evaluated by varying r ox value from 0 04 to 4 results on optimization of r ox value are provided on fig 3 a significant improvement of degradation rate was observed the highest degradation of 85 was observed at r ox 4 it clearly indicates sonocavitation is effective for ps activation due to high temperature and pressure created during cavitational bubbles collapse which leads to cleavage of the o o bond in ps molecule eq 5 54 55 there are certain reports which show that ps was effectively activated by us for degradation of organic compounds for instance dichloromethane degradation was increased from 20 to 70 comparing sole us and us ps process 56 further comparing to other aops such as ozonation uv 57 the combination of ps with us leads to complete degradation 5 s 2 o 8 2 so 4 so 4 2 h 3 3 effect of sequential addition of ps for dioxane degradation optimization of oxidant dose mainly relates to concentration of pollutant however in every aop system there is a limiting concentration of oxidants a self scavenging effect was observed for most of oxidants including ps it follows from reactions of formed radical species with oxidant molecules in this case for too high concentrations of oxidant both radicals and oxidant react together which results in a lack of degradation increase or even decrease of degradation a reasonable solution to provide high amounts of oxidant without self scavenging effects seems to be continuous injection of oxidant solution during treatment or sequential injection of defined amounts in this study a two stage sequence of oxidant injection was studies as shown in fig 4 the addition of ps was carried out in two stages for the r ox 2 and r ox 4 it was found that with help of the r ox 2 a 90 of degradation was achieved in which 2 5 g l of ps was added initially and later after 1 h second 2 5 g l was added however still a complete degradation was not achieved hence a 5 g l was added in each stage as reported in fig 3 it was found that direct addition of 5 g l at initial stage r ox 2 is not sufficient as only 72 degradation was observed on the other hand 10 g l i e two stage addition of 5 g l r ox 4 gives the complete degradation of dioxane hence it indicates the optimal dosage of ps required for the effective degradation of dioxane the r ox 4 split into two stages showed that even the direct addition does not make difference in the degradation hence r ox 4 direct addition at initial stage is preferable and refers to 25 of rse the generation of active species such as so4 and ho radicals from ps requires an activation energy the energy required for oxidation process is thus significantly lowered under cavitation conditions the rse value obtained in this study is in acceptable level compared to the activation of ps using iron powder however further profound studies addressing the evolution of ps concentration in ps based processes in relation with r ox and rse are required in addition comparative studies of ps based processes in the aspect of economical feasibility using r ox rse represent an appealing prospective for future studies 3 4 kinetics of dioxane degradation using us and ps addition the pollutants in aops undergo pseudo first order kinetics degradation rate expression of dioxane can be expressed in terms of the concentration of dioxane and ps using following equation 6 d c a d t k c a x c p s y where c a is concentration of dioxane and c ps is concentration of ps k is reaction rate constant while x and y represent the order of reaction between dioxane and ps however as the concentration of ps is in excess the rate will depend on the concentration of the dioxane alone which is a rate limiting step 7 d c a d t k c a x as shown in fig 5 the addition of ps showed higher reaction rate constant values from 0 0231 0 0124 0 0065 0 0057 min 1 for r ox values of 4 2 0 4 0 04 respectively as reported in fig 6 r ox 4 and 2 with two step addition showed the reaction rate constant value of 0 0446 and 0 0177 min 1 respectively a comparable reaction rate constant was found in other study on dioxane degradation 45 58 the results clearly indicate that sonocavitation supports the ps activation for the degradation of dioxane however the two stage studies were not performed in the literature which is possible option to scale up the method for degradation of dioxane 3 5 identification of reactive species intermediate products and the degradation mechanism the main reactive species formed in sono ps are so4 and ho radicals since dioxane is highly hydrophilic the degradation by thermal effect of cavitation can be excluded therefore it is necessary to identify the contribution of each reactive species for the degradation of dioxane in such oxidation process scavenging experiment is the most common method in aops to identify these species the alcohols such as isopropyl alcohol ipa and tert butanol tba are the commonly used scavengers for ho and so4 radicals particularly high reaction rates of ipa with both ho and so4 radicals eqs 8 and 9 allow to determine the contribution of both radicals inhibiting the reaction of dioxane with so4 and ho radicals on other hand the reaction of tba proceeds faster with ho radicals and slowly with so4 radicals eqs 10 and 11 indicating the impact of so4 radicals on the degradation of dioxane 59 60 8 ipa ho ch 3 2 c oh h 2 o 1 9 10 9 m 1 s 1 9 ipa so 4 ch 3 2 c oh so 4 2 h 8 2 10 7 m 1 s 1 10 tba ho c h 2 c ch 3 2 oh h 2 o 6 0 10 8 m 1 s 1 11 tba so 4 c h 2 c ch 3 2 oh so 4 2 h 8 4 10 5 m 1 s 1 to effectively scavenge radicals the quenching experiments have been performed with ipa and tba at a pollutant to scavenger molar ratio of 1 10 the observed results are given in fig 7 it can be seen that more than 80 of the initial dioxane content was removed in the sono cavitation processes the addition of ipa and tba reduced the degradation to 15 and 20 respectively as ipa is highly reactive with both ho and so4 radicals the reduction of dioxane degradation efficiency was significant tba selectively quench ho radicals and the difference in reduction of dioxane degradation efficiency was merely 5 suggesting the minor contribution of so4 radicals in us ps process in other words these results confirm that ho radicals are the major reactive species involved in the degradation of dioxane in sono ps processes see fig 8 in general the reaction of ho radicals with organic contaminants leads to the formation of a number of intermediate products therefore another important step in aop is the analysis and identification of the possible intermediate products to examine the degradation pathways 1000 mg l 1 of dioxane solution was treated using us ps and the transformation products were analyzed using gc ms in scan mode according to the results ethylene glycol diformate egdf diethylene glycol glyoxylic acid and acetic acid were identified as major degradation products in treated samples fig 8 the presence of egdf and diethylene glycol indicates two possible degradation pathways of dioxane in us ps process at r ox 4 to our knowledge diethylene glycol was firstly detected amongst the products of dioxane degradation the initial steps of dioxane degradation imply h abstraction by ho radicals followed with a series of transformations to form 1 4 dioxan α oxyl radical as a primary precursor of intermediates 11 61 the formation of egdf m z 118 refers to the oxidative ring opening mechanism through δc c splitting at the α c position route i further fragmentation of egdf led to the formation of glyoxylic acid m z 74 this pathway is consistent with previously reported papers 11 45 61 62 on the other hand 1 4 dioxan α oxyl radical can undergo 1 2 h shift followed by the fission of c o bond yielding diethylene glycol m z 106 route ii diethylene glycol is subsequently oxidized and fragmented through β scission to generate glyoxylic acid and acetic acid m z 60 it is important to note that the characteristic peak of egdf was observed in treated samples within 45 min suggesting that route i pathway was predominant during the initial degradation steps however egdf was not found in the samples collected after 60 min and 120 min indicating route ii as predominant this can be due to the fact that diethylene glycol with α hydrogen acted as a strong scavenger of ho radicals thus suppressing the concurrent route i pathway finally these intermediates were not present in effluents after treatment revealing effectiveness of developed aop 4 conclusions activation of persulfate under sonocavitation for the degradation of dioxane was studied best process obtained for r ox 4 shows the degradation exceeding 95 important outcome of this study relates to aspects of sequential addition of oxidant by two steps to omit risks of self scavenging between formed radicals and excess of oxidant performed comparison revealed an advantageous addition of ps in two stages mode at r ox 4 providing complete degradation of dioxane in 120 min showing 25 of rse the degradation kinetics of dioxane followed the first order reaction and showed the highest k value at r ox 4 of 0 0231 min 1 and 0 0446 min 1 for single and two stage addition of ps respectively the scavenging experiment and the product analysis clearly showed that the mechanism of dioxane degradation proceeded through so4 and ho radicals sonolytic decomposition and oxidation to yield tetraoxide formation converting it into ethylene glycol diformate egdf

8753,this paper presents a hybrid advanced oxidation process aop based on sonocavitational activation of persulfate ps for degradation of 1 4 dioxane during wastewater treatment application of sono cavitation effectively convert ps to radical species demonstrating synergistic effect by increasing the reaction rate and reducing the required energy for activation it is economically feasible and deployed alternative to the direct thermal activation method a single and two stage injection of ps were compared to eliminate self scavenging effects related to excess of oxidant in system a gc ms analysis was used to determine the degradation products of dioxane and to propose the degradation mechanism the studies revealed that the degradation was significantly enhanced by the addition of ps at molar ratio of oxidant to pollutant 4 with a two stage injection under optimal conditions at us density of 105 w cm2 dioxane with an initial concentration of 100 mg l was completely degraded in 120 min graphical abstract image 1 keywords persulfate ultrasound cavitation mineralization wastewater treatment radicals 1 introduction 1 4 dioxane dioxane is a one of the emerging micropollutants in wastewater groundwater and drinking water due to its widespread use in the production of paint surface coatings detergent cosmetics cleaning agents corrosion inhibitors etc dioxane is a human carcinogen classified as a potential carcinogenic compound b2 class by the international agency for research on cancer iarc the presence of ppm levels of dioxane in water may cause severe health issues 1 2 recent water purification method such as reverse osmosis is inefficient to reject dioxane and its derivatives some studies reported that activated sludge process as well as sewage treatment plants could remove the dioxane with 30 80 efficiency 3 4 recently several attempts have been made to remove dioxane from various water resources using biofiltration method 5 microbial based degradation 6 advanced oxidation processes aops 7 including tio2 h2o2 uv process h2o2 fe ii 8 9 metal oxide catalyst 10 solar photolysis with n doped immobilized photocatalyst 11 fenton like catalyst combination of fe0 and uv light electrochemical oxidation 12 ceramic membrane based removal 13 etc however only the partial removal of dioxane was reported in most of the aops and therefore it requires the combination of two or more methods most of aops require high energy input large catalyst loadings complex configuration of the reactor system which prohibit the implementation of these methods on industrial scale application of persulfate ps in wastewater treatment is getting increasing attention due to high stability low cost and non selective reaction chemistry paths that can achieve complete mineralization of treated contaminants 14 17 compared to h2o2 the consumption of ps over the moles of the contaminant was found lower as the reaction stoichiometric efficiency rse of ps is higher 18 21 thus studies on activation of ps using iron powder and fe based metal organic frameworks mofs resulted in rse of 5 and 40 respectively 18 20 in the case of uv 254 and heat activated ps the values of rse were up to 55 and 60 respectively 21 22 as a part of aops ps was highlighted effective in the degradation of chloramphenicol 23 benzoic acid 24 heat activated ps engenders sulfate so4 and hydroxyl ho radicals which are more commanding activator capable to effectively oxidize the organic content in wastewater 25 26 heat activated ps was used in industrial wastewater for removal of dinitrodiazophenol 27 bisphenol 28 29 chloramphenicol 23 carbon tetrachloride 28 lindane 30 31 chloroxylenol 32 mono and dichlorobenzenes 31 33 etc independently the process based on ps activation has certain limitations derived from the higher activation energy ranging from 140 to 180 kj mol this factor raises the issues which enforce to heat the wastewater 40 80 c and introduce large quantity of ps to increase the reaction rate however the above issues can be addressed by the use of combination of ps with cavitation based aops cavitation is the process which generates a variety of reactive species by generating high local temperature 5000 k and pressure 6 104 kpa through the collapse of cavitating bubbles 34 35 the cavitation conditions facilitate mass transport and the generated radicals are responsible for oxidation of pollutants some of the successful attempts were reported for degradation of benzene toluene ethylbenzene o xylene btex mixture using hydrodynamic cavitation and ps 16 the cavitation can also be combined with catalysts such as zero valent iron zno znfe2o4 nano size copper asphaltenes carbon black in the ps activation to intensify the oxidation processes 36 41 there are very few reports found on us assisted dioxane degradation 42 they reported the degradation of dioxane using four different frequencies and reported that us frequencies 358 khz showed better performance son et al reported the degradation kinetics of dioxane using us with the addition of fe0 fe2 and s2o8 2 43 they reported that addition of oxidants not only increased the rate of reaction but also change the kinetic models the solvents such as ethanol and ccl4 had a significant effect on the dioxane degradation through the decrease in the thermal effect of cavitation and the generation of reactive chlorine species respectively 44 in addition the sono cavitation processes were effective in the simultaneous degradation of dioxane and trichloroethane degradation 45 they reported that dioxane and trichloroethane degradation is higher at 15 c with ps concertation of 1 50 mmol l at the frequency of 400 khz with power 100 w briefly most of reports shows that ps is being used for degradation of different organic compounds from wastewater with aops such as catalyst 39 46 mofs 20 zero valent metals 18 19 47 48 ozone 49 or hydrodynamic cavitation 16 further there are few reports were found which report the dioxane degradation with us and ps therefore this work was carried out with the following objectives firstly to study the effect of us assisted ps activation in an ultrasonic processor optimize ps dose comparing single and dual stage oxidant addition next to study the kinetics of degradation and to identify the intermediate products to propose the degradation pathway 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals 1 4 dioxane c4h8o2 sodium persulfate na2s2o8 dichloromethane and methanol were purchased from poch poland tert butyl alcohol was purchased from sigma aldrich germany all chemicals and solvents were of analytical grade and used without further purification 2 2 experimental procedures dioxane degradation experiments were performed in ultrasonic probe reactor hielscher 400th fig 1 the degradation was performed at an operating fixed frequency of 24 khz and sonotrode tip diameter of 22 mm s24d22d acoustic power is 180 w the ultrasound tip active area was 3 8 cm2 the power output of ultrasound probe was 400 w hence 105 w cm2 was effective ultrasound intensity for each experiment the main variable in the process is amplitude that can be varied from 0 to 100 in a typical procedure 500 ml of aqueous solution containing 100 mg l of dioxane was placed in us steel reactor the reactor was circulated with cold water supplied from refrigerated bath chrompack rte 110b neslab instruments usa to maintain the temperature at 25 2 c the details of experimental setup are shown in fig 1 ps concentration was varied depending on the ratio between oxidant and dioxane r ox aliquots of samples with an approximate volume of 20 ml were taken before the beginning of treatment every 20 min in the first hour and each hour within 120 min all experiments were conducted in deionized water without ph adjustment ph was measured by merck non bleeding ph paper strips 2 3 process control by means of gas chromatography a dispersive liquid liquid microextraction dllme method was used to preconcentrate the sample of dioxane 50 51 briefly a 10 g of the sample was weighed in a vial and 5 mg of the internal standard cyclohexanone was injected into each sample the mixture is then vigorously shaken then 0 5 ml of solvent mixture of dichloromethane and acetone 60 40 was added into the sample further shaking was carried out for 1 min followed by centrifugation eba 8s hettich germany carried at 5000 rpm for 10 min a 200 μl of the organic phase was placed into 2 ml vials with 300 μl micro inserts the vials were sealed with screw caps equipped with a ptfe lined silicone septum the quantitative analysis of dioxane was performed by clarus 580 perkinelmer usa gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector gc fid the gc fid settings were as follows temperature program 50 c 5 min ramped at 10 c min to 275 c 5 min detector temperature 275 c a nitrogen was used as carrier gas with volumetric flowrate of 5 ml min detector gases flow rate air 450 ml min hydrogen 40 ml min each sample was tested 2 times with injection volume of 2 μl a gcmsqp2010se shimadzu japan was employed for the identification of dioxane degradation by products a capillary column dha column 100 m 0 2 mm id 0 1 um was used to perform gc ms analysis under following settings hydrogen was used as carrier gas 1 ml min injection port temperature was 300 c and gc ms transfer line temperature was 310 c the oven temperature program was 40 c isothermal for 5 min ramped at 5 c min to 220 c ion source ei 70 ev temperature was 200 c a mass to charge ratio of 34 220 m z was selected for scan mode analysis of byproducts 3 results and discussion 3 1 role of ultrasound and oxygen during the degradation the experiments were performed with 500 ml solution with concentration of 100 ppm of dioxane and taking the samples after each 20 min time initially the experiments were carried out under sole acoustic sono cavitation as can be seen from fig 2 less than 25 of dioxane was degraded after 120 min of sonication and no further degradation was observed hence all the batch experiments were carried out for 120 min the results indicate that sonocavitation alone is not sufficient to degrade dioxane the possible reason is that the dioxane is highly hydrophilic the molecules remain mainly in aqueous phase and do not tend to reach the cavitation bubble region where the most of radical species are formed during the bubbles collapse hence almost 70 of dioxane remains in the solution the presence of oxygen in the system has also impact on dioxane degradation during sonication 43 the oxygen has less thermal conductivity thus during the bubble collapse the heat is not properly dissipated to the surrounding whatever the degradation is observed it is because of thermolysis of water to form reactive radicals 1 h 2 o h ho 2 h o 2 ho 2 3 ho ho h 2 o o 3 2 effect of persulfate addition on dioxane degradation several reports postulated that the addition of ps generates radicals which are giving faster and higher degradation rate compared to sole use of sonocavitation 52 54 therefore an attempt was made to understand the synergistic effect of sonocavitation and ps addition the molar ratio of oxidant to organic pollutant is defined as r ox 4 r o x m o l e s o f o x i d a n t m o l e s o f p o l l u t a n t in this study the degradation of dioxane was evaluated by varying r ox value from 0 04 to 4 results on optimization of r ox value are provided on fig 3 a significant improvement of degradation rate was observed the highest degradation of 85 was observed at r ox 4 it clearly indicates sonocavitation is effective for ps activation due to high temperature and pressure created during cavitational bubbles collapse which leads to cleavage of the o o bond in ps molecule eq 5 54 55 there are certain reports which show that ps was effectively activated by us for degradation of organic compounds for instance dichloromethane degradation was increased from 20 to 70 comparing sole us and us ps process 56 further comparing to other aops such as ozonation uv 57 the combination of ps with us leads to complete degradation 5 s 2 o 8 2 so 4 so 4 2 h 3 3 effect of sequential addition of ps for dioxane degradation optimization of oxidant dose mainly relates to concentration of pollutant however in every aop system there is a limiting concentration of oxidants a self scavenging effect was observed for most of oxidants including ps it follows from reactions of formed radical species with oxidant molecules in this case for too high concentrations of oxidant both radicals and oxidant react together which results in a lack of degradation increase or even decrease of degradation a reasonable solution to provide high amounts of oxidant without self scavenging effects seems to be continuous injection of oxidant solution during treatment or sequential injection of defined amounts in this study a two stage sequence of oxidant injection was studies as shown in fig 4 the addition of ps was carried out in two stages for the r ox 2 and r ox 4 it was found that with help of the r ox 2 a 90 of degradation was achieved in which 2 5 g l of ps was added initially and later after 1 h second 2 5 g l was added however still a complete degradation was not achieved hence a 5 g l was added in each stage as reported in fig 3 it was found that direct addition of 5 g l at initial stage r ox 2 is not sufficient as only 72 degradation was observed on the other hand 10 g l i e two stage addition of 5 g l r ox 4 gives the complete degradation of dioxane hence it indicates the optimal dosage of ps required for the effective degradation of dioxane the r ox 4 split into two stages showed that even the direct addition does not make difference in the degradation hence r ox 4 direct addition at initial stage is preferable and refers to 25 of rse the generation of active species such as so4 and ho radicals from ps requires an activation energy the energy required for oxidation process is thus significantly lowered under cavitation conditions the rse value obtained in this study is in acceptable level compared to the activation of ps using iron powder however further profound studies addressing the evolution of ps concentration in ps based processes in relation with r ox and rse are required in addition comparative studies of ps based processes in the aspect of economical feasibility using r ox rse represent an appealing prospective for future studies 3 4 kinetics of dioxane degradation using us and ps addition the pollutants in aops undergo pseudo first order kinetics degradation rate expression of dioxane can be expressed in terms of the concentration of dioxane and ps using following equation 6 d c a d t k c a x c p s y where c a is concentration of dioxane and c ps is concentration of ps k is reaction rate constant while x and y represent the order of reaction between dioxane and ps however as the concentration of ps is in excess the rate will depend on the concentration of the dioxane alone which is a rate limiting step 7 d c a d t k c a x as shown in fig 5 the addition of ps showed higher reaction rate constant values from 0 0231 0 0124 0 0065 0 0057 min 1 for r ox values of 4 2 0 4 0 04 respectively as reported in fig 6 r ox 4 and 2 with two step addition showed the reaction rate constant value of 0 0446 and 0 0177 min 1 respectively a comparable reaction rate constant was found in other study on dioxane degradation 45 58 the results clearly indicate that sonocavitation supports the ps activation for the degradation of dioxane however the two stage studies were not performed in the literature which is possible option to scale up the method for degradation of dioxane 3 5 identification of reactive species intermediate products and the degradation mechanism the main reactive species formed in sono ps are so4 and ho radicals since dioxane is highly hydrophilic the degradation by thermal effect of cavitation can be excluded therefore it is necessary to identify the contribution of each reactive species for the degradation of dioxane in such oxidation process scavenging experiment is the most common method in aops to identify these species the alcohols such as isopropyl alcohol ipa and tert butanol tba are the commonly used scavengers for ho and so4 radicals particularly high reaction rates of ipa with both ho and so4 radicals eqs 8 and 9 allow to determine the contribution of both radicals inhibiting the reaction of dioxane with so4 and ho radicals on other hand the reaction of tba proceeds faster with ho radicals and slowly with so4 radicals eqs 10 and 11 indicating the impact of so4 radicals on the degradation of dioxane 59 60 8 ipa ho ch 3 2 c oh h 2 o 1 9 10 9 m 1 s 1 9 ipa so 4 ch 3 2 c oh so 4 2 h 8 2 10 7 m 1 s 1 10 tba ho c h 2 c ch 3 2 oh h 2 o 6 0 10 8 m 1 s 1 11 tba so 4 c h 2 c ch 3 2 oh so 4 2 h 8 4 10 5 m 1 s 1 to effectively scavenge radicals the quenching experiments have been performed with ipa and tba at a pollutant to scavenger molar ratio of 1 10 the observed results are given in fig 7 it can be seen that more than 80 of the initial dioxane content was removed in the sono cavitation processes the addition of ipa and tba reduced the degradation to 15 and 20 respectively as ipa is highly reactive with both ho and so4 radicals the reduction of dioxane degradation efficiency was significant tba selectively quench ho radicals and the difference in reduction of dioxane degradation efficiency was merely 5 suggesting the minor contribution of so4 radicals in us ps process in other words these results confirm that ho radicals are the major reactive species involved in the degradation of dioxane in sono ps processes see fig 8 in general the reaction of ho radicals with organic contaminants leads to the formation of a number of intermediate products therefore another important step in aop is the analysis and identification of the possible intermediate products to examine the degradation pathways 1000 mg l 1 of dioxane solution was treated using us ps and the transformation products were analyzed using gc ms in scan mode according to the results ethylene glycol diformate egdf diethylene glycol glyoxylic acid and acetic acid were identified as major degradation products in treated samples fig 8 the presence of egdf and diethylene glycol indicates two possible degradation pathways of dioxane in us ps process at r ox 4 to our knowledge diethylene glycol was firstly detected amongst the products of dioxane degradation the initial steps of dioxane degradation imply h abstraction by ho radicals followed with a series of transformations

route i further fragmentation of egdf led to the formation of glyoxylic acid m z 74 this pathway is consistent with previously reported papers 11 45 61 62 on the other hand 1 4 dioxan α oxyl radical can undergo 1 2 h shift followed by the fission of c o bond yielding diethylene glycol m z 106 route ii diethylene glycol is subsequently oxidized and fragmented through β scission to generate glyoxylic acid and acetic acid m z 60 it is important to note that the characteristic peak of egdf was observed in treated samples within 45 min suggesting that route i pathway was predominant during the initial degradation steps however egdf was not found in the samples collected after 60 min and 120 min indicating route ii as predominant this can be due to the fact that diethylene glycol with α hydrogen acted as a strong scavenger of ho radicals thus suppressing the concurrent route i pathway finally these intermediates were not present in effluents after treatment revealing effectiveness of developed aop 4 conclusions activation of persulfate under sonocavitation for the degradation of dioxane was studied best process obtained for r ox 4 shows the degradation exceeding 95 important outcome of this study relates to aspects of sequential addition of oxidant by two steps to omit risks of self scavenging between formed radicals and excess of oxidant performed comparison revealed an advantageous addition of ps in two stages mode at r ox 4 providing complete degradation of dioxane in 120 min showing 25 of rse the degradation kinetics of dioxane followed the first order reaction and showed the highest k value at r ox 4 of 0 0231 min 1 and 0 0446 min 1 for single and two stage addition of ps respectively the scavenging experiment and the product analysis clearly showed that the mechanism of dioxane degradation proceeded through so4 and ho radicals sonolytic decomposition and oxidation to yield tetraoxide formation converting it into ethylene glycol diformate egdf

8754,this work employs the data envelopment analysis technique to assess the water use efficiency of companies and the water reduction potential of industrial categories in industrial zones fifty eight companies were selected from four industrial categories wearing apparel wa 18 fabricated metal fm 12 rubber and plastic rp 12 and other manufacturing om 12 based on six variables monthly water usage two types of effluent contaminant loadings monthly production capacity number of employees and surface occupied by a company the results indicate that significant numbers of companies are inefficient in water use namely wa 28 om 42 fm 43 and rp 46 implementing technical measures to improve water use efficiency at these companies offers a varying water reduction potential per industrial category namely in the order rp 25 fm 17 wa 7 om 4 these results show that improving water efficiency by water use minimization is not the only ptential measure for improving the industrial zone s water metabolism towards self sufficiency keywords data envelopment analysis dea water reduction potential industrial water use efficiency 1 introduction a global increase in water demand water pollution and climate change have negatively influenced worldwide freshwater availability 1 this has led to competition for water use among agricultural urban and industrial sectors 2 6 this issue has drawn the interest of international and national researchers who investigated this effect in vietnam over the past two decades 7 10 in vietnam like in many other emerging economies a root cause of this competition is the increased demand due to a proliferation of industrial zones izs 10 13 water imports from adjacent regions for the industry are now a frequent practice the approach of integrated industrial water resource management has been developed to resolve water competition here sustainable industrial water supply is the main component 2 14 15 within sustainable industrial water supply new ways to ensure water security are provided by accessing modern water supply technologies for processes and in company sanitation increasing water efficiency and using alternative local resources 16 minimizing water demand through efficient appliances and methods adapted to the particular industry is an essential first step 17 this strategy has been widely adopted to reduce processing water in many industries 18 24 however these studies did not address the water reduction potential wrp as a crucial indicator they focused exclusively on minimizing waste through recycling and reuse secondly previous studies were limited to minimizing water consumption at a specific industrial manufacturing type separately e g food palm oil sugar plant slaughterhouse and other industries and sometimes to the individual company level the quantity of water used and potential reduction may vary significantly over several industry types and among the industries in one category 25 27 therefore it is interesting to compare the water demand performances of groups of similar industries to identify the opportunities for minimizing water demand by comparing these one can assess the potential minimum amount of water needed by a company without straining its economic processing capacity the amount of water used above such a minimal theoretical water requirement can be defined as water use inefficiency or water reduction potential thirdly agudelo vera et al 28 who focused on urban water management proposed that technology implementation is an option to achieve water demand minimization but did not indicate feasible benchmarks for the quantity of water to be reduced defining water minimization targets can give direction to which extent the technology should be implemented in specific situations in their case urban building 28 and in the case presented here types of industries in izs lastly traditional attempts to evaluate efficiency often encounter technical difficulties when multiple variables need to be considered thus a technique that can handle many variables and constraints within the complex problems in industrial water management is useful to our knowledge no prior studies have introduced such target for individual companies within industrial categories semi structured interviews in 2017 revealed that industrial zone authorities izas which are operating the izs in the saigon river delta favor measures at the level of single industrial companies to reduce fresh potable water consumption such measures for instance by industrial technology improvement can be practically implemented because i the scale of intervention measures is relatively small and much easier to implement than at the scale of the whole industrial zone ii private companies are in the self control of financial and technological aspects e g measures can be implemented under their transparent management regime and iii to arrive at freshwater use reduction beyond each company the existing water infrastructure of izs would need to be drastically adjusted to adopt new water supply and associated technologies and thus reduction measures at single companies can be easily applied and framed within current legal arrangements between industrial zone authority and industry for this a quantitative method to assess water in efficiency related to the water saving potential of industrial companies is needed such a method could support organizations e g industrial zone authorities to evaluate the current water efficiency among companies in different sectors and implement policies to adopt water demand minimization strategies and make their izs more water efficient the objective of this study was to develop a method for assessing the wrp of industrial categories within izs considering multiple variables this work i provides a tool that water managers can use at various levels to assess the water use efficiencies of individual companies and the wrp of industrial categories in industrial zones izs and ii proposes management actions that direct inefficient industrial companies to improve water use efficiency by benchmarking and comparing industries belonging to the same category on their water usage one can quantify the minimal theoretical water supply needed by a company without economic straining its processing performance the overall aim is to investigate the feasibility of a demand minimization approach at the iz level for selected companies as an example for other izs in the saigon river and other deltas 2 methods the data envelopment analysis dea technique 29 30 was used to assess the water demand minimization potential in an iz within the dea a decision making unit dmu is defined as a single company within an iz 2 1 three step approach the objective of this study was realized in three steps firstly variables for the dea were defined for assessing water use efficiency based on a literature review and semi structured interviews with environmental experts employed at the environmental department in local universities environmental consultancy companies industrial zone infrastructure companies and governmental agencies the companies within studied izs were selected based on their available variable data on monthly water usage contaminant loadings monthly production capacity number of employees and surface occupied by a company secondly the defined variables for the dea were collected through questionnaires filled out by selected industrial companies and industrial zone infrastructure companies the variable data were collected from january to december 2017 and the mean value of each data was used in the dea analysis it is important to compare all the companies within one fixed time frame to have a correct assessment as was done in this study repeating the assessment in five years could indicate trends in the development of the water use efficiency of industrial companies in an iz lastly water use efficiencies of single companies of the same type of industry were assessed with and without considering the effects of pollutants in the effluent using the dea technique as shown below thus the methodology can only compare the companies of each specific industry and does not encompass companies among different categories based on the results the water reduction potential was assessed for other companies and discussed in terms of significance for resolving water scarcity problems for izs 2 2 industry type selection four industries categorized by the standard for industrial classification issued by the ministry of planning and investment of vietnam were selected for dea analysis these were the manufacturing of 1 rubber and plastic rp 2 fabricated metal products fm 3 other manufacturings om and 4 wearing apparel wa a limited range of industrial categories was chosen because of a requirement for the minimum number of companies in one category 31 with three inputs and three outputs the minimum number of companies in each type of industry was determined to be twelve namely twice the sum of three inputs and three outputs 32 with a sample size in each type of industry above twelve there is a greater probability of capturing highly efficient companies in the water use 33 the three izs tan thuan ttiz hiep phuoc hpiz and long hau lhiz have heterogenous industries distribution and provide a sufficient sample for data analysis which is 13 companies for rp ttiz 9 hpiz 1 lhiz 3 14 companies for fm ttiz 11 hpiz 3 12 companies for om ttiz 10 lhiz 2 and 18 companies for wa ttiz 15 lhiz 3 2 3 data envelopment analysis charnes et al 30 and banker et al 29 were the first who proposed the dea technique for evaluating the performances of different entities for various activities and contexts in different countries many scholars have successfully applied the dea technique to evaluate efficiency in education health care finances car maintenance etc 34 37 and in water use 38 the main advantage of dea is that the technique i allows for evaluating the efficiency of multiple variables without reassigning weights and specifying any functioning form 30 ii does not require an extensive observation like traditional statistical analysis methods and iii allows the user to establish relative efficiency of each dmu within an observation set up 39 depending on the evaluation purpose multiple variables can be set as either input or output variables for the dea to calculate efficiency since the dimensions of input and output variables are different e g monthly freshwater use m3 month number of employees persons etc linear programming of the dea converts multiple inputs and outputs into virtual input and virtual output respectively making these dimensionless 40 the water use efficiency of the dmu to be evaluated dmuo is calculated by the ratio of virtual output per virtual input as follows equation 1 θ 0 v i r t u a l o u t p u t v i r t u a l i n p u t r 1 s u r y r o i 1 m v i x i o u 1 y 1 o u s y s o v 1 x 1 o v s x m o 1 where θ o is the measure of the efficiency of dmuo with subscripts of o is the dmu being evaluated and o 1 2 n i and r present that dmuo uses i 1 2 m inputs to generate r 1 2 s outputs x io is the amount of input i th for o th dmu y ro is the amount of output r th for the o th dmu u and v are the output and input weights generated in the solution of the dea equations the industrial water use efficiency at a specific iz was assessed by the initial basic frontier models ccr i 30 and bcc i 29 charnes cooper rhodes ccr banker charnes cooper bcc the economy of scale does not play a role in the ccr i model whereas it does in the bcc i model comparing ccr i and bcc i results could reveal the sources of inefficiency that a company under assessment might have to evaluate the efficiency using linear programming it is advisable to apply the dual problem approach since i a computer can save time in solving dual problems and ii dual problems are more straightforward to interpret results 40 the argumentation behind using the dual problem approach is described in the supplementary material s1 of this article 2 4 efficiencies in water use overall ccr technical bcc and scale se efficiency and slack in this study the ccr i and bcc i assessment identified a group of efficient companies with regard to water use and assigned them a score of one the variable data of this group serves as a benchmark to which all other companies are compared fig s1 supplementary material s2 efficiency scores were determined through dea results as a target for the inefficient companies that have efficiency scores of less than one but greater than zero to take measures to improve their performance the ccr i model score is known as ccr or overall efficiency while the bcc i model score is called bcc or technical efficiency 40 42 40 took the term technical efficiency from the literature on economics to distinguish the technological aspects of production from other aspects e g economic efficiency if a company has a bcc efficiency score of 1 but a lower ccr score then this company is operating technically efficient but not overall efficient due to a suboptimal scale according to cooper et al 40 and song et al 42 equation 2 scale efficiency se ccr efficiency bcc efficiency equation 2 indicates that the smaller the se value of a company the further off it is from its optimal scale 43 an inefficient company has room to further improve its efficiency by taking measures to achieve full efficiency this possibility to improve is referred to as slack the slacks can be either a surplus in portions of inefficiency as indicated by the distance from the bcc benchmark along the input axis input slack or a shortfall in portions of inefficiency along the output axis output slack fig s1 supplementary material s2 a company defined as bcc inefficient in water use indicates that managerial actions can improve the efficiency e g by proportionally reducing inputs monthly water use effluent cod or ammonium loads or combinations of those and combining this with maximizing output for instance by producing higher quantities of product in this study water use cod load and ammonium load slacks are expressed by s 1 s 2 and s 3 respectively herein the focus was on identifying the needs for measures addressing bcc inefficiencies since these are related to concrete actions in the operation of a company that can be demanded by izas the scale inefficiency was not addressed here since this can only be overcome by adjusting the company s size e g to a larger or lower size this means dealing with the domain of the strategic business policies of companies themselves and cannot be influenced by the izas 2 5 input and output selection in this study the chosen dea input variables were monthly water consumption m3 month complemented with cod load kg cod month and ammonium load kg n n h 4 month in the treated effluent of individual companies technically a contaminant load is the product of water flow rate monthly water consumption and the concentration of a contaminant when the water consumption is reduced the effluent concentration of the contaminant would increase and could exceed the effluent standard in this way the input parameters of water use and contaminant loads are coupled in the efficiency analysis the cod and ammonium were selected because they are key macro pollutant parameters in the national technical regulations of vietnam on industrial wastewater 56 and surface water quality 57 in addition cod is the main contaminant used to calculate the environmental protection fee for industrial wastewater treatment 55 later other parameters such as phosphate specific chemical pollutants organic micropollutants etc which exist in current regulations or emerging in future regulations could be added besides cod and ammonia were used as pollutant indicators to evaluate the industrial water use efficiency in terms of amounts of water pollutants generated discharges of these contaminants are inefficient as they deteriorate water resources in the local environment and diminish the availability of high quality water 38 44 in the first assessment the present study considered three inputs for calculating efficiencies by the dea monthly water consumption cod and ammonium loads in a second assessment only monthly water consumption was used as the input the effects of contaminants on water use assessment could be considered by comparing the two the present study set production capacity ton product month or the number of product month the number of employees employees company and surface area m2 company as the output variables for the dea these outputs were chosen since they contribute to the water use efficiency of a company in some industries e g in fm product capacity ton month or product month reflects the output benefit of industrial water resources while that of other types of industry e g wa is reflected by the quantity of labor person company water is mainly consumed for floor or surface cleaning and toilet flushing in industries like the warehousing industry besides all companies within the izs boundary are requested to maintain at least 20 of their rented surface area as a green space thus along with processing activities sanitation and cleaning companies also consume water for irrigation individual companies of the same industrial category were ranked as more efficient when water input to serve these outputs was less than others this study emphasized reducing inputs monthly water consumption monthly loads of cod and ammonium in effluent water of companies to achieve efficiency an input oriented version for both ccr and bcc models was considered appropriate for situations where the manager has control over the inputs 45 besides it reflects the focus of the study on consuming water more efficiently rather than increasing production the stages for assessing industrial water use are presented in fig 1 according to equation 1 water use efficiency can be promoted by decreasing inputs water usage and contaminant loads in an input oriented model 2 6 identification of management situations to improve the water use efficiency according to dea theory 40 the ccr efficiency score is the product of the bcc efficiency and scale efficiency scores θ c c r θ b c c θ s e four specific situations can be considered using this relationship i se ccr bcc 1 the company is at maximum efficiency ii se 1 and bcc 1 the overall ccr inefficiency is primarily attributed to technical issues bcc inefficiency these companies are considered close to optimal scale and non intensive water users 46 iii bcc 1 and se 1 the overall inefficiency is primarily attributed to scale effects though se inefficiencies are identified these are not further elaborated on possible actions for earlier explained reasons and iv bcc 1 and se 1 the overall inefficiency is due to technical issues and scale effects these four situations could be a basis for specific actions as explained below 2 7 data acquisition and analysis the izs provided lists of all companies located in their zones in the national business registration portal of vietnam the business code was acquired with which these companies were registered at the system of the ministry of planning and investment of vietnam 47 industrial typologies of individual companies were classified according to this system for solving equations of the ccr i and bcc i models the program dea solver was used as a software 45 three steps were followed for screening the data to yield a reliable assessment first a mean normalization was applied to ensure that all inputs and outputs were of similar magnitude across and within the dataset 33 this mean normalization was carried out through two sub procedures determining the mean of the dataset for each input and output variable and dividing each input or output by the defined mean value second the super efficiency dea model available in the dea solver was used as an outlier detection procedure the super efficiency model identifies companies whose super efficiency scores exceed the pre selected threshold of 1 3 as outliers 48 50 third the companies identified as outliers were removed from the dataset and the ccr i and bcc i models were calculated with the remaining companies 3 results and discussion 3 1 industrial water use efficiency assessment through data envelopment analysis the outcomes from the dea efficiency assessment in fig 2 a d depict the ccr i bcc i and se scores concerning the water use of companies from four selected industrial categories as fig 2a and b shows five of thirteen companies in rp and six of fourteen companies in fm were ccr and bcc efficient score of 1 companies 7 and 8 in both categories were bcc efficient but ccr inefficient while the remaining six companies in both industries were ccr and bcc inefficient within twelve companies in om only one company was identified as ccr and bcc efficient six companies were found bcc efficient but ccr inefficient and five companies were both ccr and bcc inefficient fig 2c similarly of the eighteen companies in wa three were ccr and bcc efficient five were ccr and bcc inefficient and the ten remaining were bcc efficient but ccr inefficient fig 2d the difference between ccr and bcc efficiencies indicates the existence of scale inefficiency in a company fig 3 shows the relationship between the bcc efficiency score x axis and scale efficiency se score y axis of companies in four selected industrial categories fig 4 explains a cluster of management actions needed for different cases action i is applied to companies obtaining bcc se 1 for these companies no improvements need to be made action ii is applied to companies obtaining se 1 and bcc 1 these companies need to reduce their input consumption by focusing on reducing monthly water consumption through better technology implementation or changes in internal water use behavior such as less water being used for processing cooling toilet flushing or floor cleaning 51 52 action iii is applied to companies obtaining bcc 1 and se 1 these companies have two options either to go for an expansion or a shrinkage in production as a water efficiency increasing strategy 43 action iv is applied to companies obtaining bcc 1 and se 1 these companies need to take two types of measures changing their consumption behavior by technical measures as in action ii combined with an expansion or a shrinkage in production strategy as in action iii results indicate that significant numbers of companies in the four categories are inefficient water use for technical reasons namely 46 43 42 and 28 of companies for rp fm om and wa respectively fig 3a which shows bcc and se scores of companies in the rubber and plastic industry rp is taken here as an example five companies have bcc and se efficiency scores of one rp9 13 and are defined as ccr efficient meaning no action action i fig 4 needs to be taken the company rp4 has bcc 1 and se 1 and needs to take action ii fig 4 technical measures to reduce its water consumption should be taken to improve its bcc efficiency in case bcc 1 and se 1 e g rp7 8 a company needs to take action iii fig 4 to improve its scale efficiency if a company has bcc and se efficiency scores of less than one e g rp1 2 3 5 6 these companies need to take action iv fig 4 this reasoning was applied to all four industrial categories for fm six companies were already fully efficient and six companies fm1 2 3 4 5 6 could take technical measures to improve the bcc water efficiency in comparison two companies fm7 8 should consider improving scale efficiency the situation for om is that only one company om12 is fully efficient five companies om1 2 3 4 5 could take technical measures to improve the bcc water efficiency and all companies under evaluation except for om12 should consider improving scale efficiency by shrinking or expanding for wa three companies wa16 17 18 were already fully efficient and five companies wa1 2 3 4 5 could take technical measures to improve the bcc water efficiency while ten companies wa6 15 should consider improving scale efficiency these results indicate that for rp and fm the focus needs to be primarily on improving bcc efficiency thus taking technical measures while in om and wa these measures are also required but a significant portion of the companies needs to consider strategic business measures to improve its scale efficiency the above method can help set a strategy for improving water use efficiency at different industrial levels either an individual company an industrial category or all selected companies in a complete iz as said the focus here is on actions ii and iv improving bcc efficiency by implementing innovative technologies or new production processes this is a managerial problem that can be addressed by the industrial zone authorities in discussion with individual companies to investigate how fewer inputs can be used to produce a certain number of products 3 2 water use efficiency benchmark to further analyze the potential effects of technical measures on water resource savings which is the focus of this study the relevant cases rp1 2 3 4 5 6 fm1 2 3 4 5 6 om1 2 3 4 5 wa1 2 3 4 5 were further benchmarked as explained by an example calculation in the supplementary material s3 in table 1 the rp3 was taken as an example of water efficiency target calculation including the effect of pollution loads as explained in detail in supplementary material s4 efficiency targets expressed as required input reduction percentages for the companies in the rp industry were calculated using this approach and are depicted in table 1 the s 1 s 2 s 3 are slacks related to water consumption cod effluent loads and ammonium effluent loads respectively in table 1 companies rp7 13 are defined as bcc efficient because the bcc score is 1 and all input slacks are zero the same procedure was applied to the other inefficient companies of the other three industrial categories and the overall results per industrial category are presented in table 2 here the efficiency target that is the sum of the various companies in that industry category is expressed as water reduction potential for the different industries table 2 columns 3 and 4 lists the overall water saving potential per industry considering contaminant loads as assessed by dea wrp3 for comparison the water use efficiencies of inefficient companies were also determined without pollution loads and based on one input wrp1 namely water consumption only columns 5 and 6 water reduction potential to reach the efficiency target through implementing technical measures e g process optimization or effluent water treatment reducing pollutant emissions at yet inefficient companies when including pollution loads wrp3 sums up to 17 fm 25 rp 7 wa and 4 om water saving our method assumed that wrp in an industrial category significantly depends on the water consumption behavior of the efficient companies within that category fig 2a and table 1 indicate that some companies in rp may need to cut substantial amounts in their water demand to become fully efficient for example companies 6 and 1 of rp should decrease their monthly water consumption by 11 and 76 respectively table 1 column 6 high percentage reductions may not be easily implemented in practice still the dea numbers give izas a good base for starting a discussion with a company and asking for further investigation into the cause of such high inefficiencies the theoretical finding table 2 column 4 is that wrp3 in industries ranges from 4 om to 25 rp and that improving water use efficiency can be enhanced by cooperative efforts among different industrial companies in the technical innovation 53 the total quantity of water to be saved per researched industrial sector m3 month is determined by the amount of water used m3 month and the wrp and ranked in the order of fm rp om wa the wrp provides limited but not to be ignored contributions to make these industries more self sufficient in water use 3 3 water reduction potential effects of contaminant loads when the contaminant loads were included wrp3 water use efficiencies in selected industries were found lower than when contaminant loads were excluded wrp1 table 2 the exclusion of contaminant loads as inputs shifts the quantitative wrps from 25 to 27 rp 17 20 fm 4 6 om and 7 14 wa thus the gap between the two efficiencies is small the results of the two wrp scenarios e g with and without considering contaminants are presented in fig 5 for all companies being part of the dea assessment as shown in fig 5 when including contaminant loads in the input of dea more companies were defined as fully efficient and inefficient companies were more efficient than when excluding contaminant loads this result is consistent with the findings of xu et al 38 if the three inputs are used the efficient companies which have zero water saving outnumber the inefficient ones but when only the monthly water consumption was applied as input several efficient companies in the three input case appeared to be inefficient e g rp8 13 fm11 om8 and wa7 9 10 11 12 14 when accounting for multiple input contaminants efficient water management by more optimal processes or contaminant removing treatment before discharge outside the boundaries of a company domain trades off with measures oriented on quantitative water use efficiency thus the potential for quantitative water saving is less than when contaminant loads are excluded although this goes at the cost of higher pollution of freshwater resources in the local environment technical measures can also be taken to improve the company s performance this shows that the fully efficient companies in the three input dea technique can be more efficient by including additional water saving measures and pollutant emission reduction measures therefore the benchmark of bcc efficiency can be pushed to higher levels 3 4 potential for demand minimization the dea assessment estimates the water demand minimization indicated by the wrp of 4 25 this is consistent with the observations of the ttiz manager who supported and encouraged the companies within the ttiz to save water demand the ttiz advocates demand minimization as cost effective and feasible however the maximal water saving found by the ttiz manager is limited to 20 of total water consumption per company thus this dea assessment study and izas findings in practice are consistent this means that supplementary strategies are needed to make companies and izs more self sufficient in water provision the comparison between with and without contaminant considerations does not alter this central conclusion though an important first step demands minimization needs to be complemented with other measures for that one can consider two options that have not been applied yet by the companies under assessment in this study i multi sourcing which includes rainwater harvesting brackish water treatment and use and ii recycling of water by wastewater effluent treatment storage and reuse for this physical chemical and biological treatment technologies are needed combined with filtering in natural groundwater and wetland systems 54 3 5 utilization and implications for practice the results of this theory underpinned the dea study can be used to assess the current water use of a single company by incorporating multiple criteria into the analysis assessment of water use efficiency through benchmarking is an early attempt to define an industrial metabolic profile of companies and the iz and design targeted demand minimization measures in the water management at an iz based on the four management actions fig 4 this article proposed a stepwise procedure that the decision makers at various levels could consider to push the inefficient companies towards full efficiency the first step is to reduce the input consumption of inefficient companies due to only technical issues se 1 and bcc 1 the second step is to improve only the bcc efficiencies of companies having technical inefficiency and scale inefficiency bcc 1 and se 1 in this way the se efficiency scores of these companies are still less than one but the bcc scores move horizontally towards the bcc 1 fig 4 in the last step scale inefficiency companies could decide to expand or shrink production to achieve full efficiency as shown the potential of demand minimization is essential but limited to 25 at maximum this wrp i e the degree of water use efficiency serves as a starting point for follow up studies establishing a hierarchy of measures that guide prioritizing process changes the hierarchy of measures may start with demand minimization the highest priority level by optimizing industrial processes and domestic water use therefore other steps such as multi sourcing cascading and recycling are needed to assist and guide an iz to become less dependent on water imports outside the region moreover multi sourcing cascading and recycling will require an inter plant network connecting demand supply among potential companies which needs to be designed and implemented e g it requires treatment and transport infrastructural investments since these investments can help industrial zones in general to improve their self sufficiency in water provision the design and cost effectiveness of these technical measures are the focus of follow up studies 3 6 summarizing discussion this study applied data envelopment analysis dea to determine water use efficiency in four selected categories of industries in industrial zones izs in the saigon river delta of vietnam the dea technique served as a theory underpinned method for assessing water reduction potential for industrial categories effects of multiple perspectives and factors like monthly water consumption pollutant loads production capacity company size and the number of employees were combined and interrelated in one assessment requiring a limited number of companies for each of four industrial categories in the three izs the results revealed that several companies have already reached full efficiency but a significant fraction can improve their water efficiency and contribute to water saving moreover the dea technique helps implement water demand minimization in izs and resolve water competition among agricultural urban and industrial sectors these are crucial first steps towards sustainability in industrial water provision in vietnam the main shortcoming of this assessment is that it does not account for unused methods to further harvest the water reduction potential in the water efficient companies these companies can reduce water inputs by improving their internal processes using less water or upgrading and reusing produced water in internal recycles the current water efficient companies could further push the boundaries in harvesting the water reduction potential and by this challenge other less efficient companies to take further measures hence the dea method can continuously be used to improve the industrial sector concerning water efficiency besides the dea technique evaluates the performance of individual companies under the same type of industry without considering their production technology which may vary according to the manufacturing profiles therefore the dea technique proposed in this article highlights that the water reduction potentials are linked to the actual context for evaluation further investigation of the contributions of individual companies can facilitate synergies in improving industrial water use such a further investigation may expand to external comparators to evaluate the effect of context on the water use efficiency of companies of similar type of production this context may be different for different regions within a country or within a continent the context contribution to water efficiency may be uncovered by including subsets of industries from the different regions i e southern central and northern vietnam or other countries in southeast asia such a more comprehensive dea application will allow for a regional and international comparison and benchmarking and may drive knowledge exchange and subsequent triggering of further innovations in water efficiency among industrial sectors in the region further research should address the scaling up from individual company to industrial zone scale to compare the water use efficiency of all companies within the same industrial zone disregarding which type of industrial category a company belongs to on a larger scale one may find different trade offs in water reduction potential between different industrial categories which would open the path to inter industry water exchange i e cascading water from one industry to another these cascading measures would further improve the water efficiency of an iz this is the direction of further ongoing studies being prepared for publication 4 conclusions from the above discussed results two primary outcomes can be drawn 1 the dea technique can be applied successfully to support industrial zone authorities and governmental agencies to assess water efficiency and build their water saving management and policies 2 demand minimization can yield a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 25 of water savings depending on the industrial category therefore other measures such as multi sourcing and water recycling are needed to reach higher levels of self sufficiency in water provision at industrial zones in vietnam and comparable deltas furthermore future studies should include industrial companies from the same category but from other regions in vietnam or other countries to reveal the effects of different socio economic or climatic contexts funding this work

8754,this work employs the data envelopment analysis technique to assess the water use efficiency of companies and the water reduction potential of industrial categories in industrial zones fifty eight companies were selected from four industrial categories wearing apparel wa 18 fabricated metal fm 12 rubber and plastic rp 12 and other manufacturing om 12 based on six variables monthly water usage two types of effluent contaminant loadings monthly production capacity number of employees and surface occupied by a company the results indicate that significant numbers of companies are inefficient in water use namely wa 28 om 42 fm 43 and rp 46 implementing technical measures to improve water use efficiency at these companies offers a varying water reduction potential per industrial category namely in the order rp 25 fm 17 wa 7 om 4 these results show that improving water efficiency by water use minimization is not the only ptential measure for improving the industrial zone s water metabolism towards self sufficiency keywords data envelopment analysis dea water reduction potential industrial water use efficiency 1 introduction a global increase in water demand water pollution and climate change have negatively influenced worldwide freshwater availability 1 this has led to competition for water use among agricultural urban and industrial sectors 2 6 this issue has drawn the interest of international and national researchers who investigated this effect in vietnam over the past two decades 7 10 in vietnam like in many other emerging economies a root cause of this competition is the increased demand due to a proliferation of industrial zones izs 10 13 water imports from adjacent regions for the industry are now a frequent practice the approach of integrated industrial water resource management has been developed to resolve water competition here sustainable industrial water supply is the main component 2 14 15 within sustainable industrial water supply new ways to ensure water security are provided by accessing modern water supply technologies for processes and in company sanitation increasing water efficiency and using alternative local resources 16 minimizing water demand through efficient appliances and methods adapted to the particular industry is an essential first step 17 this strategy has been widely adopted to reduce processing water in many industries 18 24 however these studies did not address the water reduction potential wrp as a crucial indicator they focused exclusively on minimizing waste through recycling and reuse secondly previous studies were limited to minimizing water consumption at a specific industrial manufacturing type separately e g food palm oil sugar plant slaughterhouse and other industries and sometimes to the individual company level the quantity of water used and potential reduction may vary significantly over several industry types and among the industries in one category 25 27 therefore it is interesting to compare the water demand performances of groups of similar industries to identify the opportunities for minimizing water demand by comparing these one can assess the potential minimum amount of water needed by a company without straining its economic processing capacity the amount of water used above such a minimal theoretical water requirement can be defined as water use inefficiency or water reduction potential thirdly agudelo vera et al 28 who focused on urban water management proposed that technology implementation is an option to achieve water demand minimization but did not indicate feasible benchmarks for the quantity of water to be reduced defining water minimization targets can give direction to which extent the technology should be implemented in specific situations in their case urban building 28 and in the case presented here types of industries in izs lastly traditional attempts to evaluate efficiency often encounter technical difficulties when multiple variables need to be considered thus a technique that can handle many variables and constraints within the complex problems in industrial water management is useful to our knowledge no prior studies have introduced such target for individual companies within industrial categories semi structured interviews in 2017 revealed that industrial zone authorities izas which are operating the izs in the saigon river delta favor measures at the level of single industrial companies to reduce fresh potable water consumption such measures for instance by industrial technology improvement can be practically implemented because i the scale of intervention measures is relatively small and much easier to implement than at the scale of the whole industrial zone ii private companies are in the self control of financial and technological aspects e g measures can be implemented under their transparent management regime and iii to arrive at freshwater use reduction beyond each company the existing water infrastructure of izs would need to be drastically adjusted to adopt new water supply and associated technologies and thus reduction measures at single companies can be easily applied and framed within current legal arrangements between industrial zone authority and industry for this a quantitative method to assess water in efficiency related to the water saving potential of industrial companies is needed such a method could support organizations e g industrial zone authorities to evaluate the current water efficiency among companies in different sectors and implement policies to adopt water demand minimization strategies and make their izs more water efficient the objective of this study was to develop a method for assessing the wrp of industrial categories within izs considering multiple variables this work i provides a tool that water managers can use at various levels to assess the water use efficiencies of individual companies and the wrp of industrial categories in industrial zones izs and ii proposes management actions that direct inefficient industrial companies to improve water use efficiency by benchmarking and comparing industries belonging to the same category on their water usage one can quantify the minimal theoretical water supply needed by a company without economic straining its processing performance the overall aim is to investigate the feasibility of a demand minimization approach at the iz level for selected companies as an example for other izs in the saigon river and other deltas 2 methods the data envelopment analysis dea technique 29 30 was used to assess the water demand minimization potential in an iz within the dea a decision making unit dmu is defined as a single company within an iz 2 1 three step approach the objective of this study was realized in three steps firstly variables for the dea were defined for assessing water use efficiency based on a literature review and semi structured interviews with environmental experts employed at the environmental department in local universities environmental consultancy companies industrial zone infrastructure companies and governmental agencies the companies within studied izs were selected based on their available variable data on monthly water usage contaminant loadings monthly production capacity number of employees and surface occupied by a company secondly the defined variables for the dea were collected through questionnaires filled out by selected industrial companies and industrial zone infrastructure companies the variable data were collected from january to december 2017 and the mean value of each data was used in the dea analysis it is important to compare all the companies within one fixed time frame to have a correct assessment as was done in this study repeating the assessment in five years could indicate trends in the development of the water use efficiency of industrial companies in an iz lastly water use efficiencies of single companies of the same type of industry were assessed with and without considering the effects of pollutants in the effluent using the dea technique as shown below thus the methodology can only compare the companies of each specific industry and does not encompass companies among different categories based on the results the water reduction potential was assessed for other companies and discussed in terms of significance for resolving water scarcity problems for izs 2 2 industry type selection four industries categorized by the standard for industrial classification issued by the ministry of planning and investment of vietnam were selected for dea analysis these were the manufacturing of 1 rubber and plastic rp 2 fabricated metal products fm 3 other manufacturings om and 4 wearing apparel wa a limited range of industrial categories was chosen because of a requirement for the minimum number of companies in one category 31 with three inputs and three outputs the minimum number of companies in each type of industry was determined to be twelve namely twice the sum of three inputs and three outputs 32 with a sample size in each type of industry above twelve there is a greater probability of capturing highly efficient companies in the water use 33 the three izs tan thuan ttiz hiep phuoc hpiz and long hau lhiz have heterogenous industries distribution and provide a sufficient sample for data analysis which is 13 companies for rp ttiz 9 hpiz 1 lhiz 3 14 companies for fm ttiz 11 hpiz 3 12 companies for om ttiz 10 lhiz 2 and 18 companies for wa ttiz 15 lhiz 3 2 3 data envelopment analysis charnes et al 30 and banker et al 29 were the first who proposed the dea technique for evaluating the performances of different entities for various activities and contexts in different countries many scholars have successfully applied the dea technique to evaluate efficiency in education health care finances car maintenance etc 34 37 and in water use 38 the main advantage of dea is that the technique i allows for evaluating the efficiency of multiple variables without reassigning weights and specifying any functioning form 30 ii does not require an extensive observation like traditional statistical analysis methods and iii allows the user to establish relative efficiency of each dmu within an observation set up 39 depending on the evaluation purpose multiple variables can be set as either input or output variables for the dea to calculate efficiency since the dimensions of input and output variables are different e g monthly freshwater use m3 month number of employees persons etc linear programming of the dea converts multiple inputs and outputs into virtual input and virtual output respectively making these dimensionless 40 the water use efficiency of the dmu to be evaluated dmuo is calculated by the ratio of virtual output per virtual input as follows equation 1 θ 0 v i r t u a l o u t p u t v i r t u a l i n p u t r 1 s u r y r o i 1 m v i x i o u 1 y 1 o u s y s o v 1 x 1 o v s x m o 1 where θ o is the measure of the efficiency of dmuo with subscripts of o is the dmu being evaluated and o 1 2 n i and r present that dmuo uses i 1 2 m inputs to generate r 1 2 s outputs x io is the amount of input i th for o th dmu y ro is the amount of output r th for the o th dmu u and v are the output and input weights generated in the solution of the dea equations the industrial water use efficiency at a specific iz was assessed by the initial basic frontier models ccr i 30 and bcc i 29 charnes cooper rhodes ccr banker charnes cooper bcc the economy of scale does not play a role in the ccr i model whereas it does in the bcc i model comparing ccr i and bcc i results could reveal the sources of inefficiency that a company under assessment might have to evaluate the efficiency using linear programming it is advisable to apply the dual problem approach since i a computer can save time in solving dual problems and ii dual problems are more straightforward to interpret results 40 the argumentation behind using the dual problem approach is described in the supplementary material s1 of this article 2 4 efficiencies in water use overall ccr technical bcc and scale se efficiency and slack in this study the ccr i and bcc i assessment identified a group of efficient companies with regard to water use and assigned them a score of one the variable data of this group serves as a benchmark to which all other companies are compared fig s1 supplementary material s2 efficiency scores were determined through dea results as a target for the inefficient companies that have efficiency scores of less than one but greater than zero to take measures to improve their performance the ccr i model score is known as ccr or overall efficiency while the bcc i model score is called bcc or technical efficiency 40 42 40 took the term technical efficiency from the literature on economics to distinguish the technological aspects of production from other aspects e g economic efficiency if a company has a bcc efficiency score of 1 but a lower ccr score then this company is operating technically efficient but not overall efficient due to a suboptimal scale according to cooper et al 40 and song et al 42 equation 2 scale efficiency se ccr efficiency bcc efficiency equation 2 indicates that the smaller the se value of a company the further off it is from its optimal scale 43 an inefficient company has room to further improve its efficiency by taking measures to achieve full efficiency this possibility to improve is referred to as slack the slacks can be either a surplus in portions of inefficiency as indicated by the distance from the bcc benchmark along the input axis input slack or a shortfall in portions of inefficiency along the output axis output slack fig s1 supplementary material s2 a company defined as bcc inefficient in water use indicates that managerial actions can improve the efficiency e g by proportionally reducing inputs monthly water use effluent cod or ammonium loads or combinations of those and combining this with maximizing output for instance by producing higher quantities of product in this study water use cod load and ammonium load slacks are expressed by s 1 s 2 and s 3 respectively herein the focus was on identifying the needs for measures addressing bcc inefficiencies since these are related to concrete actions in the operation of a company that can be demanded by izas the scale inefficiency was not addressed here since this can only be overcome by adjusting the company s size e g to a larger or lower size this means dealing with the domain of the strategic business policies of companies themselves and cannot be influenced by the izas 2 5 input and output selection in this study the chosen dea input variables were monthly water consumption m3 month complemented with cod load kg cod month and ammonium load kg n n h 4 month in the treated effluent of individual companies technically a contaminant load is the product of water flow rate monthly water consumption and the concentration of a contaminant when the water consumption is reduced the effluent concentration of the contaminant would increase and could exceed the effluent standard in this way the input parameters of water use and contaminant loads are coupled in the efficiency analysis the cod and ammonium were selected because they are key macro pollutant parameters in the national technical regulations of vietnam on industrial wastewater 56 and surface water quality 57 in addition cod is the main contaminant used to calculate the environmental protection fee for industrial wastewater treatment 55 later other parameters such as phosphate specific chemical pollutants organic micropollutants etc which exist in current regulations or emerging in future regulations could be added besides cod and ammonia were used as pollutant indicators to evaluate the industrial water use efficiency in terms of amounts of water pollutants generated discharges of these contaminants are inefficient as they deteriorate water resources in the local environment and diminish the availability of high quality water 38 44 in the first assessment the present study considered three inputs for calculating efficiencies by the dea monthly water consumption cod and ammonium loads in a second assessment only monthly water consumption was used as the input the effects of contaminants on water use assessment could be considered by comparing the two the present study set production capacity ton product month or the number of product month the number of employees employees company and surface area m2 company as the output variables for the dea these outputs were chosen since they contribute to the water use efficiency of a company in some industries e g in fm product capacity ton month or product month reflects the output benefit of industrial water resources while that of other types of industry e g wa is reflected by the quantity of labor person company water is mainly consumed for floor or surface cleaning and toilet flushing in industries like the warehousing industry besides all companies within the izs boundary are requested to maintain at least 20 of their rented surface area as a green space thus along with processing activities sanitation and cleaning companies also consume water for irrigation individual companies of the same industrial category were ranked as more efficient when water input to serve these outputs was less than others this study emphasized reducing inputs monthly water consumption monthly loads of cod and ammonium in effluent water of companies to achieve efficiency an input oriented version for both ccr and bcc models was considered appropriate for situations where the manager has control over the inputs 45 besides it reflects the focus of the study on consuming water more efficiently rather than increasing production the stages for assessing industrial water use are presented in fig 1 according to equation 1 water use efficiency can be promoted by decreasing inputs water usage and contaminant loads in an input oriented model 2 6 identification of management situations to improve the water use efficiency according to dea theory 40 the ccr efficiency score is the product of the bcc efficiency and scale efficiency scores θ c c r θ b c c θ s e four specific situations can be considered using this relationship i se ccr bcc 1 the company is at maximum efficiency ii se 1 and bcc 1 the overall ccr inefficiency is primarily attributed to technical issues bcc inefficiency these companies are considered close to optimal scale and non intensive water users 46 iii bcc 1 and se 1 the overall inefficiency is primarily attributed to scale effects though se inefficiencies are identified these are not further elaborated on possible actions for earlier explained reasons and iv bcc 1 and se 1 the overall inefficiency is due to technical issues and scale effects these four situations could be a basis for specific actions as explained below 2 7 data acquisition and analysis the izs provided lists of all companies located in their zones in the national business registration portal of vietnam the business code was acquired with which these companies were registered at the system of the ministry of planning and investment of vietnam 47 industrial typologies of individual companies were classified according to this system for solving equations of the ccr i and bcc i models the program dea solver was used as a software 45 three steps were followed for screening the data to yield a reliable assessment first a mean normalization was applied to ensure that all inputs and outputs were of similar magnitude across and within the dataset 33 this mean normalization was carried out through two sub procedures determining the mean of the dataset for each input and output variable and dividing each input or output by the defined mean value second the super efficiency dea model available in the dea solver was used as an outlier detection procedure the super efficiency model identifies companies whose super efficiency scores exceed the pre selected threshold of 1 3 as outliers 48 50 third the companies identified as outliers were removed from the dataset and the ccr i and bcc i models were calculated with the remaining companies 3 results and discussion 3 1 industrial water use efficiency assessment through data envelopment analysis the outcomes from the dea efficiency assessment in fig 2 a d depict the ccr i bcc i and se scores concerning the water use of companies from four selected industrial categories as fig 2a and b shows five of thirteen companies in rp and six of fourteen companies in fm were ccr and bcc efficient score of 1 companies 7 and 8 in both categories were bcc efficient but ccr inefficient while the remaining six companies in both industries were ccr and bcc inefficient within twelve companies in om only one company was identified as ccr and bcc efficient six companies were found bcc efficient but ccr inefficient and five companies were both ccr and bcc inefficient fig 2c similarly of the eighteen companies in wa three were ccr and bcc efficient five were ccr and bcc inefficient and the ten remaining were bcc efficient but ccr inefficient fig 2d the difference between ccr and bcc efficiencies indicates the existence of scale inefficiency in a company fig 3 shows the relationship between the bcc efficiency score x axis and scale efficiency se score y axis of companies in four selected industrial categories fig 4 explains a cluster of management actions needed for different cases action i is applied to companies obtaining bcc se 1 for these companies no improvements need to be made action ii is applied to companies obtaining se 1 and bcc 1 these companies need to reduce their input consumption by focusing on reducing monthly water consumption through better technology implementation or changes in internal water use behavior such as less water being used for processing cooling toilet flushing or floor cleaning 51 52 action iii is applied to companies obtaining bcc 1 and se 1 these companies have two options either to go for an expansion or a shrinkage in production as a water efficiency increasing strategy 43 action iv is applied to companies obtaining bcc 1 and se 1 these companies need to take two types of measures changing their consumption behavior by technical measures as in action ii combined with an expansion or a shrinkage in production strategy as in action iii results indicate that significant numbers of companies in the four categories are inefficient water use for technical reasons namely 46 43 42 and 28 of companies for rp fm om and wa respectively fig 3a which shows bcc and se scores of companies in the rubber and plastic industry rp is taken here as an example five companies have bcc and se efficiency scores of one rp9 13 and are defined as ccr efficient meaning no action action i fig 4 needs to be taken the company rp4 has bcc 1 and se 1 and needs to take action ii fig 4 technical measures to reduce its water consumption should be taken to improve its bcc efficiency in case bcc 1 and se 1 e g rp7 8 a company needs to take action iii fig 4 to improve its scale efficiency if a company has bcc and se efficiency scores of less than one e g rp1 2 3 5 6 these companies need to take action iv fig 4 this reasoning was applied to all four industrial categories for fm six companies were already fully efficient and six companies fm1 2 3 4 5 6 could take technical measures to improve the bcc water efficiency in comparison two companies fm7 8 should consider improving scale efficiency the situation for om is that only one company om12 is fully efficient five companies om1 2 3 4 5 could take technical measures to improve the bcc water efficiency and all companies under evaluation except for om12 should consider improving scale efficiency by shrinking or expanding for wa three companies wa16 17 18 were already fully efficient and five companies wa1 2 3 4 5 could take technical measures to improve the bcc water efficiency while ten companies wa6 15 should consider improving scale efficiency these results indicate that for rp and fm the focus needs to be primarily on improving bcc efficiency thus taking technical measures while in om and wa these measures are also required but a significant portion of the companies needs to consider strategic business measures to improve its scale efficiency the above method can help set a strategy for improving water use efficiency at different industrial levels either an individual company an industrial category or all selected companies in a complete iz as said the focus here is on actions ii and iv improving bcc efficiency by implementing innovative technologies or new production processes this is a managerial problem that can be addressed by the industrial zone authorities in discussion with individual companies to investigate how fewer inputs can be used to produce a certain number of products 3 2 water use efficiency benchmark to further analyze the potential effects of technical measures on water resource savings which is the focus of this study the relevant cases rp1 2 3 4 5 6 fm1 2 3 4 5 6 om1 2 3 4 5 wa1 2 3 4 5 were further benchmarked as explained by an example calculation in the supplementary material s3 in table 1 the rp3 was taken as an example of water efficiency target calculation including the effect of pollution loads as explained in detail in supplementary material s4 efficiency targets expressed as required input reduction percentages for the companies in the rp industry were calculated using this approach and are depicted in table 1 the s 1 s 2 s 3 are slacks related to water consumption cod effluent loads and ammonium effluent loads respectively in table 1 companies rp7 13 are defined as bcc efficient because the bcc score is 1 and all input slacks are zero the same procedure was applied to the other inefficient companies of the other three industrial categories and the overall results per industrial category are presented in table 2 here the efficiency target that is the sum of the various companies in that industry category is expressed as water reduction potential for the different industries table 2 columns 3 and 4 lists the overall water saving potential per industry considering contaminant loads as assessed by dea wrp3 for comparison the water use efficiencies of inefficient companies were also determined without pollution loads and based on one input wrp1 namely water consumption only columns 5 and 6 water reduction potential to reach the efficiency target through implementing technical measures e g process optimization or effluent water treatment reducing pollutant emissions at yet inefficient companies when including pollution loads wrp3 sums up to 17 fm 25 rp 7 wa and 4 om water saving our method assumed that wrp in an industrial category significantly depends on the water consumption behavior of the efficient companies within that category fig 2a and table 1 indicate that some companies in rp may need to cut substantial amounts in their water demand to become fully efficient for example companies 6 and 1 of rp should decrease their monthly water consumption by 11 and 76 respectively table 1 column 6 high percentage reductions may not be easily implemented in practice still the dea numbers give izas a good base for starting a discussion with a company and asking for further investigation into the cause of such high inefficiencies the theoretical finding table 2 column 4 is that wrp3 in industries ranges from 4 om to 25 rp and that improving water use efficiency can be enhanced by cooperative efforts among different industrial companies in the technical innovation 53 the total quantity of water to be saved per researched industrial sector m3 month is determined by the amount of water used m3 month and the wrp and ranked in the order of fm rp om wa the wrp provides limited but not to be ignored contributions to make these industries more self sufficient in water use 3 3 water reduction potential effects of contaminant loads when the contaminant loads were included wrp3 water use efficiencies in selected industries were found lower than when contaminant loads were excluded wrp1 table 2 the exclusion of contaminant loads as inputs shifts the quantitative wrps from 25 to 27 rp 17 20 fm 4 6 om and 7 14 wa thus the gap between the two efficiencies is small the results of the two wrp scenarios e g with and without considering contaminants are presented in fig 5 for all companies being part of the dea assessment as shown in fig 5 when including contaminant loads in the input of dea more companies were defined as fully efficient and inefficient companies were more efficient than when excluding contaminant loads this result is consistent with the findings of xu et al 38 if the three inputs are used the efficient companies which have zero water saving outnumber the inefficient ones but when only the monthly water consumption was applied as input several efficient companies in the three input case appeared to be inefficient e g rp8 13 fm11 om8 and wa7 9 10 11 12 14 when accounting for multiple input contaminants efficient water management by more optimal processes or contaminant removing treatment before discharge outside the boundaries of a company domain trades off with measures oriented on quantitative water use efficiency thus the potential for quantitative water saving is less than when contaminant loads are excluded although this goes at the cost of higher pollution of freshwater resources in the local environment technical measures can also be taken to improve the company s performance this shows that the fully efficient companies in the three input dea technique can be more efficient by including additional water saving measures and pollutant emission reduction measures therefore the benchmark of bcc efficiency can be pushed to higher levels 3 4 potential for demand minimization the dea assessment estimates the water demand minimization indicated by the wrp of 4 25 this is consistent with the observations of the ttiz manager who supported and encouraged the companies within the ttiz to save water demand the ttiz advocates demand minimization as cost effective and feasible however the maximal water saving found by the ttiz manager is limited to 20 of total water consumption per company thus this dea assessment study and izas findings in practice are consistent this means that supplementary strategies are needed to make companies and izs more self sufficient in water provision the comparison between with and without contaminant considerations does not alter this central conclusion though an important first step demands minimization needs to be complemented with other measures for that one can consider two options that have not been applied yet by the companies under assessment in this study i multi sourcing which includes rainwater harvesting brackish water treatment and use and ii recycling of water by wastewater effluent treatment storage and reuse for this physical chemical and biological treatment technologies are needed combined with filtering in natural groundwater and wetland systems 54 3 5 utilization and implications for practice the results of this theory underpinned the dea study can be used to assess the current water use of a single company by incorporating multiple criteria into the analysis assessment of water use efficiency through benchmarking is an early attempt to define an industrial metabolic profile of companies and the iz and design targeted demand minimization measures in the water management at an iz based on the four management actions fig 4 this article proposed a stepwise procedure that the decision makers at various levels could consider to push the inefficient companies towards full efficiency the first step is to reduce the input consumption of inefficient companies due to only technical issues se 1 and bcc 1 the second step is to improve only the bcc efficiencies of companies having technical inefficiency and scale inefficiency bcc 1 and se 1 in this way the se efficiency scores of these companies are still less than one but the bcc scores move horizontally towards the bcc 1 fig 4 in the last step scale inefficiency companies could decide to expand or shrink production to achieve full efficiency as shown the potential of demand minimization is essential but limited to 25 at maximum this wrp i e the degree of water use efficiency serves as a starting point for follow up studies establishing a hierarchy of measures that guide prioritizing process changes the hierarchy of measures may start with demand minimization the highest priority level by optimizing industrial processes and domestic water use therefore other steps such as multi sourcing cascading and recycling are needed to assist and guide an iz to become less dependent on water imports outside the region moreover multi sourcing cascading and recycling will require an inter plant network connecting demand supply among potential companies which needs to be designed and implemented e g it requires treatment and transport infrastructural investments since these investments can help industrial zones in general to improve their self sufficiency in water provision the design and cost effectiveness of these technical measures are the focus of follow up studies 3 6 summarizing discussion this study applied data envelopment analysis dea to determine water use efficiency in four selected categories of industries in industrial zones izs in the saigon river delta of vietnam the dea technique served as a theory underpinned method for assessing water reduction potential for industrial categories effects of multiple perspectives and factors like monthly water consumption pollutant loads production capacity company size and the number of employees were combined and interrelated in one assessment requiring a limited number of companies for each of four industrial categories in the three izs the results revealed that several companies have already reached full efficiency but a significant fraction can improve their water efficiency and contribute to water saving moreover the dea technique helps implement water demand minimization in izs and resolve water competition among agricultural urban and industrial sectors these are crucial first steps towards sustainability in industrial water provision in vietnam the main shortcoming of this assessment is that it does not account for unused methods to further harvest the water reduction potential in the water efficient companies these companies can reduce water inputs by improving their internal processes using less water or upgrading and reusing produced water in internal recycles the current water efficient companies could further push the boundaries in harvesting the water reduction potential and by this challenge other less efficient companies to take further measures hence the dea method can continuously be used to improve the industrial sector concerning water efficiency besides the dea technique evaluates the performance of individual companies under the same type of industry without considering their production technology which may vary according to the manufacturing profiles therefore the dea technique proposed in this article highlights that the water reduction potentials are linked to the actual context for evaluation further investigation of the contributions of individual companies can facilitate synergies in improving industrial water use such a further investigation may expand to external comparators to evaluate the effect of context on the water use efficiency of companies of similar type of production this context may be different for different regions within a country or within a continent the context contribution to water efficiency may be uncovered by including subsets of industries from the different regions i e southern central and northern vietnam or other countries in southeast asia such a more comprehensive dea application will allow for a regional and international comparison and benchmarking and may drive knowledge exchange and subsequent triggering of further innovations in water efficiency among industrial sectors in the region further research should address the scaling up from individual company to industrial zone scale to compare the water use efficiency of all companies within the same industrial zone disregarding which type of industrial category a company belongs to on a larger scale one may find different trade offs in water reduction potential between different industrial categories which would open the path to inter industry water exchange i e cascading water from one industry to another these cascading measures would further improve the water efficiency of an iz this is the direction of further ongoing studies being prepared for publication 4 conclusions from the above discussed results two primary outcomes can be drawn 1 the dea technique can be applied successfully to support industrial zone authorities and governmental agencies to assess water efficiency and build their water saving management and policies 2 demand minimization can yield a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 25 of water savings depending on the industrial category therefore other measures such as multi sourcing and water recycling are needed to reach higher levels of self sufficiency in water provision at industrial zones in vietnam and comparable deltas furthermore future studies should include industrial companies from the same category but from other regions in vietnam or other countries to reveal the effects of different socio economic or climatic contexts funding this work
