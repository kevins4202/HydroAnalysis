16665,recent studies identified fluoroalkyl amides fas transformation to perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa during disinfection as an indirect source of pfass contamination of drinking water this paper discerns the position of water disinfection systems wdss as a pfoa exposure pathway a new mechanistic model incorporating the derived knowledge about the zwitterionic cationic fas transformation to pfoa with the unsteady state hydraulic characteristics of wdss was developed the simulation outputs from model application to a wds from the usa established the significant role of delivery via distribution network in the pfoa formation in drinking water pfoa exposure risk assessment studies predicted 95 of the system nodes to be at high risk when the existing stringent health based guideline values are adopted the 1 to 3 years and 4 to 8 years old age groups were found susceptible to pfoa exposure through drinking water beyond the tolerable limit of 3 ng kg day the model predicted that reducing the chlorine dose from 2 0 2 to 1 0 1 mg l at the treatment units drops the share of 1 to 3 years old and 4 to 8 years old consumers falling to pfoa exposure from 4 32 to 0 45 and 0 32 to 0 01 respectively besides 24 9 more including x223c10 of the consumers of 1 to 3 years old age group were found exposed to pfoa risks when the organic loading of water was reduced by 60 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pfoa fluoroalkyl amides water quality drinking water health risk risk quotient 1 introduction the increased demand for water quality with improved human living standards has compelled several countries to revise the existing or implement new standards to guide drinking water quality owing to the growing concern about the presence of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass in drinking water thompson et al 2011 direct exposure to humans wang et al 2015 and their potential for toxic effects liu et al 2021 lorber and egeghy 2011 implementation of regulatory guidelines for pfass has recently gained attention in several parts of the world cordner et al 2019 the vast majority of the global and local legal frameworks primarily emphasize two anionic organic pfass usepa 2016 perfluorooctanoic acid c7f15cooh pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid c8f17so3h pfos that are most often reported and discussed in the scientific literature buck et al 2011 the aquatic contamination by pfoa or pfos is known to occur from both direct and indirect sources paul et al 2009 shan et al 2014 the series of manufacturing point sources and diffused consumer use and disposal sources constitute the direct sources of contamination paul et al 2009 in contrast indirect sources take in precursor compounds that contribute to the secondary formation of pfoa and pfos xiao et al 2018 2012 recent findings establish polyfluoroalkyl amides fas as an important precursor to pfoa formation in natural and engineered aquatic systems appleman et al 2014 xiao et al 2018 fas are structurally similar to pfoa except the perfluoroalkyl chain cnf2n 1 is connected to a nonfluorinated moiety over an amide group several studies backe et al 2013 barzen hanson et al 2017 d agostino and mabury 2017 place and field 2012 xiao 2017 xiao et al 2017 have confirmed their presence in water environment impacted by aqueous film forming foam afff contamination due to their unique characteristics conventional water treatment approaches such as coagulation flocculation xiao et al 2018 and advanced approaches such as granular activated carbon adsorption xiao et al 2017 have been found ineffective in eliminating them from the aquatic systems the study by boiteux et al 2017 accounted zwitterionic cationic fas precursors for 3 90 107 20 33 50 36 19 number of samples 12 ng l increase in the pfoa concentrations in the drinking water treatment plants dwtps after disinfection recent research establish the pfoa generation during the chlorination of zwitterionic cationic fas by the hofmann type rearrangement mechanism via the formation of n chloramide subsequent cleavage of the c n bond with the attack of a nucleophile oh or ocl and separation of the cnf2n 1 chain from the nonfluorinated moiety isac garcía et al 2016 xiao et al 2018 thus there is a potential for transforming fas escaping the water treatment train to toxic pfoa during disinfection steps in the dwtps and delivery via water distribution systems wdss since the wdss are highly vulnerable because of their accessibility the pfoa contamination in the distribution network may become an indirect pfass exposure source to the communities and a probable cause for acute and chronic health risks to a larger segment of the population astdr 2018 thus far no study has explicitly investigated the relative contribution of wdss as an exposure pathway for pfoa in afff impacted communities to fill this knowledge gap we investigated the kinetics of the transformation of a zwitterionic fa perfluorooctaneamido betaine c15h15f15n2o3 pfoab p k a 1 0 48 and p k a 2 2 27 and a cationic fa perfluorooctaneamido ammonium salt c14h16f15in2o pfoaams p k a 0 53 which have received notable recognition in the literature recently jin et al 2020 mejia avendaño et al 2016 xiao et al 2019 2018 to pfoa under direct chlorine reactions in aquatic systems the proposed kinetic relationships were applied to develop a mechanistic multi species reactive transport msrt model for predicting the advective transport and chemical reactions of chlorine total organic carbon toc pfoab pfoaams and pfoa in wdss the uncertainty analysis was incorporated into the mechanistic modeling using the monte carlo method digiano and zhang 2004 recognizing the imperfect knowledge about the chemical interactions between the considered model species the newly developed msrt model was applied to the wds of north marin water district usa model simulations were run using the epanet msx shang et al 2007 program an extension of epanet rossman 2000 that enables modeling the reactive transport of multiple interacting chemical species in wdss simulations provided data on the pfoa concentrations formed in treated water during its delivery in the distribution network this dataset was applied to assess the human health risk from pfoa contaminated drinking water by comparing the predicted pfoa levels with different existing guideline values the potential pfoa exposure risk from drinking water was evaluated by calculating the daily intake values using usa population parameters additionally the paper attempted to suggest possible measures to guide the chlorine dose toc loads and fas loads of the treated water at the dwtps before delivery to minimize the pfoa contamination of drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 modeling pfoab pfoaams degradation and pfoa formation based on the experimental observations obtained using buffered distilled water dw a recent paper xiao et al 2018 recommended pseudo first order kinetics with respect to chlorine concentration for simulating chlorine fas reactions in chlorinated waters however the pseudo first order kinetic model fails to account for the competitive nature of the oxidation addition and electrophilic substitution reactions in chlorinated waters clark and sivaganesan 2002 with organic loads therefore a simple two constituent second order kinetic model abokifa et al 2016 eq 1 was proposed to represent the kinetics of chlorine fas reactions in aquatic systems nonetheless the multiple reaction pathways between the amide groups of zwitterionic cationic fas with chlorine were simplified in the kinetic model for generalization and a single reaction pathway was applied to signify the pfoab pfoaams transformation and pfoa formation mechanism 1 a c b f c p where a b and c are the stoichiometric coefficients of chlorine fa compound and pfoa respectively the notations c f and p indicate concentrations of chlorine in mg l fa compound in ng l and pfoa in ng l respectively the pfoa formation was presumed to be proportional to the fas degradation which yielded the following system of differential equations eq 2 5 representing the mass balance of each of the constituents 2 d f 1 d t k 1 f 1 c 3 d p d t y f 1 k 1 f 1 c 4 d f 2 d t k 2 f 2 c 5 d p d t y f 2 k 2 f 2 c where f 1 and f 2 are the pfoab and pfoaams concentrations in ng l respectively k 1 and k 2 are the second order rate constants for reactions between pfoab and pfoaams with chlorine in l mg h respectively and y f 1 and y f 2 are the pfoa formation yield in ng ng as fractions of pfoab and pfoaams respectively 2 2 modeling chlorine decay and toc degradation the current study considered toc as the surrogate for natural organic matter nom present in the final dwtp output munavalli and mohankumar 2004 the reactions prompting chlorine decay and nom oxidation were characterized by the second order kinetics based on competing reactions in water clark and sivaganesan 2002 thus a yield coefficient was applied to simulate the toc degradation in the water environment as shown in eq 6 nonetheless the effects of the functional groups and the specific structure of the nom constituents on oxidation of functional groups and electrophilic substitution by chlorine abhijith and mohan 2021 were ignored in the kinetic model formulation 6 d n d t y n k c n n c where n is the toc concentration in mg l y n is the reaction yield coefficient corresponding to toc degradation mg mg and k c n is the second order rate constant corresponding to the reactions of chlorine with toc l mg h presuming that the chlorine consumption instigated by chlorine fas reaction and chlorine toc reactions are proportional to the fas and toc degradation respectively the following differential equation eq 7 was formulated to simulate the overall chlorine decay in the aquatic system 7 d c d t y 1 k 1 f 1 c y 2 k 2 f 2 c k c n n c where y 1 and y 2 are the yield coefficients for reactions between pfoab and pfoaams with chlorine mg ng respectively 2 3 selection and extraction of literature data the proposed kinetic models about chlorine fas and chlorine toc reactions were verified and calibrated using the reported literature data xiao et al 2018 the dataset on the batch experiments performed using dw and pretreated surface water sw temperature 25 c toc x223c4 mg l specific uv absorbance x223c2 l mg cm ph x223c7 9 turbidity 3 6 6 8 ntu samples spiked with pfoab and or pfoaams and dosed at a free chlorine concentration of 5 1 mg l after the breakpoint was adopted the available dataset included the temporal variations in the pfoab pfoaams and pfoa concentrations in µmol l for different initial values of pfoab pfoaams and toc the data for the pfoab pfoaams and pfoa concentrations were extracted from the reported figures by graphical methods 2 4 statistical analysis the extracted dataset was fitted using the second order models eq 2 5 and the values for k 1 k 2 y 1 y 2 y f 1 and y f 2 were derived by non linear regression microsoft office excel 2016 solver the values of k c n and y n were selected as 1 64 10 1 l mg h abokifa et al 2016 and 0 98 mg mg abhijith et al 2021 abhijith and mohan 2021 respectively for the analysis the goodness of fit was evaluated with four statistical coefficients nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of efficiency c e index of agreement d root mean square error r m s e and coefficient of determination r 2 2 5 mechanistic model development a one dimensional mechanistic msrt model integrating the advective transport and reactions of the following five species chlorine toc pfoab pfoaams and pfoa fig 1 was developed to predict the drinking water quality variations in wdss advective transport conceptualized the transmission of the quality parameters in the fluid flow caused by the flow velocity the reactions consisted of the equilibrium and kinetically controlled multi species interactions the chlorine toc reactions in the bulk phase were represented using eq 6 7 the chlorine diffusion from the bulk to the pipe wall was approximated to occur across a boundary layer munavalli and mohankumar 2004 for simplification the mass transfer and the following chlorine reactions with the pipe material were defined by first order kinetics relating to bulk chlorine concentration rossman 2000 the chlorine fas reactions were abstracted using the model equations eq 2 5 defined above as explained in the supporting information si a set of partial differential and linear equations was formulated to govern the material balance of the five species within the distribution network the concentrations of water quality parameters at various network locations at different times were derived by solving them epanet 2 0 dynamic link library dll for windows was applied to perform hydraulic analysis and epanet msx dll for windows to conduct the water quality simulations the advective reactive partial differential equations were solved using the epanet matlab toolkit eliades et al 2016 by generating msx files the default lagrangian transport algorithm and the fifth order runge kutta integrator were utilized to deal with the advection and reaction parts of the equations respectively 2 6 test network the north marin water district wds si fig s1 broadly used for water quality investigations abhijith and mohan 2020 munavalli and mohankumar 2004 was selected as the test network it consisted of 92 junctions 117 pipes two pumps three tanks and two supply sources i e north marin aqueduct river and stafford lake the water delivered in the network from both river and lake sources was assumed to be treated by processes representing typical drinking water physicochemical treatment alum coagulation dynamic settling and dual media filtration abhijith et al 2021 followed by chlorination the chlorine contact time was selected as 30 min who 2017 for analysis the river and lake water sources were presumed to be afff contaminated backe et al 2013 barzen hanson et al 2017 and zwitterionic cationic fas were deemed present in the raw and treated water the pfoa in the raw water was considered absent alum coagulation followed with dynamic settling is reported to remove 20 pfoab concentration from the aquatic systems likely due to the electrostatic attraction between the carboxyl group of pfoab and the anionic floc while it is entirely ineffective for removing pfoaams xiao et al 2018 sand filtration is also reported to have only a limited effect on removing the zwitterionic cationic fas appleman et al 2014 boiteux et al 2017 dauchy 2019 the current study ignores the relatively minimal impacts of alum coagulation over pfoab removal in the dwtps thus the pfoab and pfoaams removal degradation and the subsequent pfoa formation are assumed to be instigating only since the chlorine injection in the disinfection units nine scenarios table 1 representing varying levels of chlorine dose 1 and 2 mg l organic loading and fas loading in the chlorination units of the river and lake dwtps were considered for the analysis the chlorination units were modeled as tanks and the products of chlorine toc and chlorine fas reactions after 30 min retention were taken as input values at the two supply sources of the wds the toc levels in the chlorination unit inlets of the river and lake water dwtps were adopted as 0 56 mg l and 3 55 mg l respectively vasconcelos et al 1997 in the simulations the toc of lake water was varied to 1 42 mg l table 1 considering a 60 reduction in organic loads abhijith and mohan 2021 due to the probable insertion of the advanced treatment approach the pfoab and pfoaams concentrations in the lake and river water after filtration before chlorination were varied as 20 60 and 100 ng l to accommodate the varying extent of afff contamination of the sw sources boiteux et al 2017 evans et al 2020 gellrich et al 2013 2 7 uncertainty analysis monte carlo method the state of knowledge about the interactions involved in the mechanistic model was deemed inadequate for deriving deterministic outcomes albeit the kinetic descriptions are rational the uncertainty in the parameter values limits the reliability of model predictions digiano and zhang 2004 the sensitivity of the model outputs to the nine parameters was tested by varying the value of one parameter at a time within the selected range and by keeping the values of all other parameters as their base values table 2 the sensitivity was defined through normalized sensitivity coefficient s abhijith et al 2021 digiano and zhang 2004 defined in the si the uncertainty analysis was carried forward from the sensitivity test to the monte carlo simulations a pseudo random number generator was applied to sample the uniform distributions developed for the model parameters based on the data range derived from the current study and other studies table 2 abhijith et al 2021 abhijith and mohan 2020 due to data paucity uniform distribution for the parameter k c n was developed by including 10 variation to its base value kiéné et al 1998 corresponding to 25 c furthermore 10 variations were included in the concentration values of chlorine toc pfoab and pfoaams for representing the uncertainty in source water characteristics additionally 20 variations to the base demands at the consumer points were encompassed to capture the uncertainty in the unsteady state behavior of the wds the simulation time step was adopted as 300 s absolute and relative concentration tolerance 0 001 and was run for 15 d to develop steady state conditions at each node each simulation provided outputs concentrations of chlorine toc pfoab pfoaams and pfoa at a 5 min interval over a 24 h period at 92 junctions three tanks and two dwtp outlets to give 139680 data points a sensitivity analysis was conducted to decide the appropriate number of repeated random runs required to realize the impact of uncertainty in the model predictions 2 8 evaluation of human health risks the simulated dataset on nodal pfoa concentrations was applied to evaluate the human health risk associated with pfoa contamination of drinking water the risk quotients r q s were calculated eq 8 by comparing the predicted average and maximum nodal pfoa concentrations with the guideline pfoa values in drinking water issued by different authorities california environmental agency 2019 dunne 2020 michigan department of environment great lakes and energy 2019 minnesota department of health 2017 usepa 2016 8 r q p j i h b v j 1 n j i 1 200 where p j i is the predicted average maximum pfoa concentration in ng l in the node j during the i t h simulation h b v is the health based guideline value for pfoa in drinking water in ng l and n j is the number of nodes the daily intake of pfoa via drinking water was calculated based on the formula eq 9 provided by usepa exposure factors handbook usepa 2019 9 e d i p j i d w b w where e d i is the estimated daily intake of pfoa in ng kg day based on the average p j i value d w is the drinking water daily intake value in l day and b w is the body weight in kg the different population groups considered and the corresponding d w grandjean 2005 and b w fryar et al 2021 values selected and the data regarding the distribution of different age groups of the usa population howden and meyer 2011 applied for the analysis are detailed in si tables s1 s2 the average per capita water delivered in wdss to single family and multifamily dwellings in the usa was adopted as 314 l d dieter and maupin 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification and calibration of kinetic models for the dataset corresponding to dw spiked with pfoab and pfoaams xiao et al 2018 the second order kinetic models well predicted the fas degradation and pfoa formation kinetics p 0 05 fig 2 the statistical coefficients table 3 specified that the model predictions fit the experimental data well the best fitting values of k 1 and k 2 were obtained as 0 02 and 0 08 l mg h pfoaams was found to react with chlorine faster compared to pfoab likely due to the variations in the degradation mechanisms involved fig 1 xiao et al 2018 during pfoaams reactions with chlorine the secondary amide group present in pfoaams undergoes hofmann type rearrangement directly and pfoa formation occurs without any intermediate degradation product formation contrarily the pfoab reactions with chlorine proceed as a two step process in the first step pfoab degrades to a shorter chain fa with molecular formula c11h5f15no3 preserving the secondary amide group the hofmann type rearrangement of the secondary amide group of the intermediate product occurs in the second step causing pfoa formation and entire pfoab degradation despite the differences in the reactivity between the cationic and zwitterionic fas towards chlorine the pfoa formation yield 0 55 ng ng was found the same for both pfoab and pfoaams remarkably the pfoa formation yield value was highest for the experiments conducted in dw than in sw samples table 3 this may well be ascribed to the absence of oxidant scavenging competitive substances that consume free chlorine and hinder fas degradation for the dataset corresponding to pretreated sw spiked with pfoab and pfoaams the second order kinetic models performed well in simulating the fas degradation kinetics p 0 05 si fig s2 however they performed inadequately in modeling the pfoa formation kinetics conversely for the dataset with secondary booster chlorination the models were found decently fitting the kinetics of both fas degradation and pfoa formation p 0 05 table 3 and si fig s2 the k 1 and k 2 values were obtained 16 7 and 6 times respectively higher for the dataset corresponding to the water sample subjected to booster chlorination than that without the same the potential decline of the nom content caused by the chlorine reactions in the secondarily chlorinated waters could be the reason for the same intriguingly the second order kinetic models performed poorly in representing the fas degradation kinetics p 0 05 si fig s2 for the dataset corresponding to sw spiked simultaneously with pfoab and pfoaams however the model fitted the data corresponding to the pfoa formation significantly and the statistical coefficients table 1 supported that the model predictions are approximately identical to the extracted data thus the proposed second order models were deemed adequate for simulating the pfoa formation under all the conditions considered the estimated values of the kinetic parameters k 1 k 2 y 1 y 2 y f 1 and y f 2 varied between 0 003 0 05 l mg h 0 003 0 08 l mg h 7 5 10 6 2 5 10 5 mg ng 7 5 10 6 3 0 10 5 mg ng 0 18 0 55 ng ng and 0 26 0 55 ng ng respectively altogether the reactivity of the fas with chlorine was found subservient 2 54 8 times lower compared to that of nom hence the toc loading was acknowledged as a key factor that controls the scale and extent of pfoa formation in chlorinated waters furthermore it would be naïve not to stress the significance of temperature ph and water chemistry on the chlorine fas reactions in wdss however the available dataset was inadequate to pursue extra in this direction and hence further research is recommended 3 2 pfoab pfoaams degradation and pfoa formation in dwtps the pfoa formation predicted in the chlorination units of the lake and river dwtps are listed in si table s3 under scenario i the 30 min reactions in the chlorination units degraded pfoab and pfoaams by 0 38 4 96 and 0 32 7 97 the ensuing increase in the pfoa levels of the dwtp output was predicted as 0 25 3 67 ng l expectedly the rate and extent of pfoaams degradation were found more substantial than that of pfoab xiao et al 2018 interestingly the predicted pfoa levels were 1 6 25 2 higher in the chlorination unit outlet corresponding to river dwtp than the lake this was attributed to the higher toc loading of the lake water 3 55 0 36 mg l compared to the river water 0 56 0 06 mg l table 1 that enhanced the chlorine decay clark and sivaganesan 2002 and slowed down the rate of chlorine fas reactions xiao et al 2018 3 3 monte carlo simulations the sensitivity test results si fig s3 corresponding to scenario i specified that the model outputs pfoa concentrations are insensitive s 1 to all the six parameters k 1 k 2 y 1 y 2 y f 1 and y f 2 defining the chlorine fas reactions and are most sensitive s 1 42 to 2 49 to the parameter y n describing the chlorine toc reactions thus the knowledge gap about chlorine toc reactions was determined as the critical factor compromising the reliability of the model predictions furthermore the comparison of the monte carlo simulation outputs corresponding to 100 200 300 and 500 repeated simulations si fig s4 specified that the variations in the predicted pfoa levels are insignificant p 0 05 thus based on a trade off between model reliability and computation time we decided to repeat the simulations corresponding to each scenario 200 times from 200 repeated model simulations the nodal chlorine pfoab pfoaams and pfoa concentrations under scenario i were predicted within 0 1 9 mg l 5 9 58 1 ng l 5 3 59 0 ng l and 1 3 37 0 ng l fig 3 and si fig s5 respectively as anticipated lower chlorine pfoab and pfoaams levels and greater pfoa levels were obtained at the nodes farther from the supply sources note that under scenario i the pfoa formation inside the distribution network was between 0 and 2143 average 730 these results specified the significant role of wds in the pfoa contamination of drinking water the pfoab and pfoaams degradation during the delivery was predicted between 11 1 91 0 and 10 1 91 9 respectively the higher pfoab and pfoaams levels at specific nodes si fig s5 may encourage the chemical quality degradation of water to continue beyond the delivery points of wdss elala et al 2011 however the wds demand point was fixed as the spatial boundary in this study thus the pfoa formation amid the point of delivery and actual consumption was outside our scope further research on pfass contamination from the distribution network to household and appropriate storage is hereby suggested the water age defining the retention time of water in the distribution pipes awwa 2002 was recognized as statistically significant p 0 05 in governing the nodal pfoa concentrations the temporal trend of pfoa levels under scenario i was analyzed at specific nodes spatially distributed over the network to confirm the impacts of water age in determining the pfoa formation the average and the maximum water age in the test network were determined as 13 5 and 130 h respectively abhijith and ostfeld 2021 thus seven nodes six junctions j123 j109 j161 j147 j255 and j131 and a tank tank 2 si fig s6 with average water age values 3 34 7 87 10 18 20 60 40 09 85 30 and 145 49 h were selected to cover the spatial extent of the network unexpectedly a direct connection between the water age and the nodal pfoa levels was not evident besides the pearson correlation coefficient r value concerning the average water age and the average pfoa nodal concentrations was obtained as 0 630 thus given the network s complexity the water age was not deemed the principal factor determining the pfoa levels it was concluded that other constraints such as free chlorine toc pfoab pfoaams levels potentially govern the pfoa formation kinetics 3 4 human health risk assessment the r q values corresponding to average and maximum pfoa concentrations under scenario i calculated based on the usepa lifetime health advisory value of 70 ng l usepa 2016 were found between 0 002 0 078 fig 4 and 0 004 0 846 si fig s7 respectively out of 97 nodes of the test network 92 concerning average pfoa concentrations and 93 concerning maximum pfoa concentrations were found falling under the medium risk category 0 1 r q 1 liu et al 2021 the model predicted no nodes under the high risk category r q 1 liu et al 2021 table 4 intriguingly this number increased from zero to nine when the average pfoa concentrations were associated with h b v 35 ng l suggested by the minnesota department of health minnesota department of health 2017 the number further increased to 92 when the further stringent notification levels of california 5 1 ng l california environmental agency 2019 and maximum contaminant level prescribed by michigan 8 ng l michigan department of environment great lakes and energy 2019 and new york 10 ng l dunne 2020 were adopted table 4 predictably a more significant rise in the r q values appeared when the maximum pfoa levels were applied si fig s7 out of the 92 junctions only 59 were demand points delivering 1567 ml water to 4991604 consumers dieter and maupin 2017 per day the e d i values calculated under scenario i based on usa population exposure parameters fryar et al 2021 grandjean 2005 howden and meyer 2011 indicated that the 1 to 3 years old and 4 to 8 years old age groups had the highest pfoa exposure risks this may be attributed to the rather higher water intake per unit weight of the smaller age groups liu et al 2021 for all other age groups the e d i values were lower than the tolerable daily intake limit for pfoa 3 ng kg day astdr 2018 fig 5 the model predicted 9894 individuals 4 32 of the 1 to 3 years old and 0 32 of the 4 to 8 years old consumers to be susceptible to pfoa exposure through drinking water beyond the tolerable limit table 5 note that the demand points exceeding the tolerable limit were categorized in the medium risk category and not in the high risk category based on the r q values estimated with usepa h b v fig 4 5 these results stress the need to establish increasingly stricter lifetime health advisories to control the pfoa levels in drinking water 3 5 effects of pfoab pfoaams levels of source water the simulation outputs fig 4 and si fig s8 from scenarios i iv and v were related with that of scenarios ii and iii v and vi and viii and ix respectively to establish the effects of the pfoab and pfoaams levels of the source water on pfoa formation in the wds out of scenarios i ii and iii the pfoa levels were the highest under scenario ii 1 1 40 1 ng l taking into account the system operation the river source s average flow contribution was estimated as 74 in 42 nodes and 40 in 75 nodes si fig s9 thus given the more significant flow contribution at the nodes from the river and the greater reactivity of pfoaams with chlorine over pfoab xiao et al 2018 the greater pfoa concentrations predicted under scenario ii were attributed to the higher pfoaams levels of the river water the higher nodal pfoa levels under scenario ii induced a comparable increase in the r q and e d i values si fig s10 s11 the model predicted six more nodes under the high risk category than scenario i when the r q values were estimated by relating the average pfoa levels with the minnesota department of health h b v minnesota department of health 2017 table 4 likewise the individuals falling susceptible to pfoa exposure through drinking water was predicted as 15020 51 8 5126 individuals more than that under scenario i besides the pfoa levels under scenario ii were predicted significant enough to induce additional pfoa exposure risks to the population group consisting of 9 to 13 years old boys table 5 additionally the average reduction of 6 in nodal pfoa concentrations under scenario iii 1 3 35 0 ng l in comparison with scenario i helped in attaining an evident decline in the health risks due to pfoa contamination and exposure tables 4 5 and si fig s8 hence fas load reduction specifically the pfoaams load of the river water by advanced treatment xiao et al 2017 was proposed as a potential approach to decrease the pfoa formation and exposure risks in the distribution network 3 6 effects of chlorination to realize the role of chlorination to govern pfoa formation in the distribution network the model outputs from scenarios i ii and iii were equated with scenarios iv v and vi fig 3 and si fig s8 respectively the model predicted the attainment of a 0 58 reduction in the nodal pfoa levels by decreasing the chlorine concentration in the inlets of the dwtp disinfection units from 2 0 2 mg l to 1 0 1 mg l expectedly the more significant reductions in pfoa levels were predicted at nodes farther from the supply sources however the simulation outputs failed to reveal a direct correlation between the nodal free chlorine and pfoa levels r 0 15 0 38 this signified the potential roles of other constraints such as toc pfoab and pfoaams levels of the delivered water and the relative flow contributions at the nodes from the two water sources to direct the pfoa formation within wdss under scenario iv the r q values estimated by equating the average and maximum pfoa concentrations with the usepa h b v usepa 2016 were found between 0 001 0 549 and 0 002 0 678 respectively si fig s12 these values were 0 35 0 97 times that under scenario i furthermore the model predicted a considerable drop in the number of individuals falling vulnerable to pfoa exposure through drinking water from 9894 to 1699 table 5 interestingly the modification suggested under scenario iv succeeded in removing the population group of 4 to 8 years old from the pfoa exposure risks si fig s13 altogether changing the chlorine concentration from 2 0 2 mg l to 1 0 1 mg l was predicted to significantly reduce the pfoa exposure risk tables 4 5 nevertheless the simulation outputs established that the x223c50 reduction in the chlorine dose lowers the average available chlorine levels in 19 nodes of the test network below the who specified lower limit 0 2 mg l who 2017 si fig s14 thus given the decreased disinfection capability and enhanced likelihood for microbiological quality deterioration 1 0 1 mg l was not recommended as the optimal chlorine concentration under the operating conditions examined however from the simulation outputs identifying the optimal chlorine dosage by making a suitable trade off between the microbiological and chemical quality parameters abhijith et al 2021 could be an effective strategy for reducing pfass health risks in wds nevertheless this is outside the scope of the present study and the authors recommend the same for future studies 3 7 effects of nom removal a recent study abhijith and mohan 2021 has highlighted the positive impressions of x223c60 reduction in toc at the lake dwtp in regulating the microbial regrowth microbiological quality and disinfection by products dbps formation chemical quality in the test network under consideration in contrast the simulation outputs obtained in the current study emphasizes a different perspective of the nom load reduction in wds on the chemical quality of the delivered water in terms of pfass formation to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt in this direction the simulation outputs corresponding to scenarios vii viii and ix si fig s8 suggested the potential role of the nom content of the treated delivered water on the scale and dynamics of pfoa formation in the distribution network as rightly presumed the x223c60 lower organic loading in the lake water table 1 slowed down the chlorine decay clark and sivaganesan 2002 and altogether improved the available chlorine content of the delivered water by 2 139 accordingly substantial variations in the pfoa levels up to 236 compared to scenario i were predicted under scenario vii at farther locations from the dwtps receiving higher lake water proportions si fig s8 the r q and e d i values also reflected the enhanced pfoa formation si fig s15 s16 furthermore relative to scenario i a more significant number of nodes was predicted to have r q values greater than 1 table 4 and a greater share of the population 22255 individuals 24 9 more were found susceptible to pfoa exposure through the delivered drinking water table 5 alarmingly x223c10 of the individual water consumers of the 1 to 3 years old age group were predicted to be exposed to the non tolerable daily intake of pfoa through drinking water it may be noted that the current study does not include the microbiological quality constraints nor the chemical quality constraints other than pfass concentration into consideration hence the results presented here do not reflect the positive impacts of nom reduction on the microbial regrowth control and dbps formation control therefore additional research featuring the optimal chlorine dose selection and toc loading selection considering the exhaustive list of microbiological and chemical quality constraints is hereby recommended in this direction 4 conclusions the kinetics of the transformation of a zwitterionic fa and a cationic fa to pfoa under direct chlorine reactions in aquatic systems was examined by applying the literature data based on the derived knowledge a mechanistic model for predicting the pfoa formation and transmission was developed monte carlo simulations were run on a typical real wds of the usa recognizing the uncertainties about the transformation of fas in the water environment simulation data presented the impacts of various constraints water age free chlorine toc pfoab pfoaams levels on the pfoa formation in the treated water within the distribution network the data derived from the mechanistic modeling was applied to assess the human health risk from pfoa contaminated drinking water by comparing the predicted pfoa levels with different existing guideline values the potential pfoa exposure risk from drinking water was also evaluated by calculating the daily intake values using usa population parameters the risk assessment studies identified about 92 out of 97 network locations at high risk when the existing stringent health based guideline values are adopted besides based on the operating practices considered the 1 to 3 years and 4 to 8 years old age groups were recognized as susceptible to pfoa exposure through drinking water beyond the tolerable limit of 3 ng kg day also the simulation outputs emphasized the need to establish increasingly stricter lifetime health advisories to control the pfoa levels in drinking water improving the source water quality specifically the pfoaams loading of the delivered river water by advanced treatment was found as a possible effective strategy to decrease the pfoa formation and exposure risks in the distribution network the simulation results presented that dropping the chlorine dose from 2 0 2 to 1 0 1 mg l at the treatment units reduces the proportion of 1 to 3 years old and 4 to 8 years old consumers falling to pfoa exposure from 4 32 to 0 45 and 0 45 to 0 01 respectively in addition a 60 reduction in the organic loading of the source water effectuated in exposing nearly 10 of 1 to 3

16665,recent studies identified fluoroalkyl amides fas transformation to perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa during disinfection as an indirect source of pfass contamination of drinking water this paper discerns the position of water disinfection systems wdss as a pfoa exposure pathway a new mechanistic model incorporating the derived knowledge about the zwitterionic cationic fas transformation to pfoa with the unsteady state hydraulic characteristics of wdss was developed the simulation outputs from model application to a wds from the usa established the significant role of delivery via distribution network in the pfoa formation in drinking water pfoa exposure risk assessment studies predicted 95 of the system nodes to be at high risk when the existing stringent health based guideline values are adopted the 1 to 3 years and 4 to 8 years old age groups were found susceptible to pfoa exposure through drinking water beyond the tolerable limit of 3 ng kg day the model predicted that reducing the chlorine dose from 2 0 2 to 1 0 1 mg l at the treatment units drops the share of 1 to 3 years old and 4 to 8 years old consumers falling to pfoa exposure from 4 32 to 0 45 and 0 32 to 0 01 respectively besides 24 9 more including x223c10 of the consumers of 1 to 3 years old age group were found exposed to pfoa risks when the organic loading of water was reduced by 60 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pfoa fluoroalkyl amides water quality drinking water health risk risk quotient 1 introduction the increased demand for water quality with improved human living standards has compelled several countries to revise the existing or implement new standards to guide drinking water quality owing to the growing concern about the presence of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass in drinking water thompson et al 2011 direct exposure to humans wang et al 2015 and their potential for toxic effects liu et al 2021 lorber and egeghy 2011 implementation of regulatory guidelines for pfass has recently gained attention in several parts of the world cordner et al 2019 the vast majority of the global and local legal frameworks primarily emphasize two anionic organic pfass usepa 2016 perfluorooctanoic acid c7f15cooh pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid c8f17so3h pfos that are most often reported and discussed in the scientific literature buck et al 2011 the aquatic contamination by pfoa or pfos is known to occur from both direct and indirect sources paul et al 2009 shan et al 2014 the series of manufacturing point sources and diffused consumer use and disposal sources constitute the direct sources of contamination paul et al 2009 in contrast indirect sources take in precursor compounds that contribute to the secondary formation of pfoa and pfos xiao et al 2018 2012 recent findings establish polyfluoroalkyl amides fas as an important precursor to pfoa formation in natural and engineered aquatic systems appleman et al 2014 xiao et al 2018 fas are structurally similar to pfoa except the perfluoroalkyl chain cnf2n 1 is connected to a nonfluorinated moiety over an amide group several studies backe et al 2013 barzen hanson et al 2017 d agostino and mabury 2017 place and field 2012 xiao 2017 xiao et al 2017 have confirmed their presence in water environment impacted by aqueous film forming foam afff contamination due to their unique characteristics conventional water treatment approaches such as coagulation flocculation xiao et al 2018 and advanced approaches such as granular activated carbon adsorption xiao et al 2017 have been found ineffective in eliminating them from the aquatic systems the study by boiteux et al 2017 accounted zwitterionic cationic fas precursors for 3 90 107 20 33 50 36 19 number of samples 12 ng l increase in the pfoa concentrations in the drinking water treatment plants dwtps after disinfection recent research establish the pfoa generation during the chlorination of zwitterionic cationic fas by the hofmann type rearrangement mechanism via the formation of n chloramide subsequent cleavage of the c n bond with the attack of a nucleophile oh or ocl and separation of the cnf2n 1 chain from the nonfluorinated moiety isac garcía et al 2016 xiao et al 2018 thus there is a potential for transforming fas escaping the water treatment train to toxic pfoa during disinfection steps in the dwtps and delivery via water distribution systems wdss since the wdss are highly vulnerable because of their accessibility the pfoa contamination in the distribution network may become an indirect pfass exposure source to the communities and a probable cause for acute and chronic health risks to a larger segment of the population astdr 2018 thus far no study has explicitly investigated the relative contribution of wdss as an exposure pathway for pfoa in afff impacted communities to fill this knowledge gap we investigated the kinetics of the transformation of a zwitterionic fa perfluorooctaneamido betaine c15h15f15n2o3 pfoab p k a 1 0 48 and p k a 2 2 27 and a cationic fa perfluorooctaneamido ammonium salt c14h16f15in2o pfoaams p k a 0 53 which have received notable recognition in the literature recently jin et al 2020 mejia avendaño et al 2016 xiao et al 2019 2018 to pfoa under direct chlorine reactions in aquatic systems the proposed kinetic relationships were applied to develop a mechanistic multi species reactive transport msrt model for predicting the advective transport and chemical reactions of chlorine total organic carbon toc pfoab pfoaams and pfoa in wdss the uncertainty analysis was incorporated into the mechanistic modeling using the monte carlo method digiano and zhang 2004 recognizing the imperfect knowledge about the chemical interactions between the considered model species the newly developed msrt model was applied to the wds of north marin water district usa model simulations were run using the epanet msx shang et al 2007 program an extension of epanet rossman 2000 that enables modeling the reactive transport of multiple interacting chemical species in wdss simulations provided data on the pfoa concentrations formed in treated water during its delivery in the distribution network this dataset was applied to assess the human health risk from pfoa contaminated drinking water by comparing the predicted pfoa levels with different existing guideline values the potential pfoa exposure risk from drinking water was evaluated by calculating the daily intake values using usa population parameters additionally the paper attempted to suggest possible measures to guide the chlorine dose toc loads and fas loads of the treated water at the dwtps before delivery to minimize the pfoa contamination of drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 modeling pfoab pfoaams degradation and pfoa formation based on the experimental observations obtained using buffered distilled water dw a recent paper xiao et al 2018 recommended pseudo first order kinetics with respect to chlorine concentration for simulating chlorine fas reactions in chlorinated waters however the pseudo first order kinetic model fails to account for the competitive nature of the oxidation addition and electrophilic substitution reactions in chlorinated waters clark and sivaganesan 2002 with organic loads therefore a simple two constituent second order kinetic model abokifa et al 2016 eq 1 was proposed to represent the kinetics of chlorine fas reactions in aquatic systems nonetheless the multiple reaction pathways between the amide groups of zwitterionic cationic fas with chlorine were simplified in the kinetic model for generalization and a single reaction pathway was applied to signify the pfoab pfoaams transformation and pfoa formation mechanism 1 a c b f c p where a b and c are the stoichiometric coefficients of chlorine fa compound and pfoa respectively the notations c f and p indicate concentrations of chlorine in mg l fa compound in ng l and pfoa in ng l respectively the pfoa formation was presumed to be proportional to the fas degradation which yielded the following system of differential equations eq 2 5 representing the mass balance of each of the constituents 2 d f 1 d t k 1 f 1 c 3 d p d t y f 1 k 1 f 1 c 4 d f 2 d t k 2 f 2 c 5 d p d t y f 2 k 2 f 2 c where f 1 and f 2 are the pfoab and pfoaams concentrations in ng l respectively k 1 and k 2 are the second order rate constants for reactions between pfoab and pfoaams with chlorine in l mg h respectively and y f 1 and y f 2 are the pfoa formation yield in ng ng as fractions of pfoab and pfoaams respectively 2 2 modeling chlorine decay and toc degradation the current study considered toc as the surrogate for natural organic matter nom present in the final dwtp output munavalli and mohankumar 2004 the reactions prompting chlorine decay and nom oxidation were characterized by the second order kinetics based on competing reactions in water clark and sivaganesan 2002 thus a yield coefficient was applied to simulate the toc degradation in the water environment as shown in eq 6 nonetheless the effects of the functional groups and the specific structure of the nom constituents on oxidation of functional groups and electrophilic substitution by chlorine abhijith and mohan 2021 were ignored in the kinetic model formulation 6 d n d t y n k c n n c where n is the toc concentration in mg l y n is the reaction yield coefficient corresponding to toc degradation mg mg and k c n is the second order rate constant corresponding to the reactions of chlorine with toc l mg h presuming that the chlorine consumption instigated by chlorine fas reaction and chlorine toc reactions are proportional to the fas and toc degradation respectively the following differential equation eq 7 was formulated to simulate the overall chlorine decay in the aquatic system 7 d c d t y 1 k 1 f 1 c y 2 k 2 f 2 c k c n n c where y 1 and y 2 are the yield coefficients for reactions between pfoab and pfoaams with chlorine mg ng respectively 2 3 selection and extraction of literature data the proposed kinetic models about chlorine fas and chlorine toc reactions were verified and calibrated using the reported literature data xiao et al 2018 the dataset on the batch experiments performed using dw and pretreated surface water sw temperature 25 c toc x223c4 mg l specific uv absorbance x223c2 l mg cm ph x223c7 9 turbidity 3 6 6 8 ntu samples spiked with pfoab and or pfoaams and dosed at a free chlorine concentration of 5 1 mg l after the breakpoint was adopted the available dataset included the temporal variations in the pfoab pfoaams and pfoa concentrations in µmol l for different initial values of pfoab pfoaams and toc the data for the pfoab pfoaams and pfoa concentrations were extracted from the reported figures by graphical methods 2 4 statistical analysis the extracted dataset was fitted using the second order models eq 2 5 and the values for k 1 k 2 y 1 y 2 y f 1 and y f 2 were derived by non linear regression microsoft office excel 2016 solver the values of k c n and y n were selected as 1 64 10 1 l mg h abokifa et al 2016 and 0 98 mg mg abhijith et al 2021 abhijith and mohan 2021 respectively for the analysis the goodness of fit was evaluated with four statistical coefficients nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of efficiency c e index of agreement d root mean square error r m s e and coefficient of determination r 2 2 5 mechanistic model development a one dimensional mechanistic msrt model integrating the advective transport and reactions of the following five species chlorine toc pfoab pfoaams and pfoa fig 1 was developed to predict the drinking water quality variations in wdss advective transport conceptualized the transmission of the quality parameters in the fluid flow caused by the flow velocity the reactions consisted of the equilibrium and kinetically controlled multi species interactions the chlorine toc reactions in the bulk phase were represented using eq 6 7 the chlorine diffusion from the bulk to the pipe wall was approximated to occur across a boundary layer munavalli and mohankumar 2004 for simplification the mass transfer and the following chlorine reactions with the pipe material were defined by first order kinetics relating to bulk chlorine concentration rossman 2000 the chlorine fas reactions were abstracted using the model equations eq 2 5 defined above as explained in the supporting information si a set of partial differential and linear equations was formulated to govern the material balance of the five species within the distribution network the concentrations of water quality parameters at various network locations at different times were derived by solving them epanet 2 0 dynamic link library dll for windows was applied to perform hydraulic analysis and epanet msx dll for windows to conduct the water quality simulations the advective reactive partial differential equations were solved using the epanet matlab toolkit eliades et al 2016 by generating msx files the default lagrangian transport algorithm and the fifth order runge kutta integrator were utilized to deal with the advection and reaction parts of the equations respectively 2 6 test network the north marin water district wds si fig s1 broadly used for water quality investigations abhijith and mohan 2020 munavalli and mohankumar 2004 was selected as the test network it consisted of 92 junctions 117 pipes two pumps three tanks and two supply sources i e north marin aqueduct river and stafford lake the water delivered in the network from both river and lake sources was assumed to be treated by processes representing typical drinking water physicochemical treatment alum coagulation dynamic settling and dual media filtration abhijith et al 2021 followed by chlorination the chlorine contact time was selected as 30 min who 2017 for analysis the river and lake water sources were presumed to be afff contaminated backe et al 2013 barzen hanson et al 2017 and zwitterionic cationic fas were deemed present in the raw and treated water the pfoa in the raw water was considered absent alum coagulation followed with dynamic settling is reported to remove 20 pfoab concentration from the aquatic systems likely due to the electrostatic attraction between the carboxyl group of pfoab and the anionic floc while it is entirely ineffective for removing pfoaams xiao et al 2018 sand filtration is also reported to have only a limited effect on removing the zwitterionic cationic fas appleman et al 2014 boiteux et al 2017 dauchy 2019 the current study ignores the relatively minimal impacts of alum coagulation over pfoab removal in the dwtps thus the pfoab and pfoaams removal degradation and the subsequent pfoa formation are assumed to be instigating only since the chlorine injection in the disinfection units nine scenarios table 1 representing varying levels of chlorine dose 1 and 2 mg l organic loading and fas loading in the chlorination units of the river and lake dwtps were considered for the analysis the chlorination units were modeled as tanks and the products of chlorine toc and chlorine fas reactions after 30 min retention were taken as input values at the two supply sources of the wds the toc levels in the chlorination unit inlets of the river and lake water dwtps were adopted as 0 56 mg l and 3 55 mg l respectively vasconcelos et al 1997 in the simulations the toc of lake water was varied to 1 42 mg l table 1 considering a 60 reduction in organic loads abhijith and mohan 2021 due to the probable insertion of the advanced treatment approach the pfoab and pfoaams concentrations in the lake and river water after filtration before chlorination were varied as 20 60 and 100 ng l to accommodate the varying extent of afff contamination of the sw sources boiteux et al 2017 evans et al 2020 gellrich et al 2013 2 7 uncertainty analysis monte carlo method the state of knowledge about the interactions involved in the mechanistic model was deemed inadequate for deriving deterministic outcomes albeit the kinetic descriptions are rational the uncertainty in the parameter values limits the reliability of model predictions digiano and zhang 2004 the sensitivity of the model outputs to the nine parameters was tested by varying the value of one parameter at a time within the selected range and by keeping the values of all other parameters as their base values table 2 the sensitivity was defined through normalized sensitivity coefficient s abhijith et al 2021 digiano and zhang 2004 defined in the si the uncertainty analysis was carried forward from the sensitivity test to the monte carlo simulations a pseudo random number generator was applied to sample the uniform distributions developed for the model parameters based on the data range derived from the current study and other studies table 2 abhijith et al 2021 abhijith and mohan 2020 due to data paucity uniform distribution for the parameter k c n was developed by including 10 variation to its base value kiéné et al 1998 corresponding to 25 c furthermore 10 variations were included in the concentration values of chlorine toc pfoab and pfoaams for representing the uncertainty in source water characteristics additionally 20 variations to the base demands at the consumer points were encompassed to capture the uncertainty in the unsteady state behavior of the wds the simulation time step was adopted as 300 s absolute and relative concentration tolerance 0 001 and was run for 15 d to develop steady state conditions at each node each simulation provided outputs concentrations of chlorine toc pfoab pfoaams and pfoa at a 5 min interval over a 24 h period at 92 junctions three tanks and two dwtp outlets to give 139680 data points a sensitivity analysis was conducted to decide the appropriate number of repeated random runs required to realize the impact of uncertainty in the model predictions 2 8 evaluation of human health risks the simulated dataset on nodal pfoa concentrations was applied to evaluate the human health risk associated with pfoa contamination of drinking water the risk quotients r q s were calculated eq 8 by comparing the predicted average and maximum nodal pfoa concentrations with the guideline pfoa values in drinking water issued by different authorities california environmental agency 2019 dunne 2020 michigan department of environment great lakes and energy 2019 minnesota department of health 2017 usepa 2016 8 r q p j i h b v j 1 n j i 1 200 where p j i is the predicted average maximum pfoa concentration in ng l in the node j during the i t h simulation h b v is the health based guideline value for pfoa in drinking water in ng l and n j is the number of nodes the daily intake of pfoa via drinking water was calculated based on the formula eq 9 provided by usepa exposure factors handbook usepa 2019 9 e d i p j i d w b w where e d i is the estimated daily intake of pfoa in ng kg day based on the average p j i value d w is the drinking water daily intake value in l day and b w is the body weight in kg the different population groups considered and the corresponding d w grandjean 2005 and b w fryar et al 2021 values selected and the data regarding the distribution of different age groups of the usa population howden and meyer 2011 applied for the analysis are detailed in si tables s1 s2 the average per capita water delivered in wdss to single family and multifamily dwellings in the usa was adopted as 314 l d dieter and maupin 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification and calibration of kinetic models for the dataset corresponding to dw spiked with pfoab and pfoaams xiao et al 2018 the second order kinetic models well predicted the fas degradation and pfoa formation kinetics p 0 05 fig 2 the statistical coefficients table 3 specified that the model predictions fit the experimental data well the best fitting values of k 1 and k 2 were obtained as 0 02 and 0 08 l mg h pfoaams was found to react with chlorine faster compared to pfoab likely due to the variations in the degradation mechanisms involved fig 1 xiao et al 2018 during pfoaams reactions with chlorine the secondary amide group present in pfoaams undergoes hofmann type rearrangement directly and pfoa formation occurs without any intermediate degradation product formation contrarily the pfoab reactions with chlorine proceed as a two step process in the first step pfoab degrades to a shorter chain fa with molecular formula c11h5f15no3 preserving the secondary amide group the hofmann type rearrangement of the secondary amide group of the intermediate product occurs in the second step causing pfoa formation and entire pfoab degradation despite the differences in the reactivity between the cationic and zwitterionic fas towards chlorine the pfoa formation yield 0 55 ng ng was found the same for both pfoab and pfoaams remarkably the pfoa formation yield value was highest for the experiments conducted in dw than in sw samples table 3 this may well be ascribed to the absence of oxidant scavenging competitive substances that consume free chlorine and hinder fas degradation for the dataset corresponding to pretreated sw spiked with pfoab and pfoaams the second order kinetic models performed well in simulating the fas degradation kinetics p 0 05 si fig s2 however they performed inadequately in modeling the pfoa formation kinetics conversely for the dataset with secondary booster chlorination the models were found decently fitting the kinetics of both fas degradation and pfoa formation p 0 05 table 3 and si fig s2 the k 1 and k 2 values were obtained 16 7 and 6 times respectively higher for the dataset corresponding to the water sample subjected to booster chlorination than that without the same the potential decline of the nom content caused by the chlorine reactions in the secondarily chlorinated waters could be the reason for the same intriguingly the second order kinetic models performed poorly in representing the fas degradation kinetics p 0 05 si fig s2 for the dataset corresponding to sw spiked simultaneously with pfoab and pfoaams however the model fitted the data corresponding to the pfoa formation significantly and the statistical coefficients table 1 supported that the model predictions are approximately identical to the extracted data thus the proposed second order models were deemed adequate for simulating the pfoa formation under all the conditions considered the estimated values of the kinetic parameters k 1 k 2 y 1 y 2 y f 1 and y f 2 varied between 0 003 0 05 l mg h 0 003 0 08 l mg h 7 5 10 6 2 5 10 5 mg ng 7 5 10 6 3 0 10 5 mg ng 0 18 0 55 ng ng and 0 26 0 55 ng ng respectively altogether the reactivity of the fas with chlorine was found subservient 2 54 8 times lower compared to that of nom hence the toc loading was acknowledged as a key factor that controls the scale and extent of pfoa formation in chlorinated waters furthermore it would be naïve not to stress the significance of temperature ph and water chemistry on the chlorine fas reactions in wdss however the available dataset was inadequate to pursue extra in this direction and hence further research is recommended 3 2 pfoab pfoaams degradation and pfoa formation in dwtps the pfoa formation predicted in the chlorination units of the lake and river dwtps are listed in si table s3 under scenario i the 30 min reactions in the chlorination units degraded pfoab and pfoaams by 0 38 4 96 and 0 32 7 97 the ensuing increase in the pfoa levels of the dwtp output was predicted as 0 25 3 67 ng l expectedly the rate and extent of pfoaams degradation were found more substantial than that of pfoab xiao et al 2018 interestingly the predicted pfoa levels were 1 6 25 2 higher in the chlorination unit outlet corresponding to river dwtp than the lake this was attributed to the higher toc loading of the lake water 3 55 0 36 mg l compared to the river water 0 56 0 06 mg l table 1 that enhanced the chlorine decay clark and sivaganesan 2002 and slowed down the rate of chlorine fas reactions xiao et al 2018 3 3 monte carlo simulations the sensitivity test results si fig s3 corresponding to scenario i specified that the model outputs pfoa concentrations are insensitive s 1 to all the six parameters k 1 k 2 y 1 y 2 y f 1 and y f 2 defining the chlorine fas reactions and are most sensitive s 1 42 to 2 49 to the parameter y n describing the chlorine toc reactions thus the knowledge gap about chlorine toc reactions was determined as the critical factor compromising the reliability of the model predictions furthermore the comparison of the monte carlo simulation outputs corresponding to 100 200 300 and 500 repeated simulations si fig s4 specified that the variations in the predicted pfoa levels are insignificant p 0 05 thus based on a trade off between model reliability and computation time we decided to repeat the simulations corresponding to each scenario 200 times from 200 repeated model simulations the nodal chlorine pfoab pfoaams and pfoa concentrations under scenario i were predicted within 0 1 9 mg l 5 9 58 1 ng l 5 3 59 0 ng l and 1 3 37 0 ng l fig 3 and si fig s5 respectively as anticipated lower chlorine pfoab and pfoaams levels and greater pfoa levels were obtained at the nodes farther from the supply sources note that under scenario i the pfoa formation inside the distribution network was between 0 and 2143 average 730 these results specified the significant role of wds in the pfoa contamination of drinking water the pfoab and pfoaams degradation during the delivery was predicted between 11 1 91 0 and 10 1 91 9 respectively the higher pfoab and pfoaams levels at specific nodes si fig s5 may encourage the chemical quality degradation of water to continue beyond the delivery points of wdss elala et al 2011 however the wds demand point was fixed as the spatial boundary in this study thus the pfoa formation amid the point of delivery and actual consumption was outside our scope further research on pfass contamination from the distribution network to household and appropriate storage is hereby suggested the water age defining the retention time of water in the distribution pipes awwa 2002 was recognized as statistically significant p 0 05 in governing the nodal pfoa concentrations the temporal trend of pfoa levels under scenario i was analyzed at specific nodes spatially distributed over the network to confirm the impacts of water age in determining the pfoa formation the average and the maximum water age in the test network were determined as 13 5 and 130 h respectively abhijith and ostfeld 2021 thus seven nodes six junctions j123 j109 j161 j147 j255 and j131 and a tank tank 2 si fig s6 with average water age values 3 34 7 87 10 18 20 60 40 09 85 30 and 145 49 h were selected to cover the spatial extent of the network unexpectedly a direct connection between the water age and the nodal pfoa levels was not evident besides the pearson correlation coefficient r value concerning the average water age and the average pfoa nodal concentrations was obtained as 0 630 thus given the network s complexity the water age was not deemed the principal factor determining the pfoa levels it was concluded that other constraints such as free chlorine toc pfoab pfoaams levels potentially govern the pfoa formation kinetics 3 4 human health risk assessment the r q values corresponding to average and maximum pfoa concentrations under scenario i calculated based on the usepa lifetime health advisory value of 70 ng l usepa 2016 were found between 0 002 0 078 fig 4 and 0 004 0 846 si fig s7 respectively out of 97 nodes of the test network 92 concerning average pfoa concentrations and 93 concerning maximum pfoa concentrations were found falling under the medium risk category 0 1 r q 1 liu et al 2021 the model predicted no nodes under the high risk category r q 1 liu et al 2021 table 4 intriguingly this number increased from zero to nine when the average pfoa concentrations were associated with h b v 35 ng l suggested by the minnesota department of health minnesota department of health 2017 the number further increased to 92 when the further stringent notification levels of california 5 1 ng l california environmental agency 2019 and maximum contaminant level prescribed by michigan 8 ng l michigan department of environment great lakes and energy 2019 and new york 10 ng l dunne 2020 were adopted table 4 predictably a more significant rise in the r q values appeared when the maximum pfoa levels were applied si fig s7 out of the 92 junctions only 59 were demand points delivering 1567 ml water to 4991604 consumers dieter and maupin 2017 per day the e d i values calculated under scenario i based on usa population exposure parameters fryar et al 2021 grandjean 2005 howden and meyer 2011 indicated that the 1 to 3 years old and 4 to 8 years old age groups had the highest pfoa exposure risks this may be attributed to the rather higher water intake per unit weight of the smaller age groups liu et al 2021 for all other age groups the e d i values were lower than the tolerable daily intake limit for pfoa 3 ng kg day astdr 2018 fig 5 the model predicted 9894 individuals 4 32 of the 1 to 3 years old and 0 32 of the 4 to 8 years old consumers to be susceptible to pfoa exposure through drinking water beyond the tolerable limit table 5 note that the demand points exceeding the tolerable limit were categorized in the medium risk category and not in the high risk category based on the r q values estimated with usepa h b v fig 4 5 these results stress the need to establish increasingly stricter lifetime health advisories to control the pfoa levels in drinking water 3 5 effects of pfoab pfoaams levels of source water the simulation outputs fig 4 and si fig s8 from scenarios i iv and v were related with that of scenarios ii and iii v and vi and viii and ix respectively to establish the effects of the pfoab and pfoaams levels of the source water on pfoa formation in the wds out of scenarios i ii and iii the pfoa levels were the highest under scenario ii 1 1 40 1 ng l taking into account the system operation the river source s average flow contribution was estimated as 74 in 42 nodes and 40 in 75 nodes si fig s9 thus given the more significant flow contribution at the nodes from the river and the greater reactivity of pfoaams with chlorine over pfoab xiao et al 2018 the greater pfoa concentrations predicted under scenario ii were attributed to the higher pfoaams levels of the river water the higher nodal pfoa levels under scenario ii induced a comparable increase in the r q and e d i values si fig s10 s11 the model predicted six more nodes under the high risk category than scenario i when the r q values were estimated by relating the average pfoa levels with the minnesota department of health h b v minnesota department of health 2017 table 4 likewise the individuals falling susceptible to pfoa exposure through drinking water was predicted as 15020 51 8 5126 individuals more than that under scenario i besides the pfoa levels under scenario ii were predicted significant enough to induce additional pfoa exposure risks to the population group consisting of 9 to 13 years old boys table 5 additionally the average reduction of 6 in nodal pfoa concentrations under scenario iii 1 3 35 0 ng l in comparison with scenario i helped in attaining an evident decline in the health risks due to pfoa contamination and exposure tables 4 5 and si fig s8 hence fas load reduction specifically the pfoaams load of the river water by advanced treatment xiao et al 2017 was proposed as a potential approach to decrease the pfoa formation and exposure risks in the distribution network 3 6 effects of chlorination to realize the role of chlorination to govern pfoa formation in the distribution network the model outputs from scenarios i ii and iii were equated with scenarios iv v and vi fig 3 and si fig s8 respectively the model predicted the attainment of a 0 58 reduction in the nodal pfoa levels by decreasing the chlorine concentration in the inlets of the dwtp disinfection units from 2 0 2 mg l to 1 0 1 mg l expectedly the more significant reductions in pfoa levels were predicted at nodes farther from the supply sources however the simulation outputs failed to reveal a direct correlation between the nodal free chlorine and pfoa levels r 0 15 0 38 this signified the potential roles of other constraints such as toc pfoab and pfoaams levels of the delivered water and the relative flow contributions at the nodes from the two water sources to direct the pfoa formation within wdss under scenario iv the r q values estimated by equating the average and maximum pfoa concentrations with the usepa h b v usepa 2016 were found between 0 001 0 549 and 0 002 0 678 respectively si fig s12 these values were 0 35 0 97 times that under scenario i furthermore the model predicted a considerable drop in the number of individuals falling vulnerable to pfoa exposure through drinking water from 9894 to 1699 table 5 interestingly the modification suggested under scenario iv succeeded in removing the population group of 4 to 8 years old from the pfoa exposure risks si fig s13 altogether changing the chlorine concentration from 2 0 2 mg l to 1 0 1 mg l was predicted to significantly reduce the pfoa exposure risk tables 4 5 nevertheless the simulation outputs established that the x223c50 reduction in the chlorine dose lowers the average available chlorine levels in 19 nodes of the test network below the who specified lower limit 0 2 mg l who 2017 si fig s14 thus given the decreased disinfection capability and enhanced likelihood for microbiological quality deterioration 1 0 1 mg l was not recommended as the optimal chlorine concentration under the operating conditions examined however from the simulation outputs identifying the optimal chlorine dosage by making a suitable trade off between the microbiological and chemical quality parameters abhijith et al 2021 could be an effective strategy for reducing pfass health risks in wds nevertheless this is outside the scope of the present study and the authors recommend the same for future studies 3 7 effects of nom removal a recent study abhijith and mohan 2021 has highlighted the positive impressions of x223c60 reduction in toc at the lake dwtp in regulating the microbial regrowth microbiological quality and disinfection by products dbps formation chemical quality in the test network under consideration in contrast the simulation outputs obtained in the current study emphasizes a different perspective of the nom load reduction in wds on the chemical quality of the delivered water in terms of pfass formation to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt in this direction the simulation outputs corresponding to scenarios vii viii and ix si fig s8 suggested the potential role of the nom content of the treated delivered water on the scale and dynamics of pfoa formation in the distribution network as rightly presumed the x223c60 lower organic loading in the lake water table 1 slowed down the chlorine decay clark and sivaganesan 2002 and altogether improved the available chlorine content of the delivered water by 2 139 accordingly substantial variations in the pfoa levels up to 236 compared to scenario i were predicted under scenario vii at farther locations from the dwtps receiving higher lake water proportions si fig s8 the r q and e d i values also reflected the enhanced pfoa formation si fig s15 s16 furthermore relative to scenario i a more significant number of nodes was predicted to have r q values greater than 1 table 4 and a greater share of the population 22255 individuals 24 9 more were found susceptible to pfoa exposure through the delivered drinking water table 5 alarmingly x223c10 of the individual water consumers of the 1 to 3 years old age group were predicted to be exposed to the non tolerable daily intake of pfoa through drinking water it may be noted that the current study does not include the microbiological quality constraints nor the chemical quality constraints other than pfass concentration into consideration hence the results presented here do not reflect the positive impacts of nom reduction on the microbial regrowth control and dbps formation control therefore additional research featuring the optimal chlorine dose selection and toc loading selection considering the exhaustive list of microbiological and chemical quality constraints is hereby recommended in this direction 4 conclusions the kinetics of the transformation of a zwitterionic fa and a cationic fa to pfoa under direct chlorine reactions in aquatic systems was examined by applying the literature data based on the derived knowledge a mechanistic model for predicting the pfoa formation and transmission was developed monte carlo simulations were run on a typical real wds of the usa recognizing the uncertainties about the transformation of fas in the water environment simulation data presented the impacts of various constraints water age free chlorine toc pfoab pfoaams levels on the pfoa formation in the treated water within the distribution network the data derived from the mechanistic modeling was applied to assess the human health risk from pfoa contaminated drinking water by comparing the predicted pfoa levels with different existing guideline values the potential pfoa exposure risk from drinking water was also evaluated by calculating the daily intake values using usa population parameters the risk assessment studies identified about 92 out of 97 network locations at high risk when the existing stringent health based guideline values are adopted besides based on the operating practices considered the 1 to 3 years and 4 to 8 years old age groups were recognized as susceptible to pfoa exposure through drinking water beyond the tolerable limit of 3 ng kg day also the simulation outputs emphasized the need to establish increasingly stricter lifetime health advisories to control the pfoa levels in drinking water improving the source water quality specifically the pfoaams loading of the delivered river water by advanced treatment was found as a possible effective strategy to decrease the pfoa formation and exposure risks in the distribution network the simulation results presented that dropping the chlorine dose from 2 0 2 to 1 0 1 mg l at the treatment units reduces the proportion of 1 to 3 years old and 4 to 8 years old consumers falling to pfoa exposure from 4 32 to 0 45 and 0 45 to 0 01 respectively in addition a 60 reduction in the organic loading of the source water effectuated in exposing nearly 10 of 1 to 3 years old age consumers to the pfoa risks via drinking water financial support the financial support for this work was provided by the ministry of science technology of the state of israel and federal

16666,this study explored microbial adaptation to high ammonia concentrations 1000 mg l to 4000 mg l during anaerobic digestion ad under psychrophilic and mesophilic conditions the latter of which yielded precipitates facilitating investigation of microbial response the experimental setup was performed at bench scale using microbial consortia from four different operating anaerobic digesters treating different organic wastes ww wastewater sludge mn manure fw food waste and co co digestion fw mn adaptation experiments were conducted with semi continuous flow mode to resemble large scale operation metagenome and 16s rna analysis were performed for the first time in a psychrophilic reactor during an ammonia acclimation process these analyses were also performed in mesophilic reactor exposed to precipitates and high ammonia levels diversity reduced when adaptation occurred successfully from 1 1 to 4 g l of total ammonia nitrogen tan under psychrophilic conditions while the microbial community became more diverse under mesophilic conditions with ammonia inhibition we report for the first time methanocorposculum as a robust hydrogenotrophic methanogen at high ammoniacal concentrations under psychrophilic conditions additionally methanosarcina was present in low and high ammoniacal concentrations in mesophilic conditions but there was a shift in species dominance methanosarcina barkeri stands out as a more resilient methanogen compared to methanosarcina mazei which initially dominated at 1 1 g l tan we also explored the effects of sudden precipitates on methanogenic communities and methane production when they occurred under mesophilic conditions in two reactors methane production declined by more than 50 when precipitates occurred and was accompanied by ph reduction and vfa accumulation diversity data corroborated that methanogens were severely reduced these two reactors were not able to recover with 50 days of added operation

others these methods demand high energy and or chemical input an alternative approach is through acclimatization of the microbial community fotidis et al 2014 tale et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 this approach relies on adaptive changes that accumulate in microbial populations exposed to long term stressors scheinin et al 2015 that could lead to identification of resilient methane generating organisms the identification of novel resilient methanogens when system stresses arise play a key role in enhancing the many applications of this technology existing ammonia adaptation literature focuses on mesophilic and thermophilic reactors which are preferred because they can yield greater methane rates to potentially offset the implementation and operations costs thus acclimatization has been widely reported in reactors with working temperatures between 35 55 c chen et al 2008 esquivel elizondo et al 2016 tian et al 2018 yang et al 2018 however psychrophilic anaerobic digestion is particularly relevant in developing countries the reduced capital costs heating requirements and complexity of psychrophilic reactors among other factors lend to their popularity as compared to

been published regarding microbial adaptation to ammonia stress under psychrophilic conditions structure function and dynamics at mesophilic conditions high ammonia concentrations favor hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis for example a shift from dominance of acetoclastic methanogenesis to dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis performed by methanoculleus sp at 10g tan l and 4 8g

known methanogens to date and facilitate continuous enhancement of ad technology phosphate and carbonate crystallization may occur during anaerobic digestion in the presence of excessive ammonia concentrations struvite can be formed when phosphate orthophosphate soluble form and ammonium are readily available in a system in the presence of other cations either k or mg and under favorable conditions high ph low solubility demirer et al 2013 one study reported 75 reduction in methane production when struvite precipitation occurred demirer et al 2013 however to the best of our knowledge the impact of struvite precipitation on microbial community composition and function has not been studied this study provides insight on ammonia acclimatization in psychrophilic anaerobic digestion we report an ammonia tolerant methanogen not previously reported furthermore the unexpected struvite and other calcium and phosphate precipitates observed in some mesophilic reactors during the adaptation process using ammonium phosphate enabled further understanding of how methanogens are impacted by precipitates 2 methodology 2 1 experimental setup 2 1 1 microbial inoculum and feedstock the microbial seeds used in this study originated from four small and pilot scale active anaerobic digesters ad in st lawrence county fed with different substrates table s1 all samples were collected in 2l sterile plastic bottles and stored at 4 c no longer than 24 hrs until the experiment setup the bench scale reactors were fed with a mix of liquified baby food bf gerber starter kit to control the feedstock composition volatile solids and avoid any unintended shift on the methanogenic community due to substrate composition mesophilic reactors were fed on a daily basis and every 72 hrs in the psychrophilic reactor refer to table 1 and text s1 for details a mix of ammonium phosphate monobasic and dibasic with a ph 7 138 0 043 was used as ammonia stock during the experiment 2 1 2 bench scale reactors setup and startup prior to reactor startup short term experiments were performed with one mesophilic r3 cu and psychrophilic r1 co reactor to determine optimum olr olr was initially varied between 0 75 to 9 gvs l d 1 1 gcod l d 1 9 gcod l d and 2 4 gcod l d as suggested by liu et al 2017 the reactors performed well under the first two olrs methane output was maximized at 1 9 gcod l d at 2 4 gcod l d we observed a drop in ph and methane yield considering the adaptation experiments were fed at 1 9 gcod l d retention times were selected based upon the working retention times of the anerobic digesters from which the microbial seeds were sourced and considering that the 21 day retention time yielded stable process operation in short term experiments prior to reactor startup as described above the retention time is within those commonly observed for working anaerobic digesters 2 1 2 1 adaptation experiment reactors two bench scale reactors r1 co and r2 ww with 1800 ml working volume were setup as semi continuous stir reactors using the ampts ii system and worked for 140 days during the adaptation experiment the organic loading rate olr and residence time rt were kept stable at 1 90 0 25 gcod l day 1 64 0 11 gvs l day and 21 days respectively in one mesophilic 37 5 0 17 c reactor r2 ww likewise an olr of 0 57 gcod l day 0 48 gvs l day and rt of 63 days were maintained in the ambient temperature 22 6 0 82 c reactor r1 co the bench scale reactors ran for at least 5 days before feeding started except for inoculum from a wwtp that was already stabilized 2 1 vs vs inoculum to food ratio immediately after inoculation the reactor bottles were sealed with rubber washers and stoppers then flushed with nitrogen gas for two minutes to generate anaerobic conditions the ampts ii system was set to stir the reactors for 30 s at each minute interval during the test methane production was recorded throughout the experiment and ammonia increase relied on achieving a steady state in methane production as reported by mahdy et al 2017 based on a maximum variation of 15 in methane yield for this experimental setup sodium bicarbonate 2 m solution was used to keep ph stable in reactors as needed 6 5 7 2 a stepwise adaptation approach was implemented by increasing ammonia in the feedstock by 1 g nh4 l at the beginning of each of four phases in the experiment table s2 2 1 2 2 mesophilic reactors with precipitates two additional bench scale reactors r3 fw and r4 mn as detailed in table 1 with 1800 ml working volume were setup as semi continuous stir reactors using the ampts ii system these mesophilic reactors worked for 117 r3 fw and 97 r4 mn days at 37 5 0 17 c the olr and rt were 1 90 0 25 g cod l day and 21 days respectively here we studied the impact of precipitates on methanogenic communities this experiment was setup and conducted as described in a under 2 1 2 reactors setup and startup 2 2 physical chemical analysis the

ionization detector was used to measure volatile fatty acids vfas acetic acid butyric acid propionic acid and valeric acid text s3 2 3 16s and metagenomic analysis samples from each reactor were collected in 1 5 ml sterile tubes before an increase in tan concentrations samples were stored at 20 c after dna extraction with pro powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc carlsbad ca usa high purity dna samples were sent to cd genomics laboratory shirley ny usa with standardized concentration of 50 ng ul in te buffer 260 280 1 8 whole genome sequencing wgs was carried out with initial samples before tan increments day 44 and from the end of the experiment day 139 to evaluate any major impact in the function of the microbial communities illumina novaseq pe150 6gb readings likewise 16s sequencing was performed in the remaining samples to enable microbial dynamics analysis v4 v5 was the target rna region as recommended by willis et al 2019 to allow recognition of greater

mg rast id numbers are presented in detail in table s3 the taxonomic classification was based on genbank database benson et al 2013 for metagenomes and silva pruesse et al 2007 for 16s sequences in

was used to determine statistical difference between means all fig s were obtained using origin version 9 1 3 results 3 1 reactor performance as shown in fig 1 a2 and b2 the ph in both adaptation experiment reactors dropped as the regular feeding in initial stage started the psychrophilic reactor r1 co was fed every three days and working with longer olr 63 days showed consistently a methane yield of 173 28 nml gcod fig 3 at tan of 560 10 mg l the mesophilic reactor r2 ww worked with an olr of 21 days with a methane production rate of 333 51 nml gcod and 240 20 mg l of tan fan concentrations were under 50 mg l due to working ph in r1 co and below 200 mg l in r2 ww with phs between 6 8 and 7 2 throughout the experiment the vfa analysis returned consistent concentrations of butyric and valeric acid under 700 mg l throughout both experiments r1 co and r2 ww with a slight increase at the end of phase iv in both reactors a surge in acetic and propionic acid was observed at 81 days in r1 co consistent with the decline in ph thus time for recovery and stabilization was allowed whenever ph dropped and vfa increased in the systems although acetic acid increased in r1 co by the end of the experiment propionic acid concentrations remained under 2000 mg l propionic and acetic acid concentrations increased above 10 000 mg l by the end of the experiment in r2 ww indicating failure in the anaerobic digestion process the overall performance of the psychrophilic reactor r1 co measured as cod removal fig 2 during the first 44 days once feeding started was 64 7 3 2 the mesophilic reactor r2 ww had 20 greater cod removal and nearly double the methane yield of r1 co which is typical for reactors of higher working temperature these values are considered as threshold points to enable comparison among different stages of increasing tan during the experiment see table s4 for further details 3 2 microbial community structure and dynamics r1 co exhibited declining α diversity from phase i 44 d through phase iii 118 d as shown in fig 3 considering wgs only there was a reduction of 40 in the α diversity at phase 4 with high ammonia concentrations methane yield did not change significantly p 0 05 during phases i through iii of the experiment but declined by 20 by day 139 p 0 05 by contrast r2 ww exhibited stable diversity between phases i through iii but declining methane yields significantly reduced in each of phases i through iii p 0 05 methane yields did not recover for r2 ww by phase iv day 139 the overall bacterial fraction in the psychrophilic and mesophilic reactors were 90 and 95 during this study respectively methanogens in r1 co 8 were twice the relative abundance observed in r2 ww 4 throughout the experiment fig s3 at the phylum level firmicutes 72 87 and bacteroidetes 13 were the most abundant under psychrophilic conditions while firmicutes 34 39 actinobacteria 13 43 and bacteroidetes 8 22 were abundant at mesophilic temperatures with ammonia inhibition fig s4 as shown in fig 4 diversity of bacteria in r1 co increased with an increase in tan bacilli class were the most abundant within firmicutes phyllum carnobacteriaceae and bacillaceae were overtaken by enterococcaceae at higher tan concentrations shifting from 0 1 to 80 the initial archaeae community used in the startup of the mesophilic reactor r2 ww changed with increasing tan concentrations the metagenome data fig 5 a returned a population dominated by methanosarcinaceae 95 and other members such as methanoculleus methanocorposculum and methanosaeta in the microbial consortium of r1 co the greater the tan concentration in the psychrophilic reactor the more it favored methanocorposculum 60 of the population based upon 16s data and up to 71 relative abundance considering wgs data a 70 decrease in the population of actinobacteria class in the mesophilic reactor r2 ww at phase iv was observed bacilliales relative abundance was stable even at high tan although methane yield had greatly decreased bacteroidia 93 abundance of bacteroides and clostridia clostridiaceae and eubacteriaceae predominantly increased in relative abundance as the reactor received daily feeding and methane production initiated suggesting active roles in the acidogenesis acetogenesis stages of ad likewise the archaea community was limited during the startup of the mesophilic reactor r2 ww mostly composed of methanosarcinaceae and methanobacteriaceae according to wgs fig 5a and limited to methanobacterium by 16s data fig 4b although the diversity of the archaea increased in r2 ww high tan concentrations and other stresses arising such as vfa accumulation and reduction of ph correlate to the subsequent drop in methane production at tan 4 g l the 16 s rrna data suggest that methanobacterium were dominant 60 methanospirrillum had an abundance of 10 fig 4b however metagenome analysis for samples at day 0 and 139 suggest that methanospirillum was 88 of the methanogen population at high tan in phase 4 fig 5a it is important to note that the wgs data also reflect presence of methanosarcina at both low and high ammoniacal concentrations under mesophilic conditions r2 ww but there was a shift in species dominance methanosarcina barkeri stands out as a more ammonia tolerant methanogen compared to methanosarcina mazei which initially dominated in 1 1 g l tan additionally methane concentrations dropped considerably due to collapse of the methanogen population 2500 hits while the psychrophilic reactor returned almost 300 000 hits for methanogens at day 139 fig 5b principle component analysis pcoa shows that the anaerobic communities in both psychrophilic and mesophilic reactors were changing over time fig 6 according to the matrix distances the biggest community difference was between 44 and 81 days in r1 co while there was no marked difference between communities at 3 gtan l and 4 gtan l which is related to the successful growth of methanocorposculum by contrast the mesophilic reactor exhibited the greatest change in community between 44 and 118 days 3 3 microbial function we used two different databases to analyze methane metabolism pathways subsystems and kegg orthology ko fig 7 reports number of hits for methanogenesis genes from the metagenomes in the subsystems database only methanosarcinaceae contributed genes for methanogenesis from methylated compounds in r1 co this metabolic pathway was reduced in 4 fold from day 0 to 139 in r1 co as the methanosarcinaceae population diminished genes for this metabolic pathway were not observed in the mesophilic reactor r2 ww although there was good production of methane at the initial stage of operation in the mesophilic reactor once feeding started 333 51 it dropped five fold as tan reached 3 g l to 70 nml gcod and was unable to recover by contrast the methane slightly increased from phase 1 to 2 in the psychrophilic reactor which was linked to the dominance of methanocorposculum above 75 relative abundance fig 4 with the genetic input for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis of around 80 from this organism since it has been reported that some bacterial species are capable of metabolizing methane as a source of energy enzmann et al 2018 we explored the kegg database for further insights in methanotrophy shown in fig 8 we observed a similar shift from methanosarcinaceae to methanocorpusculaceae at high tan concentrations interestingly kegg database shows that there were higher number of genes coding for methane metabolism in day 139 compared to susbsystems database this could be due to the increase on hits for methanogenesis from methylated compounds the microbial seed used for r2 ww reactor startup had a minimal number of gene copies for methanogenesis 20 hits as expected in stabilized sludge however as the feeding started we observed an increase in methane yield up to 320 nml ch4 gcod fig 8 which dramatically dropped as tan was increased in the system this was associated with the presence of eubacteriaceae 3 4 effect of struvite and other precipitates on anaerobic communities a white precipitate formed in r3 fw between 40 81 days and r4 mn between 20 to 61 days a minteq simulation was used to model the fw anaerobic digester provided reactor conditions of phosphorus potassium nitrogen ph and temperature the results of the simulation were likely precipitation of struvite and other phosphate salts due to oversaturation observed under the provided conditions see tables s5 and s6 tn concentrations in the reactors came from protein metabolism and external ammonia input from the stock ammonium phosphate intending tan stepwise increase the occurrence of struvite and other precipitates provided an opportunity to understand their effect on methanogenic communities as shown in fig 9 acetic acid started accumulating in r3 fw initial consortium from digester treating fw reaching concentrations that were eight times greater than the period before struvite precipitation was observed before phase ii started a similar pattern was observed in r4 mn initial microbial consortium from the dairy manure digester the 16s data reinforces the physicochemical analysis fig 10 shows that the abundance of methanogens sharply declined when precipitates were first observed in the reactors day 41 for r3 fw and day 22 for r4 mn wgs data for r3 fw day 44 and r4 mn day 22 are presented in fig s6 at least 67 of the unclassified group derived from euryarcheota in day 0 r3 fw were members of the genus methanoculleus 26 belonged to methanosarcina although struvite precipitation impacted the total population of methanogens members from methanomicrobiaceae were present even so methane production was reduced in at least 70 in r3 fw and r4 mn 100 nmlch4 gcod suggesting these organisms may not be as efficient as other methanogens 4 discussion 4 1 digester performance with daily feeding vfa production increased dropping the working ph indicative of active anaerobic decomposition of organic waste the surge in acetic and propionic acid in r2 ww by day 139 was associated with a significant increase in propionibacteriaceae a source of propionic acid and continued activity of acetogens which was also congruent with 50 lower methane yield siegert and banks 2005 reported that concentrations greater than 4000 mg total vfa l were inhibitory to methanogenesis which was evident in r2 ww buildup of vfas concentrations would occur owing buildup in end products of acetogenesis while cod may continue to be reduced but at a slower pace as vfas are partially converted to co2 propionate build up also occurred at the end of phase ii in r1 co which could also be a factor why methanocorposculum succeeded over methanosarcina the latter being an acetoclastic methanogen could have been greatly impacted by the propionic acid accumulation acting as an inhibitor as previously suggested by wiegant and zeeman 1986 even though methane production dropped at the last two phases in r2 ww cod removal was still above 50 this could be due to higher production of carbon dioxide co2 in the reactors since the co2 traps had to be changed with greater frequency the optimum working ph in ad is reported to be 6 5 8 5 shamurad et al 2019 the slightly low ph in these reactors closely reflect what happens in reactors receiving high olr fan of 45 mg l or greater and tan above 1 5 g l was reported to be inhibitory to ad in mesophilic conditions shi et al 2017 here inhibition was observed even at 1 5 g l tan fan 80 mg nh3 l throughout the experiment our results support previous findings from massé et al 2014 and tian et al 2018 that indicate fan is the major toxic form of ammonia although tan reached 4 g l in the psychrophilic reactor fan remained 35 mg l methane yields were not significantly impacted up to 3g l tan but reduced in 20 at a tan of 4 g l in r1 co by contrast it dropped more than 50 in mesophilic conditions with approximately 80 mg l fan masse et al 2014 reported ammonia inhibition in psychrophilic reactors with as low as 0 23 mlch4 gcod with high ammonia concentrations hence it is known ammonia inhibition can occur in psychrophilic reactors limiting analysis to physical and chemical characteristics in ad does not yield insight into the underlying processes of ammonia inhibition 4 2 digester microbial structure and dynamics the α diversity of our microbial consortia was greater considering wgs data that 16s rna data owing to the depth and accuracy in the analysis in general the lower diversity observed in psychrophilic conditions at high tan is congruent with prior reports for mesophilic reactors whereby selective pressure yields a more specialized community esquivel elizondo et al 2016 and tian et al 2018 likewise greater diversity observed during low methane yield periods in the mesophilic reactor r2 ww may indicate a lack of specialization of methanogens although different studies in mesophilic continuous systems reported inhibition above 5 g l of tan when acclimation occurred yenigün and demirel 2013 this study shows that only 1800 mg tan l 80 mg l of fan in r2 ww caused severe inhibition in methane yields distance matrix analysis revealed changes in the microbial community structure when tan increased from 1 g l to 2 g l de vrieze et al 2015 investigated microbial community structure in 29 full scale anaerobic digesters and reported that clusters were formed based on tan fan and temperature tian et al 2018 also reported changes in microbial dynamics due to high tan in ammonia acclimatization experiments in this study ammonia tolerant consortia formed different clusters than unacclimated consortia clostridiales and bacteroidetes were previously reported to be favored in a psychrophilic reactor normally working under low ammonia concentrations by pcr dgge technique wei and guo 2018 our results show similar abundance patterns even at high tan concentrations at 2 g l tan bacteroidaceae and clostridiales were the most abundant organisms in the mesophilic reactor r2 ww similar to what guo et al 2015 reported these are known fermentative bacteria producing different organic acids as well as co2 and h2 during ad traversi et al 2012 notably ph did not drop in the final days of phase iv even though high acetic and propionic acid concentrations were observed this can be attributed to the buffering capacity of the ammonium phosphate used as ammonia stock in the acclimation process buffering capacity was not observed when ammonium chloride was used as ammonia stock in another study poggi varaldo et al 1997 two successful ammonia acclimation experiments have previously been reported in mesophilic reactors with continuous operation working with up to 8 g l of tan without inhibition tian et al 2018 yan et al 2019 while some adaptation occurred in this study it was not as successful ammonia inhibition occurred even at 2 g l tan the variability of successful adaptation to elevated tan in mesophilic ad reported among investigators and differences in maximum operating tan concentrations for those who have successfully adapted their consortia has been attributed to the selection of initial inoculum de vrieze et al 2015 the four microbial seeds from different ad treating different organic wastes for this adaption experiments in this study highlight the importance of inoculum selection for the reactor startup to ensure stress tolerance and microbial resilience at field scale inoculum from the wastewater ad of this study appears to be a poor source of robust microbes for acclimatation due to low tolerance to ammonia while other inocula were more successful discrepancies between wgs and 16s rna methods for methanogen community composition were observed in our study and may be driven by the chosen analysis parameters microorganisms have copy numbers of rrna that can be quite variable from one taxon to another thus abundance could be influenced by this factor in 16s data thus we consider the deeper and more consistent wgs results as more representative than 16s rrna data in our analysis relative abundance of acetoclastic methanogens methanosaeta hydrogenotrophic methanobacterium and methanosarcina carrying acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic pathways were reduced at higher tan concentrations in r1 co indicating sensitivity of these methanogens to ammonia more than 70 of relative abundance was attributable to methanocorposculum at 3g tan l indicating methane production was dominated by the hydrogenotrophic pathway likewise it is important to note that methanosarcina barkeri was found to be more resistant than methanosarcina mazei at high ammoniacal concentration in r2 ww this could indicate that the hydrogenotrophic pathway was more active in the mesophilic reactor supporting claims from dai et al 2016 and tian et al 2018 likewise ziganshin et al 2016 linked methanoculleus with elevated ammonia whereas methanocorposculum methanobacterium and methanosaeta were inversely associated with ammonia in mesophilic continuous reactors under psychrophilic conditions in our study we report methanocorposculum to be the most resilient methanogen as demonstrated by 16s rrna and wgs analysis 70 at 3 gtan l the limited methanogenic activity in the initial consortium in r2 ww was likely owing its origin as a stabilized sludge two hydrogenotrophic methanogens present in this initial consortium methanospirillum and methanobacterium are commonly found in other ad reactors lim et al 2020 methanoculleus has only 1 gene copy of rrna while multiple copies have been reported on methanosarcina 3 copies and methanospirillum 4 copies rrndb database stoddard et al 2015 thus 16s rrna data could bias analysis methanoculleus was previously reported to be a robust species under high organic load and elevated ammonia compared to methanospirillum li et al 2016 in our study methanospirillum surpassed methanoculleus at high tan in r2 ww this methanogen is not considered robust because it yields low methane 4 3 digester microbial function in general all three main metabolic pathways for methane production were identified in psychrophilic r1 co and mesophilic r2 ww reactors where the hydrogenotrophic methanogens were dominant when the tan concentrations were high when subsystems and kegg databases were analyzed methane production in the initial inoculum for r2 ww was limited under this condition methanospirillaceae were the greatest contributor of methanogenesis genes at high ammonia concentrations in r2 methane production dropped five fold from that measured at the initial stage in r2 ww as tan approached 3 g l then remained at 70 nmlch4 gcod with further tan increase lacking metagenomic data during this period we hypothesize that the methanogen population dominated by methanobacteriaceae began their decline after day 81 when the first ammonia increase occurred likewise we highlight the shift in species abundance in r2 ww when analyzing methanogenesis related genes fig 7 and methane metabolism anabolism and catabolism genes fig 8 methanospirillaceae were the dominant contributors of methanogenesis related genes supporting the analysis presented above regarding methanotrophs eubacteriaceae carried 50 of methane metabolism genes it is well known that methanotrophs include members of both eubacteria and archaea and can grow aerobically or anaerobically thus it is possible that methane may have been consumed as an energy source by methanotrophic eubacteriaceae reducing in part the net methane production from this reactor hanson and hanson 1996 murrell et al 1998 the homoacetogens clostridium eubacterium and pelobacter form acetate from h2 and co2 populations were stable at low and high ammonia concentrations in r1 co although an increase of 33 was observed in the clostridium population this supports that methane production from acetate was active in the psychrophilic reactor even at high tan 4 4 novel resilient psychrophilic methanogen and implications little information about psychrophilic anaerobic digestion in general is available in the scientific and technical literature there is a paucity of information specifically on the effects of ammonia and other stresses on psychrophilic reactor performance and microbial community composition and function however some important generalizations likely to extend to psychrophilic anaerobic digestion can be drawn from the literature on mesophilic anaerobic digestion studies on the role of species interaction for successful adaptation cenci et al 2018 lawrence et al 2012 suggest that the way in which species interactions evolve in changing environments could determine the success of adaptation and outcomes in microbial community composition and function indeed interactions among methanogens and symbiotes are known to have significant impact upon successful methanogenesis at mesophilic temperatures under stress methanoculleus is a widely reported ammonia tolerant hydrogenotrophic methanogen esquivel elizondo et al 2016 fotidis et al 2017 frank et al 2016 wang et al 2015 in mesophilic reactors owing in part to syntropy with acetate oxidizing bacteria despite a slow growth rate esquivel elizondo et al 2016 frank et al 2016 diversity and redundancy are hallmarks of resilient systems combined with complex syntrophic interactions we can expect that there may be a greater variety of ammonia tolerant methanogens than presently known and expanded upon in our study it is quite possible that the success of methanocorposculum a hydrogenotrophic methanogen in this study under ammonia stress and psychrophilic conditions could be similar to that of methanoculleus with syntrophic interaction with acetate oxidizing bacteria playing a role regardless the high genetic contribution from methanocorposculum to methane formation under psychrophilic conditions despite high tan demonstrates its resilience this could have important implications for improving ammonia tolerance of ambient temperature digesters examples of such digesters include covered unheated anaerobic lagoons at large scale livestock feeding operations in the u s and unheated anaerobic digestion systems in developing regions of the world with warm climates small scale working ambient temperature digesters are abundant in places such as cuba india indonesia and central africa with predominantly hot weather working temperatures between 26 29 c but are also possible for areas such as peru bolivia and ecuador where low ambient temperatures at higher elevations can reach 22 23 c midday and year round working temperatures oscillating from 15 to 25 c voegeli 2014 developing countries are facing challenges with organic waste disposal and treatment poor energy infrastructure can limit wider adoption of mesophilic or thermophilic reactors our study provided insight about resilient methanogens such as methanocorposculum capable of adapting to high ammonia in reactors working at room temperature although methane production rates may be lower at psychrophilic temperatures this may be offset by lower energy demands required and the benefit of treating organic waste while obtaining biogas and fertilizers 4 5 struvite effects on methanogens during ad although prior information about the process and benefits of phosphorus recovery through struvite precipitation after anaerobic digestion exist castro molano et al 2018 huchzermeier and tao 2012 lorick et al 2020 yilmazel and demirer 2011 limited information has been reported regarding effects of unintentional struvite and other precipitates on methane production for example marti et al 2008 reported some operational problems due to struvite precipitation during ad evidencing struvite and other precipitates occurrence through modeling approaches marti et al 2008 romero guiza et al 2015 suggested a negative impact of struvite precipitation on anaerobic biomass following significant reduction in methane yield observed at near neutral ph romero güiza et al 2015 consistent with another study reporting up to 75 reduction in methane yield with struvite precipitation demirer et al 2013 in contrast one study reported no impact of struvite precipitation on methane yield but their evidence of struvite and other precipitate occurrence was limited to a mass balance analysis rather than observation or biogeochemical modeling sánchez ramírez et al 2019 at the time of this study we could not identify published literature specifically reporting the impact of unintentional struvite precipitation within anaerobic digesters on methanogens composition and structure via metagenomic analysis in this work formation of precipitates reduced digester performance and stability leading to cod and vfa accumulation and 60 69 reduction in methane production to 100 nml gcod the ph declined over the period the ammonia stock was supplied and remained approximately 7 3 for both reactors a similar pattern was observed in another study intending struvite precipitation in ad where ph reduction was related to the proton released by the displacement of the phosphorus equilibrium and tan fixation romero güiza et al 2015 acetic acid accumulation indicated greater impact on acetoclastic methanogens than bacteria metabolizing long chain fatty acids to small chain fatty acids accumulation of vfas in both mesophilic reactors r3 and r4 was linked to the abundance of acetogens including clostridiales ruminococcaceae and clostridiaceae and lactobacillales consistent with prior report blasco et al 2020 we could not achieve recovery for either reactor during an additional 100 days of operation post precipitate formation this study reports for the first time methanogen community composition and function in response to unintentional precipitate formation during anaerobic digestion the reduction in methanogenesis was not a response to increasing tan for example at the beginning of the experiment tan was approximately 3 g l in r3 which exhibited active methane production after precipitation in the same reactor tan was reduced to 2 g l with concomitant reduction in methane production rather precipitate formation sharply reduced the abundance of methanogens in both reactors and shifted community composition from one more abundant in methanoculleus and methanosarcina to one predominantly comprised of methanomicrobiaceae which were less productive although some recovery in methanogens was observed at day 117 and 97 in r3 and r4 respectively methanogenic activity remained limited for the rest of the experiment fig s6 further study is suggested to elucidate mechanisms underlaying the collapse of methanogens populations with precipitation 5 conclusions ammonia can be a major stressor in the ad of protein rich wastes developing strategies to mitigate inhibition caused by ammonia is essential to enhance the environmental and economic benefits of this technology this research showed that ammonia adaptation is possible in psychrophilic reactors r1 co with semi continuous feeding we confirmed that lower microbial diversity is linked to the selection of fewer resilient methanogens in reactors we also highlight the importance of inoculum selection for the reactor startup to ensure stress tolerance and microbial resilience throughout the adaptation experiments since successful ammonia acclimation was not achieved in mesophilic conditions r2 ww we hypothesize that methanogens are directly affected by tan which led to vfa accumulation mycobacteriaceae were abundant in r2 ww during reactor startup potentially linked to abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogen populations under low tan additionally methane consumption by eubacteriaceae under adverse conditions was reported species interaction could play a role on why methanocorpusculum successfully adapted to high ammonia concentrations by replacing methanoculleus in its syntrophic interaction with saob bacteria finally we report quantitatively the effects of unintentional precipitate formation during ad on methanogen community composition ultimately leading to reactor failure investigation of the underlying mechanisms by which methanocorposculum is more resistant to ammonia and how struvite interacts with methanogens is warranted funding this research was funded by the new york state pollution prevention institute nysp2i

16666,this study explored microbial adaptation to high ammonia concentrations 1000 mg l to 4000 mg l during anaerobic digestion ad under psychrophilic and mesophilic conditions the latter of which yielded precipitates facilitating investigation of microbial response the experimental setup was performed at bench scale using microbial consortia from four different operating anaerobic digesters treating different organic wastes ww wastewater sludge mn manure fw food waste and co co digestion fw mn adaptation experiments were conducted with semi continuous flow mode to resemble large scale operation metagenome and 16s rna analysis were performed for the first time in a psychrophilic reactor during an ammonia acclimation process these analyses were also performed in mesophilic reactor exposed to precipitates and high ammonia levels diversity reduced when adaptation occurred successfully from 1 1 to 4 g l of total ammonia nitrogen tan under psychrophilic conditions while the microbial community became more diverse under mesophilic conditions with ammonia inhibition we report for the first time methanocorposculum as a robust hydrogenotrophic methanogen at high ammoniacal concentrations under psychrophilic conditions additionally methanosarcina was present in low and high ammoniacal concentrations in mesophilic conditions but there was a shift in species dominance methanosarcina barkeri stands out as a more resilient methanogen compared to methanosarcina mazei which initially dominated at 1 1 g l tan we also explored the effects of sudden precipitates on methanogenic communities and methane production when they occurred under mesophilic conditions in two reactors methane production declined by more than 50 when precipitates occurred and was accompanied by ph reduction and vfa accumulation diversity data corroborated that methanogens were severely reduced these two reactors were not able to recover with 50 days of added operation

reported in reactor performance and processes ak et al 2015 hansen et al 1998 methane inhibition due to high ammonia concentrations has received significant attention numerous biogas plants have reported losses of methane potential due to ammonia toxicity fotidis et al 2013 biogas production relies on the concerted effort of different microbial communities working together where the product of one group becomes in the substrate for another currently it is widely acknowledged that methanogens are greatly impacted by high ammonia concentration during ad bonk et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 nakakubo et al 2008 rajagopal et al 2013 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2018 furthermore free ammonia nitrogen fan of 45 mg l or greater has been reported to be inhibitory to anaerobic digestion in mesophilic conditions while tan above 1 5 g l was reported to be toxic shi et al 2017 diverse methods have been used to remove ammonia from ad such as reducing the working temperature batstone et al 2002 water dilution of reactor content nielsen and angelidaki 2008 cation exchange membranes to allow cation flux hunt 2020 and ammonia removal using electrochemical methods desloover et al 2015 among others these methods demand high energy and or chemical input an alternative approach is through acclimatization of the microbial community fotidis et al 2014 tale et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 this approach relies on adaptive changes that accumulate in microbial populations exposed to long term stressors scheinin et al 2015 that could lead to identification of resilient methane generating organisms the identification of novel resilient methanogens when system stresses arise play a key role in enhancing the many applications of this technology existing ammonia adaptation literature focuses on mesophilic and thermophilic reactors which are preferred because they can yield greater methane rates to potentially offset the implementation and operations costs thus acclimatization has been widely reported in reactors with working temperatures between 35 55 c chen et al 2008 esquivel elizondo et al 2016 tian et al 2018 yang et al 2018 however psychrophilic anaerobic digestion is particularly relevant in developing countries the reduced capital costs heating requirements and complexity of psychrophilic reactors among other factors lend to their popularity as compared to developed countries organic waste makes up a greater fraction of municipal solid waste voegeli 2014 ammonia accumulation also occurs under psychrophilic conditions a reduced methane yield of 0 23 ml ch4 g cod 1 was reported in psychrophilic batch reactors treating cattle manure with high ammonia concentrations 8 2g tan l 1 massé et al 2014 others have reported 225 7 ml ch4 gvs 1 from bench scale batch reactors wei and guo 2018 limited information exists regarding microbial composition in ambient reactors operated at low ammonia concentrations wei and guo 2018 however no such information has been published regarding microbial adaptation to ammonia stress under psychrophilic conditions structure function and dynamics at mesophilic conditions high ammonia concentrations favor hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis for example a shift from dominance of acetoclastic methanogenesis to dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis performed by methanoculleus sp at 10g tan l and 4 8g tan l have been reported e g tian et al 2018 werner et al 2014 others have reported a shift from acetoclastic methanogenesis only to a more versatile group methanorsarcina spp capable of performing both hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis yan et al 2019 greater study on parameters affecting microbial community composition and function can expand limited knowledge of mostly well known methanogens to date and facilitate continuous enhancement of ad technology phosphate and carbonate crystallization may occur during anaerobic digestion in the presence of excessive ammonia concentrations struvite can be formed when phosphate orthophosphate soluble form and ammonium are readily available in a system in the presence of other cations either k or mg and under favorable conditions high ph low solubility demirer et al 2013 one study reported 75 reduction in methane production when struvite precipitation occurred demirer et al 2013 however to the best of our knowledge the impact of struvite precipitation on microbial community composition and function has not been studied this study provides insight on ammonia acclimatization in psychrophilic anaerobic digestion we report an ammonia tolerant methanogen not previously reported furthermore the unexpected struvite and other calcium and phosphate precipitates observed in some mesophilic reactors during the adaptation process using ammonium phosphate enabled further understanding of how methanogens are impacted by precipitates 2 methodology 2 1 experimental setup 2 1 1 microbial inoculum and feedstock the microbial seeds used in this study originated from four small and pilot scale active anaerobic digesters ad in st lawrence county fed with different substrates table s1 all samples were collected in 2l sterile plastic bottles and stored at 4 c no longer than 24 hrs until the experiment setup the bench scale reactors were fed with a mix of liquified baby food bf gerber starter kit to control the feedstock composition volatile solids and avoid any unintended shift on the methanogenic community due to substrate composition mesophilic reactors were fed on a daily basis and every 72 hrs in the psychrophilic reactor refer to table 1 and text s1 for details a mix of ammonium phosphate monobasic and dibasic with a ph 7 138 0 043 was used as ammonia stock during the experiment 2 1 2 bench scale reactors setup and startup prior to reactor startup short term experiments were performed with one mesophilic r3 cu and psychrophilic r1 co reactor to determine optimum olr olr was initially varied between 0 75 to 9 gvs l d 1 1 gcod l d 1 9 gcod l d and 2 4 gcod l d as suggested by liu et al 2017 the reactors performed well under the first two olrs methane output was maximized at 1 9 gcod l d at 2 4 gcod l d we observed a drop in ph and methane yield considering the adaptation experiments were fed at 1 9 gcod l d retention times were selected based upon the working retention times of the anerobic digesters from which the microbial seeds were sourced and considering that the 21 day retention time yielded stable process operation in short term experiments prior to reactor startup as described above the retention time is within those commonly observed for working anaerobic digesters 2 1 2 1 adaptation experiment reactors two bench scale reactors r1 co and r2 ww with 1800 ml working volume were setup as semi continuous stir reactors using the ampts ii system and worked for 140 days during the adaptation experiment the organic loading rate olr and residence time rt were kept stable at 1 90 0 25 gcod l day 1 64 0 11 gvs l day and 21 days respectively in one mesophilic 37 5 0 17 c reactor r2 ww likewise an olr of 0 57 gcod l day 0 48 gvs l day and rt of 63 days were maintained in the ambient temperature 22 6 0 82 c reactor r1 co the bench scale reactors ran for at least 5 days before feeding started except for inoculum from a wwtp that was already stabilized 2 1 vs vs inoculum to food ratio immediately after inoculation the reactor bottles were sealed with rubber washers and stoppers then flushed with nitrogen gas for two minutes to generate anaerobic conditions the ampts ii system was set to stir the reactors for 30 s at each minute interval during the test methane production was recorded throughout the experiment and ammonia increase relied on achieving a steady state in methane production as reported by mahdy et al 2017 based on a maximum variation of 15 in methane yield for this experimental setup sodium bicarbonate 2 m solution was used to keep ph stable in reactors as needed 6 5 7 2 a stepwise adaptation approach was implemented by increasing ammonia in the feedstock by 1 g nh4 l at the beginning of each of four phases in the experiment table s2 2 1 2 2 mesophilic reactors with precipitates two additional bench scale reactors r3 fw and r4 mn as detailed in table 1 with 1800 ml working volume were setup as semi continuous

experiment reactors dropped as the regular feeding in initial stage started the psychrophilic reactor r1 co was fed every three days and working with longer olr 63 days showed consistently a methane yield of 173 28 nml gcod fig 3 at tan of 560 10 mg l the mesophilic reactor r2 ww worked with an olr of 21 days with a methane production rate of 333 51 nml gcod and 240 20 mg l of tan fan concentrations were under 50 mg l due to working ph in r1 co and below 200 mg l in r2 ww with phs between 6 8 and 7 2 throughout the experiment the vfa analysis returned consistent concentrations of butyric and valeric acid under 700 mg l throughout both experiments r1 co and r2 ww with a slight increase at the end of phase iv in both reactors a surge in acetic and propionic acid was observed at 81 days in r1 co consistent with the decline in ph thus time for recovery and stabilization was allowed whenever ph dropped and vfa increased in the systems although acetic acid increased in r1 co by the end of the experiment propionic acid concentrations remained under 2000 mg l propionic and acetic acid concentrations increased above 10 000 mg l by the end of the experiment in r2 ww indicating failure in the anaerobic digestion process the overall performance of the psychrophilic reactor r1 co measured as cod removal fig 2 during the first 44 days once feeding started was 64 7 3 2 the mesophilic reactor r2 ww had 20 greater cod removal and nearly double the methane yield of r1 co which is typical for reactors of higher working temperature these values are considered as threshold points to enable comparison among different stages of increasing tan during the experiment see table s4 for further details 3 2 microbial community structure and dynamics r1 co exhibited declining α diversity from phase i 44 d through phase iii 118 d as shown in fig 3 considering wgs only there was a reduction of 40 in the α diversity at phase 4 with high ammonia concentrations methane yield did not change significantly p 0 05 during phases i through iii of the experiment but declined by 20 by day 139 p 0 05 by contrast r2 ww exhibited stable diversity between phases i through iii but declining methane yields significantly reduced in each of phases i through iii p 0 05 methane yields did not recover for r2 ww by phase iv day 139 the overall bacterial fraction in the psychrophilic and mesophilic reactors were 90 and 95 during this study respectively methanogens in r1 co 8 were twice the relative abundance observed in r2 ww 4 throughout the experiment fig s3 at the phylum level firmicutes 72 87 and bacteroidetes 13 were the most abundant under psychrophilic conditions while firmicutes 34 39 actinobacteria 13 43 and bacteroidetes 8 22 were abundant at mesophilic temperatures with ammonia inhibition fig s4 as shown in fig 4 diversity of bacteria in r1 co increased with an increase in tan bacilli class were the most abundant within firmicutes phyllum carnobacteriaceae and bacillaceae were overtaken by enterococcaceae at higher tan concentrations shifting from 0 1 to 80 the initial archaeae community used in the startup of the mesophilic reactor r2 ww changed with increasing tan concentrations the metagenome data fig 5 a returned a population dominated by methanosarcinaceae 95 and other members such as methanoculleus methanocorposculum and methanosaeta in the microbial consortium of r1 co the greater the tan concentration in the psychrophilic reactor the more it favored methanocorposculum 60 of the population based upon 16s data and up to 71 relative abundance considering wgs data a 70 decrease in the population of actinobacteria class in the mesophilic reactor r2 ww at phase iv was observed bacilliales relative abundance was stable even at high tan although methane yield had greatly decreased bacteroidia 93 abundance of bacteroides and clostridia clostridiaceae and eubacteriaceae predominantly increased in relative abundance as the reactor received daily feeding and methane production initiated suggesting active roles in the acidogenesis acetogenesis stages of ad likewise the archaea community was limited during the startup of the mesophilic reactor r2 ww mostly composed of methanosarcinaceae and methanobacteriaceae according to wgs fig 5a and limited to methanobacterium by 16s data fig 4b although the diversity of the archaea increased in r2 ww high tan concentrations and other stresses arising such as vfa accumulation and reduction of ph correlate to the subsequent drop in methane production at tan 4 g l the 16 s rrna data suggest that methanobacterium were dominant 60 methanospirrillum had an abundance of 10 fig 4b however metagenome analysis for samples at day 0 and 139 suggest that methanospirillum was 88 of the methanogen population at high tan in phase 4 fig 5a it is important to note that the wgs data also reflect presence of methanosarcina at both low and high ammoniacal concentrations under mesophilic conditions r2 ww but there was a shift in species dominance methanosarcina barkeri stands out as a more ammonia tolerant methanogen compared to methanosarcina mazei which initially dominated in 1 1 g l tan additionally methane concentrations dropped considerably due to collapse of the methanogen population 2500 hits while the psychrophilic reactor returned almost 300 000 hits for methanogens at day 139 fig 5b principle component analysis pcoa shows that the anaerobic communities in both psychrophilic and mesophilic reactors were changing over time fig 6 according to the matrix distances the biggest community difference was between 44 and 81 days in r1 co while there was no marked difference between communities at 3 gtan l and 4 gtan l which is related to the successful growth of methanocorposculum by contrast the mesophilic reactor exhibited the greatest change in community between 44 and 118 days 3 3 microbial function we used two different databases to analyze methane metabolism pathways subsystems and kegg orthology ko fig 7 reports number of hits for methanogenesis genes from the metagenomes in the subsystems database only methanosarcinaceae contributed genes for methanogenesis from methylated compounds in r1 co this metabolic pathway was reduced in 4 fold from day 0 to 139 in r1 co as the methanosarcinaceae population diminished genes for this metabolic pathway were not observed in the mesophilic reactor r2 ww although there was good production of methane at the initial stage of operation in the mesophilic reactor once feeding started 333 51 it dropped five fold as tan reached 3 g l to 70 nml gcod and was unable to recover by contrast the methane slightly increased from phase 1 to 2 in the psychrophilic reactor which was linked to the dominance of methanocorposculum above 75 relative abundance fig 4 with the genetic input for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis of around 80 from this organism since it has been reported that some bacterial species are capable of metabolizing methane as a source of energy enzmann et al 2018 we explored the kegg database for further insights in methanotrophy shown in fig 8 we observed a similar shift from methanosarcinaceae to methanocorpusculaceae at high tan concentrations interestingly kegg database shows that there were higher number of genes coding for methane metabolism in day 139 compared to susbsystems database this could be due to the increase on hits for methanogenesis from methylated compounds the microbial seed used for r2 ww reactor startup had a minimal number of gene copies for methanogenesis 20 hits as expected in stabilized sludge however as the feeding started we observed an increase in methane yield up to 320 nml ch4 gcod fig 8 which dramatically dropped as tan was increased in the system this was associated with the presence of eubacteriaceae 3 4 effect of struvite and other precipitates on anaerobic communities a white precipitate formed in r3 fw between 40 81 days and r4 mn between 20 to 61 days a minteq simulation was used to model the fw anaerobic digester provided reactor conditions of phosphorus potassium nitrogen ph and temperature the results of the simulation were likely precipitation of struvite and other phosphate salts due to oversaturation observed under the provided conditions see tables s5 and s6 tn concentrations in the reactors came from protein metabolism and external ammonia input from the stock ammonium phosphate intending tan stepwise increase the occurrence of struvite and other precipitates provided an opportunity to understand their effect on methanogenic communities as shown in fig 9 acetic acid started accumulating in r3 fw initial consortium from digester treating fw reaching concentrations that were eight times greater than the period before struvite precipitation was observed before phase ii started a similar pattern was observed in r4 mn initial microbial consortium from the dairy manure digester the 16s data reinforces the physicochemical analysis fig 10 shows that the abundance of methanogens sharply declined when precipitates were first observed in the reactors day 41 for r3 fw and day 22 for r4 mn wgs data for r3 fw day 44 and r4 mn day 22 are presented in fig s6 at least 67 of the unclassified group derived from euryarcheota in day 0 r3 fw were members of the genus methanoculleus 26 belonged to methanosarcina although struvite precipitation impacted the total population of methanogens members from methanomicrobiaceae were present even so methane production was reduced in at least 70 in r3 fw and r4 mn 100 nmlch4 gcod suggesting these organisms may not be as efficient as other methanogens 4 discussion 4 1 digester performance with daily feeding vfa production increased dropping the working ph indicative of active anaerobic decomposition of organic waste the surge in acetic and propionic acid in r2 ww by day 139 was associated with a significant increase in propionibacteriaceae a source of propionic acid and continued activity of acetogens which was also congruent with 50 lower methane yield siegert and banks 2005 reported that concentrations greater than 4000 mg total vfa l were inhibitory to methanogenesis which was evident in r2 ww buildup of vfas concentrations would occur owing buildup in end products of acetogenesis while cod may continue to be reduced but at a slower pace as vfas are partially converted to co2 propionate build up also occurred at the end of phase ii in r1 co which could also be a factor why methanocorposculum succeeded over methanosarcina the latter being an acetoclastic methanogen could have been greatly impacted by the propionic acid accumulation acting as an inhibitor as previously suggested by wiegant and zeeman 1986 even though methane production dropped at the last two phases in r2 ww cod removal was still above 50 this could be due to higher production of carbon dioxide co2 in the reactors since the co2 traps had to be changed with greater frequency the optimum working ph in ad is reported to be 6 5 8 5 shamurad et al 2019 the slightly low ph in these reactors closely reflect what happens in reactors receiving high olr fan of 45 mg l or greater and tan above 1 5 g l was reported to be inhibitory to ad in mesophilic conditions shi et al 2017 here inhibition was observed even at 1 5 g l tan fan 80 mg nh3 l throughout the experiment our results support previous findings from massé et al 2014 and tian et al 2018 that indicate fan is the major toxic form of ammonia although tan reached 4 g l in the psychrophilic reactor fan remained 35 mg l methane yields were not significantly impacted up to 3g l tan but reduced in 20 at a tan of 4 g l in r1 co by contrast it dropped more than 50 in mesophilic conditions with approximately 80 mg l fan masse et al 2014 reported ammonia inhibition in psychrophilic reactors with as low as 0 23 mlch4 gcod with high ammonia concentrations hence it is known ammonia inhibition can occur in psychrophilic reactors limiting analysis to physical and chemical characteristics in ad does not yield insight into the underlying processes of ammonia inhibition 4 2 digester microbial structure and dynamics the α diversity of our microbial consortia was greater considering wgs data that 16s rna data owing to the depth and accuracy in the analysis in general the lower diversity observed in psychrophilic conditions at high tan is congruent with prior reports for mesophilic reactors whereby selective pressure yields a more specialized community esquivel elizondo et al 2016 and tian et al 2018 likewise greater diversity observed during low methane yield periods in the mesophilic reactor r2 ww may indicate a lack of specialization of methanogens although different studies in mesophilic continuous systems reported inhibition above 5 g l of tan when acclimation occurred yenigün and demirel 2013 this study shows that only 1800 mg tan l 80 mg l of fan in r2 ww caused severe inhibition in methane yields distance matrix analysis revealed changes in the microbial community structure when tan increased from 1 g l to 2 g l de vrieze et al 2015 investigated microbial community structure in 29 full scale anaerobic digesters and reported that clusters were formed based on tan fan and temperature tian et al 2018 also reported changes in microbial dynamics due to high tan in ammonia acclimatization experiments in this study ammonia tolerant consortia formed different clusters than unacclimated consortia clostridiales and bacteroidetes were previously reported to be favored in a psychrophilic reactor normally working under low ammonia concentrations by pcr dgge technique wei and guo 2018 our results show similar abundance patterns even at high tan concentrations at 2 g l tan bacteroidaceae and clostridiales were the most abundant organisms in the mesophilic reactor r2 ww similar to what guo et al 2015 reported these are known fermentative bacteria producing different organic acids as well as co2 and h2 during ad traversi et al 2012 notably ph did not drop in the final days of phase iv even though high acetic and propionic acid concentrations were observed this can be attributed to the buffering capacity of the ammonium phosphate used as ammonia stock in the acclimation process buffering capacity was not observed when ammonium chloride was used as ammonia stock in another study poggi varaldo et al 1997 two successful ammonia acclimation experiments have previously been reported in mesophilic reactors with continuous operation working with up to 8 g l of tan without inhibition tian et al 2018 yan et al 2019 while some adaptation occurred in this study it was not as successful ammonia inhibition occurred even at 2 g l tan the variability of successful adaptation to elevated tan in mesophilic ad reported among investigators and differences in maximum operating tan concentrations for those who have successfully adapted their consortia has been attributed to the selection of initial inoculum de vrieze et al 2015 the four microbial seeds from different ad treating different organic wastes for this adaption experiments in this study highlight the importance of inoculum selection for the reactor startup to ensure stress tolerance and microbial resilience at field scale inoculum from the wastewater ad of this study appears to be a poor source of robust microbes for acclimatation due to low tolerance to ammonia while other inocula were more successful discrepancies between wgs and 16s rna methods for methanogen community composition were observed in our study and may be driven by the chosen analysis parameters microorganisms have copy numbers of rrna that can be quite variable from one taxon to another thus abundance could be influenced by this factor in 16s data thus we consider the deeper and more consistent wgs results as more representative than 16s rrna data in our analysis relative abundance of acetoclastic methanogens methanosaeta hydrogenotrophic methanobacterium and methanosarcina carrying acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic pathways were reduced at higher tan concentrations in r1 co indicating sensitivity of these methanogens to ammonia more than 70 of relative abundance was attributable to methanocorposculum at 3g tan l indicating methane production was dominated by the hydrogenotrophic pathway likewise it is important to note that methanosarcina barkeri was found to be more resistant than methanosarcina mazei at high ammoniacal concentration in r2 ww this could indicate that the hydrogenotrophic pathway was more active in the mesophilic reactor supporting claims from dai et al 2016 and tian et al 2018 likewise ziganshin et al 2016 linked methanoculleus with elevated ammonia whereas methanocorposculum methanobacterium and methanosaeta were inversely associated with ammonia in mesophilic continuous reactors under psychrophilic conditions in our study we report methanocorposculum to be the most resilient methanogen as demonstrated by 16s rrna and wgs analysis 70 at 3 gtan l the limited methanogenic activity in the initial consortium in r2 ww was likely owing its origin as a stabilized sludge two hydrogenotrophic methanogens present in this initial consortium methanospirillum and methanobacterium are commonly found in other ad reactors lim et al 2020 methanoculleus has only 1 gene copy of rrna while multiple copies have been reported on methanosarcina 3 copies and methanospirillum 4 copies rrndb database stoddard et al 2015 thus 16s rrna data could bias analysis methanoculleus was previously reported to be a robust species under high organic load and elevated ammonia compared to methanospirillum li et al 2016 in our study methanospirillum surpassed methanoculleus at high tan in r2 ww this methanogen is not considered robust because it yields low methane 4 3 digester microbial function in general all three main metabolic pathways for methane production were identified in psychrophilic r1 co and mesophilic r2 ww reactors where the hydrogenotrophic methanogens were dominant when the tan concentrations were high when subsystems and kegg databases were analyzed methane production in the initial inoculum for r2 ww was limited under this condition methanospirillaceae were the greatest contributor of methanogenesis genes at high ammonia concentrations in r2 methane production dropped five fold from that measured at the initial stage in r2 ww as tan approached 3 g l then remained at 70 nmlch4 gcod with further tan increase lacking metagenomic data during this period we hypothesize that the methanogen population dominated by methanobacteriaceae began their decline after day 81 when the first ammonia increase occurred likewise we highlight the shift in species abundance in r2 ww when analyzing methanogenesis related genes fig 7 and methane metabolism anabolism and catabolism genes fig 8 methanospirillaceae were the dominant contributors of methanogenesis related genes supporting the analysis presented above regarding methanotrophs eubacteriaceae carried 50 of methane metabolism genes it is well known that methanotrophs include members of both eubacteria and archaea and can grow aerobically or anaerobically thus it is possible that methane may have been consumed as an energy source by methanotrophic eubacteriaceae reducing in part the net methane production from this reactor hanson and hanson 1996 murrell et al 1998 the homoacetogens clostridium eubacterium and pelobacter form acetate from h2 and co2 populations were stable at low and high ammonia concentrations in r1 co although an increase of 33 was observed in the clostridium population this supports that methane production from acetate was active in the psychrophilic reactor even at high tan 4 4 novel resilient psychrophilic methanogen and implications little information about psychrophilic anaerobic digestion in general is available in the scientific and technical literature there is a paucity of information specifically on the effects of ammonia and other stresses on psychrophilic reactor performance and microbial community composition and function however some important generalizations likely to extend to psychrophilic anaerobic digestion can be drawn from the literature on mesophilic anaerobic digestion studies on the role of species interaction for successful adaptation cenci et al 2018 lawrence et al 2012 suggest that the way in which species interactions evolve in changing environments could determine the success of adaptation and outcomes in microbial community composition and function indeed interactions among methanogens and symbiotes are known to have significant impact upon successful methanogenesis at mesophilic temperatures under stress methanoculleus is a widely reported ammonia tolerant hydrogenotrophic methanogen esquivel elizondo et al 2016 fotidis et al 2017 frank et al 2016 wang et al 2015 in mesophilic reactors owing in part to syntropy with acetate oxidizing bacteria despite a slow growth rate esquivel elizondo et al 2016 frank et al 2016 diversity and redundancy are hallmarks of resilient systems combined with complex syntrophic interactions we can expect that there may be a greater variety of ammonia tolerant methanogens than presently known and expanded upon in our study it is quite possible that the success of methanocorposculum a hydrogenotrophic methanogen in this study under ammonia stress and psychrophilic conditions could be similar to that of methanoculleus with syntrophic interaction with acetate oxidizing bacteria playing a role regardless the high genetic contribution from methanocorposculum to methane formation under psychrophilic conditions despite high tan demonstrates its resilience this could have important implications for improving ammonia tolerance of ambient temperature digesters examples of such digesters include covered unheated anaerobic lagoons at large scale livestock feeding operations in the u s and unheated anaerobic digestion systems in developing regions of the world with warm climates small scale working ambient temperature digesters are abundant in places such as cuba india indonesia and central africa with predominantly hot weather working temperatures between 26 29 c but are also possible for areas such as peru bolivia and ecuador where low ambient temperatures at higher elevations can reach 22 23 c midday and year round working temperatures oscillating from 15 to 25 c voegeli 2014 developing countries are facing challenges with organic waste disposal and treatment poor energy infrastructure can limit wider adoption of mesophilic or thermophilic reactors our study provided insight about resilient methanogens such as methanocorposculum capable of adapting to high ammonia in reactors working at room temperature although methane production rates may be lower at psychrophilic temperatures this may be offset by lower energy demands required and the benefit of treating organic waste while obtaining biogas and fertilizers 4 5 struvite effects on methanogens during ad although prior information about the process and benefits of phosphorus recovery through struvite precipitation after anaerobic digestion exist castro molano et al 2018 huchzermeier and tao 2012 lorick et al 2020 yilmazel and demirer 2011 limited information has been reported regarding effects of unintentional struvite and other precipitates on methane production for example marti et al 2008 reported some operational problems due to struvite precipitation during ad evidencing struvite and other precipitates occurrence through modeling approaches marti et al 2008 romero guiza et al 2015 suggested a negative impact of struvite precipitation on anaerobic biomass following significant reduction in methane yield observed at near neutral ph romero güiza et al 2015 consistent with another study reporting up to 75 reduction in methane yield with struvite precipitation demirer et al 2013 in contrast one study reported no impact of struvite precipitation on methane yield but their evidence of struvite and other precipitate occurrence was limited to a mass balance analysis rather than observation or biogeochemical modeling sánchez ramírez et al 2019 at the time of this study we could not identify published literature specifically reporting the impact of unintentional struvite precipitation within anaerobic digesters on methanogens composition and structure via metagenomic analysis in this work formation of precipitates reduced digester performance and stability leading to cod and vfa accumulation and 60 69 reduction in methane production to 100 nml gcod the ph declined over the period the ammonia stock was supplied and remained approximately 7 3 for both reactors a similar pattern was observed in another study intending struvite precipitation in ad where ph reduction was related to the proton released by the displacement of the phosphorus equilibrium and tan fixation romero güiza et al 2015 acetic acid accumulation indicated greater impact on acetoclastic methanogens than bacteria metabolizing long chain fatty acids to small chain fatty acids accumulation of vfas in both mesophilic reactors r3 and r4 was linked to the abundance of acetogens including clostridiales ruminococcaceae and clostridiaceae and lactobacillales consistent with prior report blasco et al 2020 we could not achieve recovery for either reactor during an additional 100 days of operation post precipitate formation this study reports for the first time methanogen community composition and function in response to unintentional precipitate formation during anaerobic digestion the reduction in methanogenesis was not a response to increasing tan for example at the beginning of the experiment tan was approximately 3 g l in r3 which exhibited active methane production after precipitation in the same reactor tan was reduced to 2 g l with concomitant reduction in methane production rather precipitate formation sharply reduced the abundance of methanogens in both reactors and shifted community composition from one more abundant in methanoculleus and methanosarcina to one predominantly comprised of methanomicrobiaceae which were less productive although some recovery in methanogens was observed at day 117 and 97 in r3 and r4 respectively methanogenic activity remained limited for the rest of the experiment fig s6 further study is suggested to elucidate mechanisms underlaying the collapse of methanogens populations with precipitation 5 conclusions ammonia can be a major stressor in the ad of protein rich wastes developing strategies to mitigate inhibition caused by ammonia is essential to enhance the environmental and economic benefits of this technology this research showed that ammonia adaptation is possible in psychrophilic reactors r1 co with semi continuous feeding we confirmed that lower microbial diversity is linked to the selection of fewer resilient methanogens in reactors we also highlight the importance of inoculum selection for the reactor startup to ensure stress tolerance and microbial resilience throughout the adaptation experiments since successful ammonia acclimation was not achieved in mesophilic conditions r2 ww we hypothesize that methanogens are directly affected by tan which led to vfa accumulation mycobacteriaceae were abundant in r2 ww during reactor startup potentially linked to abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogen populations under low tan additionally methane consumption by eubacteriaceae under adverse conditions was reported species interaction could play a role on why methanocorpusculum successfully adapted to high ammonia concentrations by replacing methanoculleus in its syntrophic interaction with saob bacteria finally we report quantitatively the effects of unintentional precipitate formation during ad on methanogen community composition ultimately leading to reactor failure investigation of the underlying mechanisms by which methanocorposculum is more resistant to ammonia and how struvite interacts with methanogens is warranted funding this research was funded by the new york state pollution prevention institute nysp2i

16667,the integrated vertical flow ivf constructed wetland consists of two or more chambers with heterogeneous flow patterns and strong aeration capability possesses favorable remediation performance the constructed wetland model no 1 cwm1 embedded in the opengeosys iphreeqc was applied to investigate the wetland plant effects on treatment efficiency two fundamental functions of the plant roots i the radial oxygen loss rol and ii exudation of internal organic carbon ioc are developed and implemented in the model to simulate the treating processes of planted laboratory scale ivf wetlands fed by the synthetic wastewater the good agreement between simulated results and measurements of the planted ivf wetland and the unplanted filters mimicking wetland demonstrates the combined effects of rol and ioc and the model reliability in summer the ammonia nh4 n and total nitrogen tn removals are high as above 90 in both ivf wetlands and in winter they decline significantly to around 55 and 45 in unplanted wetland contrastively to about 85 and 78 in the planted wetland the nitrogen removal cod n ratio relation curves of ivf wetlands are proposed and obtained by modeling to evaluate organic carbon loading status based on the curves the cod n ratios of unplanted and planted wetlands are about 3 7 and 3 10 gcod gn for high tn removal respectively planted wetlands can tolerate a wider range of cod n ratio influents than unplanted ones the rol in the unplanted wetland promotes cod and nh4 n removal while may inhibit denitrification under low temperature conditions the single addition of ioc enhances the oxygen consuming and restrains the nitrification under the full loaded cod condition summing up all organic carbon releases from substrate and roots as ioc the quantification of ioc acts on nitrogen treatment was simulated and compared with the external organic carbon eoc loading from influent ioc performs higher efficiency on tn removal than eoc at the same organic loading rates

engineering systems designed and assembled with economical advantage in lower operational and maintenance costs to treat wastewater in more controllable conditions plants are regarded as an essential component of wetlands that the stem and leaf above the substrate play the role of landscaping ornament recreation wildlife habitat creation alleviating the influence of extreme weather as well as the nutrient removal capacity hua et al 2018 wang et al 2017 wetlands with plants were observed to have more stable treatment performance and higher removals especially for nitrogen rather than bod and

treatment performance has been widely discussed the primary perception of the nutrient removal pathway was the nutrients uptake ammonium is the preferential biotic uptake source among inorganic nitrogen nayar et al 2010 comparing to the wastewater loadings the amount of nutrients removed by plant harvesting is generally insignificant bachand and horne 2000 brix 1997 kim and geary 2001 the proportions of nitrogen removal by plants uptake in wetlands are 4 11 and 2 8 given by lin et al 2002 and tanner 2001 respectively while proportions by denitrification are about 89 96 lin et al 2002 in some researches the amount of nutrients removed by plants can be high in the low loaded systems especially the horizontal subsurface flow wetlands greenway and woolley 2001 kyambadde et al 2004 in general the expected maximum nitrogen and phosphorus removal by plant uptake directly and harvesting was small lin et al 2002 usepa 2011 yang 2001 the rhizosphere zone of plant roots is considered to be one of the most dynamic interfaces on earth philippot et al 2013 plants roots can accelerate the development of microbial communities by promoting alternate aerobic and anaerobic microenvironments stottmeister et al 2003 internal aeration is crucial for root growth under anoxic conditions and the oxygen is transported via the aerenchyma to the root tips enabling root growth into anoxic soil haichar et al 2008 the oxygen release to the soil called radial oxygen loss rol was observed measured and quantified significant differences among species were tested rol in the rhizosphere has been related to the removal of tn among different plant species mei et al 2014 paranychianakis et al 2016 generally rol was positively correlated with photosynthetic rate transpiration rate root activity root biomass above ground biomass leaf biomass root porosity maximum root length lai et al 2012 the oxygen profiles patterns in the rhizosphere present oxygen saturation peaked around the middle part of roots and the thickness of stably oxidized zones increased as the roots grew wang et al 2014 the oxygen transport model between root and soil was studied and established cook and knight 2003 cook et al 2013 plant roots may release up to 20 of their photosynthesis products into the soil providing the basis for the establishment of plant microorganism interactions haichar et al 2008 the newly generated carbon derived from root exudates and carbon in soil organic matter are available for microbial growth caspersen et al 2004 wu et al 2012 the majority of root exudates including primary metabolites sugars amino acids and organic acids are regarded to be passively lost from the root and used by rhizosphere dwelling microbes canarini et al 2019 dundek et al 2011 the plants show high power on organic matter degradation through bacteria caused by root exudation moreover wetland plants deliver organic carbon via root exudates to fuel the microbial denitrification process in constructed wetland systems receiving nitrate rich and low carbon wastewater zhai et al 2013 show doc release rates from root amounted to 0 6 4 8 of the net photosynthetically fixed carbon extrapolating the laboratory measurements to field conditions suggests that plant root exudates may potentially fuel a denitrification rate of 94 267 kgn ha 1 year 1 in subsurface flow constructed wetlands root exudates are potentially important as an organic carbon source for denitrification in lightly loaded subsurface flow constructed wetland root exudates can act as endogenous carbon sources for heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and ultimately determine the microbe distribution patterns in micro polluted wetlands wu et al 2017 nutrient removal was positively correlated with microbe density in the rhizosphere which is affected by root exudates chen et al 2016 in recent years nitrogen content increases in urban sewage and the deficient carbon loading problems are common for wetlands operation in china the denitrifying bacteria require labile organic carbon as an energy source denitrification clement et al 2002 the organic loading rate olr influents the nitrifying and denitrifying bacterial community pelissari et al 2016 excessive and insufficient organic carbon leads to the reduction of nitrogen removal ding et al 2012 wu et al 2013 in the numerous practices of wetland construction and operation in china the treat performances were usually restricted by low cod n ratios xie et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 to promote total nitrogen removal numerous researches focused on the cod n ratios of influent wastewater akizuki et al 2015 ding et al 2012 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2017 the planted wetlands achieve efficient nitrogen removal under both high and low cod n conditions huett et al 2005 zhu et al 2014 it is difficult to set a guideline value on cod n ratio for high nitrogen removals which are related to wetland configurations operation mode plantation nitrogen composition and types of wastewater to be treated saeed and sun 2012 nevertheless for a certain wetland the cod n ratios can be the guidance to evaluate whether the wetland is overloaded or lightly loaded by cod the properties of substrates predominate not only the hydrodynamics but also the biological dynamics adsorption and fixation process consequently influence the treatment efficiency lima et al 2018 shi et al 2018 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2019 the concept of internal supplies of organic carbon from the filter material was brought out as an alternative solution by saeed and sun 2011a 2011b and tee et al 2012 the background concentration in substrates in terms of organic carbon is often assumed to be around 3 mg l 1 rousseau et al 2004 the impacts of some different unconventional substrates on the nitrogen and organics removal were summarized saeed and sun 2012 some fillers were selected for internal organic carbon ioc supplement which can promote denitrification and improved nitrogen treat performance saeed and sun 2017 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2019 it should be mentioned that the additional ioc may only benefit the micro pollutant water and deficient carbon system most researches brought forth the options of filler selection for better treatment it is difficult to assess the effects of quantitative ioc loading as well as spatial assembly of ioc on the removal by experiments constructed wetland models have been considered as an important tool to enhance understanding of the simultaneous physic chemical and biological processes and to optimize the design and operation of wetlands in general the process based models consist of the hydraulic module transport module biochemical module most biochemical modules were developed based on activated sludge models to simulate the biokinetic process in recent years the improved cwm1 has become popular for modeling boog et al 2019 john et al 2020 langergraber et al 2009 based on the framework of the wetlands model some mechanistic processes were implemented in the model to investigate combined effects caused by external and internal factors the clogging process boano et al 2018

release by plant roots were simulated by samsó and garcia 2013a in which all ammonium ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen were taken into account for uptake and plants did not cause noticeable differences giraldi et al 2010 regarded that the uptake could be ignored and the oxygen released by plant roots was calibrated by oxygen transfer parameters in simulation the carbon exudations from roots have not been considered and brought into the modeling the present study is based on observation results from two laboratory scale experimental ivf wetlands which were filled with zeolite one was planted with phragmites australis and the other was unplanted the plant effects as radial oxygen loss rol and internal organic carbon ioc exudates associated with the adsorption clogging effects are developed and implemented in the biological dynamics model of cwm1 which is coupled to a reactive transport model opengeosys iphreeqc the comparisons between the experimental measurements and modeling results are carried out to calibrate the parameters and verify the model reliability the nitrogen removal cod n ratio relation curves are put forward and the curves for unplanted and planted wetlands are calculated by the model to evaluate carbon loading levels instead of conventional experiments two important factors as rol and ioc are simulated in a whole year respectively to analyze the seasonal treatments alteration along with the bacteria activities and temperature changes for deficient carbon systems many experiments focused on the filler selections while the quantitative supplements of ioc and its impacts were difficult to assess following the concept of internal carbon source the model calculates the nitrogen removal variation with the growth of external organic carbon eoc and the internal organic carbon ioc respectively to further understand the spatial function of carbon sources 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental ivf wetlands taking the advantage of horizontal flow hf wetlands and vertical flow vf wetlands the integrated vertical flow ivf wetlands with relatively high treatment performance for common pollutants have become one of the main wetland types in china chang et al 2013 chen et al 2008 the laboratory scale experiments were carried out at hefei university of technology there were several ivf wetlands with identical geometrical size which was 1m long 0 5m wide and 0 65m height with a bottom slope of 0 5 each ivf wetland was divided into a down flow chamber dfc and an up flow chamber ufc by a vertical clapboard in the middle which left a 5cm narrow slit at the bottom to connect two chambers fig 1 the surface elevations of the down flow chamber were 10cm higher than those of the up flow chamber the water pipes were distributed on the surface of the down flow chamber and water was collected on the surface of the up flow chamber the experiments were designed to study the effects of wetland plants there were two parallel ivf wetlands filled with granular zeolite as one is a normal wetland with plants and the other is unplanted filters mimicking wetland systems the granular media consisted of 3 layers shown in fig 1 the 1st layer in the upper down flow chamber composed of fine gravels d 2 4 mm initial porosity n 40 has a thickness of 0 35m and the 2nd layer in the upper up flow chamber with fine gravels d 2 4 mm initial porosity n 45 has a thickness of 0 25m the 3rd layer at bottom of wetland with coarser gravels d 4 8 mm porosity n 45 is 0 3m thick the intermittent influent was supplied by a peristaltic pump with a time relay the duration of single feeding was 2 hours and the interval between single loadings is 1 hour the single wastewater loadings were 7 5l the phragmites australis were transplanted in ivf wetlands in march 2014 and grew well in the summer the wetland plants started to wither in oct and were harvested in dec the ivf wetlands in summer and winter are shown in fig 2 although the model can calculate the spatiotemporal variations of water components in the wetland many experiments usually provide the changes between influent and effluent and the internal alterations are mostly similar to the black box to investigate the water variation inside the ivf wetlands there were 3 internal sites along the flow stream for sampling which were shown in fig 1 the wetlands were operated with hydraulic loading rates hlr of approximately 0 24 m3 m2 d 1 and hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 7 days the mean annual precipitation and evaporation are 1036 7mm and 703mm in hefei city the water loss due to evaporation and reed transpiration is about 2 2 4 of influent and the extra water from rainfall is about 2 4 of influent the wetland system can be regarded as a water balance the synthetic wastewater supplies are fed to ivf wetlands and the influent concentrations of components as organic loading glucose nh4 n tn and do the monitoring was carried out after several months till its stable operation in june 2014 the concentrations of the influent internal sites and effluent were monitored once a month and usually 3 samples were taken for each time the values were shown in table 1 the total nitrogen in influent mainly consists of ammonia in the experiment and with cod n ratio is around 5 9 7 1 2 2 model description 2 2 1 model setup the established model framework ogs iphreeqc coupled with constructed wetland model no1 cwm1 has been applied for ivf wetlands modelling in this study opengeosys ogs is an open source finite element simulator for thermo hydro mechanical chemical processes which has been developed for several decades bilke et al 2019 kolditz et al 2012 ogs has been used in various environmental disciplines such as water resources management soil physics geothermal energy systems and deep geological deposition of hazardous waste in this work the capabilities of ogs for multicomponent transport processes in variably saturated porous media are presented kalbacher et al 2011 phreeqc is one of the most widely used open source geochemical solvers for aqueous mineral gas surface ion exchange solid solution equilibria and kinetic reactions it can also provide a well defined set of methods for data transfer and management charlton and parkhurst 2011 cwm1 is a general model to describe the biochemical transformation and degradation processes for organic matter nitrogen and sulphur in subsurface flow constructed wetlands which can be appended in the framework of phreeqc since both ogs and phreeqc are open source models they have been technically coupled on the code level as ogs iphreeqc i stands for interface he et al 2015 lu et al 2017 the ivf wetlands have two chambers that result in a spatial heterogeneous distribution of hydrodynamic and water quality components the computed domain is discretized by quadrangle meshes and divided into 3 sub domains filled with 3 different porous materials which is shown in fig 3 the influent and effluent boundary conditions of hydrodynamics and water quality are set up on the surface of the down flow chamber and the up flow chamber respectively the inflow rates and concentration of cod nh4 n and tn are identified for both ivf wetlands the influent water is well distributed on the down flow chamber surface with the hydraulic loading rate of 0 24 m3d 1 the time series of cod nh4 n and tn concentration is from the measurements since the cod of inflow is made by glucose in the experiment the influent cod is regarded as biodegradable dissolved cod sf in the model and the easily biodegradable particle cod xs is 0 the measured influent concentrations of components as organic loading glucose nh4 n tn and do associated with discharges were input as discharge boundary the outflow boundary is set as a pressure boundary with zero gradient concentration initially all water quality variables including bacterial components are set to a small value as 10 2 mg l 1 in the computed domain for starting in the planted wetland the two chambers are almost full filled by the roots of well grown phragmites australis which are set as root zones in modelling although the reeds were harvested in winter the functions of roots are still active the geometrical domain is relatively regular the heterogeneous quadrilateral meshes are applied for simulation the uniform coarse meshes with the size of 9 98cm 2 7778cm are utilized in the main body of down flow and up flow chambers and slightly fine meshes are in the upper layers of the down flow chamber and the bottom layers of wetlands the clapboard set as 2mm thick in the middle is not figured into the computed domain the smallest mesh is generated at the junction of two chambers with a size of 0 2cm 1 25cm there is a slight slope at the bottom so the bottom meshes are varied the computation domain meshes and boundary conditions in the model are indicated in fig 3 to investigate the spatial variations in ivf wetlands 1 polyline is defined for the model output also shown in fig 3 the polyline starts from the surface of the down flow chamber down to the bottom line1 then goes to the horizontal direction at the bottom to the up flow chamber line 2 finally it from the bottom to the surface of ufc line 3 2 2 2 hydraulic module the unsaturated and saturated zone both exist in the ivf wetlands the richards

volumetric water content m is the coefficient in van genuchten model 2 2 3 biological dynamic model the biological dynamic module is used constructed wetland model cwm1 langergraber et al 2009 which models the dissolved oxygen organic carbon organic nitrogen ammonia and oxidized nitrogen hydrogen sulphide and sulfate as well as the growth and decay of heterotrophic fermenting autotrophic methanogenic and sulfate reducing and sulphide oxidizing bacteria cwm1 computes 17 processes and 16 components the computed component consists of 8 dissolved species and 8 particulate species dissolved species indicated by si i 1 2 are only present in the aqueous phase and particulate species indicated by xi i 1 2 are defined both in the aqueous mobile and solid immobile phases part of the cod and all bacteria species belong to the particulate species the particulate components participate in the attachment and detachment processes and transform between mobile and immobile statues the transport of aqueous mobile components with absorption effects in unsaturated porous media is described by eq 4 as 4 n θ c i t ρ s s a d s t n θ d c i q c i q c i r c i where i 1 2 k k is the total

oxygen is an important component to influences the treatment performance of ivf wetland the porosity of the unsaturated zone brings air into substrates and intermittent water supply generating saturation changes is used for aeration oxygen transfer rate otr from air to water is the function of properties temperature the concentration of saturated dissolved oxygen and local dissolved oxygen garcía et al 2010 pointed out that the oxygen transfer coefficient is an inverse proportion function of depth especially in vertical flow wetlands combining the depth impacts on otr we developed eq 5

langergraber and šimůnek 2012 mburu et al 2012 samsó and garcia 2013b photosynthesis of plants increases oxygen partial pressure in the blades and helps oxygen transport to the underground parts through aerenchyma and spreads oxygen to the rhizosphere in the form of rol in winter although the leaves wither in winter the reservation of ventilation tissue promotes the rol in this study rol is referred to the formula from cook et al cook and knight 2003 cook et al 2013 which is calculated by eq 6 6 r o l 2 π d l l 0 s r o o t α o s o l n r a e x p z z r where d l is the diffusion

the depth m z r is the scaling depth m r is the radius of a zone of saturated soil around the root plus the root m a is the parameters of the root radius m depth is the main factor that affects the magnitude of rol the rol is high in the surface layer and decreases exponentially against the depth 2 internal organic carbon ioc loading from root exudate the organic loading changes the microbial community and determines the growth of heterogeneous denitrifying bacteria zhai et al 2013 in an aerobic environment organic matter can be metabolized by a large number of heterotrophic bacteria through oxygen the internal organic loading from filling material and root exudates should not be ignored as for the gravels without specially treated the plants roots are the largest internal source of organic matter according to the experimental researches doc released by root is affected by photosynthesis temperature light regime nutrient availability and the plant species van veen et al 1991 carbon released from living plant roots to soil has been reported to account for 15 25 of below ground allocated carbon kuzyakov 2002 and 10 40 of the net primary production of the plants warembourg 2003 in daytime or high temperature roots exudes more organic matter than in the dark or low temperature in this study considering the temperature impacts on plant roots we introduce the internal organic carbon ioc loading by plants as 7 i o c k r o o t θ r c t 20 in which kroot is the organic carbon exudate from plant roots at 20 c mg l 1 h 1 θ r c is the temperature coefficient t is the water temperature the ioc from roots is assumed as the uniform distribution in the computed domain 3 ammonia absorption the zeolite is common for the substrates in wetland therefore was selected in this experiment the zeolite is an adsorbent with strong adsorption capacity because of the powerful cation exchange capacity collison and grismer 2014 the ammonium was adsorbed by substrate besides conversion into nitrates during the feeding period and the adsorbed mass of ammonium was nitrified during the rest period provoking high nitrates concentrations consequently morvannou et al 2014 the adsorption capacity of zeolite was calculated by langmuir isothermal adsorption equation described by equation 8 8 s s m a x k l c 1 k l c where s is the amount of adsorbate on the adsorbent g g 1 k l means the distribution coefficient of langmuir m3g 1 s m a x is the maximum amount of adsorbate on the adsorbent g g 1 c is the concentration of the dissolved species g l 1 the coefficient values of smax kl refer to the experimental studies lu et al 2016 4 clogging and limitation of biomass the clogging process led by the particle materials attachment on the substrate is considered in the simulation following by boog et al 2019 samsó and garcia 2013b the particle cod composed of xs and xi which are both separated into the mobile and immobile parts obeys the 1st order attach detach process additionally the processes are taken into consideration referring boog et al 2019 and samsó and garcia 2013b 1 microbial reproduction over the medium impedes bacterial growth the parameter is

results and discussion 3 1 model calibration the modelled period is consistent with the experimental period from may 2014 to aug 2015 the influent concentrations of components as organic loading glucose nh4 n tn and do were measured these concentrations correspond to mean values measured in all samples and are 0 for sno sh2s and sso4 influent concentrations of bacteria groups are generally very small in comparison to the amount present within the granular media and were neglected the influent cod consisted of inert cod ci readily biodegradable cod cr and slowly biodegradable soluble cod cs since total cod was represented by glucose according to john et al 2020 the proportion of each fraction was defined to be 1 fermentable readily biodegradable soluble cod sf is 94 4 2 inert soluble cod si is 2 8 3 inert particulate cod xi is 2 8 4 slowly biodegradable particulate cod xs and fermentation products as acetate cod sa are 0 all components in the influent set at the boundary are aqueous mobile the initial concentrations of all simulated components and bacterial groups in wetland were set to zero to recreate the start up situation and to reduce the impact of imposed initial conditions on bacteria distribution the time series of water temperature in fig 4 were taken into simulations as the forcing term the material properties of 3 kinds of substrates fig 1 in each layer were described by van genuchten model and the saturated permeability was calculated by the empirical formula utilized the grain size and porosity ishaku 2011 the parameter or coefficient values are listed in table 2 parameter values of material properties in 3 substrate layers the dispersions of mass transport at the longitudinal and transverse direction are 0 4 m2s 1 and 0 01m2 s 1 respectively there is no tracer experimental data available for calibration the two main aspects of plant effects in modelling are considered as rol and ioc which are switched off in no plant np modelling and switched on in with plants wp case the cwm1 model possesses the amount of parameters and most parameter values in the paper are from published references langergraber et al 2009 toscano et al 2009 samsó and garcia 2013b some are calibrated by experimental data besides the inherent ones the parameter values of rol and internal organic carbon ioc loading from plant roots are from references and calibration the aeration by intermittent influent is calibrated by the data of the unplanted ivf wetland experiment the important parameters are listed in table 3 in the experiment the effluent and the water inside the wetland were sampled and measured the comparisons of measured effluent concentrations of cod nh4 n and tn with simulated concentrations without and with the plant abbreviation for np and wp from may 2014 to aug 2015 are shown in fig 5 the measured variables are denoted by the symbols and the computed results are indicated by lines the inflow cod nh4 n and tn are reduced by both laboratory scale ivf wetlands and the planted wetland has better treatment performance than unplanted one in the whole year that is indicated by the measurements and the simulated results the cod removals are considerably high 85 in both planted and unplanted wetlands during the operating period the nitrogen removals are highest in summer and lowest in winter the lowest removal appears in feb 2015 the contrasts of nh4 n and tn removal between ivf wetlands planted and unplanted are remarkable in winter in which planted wetland has 75 85 removal rates and unplanted wetland has 40 50 rate it is consistent with many practical applications and experiments that the nitrogen removal variation along with the seasons in treating nitrate laden wastewater of wetlands boog et al 2019 the season s efficiency of nitrogen removal from high to low is in the turn of summer autumn spring and winter chang et al 2013 the treat performance of nitrogen decreases in the second year shown by both measurements and simulations which may be due to the small size of ivf wetland and the fast development of the clogging process in terms of the effluent concentrations in the summer of 2014 there is no significant difference between the planted and unplanted wetland the interior water was sampled and measured in aug 2014 for inside investigation in fig 1 the simulated cod nh4 n tn and do along the polyline in fig 3 are plotted and compared with the measured data in fig 6 the polyline passes through the down flow chamber dfc the bottom bot and the up flow chamber ufc which are denoted in fig 6 high levels 96 and 97 of cod were successfully removed from synthetic wastewater by planted and unplanted laboratory scale ivf wetlands respectively although subtle differences between the effluent of np and wp wetlands appear in fig 6 in august 2014 the interior differences of nitrogen are remarkable the cod nh4 n and tn decrease gradually along the flow stream in both ivf wetlands the cod profile in the planted wetland is similar to that in the unplanted one the concentrations of nh4 n and tn in the down flow chamber and bottom in np wetland are higher than those in wp wetland in the planted wetland the nh4 n and tn are removed about 80 in the down flow chamber and the reduction of the rest nitrogen become slowly on the contrary the nitrogen removals in the down flow chamber in np wetland are about 50 and the removal rates persist in the bottom and up flow chamber nh4 n and tn in the down flow chamber decrease more rapidly in wp wetland than in np wetland the laboratory scale ivf wetlands fed by intermittent wastewater exhibit the high efficiency of cod and nitrogen removal there is sufficient do for the degradation of cod and nh4 n in both ivf wetlands additionally the effluent do indicates the differences between np and wp wetlands in fig 6 the down flow chamber in wetland is the area for do consumption resulting in similar do profiles from the surface to bottom in both wetlands do rises in ufc from the bottom to the surface and do in wp is higher than that in np at the outlet in general the simulated time serial of effluent and profiles of cod nh4 n and tn in summer in both ivf wetlands are in agreement with the measured data which proves the reliability for plant setting in the model 3 2 hydrodynamics and water quality in ivf wetlands the modelling results provide the spatiotemporal data of variables to investigate their relationships there is no distinct hydrodynamic difference in the planted and unplanted wetlands due to the model settings and the simulated distributions of saturation and flow speeds in ivf wetlands are shown in fig 7 a and b the substrates at the surface layer in the down flow chamber are unsaturated the rest area is saturated in fig 7 a the domestic flow directions in the two chambers are opposite the highest magnitude of flow speeds occurs at the joint area at bottom of two chambers the lowest flow speeds appear at ancipital bottom corners where may form the dead zone in ivf wetlands under the steady hydrodynamic conditions the bio chemical processes form the spatial distinct patterns of do cod nh4 n and tn in planted and unplanted wetlands the distributions of do cod nh4 n and tn on aug 15th 2014 in the unplanted wetland are selected and shown in fig 8 the intermittent influent generate the partially unsaturated zone in the top layer of wetlands that possess high oxygen transfer capacity and boosts the nitrification reaction the concentration of cod nh4 n and tn decrease following the flow streams from the down flow chamber to the up flow chamber in which cod drops faster than nh4 n and tn the aerobic and anoxic conditions alternately exist in ivf wetlands in practice applications both hf wetlands and ivf wetlands have been widely employed to treat polluted surface water or domestic wastewater chang et al 2013 according to the structural differences ivf wetlands provide the meandering flow and aerobic anoxic aerobic alternately conditions for nitrification and denitrification while hf wetlands offer the smooth horizontal flow and predominant anoxic condition for denitrification the nitrogen component of the influent is one of the primary factors to be considered for the wetland design 3 3 nitrogen removal cod n ratio curves in unplanted and planted wetlands the proper quantities of organic carbon feeding into the wetlands can overcome the limitations of deficient carbon loading to support denitrification and upgrade the nitrogen removal performance chang et al 2013 ingersoll and baker 1998 the cod n ratio at 2 5 showed the highest tn removal in zhao et al 2010 while in the other researches the proper cod n ratios in a range of 2 5 20 in fan et al 2013 and 6 in ding et al 2012 the influent cod n ratio is related to do supply which may affect the balance between nitrification and denitrification in wetlands and cod n ratios in a range of 2 20 wang et al 2020 and cod n ratios at 10 in wu et al 2016 the cod n ratios to promote nitrogen removal alter with a plantation temperature wetland configurations aeration nitrogen composition therefore it is not a universal value saeed and sun 2012 nitrogen removal shows differently in unplanted and planted wetlands in section 3 2 1 to explore the appropriate influent cod n for nitrogen removal a series of cod n ratios for unplanted and planted wetlands respectively are simulated the constant temperature at 25 c and the same parameters setting in section 3 1 are employed in the models the first scenario presents the unplanted wetland and the second scenario presents the planted wetland both simulations run two months period for analysis the removal of nh4 n and tn along cod n ratios of unplanted and planted wetlands are plotted in fig 9 in the intermittent feeding wastewater nh4 n is the predominant component in the nitrogen composition the 80 removal is set as the high treating performance the high nh4 n removal is at cod n 7 2 in np wetland and cod n 10 5 in wp wetland which are the threshold values for nh4 n removal if cod n is larger than the threshold values the removal drops fast when cod n ranges in 4 7 in np wetland and 3 10 in planted wetland tn is treated efficiently and the ratio range of planted wetland is wider than that of unplanted wetland the lower cod n ratios indicate deficient carbon for bacteria growth and restrict denitrification while higher cod n ratios cause high do consumption consequently inhibits the nitrification and both situations result low tn removal the cod n ratio of influent in the experiment is about 6 0 7 1 which approaches the upper limit of the high nitrogen removal of unplanted wetland the organic loading is sufficient for the nitrification in np wetland however it is in the appropriate range of wp wetland the planted wetland can tolerate the large changes of carbon loading and maintain the high treat performance which has been observed by experiments huett et al 2005 zhu et al 2014 3 4 effects of plants and temperature on treatment performance the combined aspects of plants root as rol and ioc are set for wp computations do is a crucial factor for treatment and rol function was already mentioned and simulated by langergraber and šimůnek 2012 saeed and sun 2013 samsó and garcia 2013a the increasing do from rol enhances the removal of cod and nh4 n in the wetland system while in low temperature conditions increasing do may weaken the tn removal boog et al 2019 to investigate the contributions of rol and ioc separately in treatment based on the np model rol only and ioc only are added and employed in modelling the comparisons are consist of 4 cases abbreviated as np rol ioc and wp the boundary conditions and the parameters set in the model are identical to those in section 3 1 the time series of effluent results of 4 cases are exhibited in fig 10 the removal varied in the year corresponds to seasons the activity of bacteria is weakened at low temperature therefore do consumption decreased especially by nitrifying bacteria the sufficient do levels inhibited the activity of denitrifying bacteria xh and decreased nox n removal compared to the np case the rol function promotes the removal of cod nh4 n significantly especially in winter which is similar to the wp case as for the tn removal the promotion by rol is unremarkable against wp sometimes in summer tn removal by rol is slightly higher than np based on the comparative high removal rol vitalizes the heterotrophic bacteria xh and autotrophic nitrifying bacteria xa to reduces the cod and nitrify nh4 n nevertheless it might inhibit the denitrification process and decrease the nox n removal the computed cod and nh4 n concentration of effluent in rol cases are approximate to the wp case while the tn values in winter and next year are high than that in wp the function of ioc drags down the removals ioc in the substrates consumes oxygen and depresses the elimination of cod nh4 n and tn the compound function of rol and ioc achieves the best performance the order of removal efficiency from low to high is ioc np rol and wp two typical moments for summer and winter are selected to study the temperature impacts in fig 10 the concentration of cod nh4 n tn and do along the polyline inside the ivf wetlands on august 15th 2014 for 4 simulation cases are exhibited in fig 11 all ivf wetlands operate well in summer with a low contaminate concentration in the effluent the profiles of cod nh4 n tn and do in np and ioc cases are approximate although the concentrate values are a little higher in ioc than those in np ioc lowers do demand nitrification and cod removal along the flow way since ioc is evenly distributed in wetlands in the rol and wp cases most cod nh4 n and tn from influent are eliminated powerfully in the dfc with the dropping do consequently do escalates due to the less residual pollutants to be treated in the ufc taking the np case as a reference do changes δdo in rol ioc and wp cases in the whole domain are displayed in fig 12 under the function of rol do increases slightly in the top thin layer of the down flow chamber and rises obviously in the half upper layer of the up flow chamber indicated in fig 9 a without the rol supply otr provides do for biochemical reaction and transport through the flow in fig 6 ioc in substrates causes the competition of do consumption and aggravates the do deficiency at the bottom in ivf wetland in fig 9 b the combination function of rol and ioc do ascends in some area in the upper layers in winter the treat performance declines with the descent temperature the concentration of cod nh4 n tn and do along the polyline inside the ivf wetland on jan 15th 2015 for 4 simulation cases are exhibited in fig 13 comparing the performance in summer cod removal declines slightly while nh4 n and tn removal descend appreciably in winter going to the profiles the ioc and np cases have similar patterns and wp and rol cases show the resemblance in ioc and np cases about 61 83 cod is ridden in dfc and eventually the removal is about 85 92 the nh4 n and tn increase about by 7 instead of decrease in dfc then drop slowly at the bottom and ufc decrease by 40 60 at the outlet the nh4 n removal in wp and rol keep high as 90 and tn removal in rol is 64 which is lower than 81 in wp the inhibition of nitrification is initiated with increasing carbon loads wu et al 2013 to improve the understanding of the treat performance changes in seasons the distribution of heterotrophic bacteria xh autotrophic nitrifying bacteria xa and fermenting bacteria xfb along the polyline inside the ivf wetlands in summer and winter are plotted in fig 14 large amounts of xh accumulate at the surface of the down flow chamber in fig 14 there is competition between xh and xa in the substrate biofilm in winter the growth rate of xh does not drop at low temperatures while the growth of xa was significantly inhibited gao et al 2015 the competition between xh and xa become intensified in low temperature condition the high density of xh leads to high mortality and lysis which generates a quantity of cod and nh4 n langergraber and šimůnek 2005 2012 which in turn causes the slowing down removal of cod and increasing nh4 n in dfc in winter xa reduces in the down flow chamber in contrast to high xa in summer additionally the attachment of particulate material also weakens the growth xa in the down flow chamber the spaces for xa growth are squeezed into the up flow chamber in ioc cases the oxygen is taken up not only by the inflow cod but also by the ioc forming the anoxia condition in the down flow chamber do deficiency in the down flow chamber also transform the high xfb in the unplanted wetland part of cod is removed by xfb through fermentation in anoxia condition in down flow chamber which results higher xfb concentration and slightly lower xh at some area in ioc comparing with unplanted wetland going back to fig 9 the increasing carbon loading enhances the consumption of limited do and depresses xa additional it strengthens the competition between xh and xa while xh has greater advantages with a higher growth rate against that of xa with the continuous growth of cod n xa was severely restricted and the nitrification capacity almost is weakened and disappeared a great amount of xh take the advantage to reproduce and consequently the lysis of high mortality brings nh4 n which is shown as the negative removal in terms of the main bacteria components in this model produced by hydrolysis and high oxygen transfer capacity a large amount of xh grows at the surface layer of the down flow chamber due to its high olr in the unsaturated zone below the 10cm depth of the down flow chamber xa begins to grow and consume the oxygen which accords with the decreasing oxygen in the down flow chamber the concentration of total bacterial is highest at the surface layer of the down flow chamber due to the high pollution loads and the mass of bacteria in the down flow chamber takes the majority share of the system the additional internal organic carbon ioc in the unplanted wetland without rol decreases the nh4 n and tn removal while the integration function of ioc and rol in planted wetland upgrades the performance which is coherent to the results in section 3 2 2 3 5 influence of internal organic carbon on treatment performance the deficient carbon loading causes the low nitrogen removal is the common problem of wetland operation in china in addition to the adjustment of influent cod n the increasing carbon sources from filler can significantly fuel the nitrogen removal through experimental study saeed and sun 2012 saeed and sun 2017 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2019 however the impacts of the quantification ioc on treatment were difficult to evaluate accurately the ioc released from filler including plant roots show the spatial distinction from the external organic carbon eoc from influent which may generate different treating performances to investigate the ioc and eoc effects on treatment performance assuming the constant temperature at 25 c otr levels are the same as that in section 3 1 and rol is ignored the hypothetical organic carbon loading rates olr which indicates the daily loading mass per cube meter of wetlands are simulated in two scenarios the first scenario i consisted of a set of simulations with the same initial condition nitrogen loading oxygen transfer rate temperature and no ioc loading during the cross validation scenario except the influent cod loading as eoc is set to different constant values in each simulation in the second scenario ii eoc is switched to zero and ioc is set to varied values while the rest settings are identical to scenario i each simulation reaches the steady state status for analysis the nitrogen in the system removal changes with the increasing external or internal organic loading rates olr is shown in fig 15 the red solid lines indicate the removal of nh4 and tn under eoc inflow conditions and the blue dash lines denote the ioc conditions when the olr of eoc is lower than 40 gcod m 3d 1 nh4 n removal achieves above 95 and when olr is greater than 40 gcod m 3d 1 removal drops sharply with the10 gcod m 3d 1 olr amplification decreasing 35 47 removal when olr is over 80 gcod m 3d 1 the removal becomes negative which means the effluent nh4 n is larger than the influent similarly low olrs of ioc lead to the high nh4 n removal the point of inflection is at 30 gcod m 3d 1 nevertheless the removal decline rates are significantly greater of eoc than those of ioc higher organic loading enhances the consumption of limited do and depresses xa additional the increasing carbon loading strengthens the competition between xh and xa while xh has greater advantages with the continuous growth of olr xa was severely restricted and the nitrification capacity is weakened and disappeared a great amount xh takes the advantage to reproduce and consequently the lysis of high mortality brings negative nh4 n removal under the higher olr status larger than 45 gcod m 3d 1 the ioc loading in ivf wetlands shows higher efficiency to remove nh4 n than eoc loading simulated tn removal appears a single peak pattern with the increasing olr in both scenarios the peak value of tn removal is about 93 with the eoc loading at 42 gcod m 3d 1 and the peak removal reaches 99 with the ioc loading at 30 gcod m 3d 1 under the same olr condition the tn removal of ioc is higher than that of eoc wherever the organic carbon is from lower eoc or ioc results in the decrease of xh due to carbon deficiency which deteriorates denitrification of nox n and increases effluent nox n concentrations under higher olr conditions tn removal is higher in scenario i than that in scenario ii low olr influent brings out the low tn removal in wetlands and the additive organic carbon in substrate improves the treat performance powerfully the filling material section and assembling in a wetland can be well designed by the numerical model for the best performance 4 conclusion as an indispensable factor in wetlands the plants play dynamic roles in seasons numerous experiments and biochemical analyses have been done to explore the plants functions which is also necessary to be involved in the numerical models plant effects are described as the co action of radial oxygen loss rol and internal organic carbon ioc exudates from roots and are implemented in the wetland model the model validation and calibration show the feasibility and reliability for the plants simulation the developed model can better present the wetland performance in real since almost all constraucted wetlands are ornamented by plants many studies dedicate the efforts to cod n ratio to improve the treatment performance although there is no universal value for all wetlands the nitrogen removal cod n ratio curves can be calculated by numerical model instead of massive experiments for a certain wetland once the curves are plotted the carbon loadings for high tn removal can be evaluated to guild the wetland operations moreover the planted wetlands work well under the wider range of cod n ratio influents than the unplanted wetlands the substrates reformation of wetlands is an alternative option to solve or alleviate the deficient carbon loading problem which is common in china generalizing all the organic carbon released by plant roots or substrates as ioc the quantified ioc impacts on the performance are investigated the ioc fuels higher tn removal than the eoc at the same loading due to their different spatial characteristics the spatial placements of some special substrates or plants can be the practicable method to improve the treatment the modelling studies of ioc impacts provid the theoretical support basis for the exquisite

16667,the integrated vertical flow ivf constructed wetland consists of two or more chambers with heterogeneous flow patterns and strong aeration capability possesses favorable remediation performance the constructed wetland model no 1 cwm1 embedded in the opengeosys iphreeqc was applied to investigate the wetland plant effects on treatment efficiency two fundamental functions of the plant roots i the radial oxygen loss rol and ii exudation of internal organic carbon ioc are developed and implemented in the model to simulate the treating processes of planted laboratory scale ivf wetlands fed by the synthetic wastewater the good agreement between simulated results and measurements of the planted ivf wetland and the unplanted filters mimicking wetland demonstrates the combined effects of rol and ioc and the model reliability in summer the ammonia nh4 n and total nitrogen tn removals are high as above 90 in both ivf wetlands and in winter they decline significantly to around 55 and 45 in unplanted wetland contrastively to about 85 and 78 in the planted wetland the nitrogen removal cod n ratio relation curves of ivf wetlands are proposed and obtained by modeling to evaluate organic carbon loading status based on the curves the cod n ratios of unplanted and planted wetlands are about 3 7 and 3 10 gcod gn for high tn removal respectively planted wetlands can tolerate a wider range of cod n ratio influents than unplanted ones the rol in the unplanted wetland promotes cod and nh4 n removal while may inhibit denitrification under low temperature conditions the single addition of ioc enhances the oxygen consuming and restrains the nitrification under the full loaded cod condition summing up all organic carbon releases from substrate and roots as ioc the quantification of ioc acts on nitrogen treatment was simulated and compared with the external organic carbon eoc loading from influent ioc performs higher efficiency on tn removal than eoc at the same organic loading rates

engineering systems designed and assembled with economical advantage in lower operational and maintenance costs to treat wastewater in more controllable conditions plants are regarded as an essential component of wetlands that the stem and leaf above the substrate play the role of landscaping ornament recreation wildlife habitat creation alleviating the influence of extreme weather as well as the nutrient removal capacity hua et al 2018 wang et al 2017 wetlands with plants were observed to have more stable treatment performance and higher removals especially for nitrogen rather than bod and cod comparing to unplanted wetlands carrasco acosta et al 2019 huett et al 2005 pelissari et al 2016 tanner 2001 teixeira et al 2018 zhu et al 2014 stefanakis et al 2012 the contribution of plants to treatment performance has been widely discussed the primary perception of the nutrient removal pathway was the nutrients uptake ammonium is the preferential biotic uptake source among inorganic nitrogen nayar et al 2010 comparing to the wastewater loadings the amount of nutrients removed by plant harvesting is generally insignificant bachand and horne 2000 brix 1997 kim and geary 2001 the proportions of nitrogen removal by plants uptake in wetlands are 4 11 and 2 8 given by lin et al 2002 and tanner 2001 respectively while proportions by denitrification are about 89 96 lin et al 2002 in some researches the amount of nutrients removed by plants can be high in the low loaded systems especially the horizontal subsurface flow wetlands greenway and woolley 2001 kyambadde et al 2004 in general the expected maximum nitrogen and phosphorus removal by plant uptake directly and harvesting was small lin et al 2002 usepa 2011 yang 2001 the rhizosphere zone of plant roots is considered to be one of the most dynamic interfaces on earth philippot et al 2013 plants roots can accelerate the development of microbial communities by promoting alternate aerobic and anaerobic microenvironments stottmeister et al 2003 internal aeration is crucial for root growth under anoxic conditions and the oxygen is transported via the aerenchyma to the root tips enabling root growth into anoxic soil haichar et al 2008 the oxygen release to the soil called radial oxygen loss rol was observed measured and quantified significant differences among species were tested rol in the rhizosphere has been related to the removal of tn among different plant species mei et al 2014 paranychianakis et al 2016 generally rol was positively correlated with photosynthetic rate transpiration rate root activity root biomass above ground biomass leaf biomass root porosity maximum root length lai et al 2012 the oxygen profiles patterns in the rhizosphere present oxygen saturation peaked around the middle part of roots and the thickness of stably oxidized zones increased as the roots grew wang et al 2014 the oxygen transport model between root and soil was studied and established cook and knight 2003 cook et al 2013 plant roots may release up to 20 of their photosynthesis products into the soil providing the basis for the establishment of plant microorganism interactions haichar et al 2008 the newly generated carbon derived from root exudates and carbon in soil organic matter are available for microbial growth caspersen et al 2004 wu et al 2012 the majority of root exudates including primary metabolites sugars amino acids and organic acids are regarded to be passively lost from the root and used by rhizosphere dwelling microbes canarini et al 2019 dundek et al 2011 the plants show high power on organic matter degradation through bacteria caused by root exudation moreover wetland plants deliver organic carbon via root exudates to fuel the microbial denitrification process in constructed wetland systems receiving nitrate rich and low carbon wastewater zhai et al 2013 show doc release rates from root amounted to 0 6 4 8 of the net photosynthetically fixed carbon extrapolating the laboratory measurements to field conditions suggests that plant root exudates may potentially fuel a denitrification rate of 94 267 kgn ha 1 year 1 in subsurface flow constructed wetlands root exudates are potentially important as an organic carbon source for denitrification in lightly loaded subsurface flow constructed wetland root exudates can act as endogenous carbon sources for heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and ultimately determine the microbe distribution patterns in micro polluted wetlands wu et al 2017 nutrient removal was positively correlated with microbe density in the rhizosphere which is affected by root exudates chen et al 2016 in recent years nitrogen content increases in urban sewage and the deficient carbon loading problems are common for wetlands operation in china the denitrifying bacteria require labile organic carbon as an energy source denitrification clement et al 2002 the organic loading rate olr influents the nitrifying and denitrifying bacterial community pelissari et al 2016 excessive and insufficient organic carbon leads to the reduction of nitrogen removal ding et al 2012 wu et al 2013 in the numerous practices of wetland construction and operation in china the treat performances were usually restricted by low cod n ratios xie et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 to promote total nitrogen removal numerous researches focused on the cod n ratios of influent wastewater akizuki et al 2015 ding et al 2012 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2017 the planted wetlands achieve efficient nitrogen removal under both high and low cod n conditions huett et al 2005 zhu et al 2014 it is difficult to set a guideline value on cod n ratio for high nitrogen removals which are related to wetland configurations operation mode plantation nitrogen composition and types of wastewater to be treated saeed and sun 2012 nevertheless for a certain wetland the cod n ratios can be the guidance to evaluate whether the wetland is overloaded or lightly loaded by cod the properties of substrates predominate not only the hydrodynamics but also the biological dynamics adsorption and fixation process consequently influence the treatment efficiency lima et al 2018 shi et al 2018 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2019 the concept of internal supplies of organic carbon from the filter material was brought out as an alternative solution by saeed and sun 2011a 2011b and tee et al 2012 the background concentration in substrates in terms of organic carbon is often assumed to be around 3 mg l 1 rousseau et al 2004 the impacts of some different unconventional substrates on the nitrogen and organics removal were summarized saeed and sun 2012 some fillers were selected for internal organic carbon ioc supplement which can promote denitrification and improved nitrogen treat performance saeed and sun 2017 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2019 it should be mentioned that the additional ioc may only benefit the micro pollutant water and deficient carbon system most researches brought forth the options of filler selection for better treatment it is difficult to assess the effects of quantitative ioc loading as well as spatial assembly of ioc on the removal by experiments constructed wetland models have been considered as an important tool to enhance understanding of the simultaneous physic chemical and biological processes and to optimize the design and operation of wetlands in general the process based models consist of the hydraulic module transport module biochemical module most biochemical modules were developed based on activated sludge models to simulate the biokinetic process in recent years the improved cwm1 has become popular for modeling boog et al 2019 john et al 2020 langergraber et al 2009 based on the framework of the wetlands model some mechanistic processes were implemented in the model to investigate combined effects caused by external and internal factors the clogging process boano et al 2018 rajabzadeh et al 2015 nivala et al 2012 giraldi et al 2010 aeration and temperature impacts boog et al 2019 john et al 2020 were widely modeled as for the plants effects nutrients uptake and oxygen release by plant roots were simulated by samsó and garcia 2013a in which all ammonium ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen were taken into account for uptake and plants did not cause noticeable differences giraldi et al 2010 regarded that the uptake could be ignored and the oxygen released by plant roots was calibrated by oxygen transfer parameters in simulation the carbon exudations from roots have not been considered and brought into the modeling the present study is based on observation results from two laboratory scale experimental ivf wetlands which were filled with zeolite one was planted with phragmites australis and the other was unplanted the plant effects as radial oxygen loss rol and internal organic carbon ioc exudates associated with the adsorption clogging effects are developed and implemented in the biological dynamics model of cwm1 which is coupled to a reactive transport model opengeosys iphreeqc the comparisons between the experimental measurements and modeling results are carried out to calibrate the parameters and verify the model reliability the nitrogen removal cod n ratio relation curves are put forward and the curves for unplanted and planted wetlands are calculated by the model to evaluate carbon loading levels instead of conventional experiments two important factors as rol and ioc are simulated in a whole year respectively to analyze the seasonal treatments alteration along with the bacteria activities and temperature changes for deficient carbon systems many experiments focused on the filler selections while the quantitative supplements of ioc and its impacts were difficult to assess following the concept of internal carbon source the model calculates the nitrogen removal variation with the growth of external organic carbon eoc and the internal organic carbon ioc respectively to further understand the spatial function of carbon sources 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental ivf wetlands taking the advantage of horizontal flow hf wetlands and vertical flow vf wetlands the integrated vertical flow ivf wetlands with relatively high treatment performance for common pollutants have become one of the main wetland types in china chang et al 2013 chen et al 2008 the laboratory scale experiments were carried out at hefei university of technology there were several ivf wetlands with identical geometrical size which was 1m long 0 5m wide and 0 65m height with a bottom slope of 0 5 each ivf wetland was divided into a down flow chamber dfc and an up flow chamber ufc by a vertical clapboard in the middle which left a 5cm narrow slit at the bottom to connect two chambers fig 1 the surface elevations of the down flow chamber were 10cm higher than those of the up flow chamber the water pipes were distributed on the surface of the down flow chamber and water was collected on the surface of the up flow chamber the experiments were designed to study the effects of wetland plants there were two parallel ivf wetlands filled with granular zeolite as one is a normal wetland with plants and the other is unplanted filters mimicking wetland systems the granular media consisted of 3 layers shown in fig 1 the 1st layer in the upper down flow chamber composed of fine gravels d 2 4 mm initial porosity n 40 has a thickness of 0 35m and the 2nd layer in the upper up flow chamber with fine gravels d 2 4 mm initial porosity n 45 has a thickness of 0 25m the 3rd layer at bottom of wetland with coarser gravels d 4 8 mm porosity n 45 is 0 3m thick the intermittent influent was supplied by a peristaltic pump with a time relay the duration of single feeding was 2 hours and the interval between single loadings is 1 hour the single wastewater loadings were 7 5l the phragmites australis were transplanted in ivf wetlands in march 2014 and grew well in the summer the wetland plants started to wither in oct and were harvested in dec the ivf wetlands in summer and winter are shown in fig 2 although the model can calculate the spatiotemporal variations of water components in the wetland many experiments usually provide the changes between influent and effluent and the internal alterations are mostly similar to the black box to investigate the water variation inside the ivf wetlands there were 3 internal sites along the flow stream for sampling which were shown in fig 1 the wetlands were operated with hydraulic loading rates hlr of approximately 0 24 m3 m2 d 1 and hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 7 days the mean annual precipitation and evaporation are 1036 7mm and 703mm in hefei city the water loss due to evaporation and reed transpiration is about 2 2 4 of influent and the extra water from rainfall is about 2 4 of influent the wetland system can be regarded as a water balance the synthetic wastewater supplies are fed to ivf wetlands and the influent concentrations of components as organic loading glucose nh4 n tn and do the monitoring was carried out after several months till its stable operation in june 2014 the concentrations of the influent internal sites and effluent were monitored once a month and usually 3 samples were taken for each time the values were shown in table 1 the total nitrogen in influent mainly consists of ammonia in the experiment and with cod n ratio is around 5 9 7 1 2 2 model description 2 2 1 model setup the established model framework ogs iphreeqc coupled with constructed wetland model no1 cwm1 has been applied for ivf wetlands modelling in this study opengeosys ogs is an open source finite element simulator for thermo hydro mechanical chemical processes which has been developed for several decades bilke et al 2019 kolditz et al 2012 ogs has been used in various environmental disciplines such as water resources management soil physics geothermal energy systems and deep geological deposition of hazardous waste in this work the capabilities of ogs for multicomponent transport processes in variably saturated porous media are presented kalbacher et al 2011 phreeqc is one of the most widely used open source geochemical solvers for aqueous mineral gas surface ion exchange solid solution equilibria and kinetic reactions it can also provide a well defined set of methods for data transfer and management charlton and parkhurst 2011 cwm1 is a general model to describe the biochemical transformation and degradation processes for organic matter nitrogen and sulphur in subsurface flow constructed wetlands which can be appended in the framework of phreeqc since both ogs and phreeqc are open source models they have been technically coupled on the code level as ogs iphreeqc i stands for interface he et al 2015 lu et al 2017 the ivf wetlands have two chambers that result in a spatial heterogeneous distribution of hydrodynamic and water quality components the computed domain is discretized by quadrangle meshes and divided into 3 sub domains filled with 3 different porous materials which is shown in fig 3 the influent and effluent boundary conditions of hydrodynamics and water quality are set up on the surface of the down flow chamber and the up flow chamber respectively the inflow rates and concentration of cod nh4 n and tn are identified for both ivf wetlands the influent water is well distributed on the down flow chamber surface with the hydraulic loading rate of 0 24 m3d 1 the time series of cod nh4 n and tn concentration is from the measurements since the cod of inflow is made by glucose in the experiment the influent cod is regarded as biodegradable dissolved cod sf in the model and the easily biodegradable particle cod xs is 0 the measured influent concentrations of components as organic loading glucose nh4 n tn and do associated with discharges were input as discharge boundary the outflow boundary is set as a pressure boundary with zero gradient concentration initially all water quality variables including bacterial components are set to a small value as 10 2 mg l 1 in the computed domain for starting in the planted wetland the two chambers are almost full filled by the roots of well grown phragmites australis which are set as root zones in modelling although the reeds were harvested in winter the functions of roots are still active the geometrical domain is relatively regular the heterogeneous quadrilateral meshes are applied for simulation the uniform coarse meshes with the size of 9 98cm 2 7778cm are utilized in the main body of down flow and up flow chambers and slightly fine meshes are in the upper layers of the down flow chamber and the bottom layers of wetlands the clapboard set as 2mm thick in the middle is not figured into the computed domain the smallest mesh is generated at the junction of two chambers with a size of 0 2cm 1 25cm there is a slight slope at the bottom so the bottom meshes are varied the computation domain meshes and boundary conditions in the model are indicated in fig 3 to investigate the spatial variations in ivf wetlands 1 polyline is defined for the model output also shown in fig 3 the polyline starts from the surface of the down flow chamber down to the bottom line1 then goes to the horizontal direction at the bottom to the up flow chamber line 2 finally it from the bottom to the surface of ufc line 3 2 2 2 hydraulic module the unsaturated and saturated zone both exist in the ivf wetlands the richards

models the dissolved oxygen organic carbon organic nitrogen ammonia and oxidized nitrogen hydrogen sulphide and sulfate as well as the growth and decay of heterotrophic fermenting autotrophic methanogenic and sulfate reducing and sulphide oxidizing bacteria cwm1 computes 17 processes and 16 components the computed component consists of 8 dissolved species and 8 particulate species dissolved species indicated by si i 1 2 are only present in the aqueous phase and particulate species indicated by xi i 1 2 are defined both in the aqueous mobile and solid immobile phases part of the cod and all bacteria species belong to the particulate species the particulate components participate in the attachment and detachment processes and transform between mobile and immobile statues the

oxygen is an important component to influences the treatment performance of ivf wetland the porosity of the unsaturated zone brings air into substrates and intermittent water supply generating saturation changes is used for aeration oxygen transfer rate otr from air to water is the function of properties temperature the concentration of saturated dissolved oxygen and local dissolved oxygen garcía et al 2010 pointed out that the oxygen transfer coefficient is an inverse proportion function of depth especially in vertical flow wetlands combining the depth impacts on otr we developed eq 5

langergraber and šimůnek 2012 mburu et al 2012 samsó and garcia 2013b photosynthesis of plants increases oxygen partial pressure in the blades and helps oxygen transport to the underground parts through aerenchyma and spreads oxygen to the rhizosphere in the form of rol in winter although the leaves wither in winter the reservation of ventilation tissue promotes the rol in this study rol is referred to the formula from cook et al cook and knight 2003 cook et al 2013 which is calculated by eq 6 6 r o l 2 π d l l 0 s r o o t α o s o l n r a e x p z z r where d l is the diffusion

the depth m z r is the scaling depth m r is the radius of a zone of saturated soil around the root plus the root m a is the parameters of the root radius m depth is the main factor that affects the magnitude of rol the rol is high in the surface layer and decreases exponentially against the depth 2 internal organic carbon ioc loading from root exudate the organic loading changes the microbial community and determines the growth of heterogeneous denitrifying bacteria zhai et al 2013 in an aerobic environment organic matter can be metabolized by a large number of heterotrophic bacteria through oxygen the internal organic loading from filling material and root exudates should not be ignored as for the gravels without specially treated the plants roots are the largest internal source of organic matter according to the experimental researches doc released by root is affected by photosynthesis temperature light regime nutrient availability and the plant species van veen et al 1991 carbon released from living plant roots to soil has been reported to account for 15 25 of below ground allocated carbon kuzyakov 2002 and 10 40 of the net primary production of the plants warembourg 2003 in daytime or high temperature roots exudes more organic matter than in the dark or low temperature in this study considering the temperature impacts on plant roots we introduce the internal organic carbon ioc loading by plants as 7 i o c k r o o t θ r c t 20 in which kroot is the organic carbon exudate from plant roots at 20 c mg l 1 h 1 θ r c is the temperature coefficient t is the water temperature the ioc from roots is assumed as the uniform distribution in the computed domain 3 ammonia absorption the zeolite is common for the substrates in wetland therefore was selected in this experiment the zeolite is an adsorbent with strong adsorption capacity because of the powerful cation exchange capacity collison and grismer 2014 the ammonium was adsorbed by substrate besides conversion into nitrates during the feeding period and the adsorbed mass of ammonium was nitrified during the rest period provoking high nitrates concentrations consequently morvannou et al 2014 the adsorption capacity of zeolite was calculated by langmuir isothermal adsorption equation described by equation 8 8 s s m a x k l c 1 k l c where s is the amount of adsorbate on the adsorbent g g 1 k l

smax kl refer to the experimental studies lu et al 2016 4 clogging and limitation of biomass the clogging process led by the particle materials attachment on the substrate is considered in the simulation following by boog et al 2019 samsó and garcia 2013b the particle cod composed of xs and xi which are both separated into the mobile and immobile parts obeys the 1st order attach detach process additionally the processes are taken into consideration referring boog et al 2019 and samsó and garcia 2013b 1 microbial reproduction over the medium impedes bacterial growth the parameter is

results and discussion 3 1 model calibration the modelled period is consistent with the experimental period from may 2014 to aug 2015 the influent concentrations of components as organic loading glucose nh4 n tn and do were measured these concentrations correspond to mean values measured in all samples and are 0 for sno sh2s and sso4 influent concentrations of bacteria groups are generally very small in comparison to the amount present within the granular media and were neglected the influent cod consisted of inert cod ci readily biodegradable cod cr and slowly biodegradable soluble cod cs since total cod was represented by glucose according to john et al 2020 the proportion of each fraction was defined to be 1 fermentable readily biodegradable soluble cod sf is 94 4 2 inert soluble cod si is 2 8 3 inert particulate cod xi is 2 8 4 slowly biodegradable particulate cod xs and fermentation products as acetate cod sa are 0 all components in the influent set at the boundary are aqueous mobile the initial concentrations of all simulated components and bacterial groups in wetland were set to zero to recreate the start up situation and to reduce the impact of imposed initial conditions on bacteria distribution the time series of water temperature in fig 4 were taken into simulations as the forcing term the material properties of 3 kinds of substrates fig 1 in each layer were described by van genuchten model and the saturated permeability was calculated by the empirical formula utilized the grain size and porosity ishaku 2011 the parameter or coefficient values are listed in table 2 parameter values of material properties in 3 substrate layers the dispersions of mass transport at the longitudinal and transverse direction are 0 4 m2s 1 and 0 01m2 s 1 respectively there is no tracer experimental data available for calibration the two main aspects of plant effects in modelling are considered as rol and ioc which are switched off in no plant np modelling and switched on in with plants wp case the cwm1 model possesses the amount of parameters and most parameter values in the paper are from published references langergraber et al 2009 toscano et al 2009 samsó and garcia 2013b some are calibrated by experimental data besides the inherent ones the parameter values of rol and internal organic carbon ioc loading from plant roots are from references and calibration the aeration by intermittent influent is calibrated by the data of the unplanted ivf wetland experiment the important parameters are listed in table 3 in the experiment the effluent and the water inside the wetland were sampled and measured the comparisons of measured effluent concentrations of cod nh4 n and tn with simulated concentrations without and with the plant abbreviation for np and wp from may 2014 to aug 2015 are shown in fig 5 the measured variables are denoted by the symbols and the computed results are indicated by lines the inflow cod nh4 n and tn are reduced by both laboratory scale ivf wetlands and the planted wetland has better treatment performance than unplanted one in the whole year that is indicated by the measurements and the simulated results the cod removals are considerably high 85 in both planted and unplanted wetlands during the operating period the nitrogen removals are highest in summer and lowest in winter the lowest removal appears in feb 2015 the contrasts of nh4 n and tn removal between ivf wetlands planted and unplanted are remarkable in winter in which planted wetland has 75 85 removal rates and unplanted wetland has 40 50 rate it is consistent with many practical applications and experiments that the nitrogen removal variation along with the seasons in treating nitrate laden wastewater of wetlands boog et al 2019 the season s efficiency of nitrogen removal from high to low is in the turn of summer autumn spring and winter chang et al 2013 the treat performance of nitrogen decreases in the second year shown by both measurements and simulations which may be due to the small size of ivf wetland and the fast development of the clogging process in terms of the effluent concentrations in the summer of 2014 there is no significant difference between the planted and unplanted wetland the interior water was sampled and measured in aug 2014 for inside investigation in fig 1 the simulated cod nh4 n tn and do along the polyline in fig 3 are plotted and compared with the measured data in fig 6 the polyline passes through the down flow chamber dfc the bottom bot and the up flow chamber ufc which are denoted in fig 6 high levels 96 and 97 of cod were successfully removed from synthetic wastewater by planted and unplanted laboratory scale ivf wetlands respectively although subtle differences between the effluent of np and wp wetlands appear in fig 6 in august 2014 the interior differences of nitrogen are remarkable the cod nh4 n and tn decrease gradually along the flow stream in both ivf wetlands the cod profile in the planted wetland is similar to that in the unplanted one the concentrations of nh4 n and tn in the down flow chamber and bottom in np wetland are higher than those in wp wetland in the planted wetland the nh4 n and tn are removed about 80 in the down flow chamber and the reduction of the rest nitrogen become slowly on the contrary the nitrogen removals in the down flow chamber in np wetland are about 50 and the removal rates persist in the bottom and up flow chamber nh4 n and tn in the down flow chamber decrease more rapidly in wp wetland than in np wetland the laboratory scale ivf wetlands fed by intermittent wastewater exhibit the high efficiency of cod and nitrogen removal there is sufficient do for the degradation of cod and nh4 n in both ivf wetlands additionally the effluent do indicates the differences between np and wp wetlands in fig 6 the down flow chamber in wetland is the area for do consumption resulting in similar do profiles from the surface to bottom in both wetlands do rises in ufc from the bottom to the surface and do in wp is higher than that in np at the outlet in general the simulated time serial of effluent and profiles of cod nh4 n and tn in summer in both ivf wetlands are in agreement with the measured data which proves the reliability for plant setting in the model 3 2 hydrodynamics and water quality in ivf wetlands the modelling results provide the spatiotemporal data of variables to investigate their relationships there is no distinct hydrodynamic difference in the planted and unplanted wetlands due to the model settings and the simulated distributions of saturation and flow speeds in ivf wetlands are shown in fig 7 a and b the substrates at the surface layer in the down flow chamber are unsaturated the rest area is saturated in fig 7 a the domestic flow directions in the two chambers are opposite the highest magnitude of flow speeds occurs at the joint area at bottom of two chambers the lowest flow speeds appear at ancipital bottom corners where may form the dead zone in ivf wetlands under the steady hydrodynamic conditions the bio chemical processes form the spatial distinct patterns of do cod nh4 n and tn in planted and unplanted wetlands the distributions of do cod nh4 n and tn on aug 15th 2014 in the unplanted wetland are selected and shown in fig 8 the intermittent influent generate the partially unsaturated zone in the top layer of wetlands that possess high oxygen transfer capacity and boosts the nitrification reaction the concentration of cod nh4 n and tn decrease following the flow streams from the down flow chamber to the up flow chamber in which cod drops faster than nh4 n and tn the aerobic and anoxic conditions alternately exist in ivf wetlands in practice applications both hf wetlands and ivf wetlands have been widely employed to treat polluted surface water or domestic wastewater chang et al 2013 according to the structural differences ivf wetlands provide the meandering flow and aerobic anoxic aerobic alternately conditions for nitrification and denitrification while hf wetlands offer the smooth horizontal flow and predominant anoxic condition for denitrification the nitrogen component of the influent is one of the primary factors to be considered for the wetland design 3 3 nitrogen removal cod n ratio curves in unplanted and planted wetlands the proper quantities of organic carbon feeding into the wetlands can overcome the limitations of deficient carbon loading to support denitrification and upgrade the nitrogen removal performance chang et al 2013 ingersoll and baker 1998 the cod n ratio at 2 5 showed the highest tn removal in zhao et al 2010 while in the other researches the proper cod n ratios in a range of 2 5 20 in fan et al 2013 and 6 in ding et al 2012 the influent cod n ratio is related to do supply which may affect the balance between nitrification and denitrification in wetlands and cod n ratios in a range of 2 20 wang et al 2020 and cod n ratios at 10 in wu et al 2016 the cod n ratios to promote nitrogen removal alter with a plantation temperature wetland configurations aeration nitrogen composition therefore it is not a universal value saeed and sun 2012 nitrogen removal shows differently in unplanted and planted wetlands in section 3 2 1 to explore the appropriate influent cod n for nitrogen removal a series of cod n ratios for unplanted and planted wetlands respectively are simulated the constant temperature at 25 c and the same parameters setting in section 3 1 are employed in the models the first scenario presents the unplanted wetland and the second scenario presents the planted wetland both simulations run two months period for analysis the removal of nh4 n and tn along cod n ratios of unplanted and planted wetlands are plotted in fig 9 in the intermittent feeding wastewater nh4 n is the predominant component in the nitrogen composition the 80 removal is set as the high treating performance the high nh4 n removal is at cod n 7 2 in np wetland and cod n 10 5 in wp wetland which are the threshold values for nh4 n removal if cod n is larger than the threshold values the removal drops fast when cod n ranges in 4 7 in np wetland and 3 10 in planted wetland tn is treated efficiently and the ratio range of planted wetland is wider than that of unplanted wetland the lower cod n ratios indicate deficient carbon for bacteria growth and restrict denitrification while higher cod n ratios cause high do consumption consequently inhibits the nitrification and both situations result low tn removal the cod n ratio of influent in the experiment is about 6 0 7 1 which approaches the upper limit of the high nitrogen removal of unplanted wetland the organic loading is sufficient for the nitrification in np wetland however it is in the appropriate range of wp wetland the planted wetland can tolerate the large changes of carbon loading and maintain the high treat performance which has been observed by experiments huett et al 2005 zhu et al 2014 3 4 effects of plants and temperature on treatment performance the combined aspects of plants root as rol and ioc are set for wp computations do is a crucial factor for treatment and rol function was already mentioned and simulated by langergraber and šimůnek 2012 saeed and sun 2013 samsó and garcia 2013a the increasing do from rol enhances the removal of cod and nh4 n in the wetland system while in low temperature conditions increasing do may weaken the tn removal boog et al 2019 to investigate the contributions of rol and ioc separately in treatment based on the np model rol only and ioc only are added and employed in modelling the comparisons are consist of 4 cases abbreviated as np rol ioc and wp the boundary conditions and the parameters set in the model are identical to those in section 3 1 the time series of effluent results of 4 cases are exhibited in fig 10 the removal varied in the year corresponds to seasons the activity of bacteria is weakened at low temperature therefore do consumption decreased especially by nitrifying bacteria the sufficient do levels inhibited the activity of denitrifying bacteria xh and decreased nox n removal compared to the np case the rol function promotes the removal of cod nh4 n significantly especially in winter which is similar to the wp case as for the tn removal the promotion by rol is unremarkable against wp sometimes in summer tn removal by rol is slightly higher than np based on the comparative high removal rol vitalizes the heterotrophic bacteria xh and autotrophic nitrifying bacteria xa to reduces the cod and nitrify nh4 n nevertheless it might inhibit the denitrification process and decrease the nox n removal the computed cod and nh4 n concentration of effluent in rol cases are approximate to the wp case while the tn values in winter and next year are high than that in wp the function of ioc drags down the removals ioc in the substrates consumes oxygen and depresses the elimination of cod nh4 n and tn the compound function of rol and ioc achieves the best performance the order of removal efficiency from low to high is ioc np rol and wp two typical moments for summer and winter are selected to study the temperature impacts in fig 10 the concentration of cod nh4 n tn and do along the polyline inside the ivf wetlands on august 15th 2014 for 4 simulation cases are exhibited in fig 11 all ivf wetlands operate well in summer with a low contaminate concentration in the effluent the profiles of cod nh4 n tn and do in np and ioc cases are approximate although the concentrate values are a little higher in ioc than those in np ioc lowers do demand nitrification and cod removal along the flow way since ioc is evenly distributed in wetlands in the rol and wp cases most cod nh4 n and tn from influent are eliminated powerfully in the dfc with the dropping do consequently do escalates due to the less residual pollutants to be treated in the ufc taking the np case as a reference do changes δdo in rol ioc and wp cases in the whole domain are displayed in fig 12 under the function of rol do increases slightly in the top thin layer of the down flow chamber and rises obviously in the half upper layer of the up flow chamber indicated in fig 9 a without the rol supply otr provides do for biochemical reaction and transport through the flow in fig 6 ioc in substrates causes the competition of do consumption and aggravates the do deficiency at the bottom in ivf wetland in fig 9 b the combination function of rol and ioc do ascends in some area in the upper layers in winter the treat performance declines with the descent temperature the concentration of cod nh4 n tn and do along the polyline inside the ivf wetland on jan 15th 2015 for 4 simulation cases are exhibited in fig 13 comparing the performance in summer cod removal declines slightly while nh4 n and tn removal descend appreciably in winter going to the profiles the ioc and np cases have similar patterns and wp and rol cases show the resemblance in ioc and np cases about 61 83 cod is ridden in dfc and eventually the removal is about 85 92 the nh4 n and tn increase about by 7 instead of decrease in dfc then drop slowly at the bottom and ufc decrease by 40 60 at the outlet the nh4 n removal in wp and rol keep high as 90 and tn removal in rol is 64 which is lower than 81 in wp the inhibition of nitrification is initiated with increasing carbon loads wu et al 2013 to improve the understanding of the treat performance changes in seasons the distribution of heterotrophic bacteria xh autotrophic nitrifying bacteria xa and fermenting bacteria xfb along the polyline inside the ivf wetlands in summer and winter are plotted in fig 14 large amounts of xh accumulate at the surface of the down flow chamber in fig 14 there is competition between xh and xa in the substrate biofilm in winter the growth rate of xh does not drop at low temperatures while the growth of xa was significantly inhibited gao et al 2015 the competition between xh and xa become intensified in low temperature condition the high density of xh leads to high mortality and lysis which generates a quantity of cod and nh4 n langergraber and šimůnek 2005 2012 which in turn causes the slowing down removal of cod and increasing nh4 n in dfc in winter xa reduces in the down flow chamber in contrast to high xa in summer additionally the attachment of particulate material also weakens the growth xa in the down flow chamber the spaces for xa growth are squeezed into the up flow chamber in ioc cases the oxygen is taken up not only by the inflow cod but also by the ioc forming the anoxia condition in the down flow chamber do deficiency in the down flow chamber also transform the high xfb in the unplanted wetland part of cod is removed by xfb through fermentation in anoxia condition in down flow chamber which results higher xfb concentration and slightly lower xh at some area in ioc comparing with unplanted wetland going back to fig 9 the increasing carbon loading enhances the consumption of limited do and depresses xa additional it strengthens the competition between xh and xa while xh has greater advantages with a higher growth rate against that of xa with the continuous growth of cod n xa was severely restricted and the nitrification capacity almost is weakened and disappeared a great amount of xh take the advantage to reproduce and consequently the lysis of high mortality brings nh4 n which is shown as the negative removal in terms of the main bacteria components in this model produced by hydrolysis and high oxygen transfer capacity a large amount of xh grows at the surface layer of the down flow chamber due to its high olr in the unsaturated zone below the 10cm depth of the down flow chamber xa begins to grow and consume the oxygen which accords with the decreasing oxygen in the down flow chamber the concentration of total bacterial is highest at the surface layer of the down flow chamber due to the high pollution loads and the mass of bacteria in the down flow chamber takes the majority share of the system the additional internal organic carbon ioc in the unplanted wetland without rol decreases the nh4 n and tn removal while the integration function of ioc and rol in planted wetland upgrades the performance which is coherent to the results in section 3 2 2 3 5 influence of internal organic carbon on treatment performance the deficient carbon loading causes the low nitrogen removal is the common problem of wetland operation in china in addition to the adjustment of influent cod n the increasing carbon sources from filler can significantly fuel the nitrogen removal through experimental study saeed and sun 2012 saeed and sun 2017 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2019 however the impacts of the quantification ioc on treatment were difficult to evaluate accurately the ioc released from filler including plant roots show the spatial distinction from the external organic carbon eoc from influent which may generate different treating performances to investigate the ioc and eoc effects on treatment performance assuming the constant temperature at 25 c otr levels are the same as that in section 3 1 and rol is ignored the hypothetical organic carbon loading rates olr which indicates the daily loading mass per cube meter of wetlands are simulated in two scenarios the first scenario i consisted of a set of simulations with the same initial condition nitrogen loading oxygen transfer rate temperature and no ioc loading during the cross validation scenario except the influent cod loading as eoc is set to different constant values in each simulation in the second scenario ii eoc is switched to zero and ioc is set to varied values while the rest settings are identical to scenario i each simulation reaches the steady state status for analysis the nitrogen in the system removal changes with the increasing external or internal organic loading rates olr is shown in fig 15 the red solid lines indicate the removal of nh4 and tn under eoc inflow conditions and the blue dash lines denote the ioc conditions when the olr of eoc is lower than 40 gcod m 3d 1 nh4 n removal achieves above 95 and when olr is greater than 40 gcod m 3d 1 removal drops sharply with the10 gcod m 3d 1 olr amplification decreasing 35 47 removal when olr is over 80 gcod m 3d 1 the removal becomes negative which means the effluent nh4 n is larger than the influent similarly low olrs of ioc lead to the high nh4 n removal the point of inflection is at 30 gcod m 3d 1 nevertheless the removal decline rates are significantly greater of eoc than those of ioc higher organic loading enhances the consumption of limited do and depresses xa additional the increasing carbon loading strengthens the competition between xh and xa while xh has greater advantages with the continuous growth of olr xa was severely restricted and the nitrification capacity is weakened and disappeared a great amount xh takes the advantage to reproduce and consequently the lysis of high mortality brings negative nh4 n removal under the higher olr status larger than 45 gcod m 3d 1 the ioc loading in ivf wetlands shows higher efficiency to remove nh4 n than eoc loading simulated tn removal appears a single peak pattern with the increasing olr in both scenarios the peak value of tn removal is about 93 with the eoc loading at 42 gcod m 3d 1 and the peak removal reaches 99 with the ioc loading at 30 gcod m 3d 1 under the same olr condition the tn removal of ioc is higher than that of eoc wherever the organic carbon is from lower eoc or ioc results in the decrease of xh due to carbon deficiency which deteriorates denitrification of nox n and increases effluent nox n concentrations under higher olr conditions tn removal is higher in scenario i than that in scenario ii low olr influent brings out the low tn removal in wetlands and the additive organic carbon in substrate improves the treat performance powerfully the filling material section and assembling in a wetland can be well designed by the numerical model for the best performance 4 conclusion as an indispensable factor in wetlands the plants play dynamic roles in seasons numerous experiments and biochemical analyses have been done to explore the plants functions which is also necessary to be involved in the numerical models plant effects are described as the co action of radial oxygen loss rol and internal organic carbon ioc exudates from roots and are implemented in the wetland model the model validation and calibration show the feasibility and reliability for the plants simulation the developed model can better present the wetland performance in real since almost all constraucted wetlands are ornamented by plants many studies dedicate the efforts to cod n ratio to improve the treatment performance although there is no universal value for all wetlands the nitrogen removal cod n ratio curves can be calculated by numerical model instead of massive experiments for a certain wetland once the curves are plotted the carbon loadings for high tn removal can be evaluated to guild the wetland operations moreover the planted wetlands work well under the wider range of cod n ratio influents than the unplanted wetlands the substrates reformation of wetlands is an alternative option to solve or alleviate the deficient carbon loading problem which is common in china generalizing all the organic carbon released by plant roots or substrates as ioc the quantified ioc impacts on the performance are investigated the ioc fuels higher tn removal than the eoc at the same loading due to their different spatial characteristics the spatial placements of some special substrates or plants can be the practicable method to improve the treatment the modelling studies of ioc impacts provid the theoretical support basis for the exquisite

16668,determining the bioavailability and toxicity mechanism of silver nanoparticles agnps is challenging as ag is continuously released by external or internal agnp dissolution in the actual exposure system regardless of the laboratory or the natural environment here a novel pulsed gradient ag agno3 exposure was conducted with zebrafish danio rerio larvae to simulate dissolved gradient concentrations of ag from polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp coated agnps the accumulation and toxicity of the pulsed gradient ag agno3 and in the meantime the released ag from pvp agnps were predicted using a toxicokinetic toxicodynamic tk td model with obtained ag parameters in order to further understand the possible mechanism of pvp agnp releasing ag in the body subcellular fractions s9 of zebrafish were also used to incubate with agnps in vitro to mimic the realistic in vivo scenarios in the tk process in vivo analysis showed that agnps released around twice as many ag into the body than were detected with a single ag pulse exposure system this was supported by evidence that subcellular s9 fractions might cause the pvp agnps to lose the capping agent and favor ag release in the td process toxicity survival rate was predicted by the total bodily ag i concentration suggesting that agnp toxicity in larvae was mainly due to gradually released ag rather than agnps themselves this study helps clarify the role of ag in agnp toxicity and offers a novel framework by which to investigate the toxicity of metal nanoparticles and corresponding metal ions in biological systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords silver nanoparticle silver ion toxicokinetic toxicodynamic zebrafish danio rerio polyvinylpyrrolidone 1 introduction nanomaterials are applied in many industrial and technological sectors encompassing information technology food safety energy cosmetics pharmaceuticals and agriculture alvino et al 2020 leonel et al 2021 quik et al 2015 scalisi et al 2020 silver nanoparticles agnp are universally used in nanomaterials and particularly in consumer products such as detergents plastics textiles and atopic dermatitis creams as well as in antimicrobials for water treatments because of their strong antibacterial properties de leersnyder et al 2019 lu et al 2020 silveira valente et al 2020 consequently around 360 450 tons of agnps are produced globally per year lazareva and keller 2014 the mass production of agnps has led to pollution of aquatic environments lazareva and keller 2014 with agnp levels of 24 0 770 μg l 1 having been detected in surface water aznar et al 2017 xiao et al 2019 the toxicity of agnp has been studied in a number of aquatic organisms including fish plants invertebrates microalgae and bacteria fabrega et al 2011 tortella et al 2020 evidence suggests that agnps could lead to lipid peroxidation huang et al 2018 biomass reduction photosynthetic efficiency reduction rajala et al 2018 phytoplankton assemblage chen et al 2018 sugar and protein metabolism ribosome function histones and disruption of energy production novo et al 2015 however whether these toxicities were caused by the agnps themselves the ag released from the agnps or both is currently debatable choi et al 2008 zhang and wang 2019 some studies have suggested that the toxicity originates from the original agnps themselves rather than the dissolved ag or biosynthesized agnps choi et al 2008 huang et al 2018 contrastingly other reports have shown that agnp toxicity is mainly induced by dissolved ag rather than agnp rajala et al 2018 zhang and wang 2019 other studies however have attributed agnp toxicity to dissolved ag in addition to direct particle specific effects i e one or the other is not solely responsible ahlberg et al 2014 miao et al 2010 silver nitrate agno3 exposure is often used as a ionizing control in studies aiming to reveal the toxicity contributions of ag agnps and combined ag agnp boehme et al 2017 hu et al 2020 novo et al 2015 rosario et al 2020 which is largely attributed to the ag release via oxidation and dissolution of the surface ag atoms stabryla et al 2018 such studies often employ constant concentrations of agnps along with agno3 exposure systems in which ag concentrations remain constant boehme et al 2017 hu et al 2020 novo et al 2015 rosario et al 2020 ignoring the fact that ag is gradually released from agnps in solution i e ag concentrations in actual exposure systems gradually increase due to the dissolution of agnp hu et al 2020 this process will affect the subsequent accumulation and toxicity of ag in organisms in which the toxicity of released ag may wrongly be determined as the toxicity of agnps themselves obviously we realized the differences in constant ag concentration versus gradual ag release and there is need to conduct the control of pulse dose ag to mimic ion release occurring in agnp systems thus to clarify the toxicity mechanism of agnps the following three processes must be quantified 1 the dissolution of agnps in the exposure solution 2 the toxicokinetic tk process of agnp and ag and 3 the toxicodynamic td process of both in the organism bachler et al 2013 shao and wang 2020 topuz and van gestel 2015 tk td model as a robust mechanistic approach can integrate time course toxic effects on many endpoints teng et al 2016 wang and tan 2019 tk deals with the time course absorption distribution metabolism and elimination of toxicants by linking external exposure concentrations to biologically effective concentrations whereas td describes the time processes by which toxic actions lead to subsequent damage hazard in organisms we suggest that tk td modeling could be used to quantify the biodistribution of agnps and corresponding released ag and it could determine whether toxicity is mediated by the accumulation of particles or originates from the released ag however to the best of our knowledge the toxicity of agnps has yet to be accurately quantified by tk td modeling bachler et al 2013 shao and wang 2020 in the present study we aimed to explore the mechanism of agnp toxicity in zebrafish danio rerio larvae exposed to polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp coated agnps and agno3 respectively using a combination of in vivo in vitro and in silico methods illustrated in fig 1 first we determined the dissolution process of agnps in the exposure solution and quantified the concentration gradient of ag gradually released from agnps via a first order dissolution model second we used pulsed rather than constant agno3 exposures to simulate and quantify the concentration gradient of released ag entering the larvae via a tk model to isolate the accumulation contribution of the ion finally from agnps in solution or in larvae we distinguished the contribution of released ag to agnp toxicity via a td model to isolate the toxicity contribution of the ion in addition to clarifying the role of ag in three above processes of agnp toxicity this study offers a new framework to investigate the toxicities of other metal nanoparticles and their released metal ions in biological systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of agnps pvp molecular weight 58 000 coated agnps were used in our experiment see supporting information for agnp suspension synthesis and preparation as pvp is a coating commonly used to stabilize dispersed nanoparticles all characterization analyses were conducted with the obtained aqueous dispersions of agnps particle size distribution was measured by dynamic light scattering dls using a zetasizer nano zs malvern uk and transmission electron microscopy tem using a talos l120c g2 transition electron microscope fei czech republic the dls size measurement was performed in triplicate using backscatter 173 detection on 3 5 ml samples in 4 5 ml plastic cuvette four sided transparent polystyrene optical path 10 mm containing 107 mg l 1 pvp agnps after 15 min of sonication 550 sonic dismembrator fisher scientific using tem the sizes of at least 200 particles were measured for each of three pvp agnps with the microscope operated at 200 kv see supporting information 1 3 absorption spectra were measured using a shimadzu uv vis spectrophotometer model no uv1601u whereas the produced nanoparticles were characterized using a s2000 uv vis spectrometer ocean optics inc 2 2 organisms as a representative model zebrafish danio rerio has many advantages e g rapid development optical transparency in early life stages and low cost usage and has been widely used to explore toxic action mechanisms of many chemicals to represent a risk to the fish inhabiting the freshwater environments parng 2005 zebrafish have been cultured in our laboratory for 6 years for the maintenance and toxicity testing of these fish we followed oecd guidelines oecd 203 and 210 zebrafish were cultured in 20 l aquariums filled with filtered tap water filtered through a gf c membrane with a 1 2 μm pore size millipore watford uk table s1 provides the parameters of the water e g total organic carbon toc ph and the concentrations of inorganic ions k na ca2 mg2 cl no3 and so4 2 the zebrafish were fed with newly hatched brine shrimp artemia salina twice a day and maintained with a 12 12 h light dark photoperiod at a constant temperature of 26 0 5 c three day old 72 h post fertilization hpf larvae were used in the experiments because of their transparent bodies which provide good visibility to various internal organs the larvae were not fed during the 96 h experiment to eliminate the influence of food on ag accumulation in the body 2 3 constant and pulsed agno3 toxicity tests for toxicity testing we aimed to reveal toxicity differences in constant versus gradient concentrations of ag exposure the ag exposure concentrations 5 30 μg l 1 were in relevance of 10 90 lethal concentration lc from 24 to 120 hpf reported in zebrafish boyle and goss 2018 robinson et al 2020 in detail larvae were collected from their culture stock placed in a 6 well plate containing 10 ml of low ionic strength water the exact composition is provided in table s2 and allowed to acclimate for 60 min for constant agno3 exposure larvae were exposed to 10 0 μg l 1 of ag in agno3 over a period from 0 to 96 h the ag exposure solutions were completely renewed with fresh 10 0 μg l 1 of ag every 24 h at 24 h some exposed larvae were transferred into fresh low ionic water for the remaining period up to 96 h the living larvae were collected and mortality was observed during 72 h depuration experiments the solutions were completely renewed with fresh low ionic water every 24 h and there was no ag and or ag complexes in low ionic water to contribute to the internal ag data as indicated by that ag concentration in solutions were below limit of detection lod 0 114 μg l ag for ag by icp ms for pulsed agno3 exposure the larvae were exposed to a 5 00 μg l 1 ag pulse in agno3 during 0 6 h a 10 0 μg l 1 ag pulse in agno3 during 6 24 h a 15 0 μg l 1 ag pulse in agno3 during 24 48 h a 20 0 μg l 1 ag pulse in agno3 during 48 72 h and finally a 30 0 μg l 1 ag pulse in agno3 during 72 96 h during the experiment which comprised three replicates 30 larvae pre replicate survival was recorded and living larvae were collected at 0 6 24 48 72 and 96 h 2 4 pvp agnp accumulation and toxicity tests 2 4 1 real time monitoring of dissolution kinetics of pvp agnps the protocol for monitoring the release kinetics of ag from pvp agnps was similar to a previously reported method zhang and wang 2019 briefly the stock pvp agnp suspension 102 mg l 1 ag atom concentrations detected by icp ms was respectively diluted 1000 times and 400 times with low ionic strength water table s2 to produce solutions with 92 0 and 255 μg l 1 ag atom concentrations detected by icp ms in terms of environmental relevance similar levels of nanoparticulate ag have been reported in taihu lake china xiao et al 2019 river meuse river ijssel the netherlands and river isar germany peters et al 2018 agnp exposure concentration is regarded as a major factor affecting bioaccumulation and biotransformation wang et al 2014 at various time points 0 6 24 48 72 and 96 h the dissolution kinetics of the pvp agnps were measured by single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry sp icp ms and conventional centrifugal ultrafiltration followed by icp ms detection for quality comparison see section 1 9 and tables s3 s5 in supporting information 2 4 2 real time monitoring of tk and td process of pvp agnps for real time monitoring of pvp agnp tk and td processes zebrafish larvae were collected from the glass petri dish φ120 mm placed in a 6 well plate 30 individuals per well containing 10 ml of low ionic strength water and allowed to acclimate for 60 min afterwards larvae were exposed to two concentrations of pvp agnp suspensions with ag at 92 0 and 255 μg l 1 respectively for 96 h 2 4 3 pulsed agno3 toxicity tests to mimic the dissolution kinetics of pvp agnp suspensions larvae were collected from the glass petri dish φ120 mm placed in a 6 well plate containing 10 ml of low ionic strength water and allowed to acclimate for 60 min after which they were exposed to pulsed agno3 for 96 h in these experiments pulsed ag concentrations were selected according to the real time monitoring of dissolution kinetics from pvp agnp suspensions total ag atom concentrations of 92 0 and 255 μg l 1 the ag exposure solutions were renewed at various time points i e 0 6 24 48 72 and 96 h during the experiment which comprised three replicates 30 larvae pre replicate survival was recorded and living larvae were collected at 0 6 24 48 72 and 96 h following collection 5 ml of etching solution 10 mm na2s2o3 5h2o in phosphate buffered saline pbs was added to each well of the plates containing the larvae which were incubated for 30 s to remove surface attached ag from the larvae zhang and wang 2019 the larvae were then washed three times with 3 ml of pbs per wash and sacrificed in ice bath finally the collected larvae were digested and the accumulation kinetics of ag and pvp agnps were measured by icp ms 2 4 4 depuration of pvp agnps from larvae to test for depuration of pvp agnps larvae were exposed to 92 0 and 255 μg l 1 respectively of ag in pvp agnp suspensions for 96 h however at 24 h some exposed larvae were transferred to fresh low ionic strength water for the remaining period up to 96 h during the experiment which comprised three replicates 30 larvae pre replicate survival was recorded and living larvae were collected at 0 6 24 48 72 and 96 h herein there were no enough living larvae collected at 48 72 and 96 h for 255 μg l 1 of ag in pvp agnp suspensions to reach limit of detection lod 0 122 μg l ag for ag content by sp icp ms and thus we cannot obtain internal ag data 2 4 5 liver s9 fraction and pvp agnps in vitro in vitro biotransformation assays were widely used in pharmacology and human toxicology to screen drugs for metabolism gomez lechon et al 2016 typically subcellular fractions or isolated hepatocytes such as post mitochondrial supernatants s9 fractions are ubiquitous in the liver which is the main organ for drug biotransformation in vertebrates kropf et al 2020 laue et al 2020 in addition it is verified that it have thiol groups sh musavi and kakkar 2003 which was inclined to strongly bind with ag wetzel et al 2021 to test the possible reaction between pvp agnp and s9 fraction 30 larvae were placed in a 10 ml centrifuge tube and rinsed with a prechilled 0 15 m kcl solution three times to remove hemoglobin which can inhibit microsomal enzyme activity subsequently 6 ml of tris hcl buffer solution was added to the tube and the larvae were homogenized with an electric homogenizer rod 20 000 rev min 1 for 2 min after which the mixture was centrifuged at high speed 9000 g for 10 min afterwards 5 ml of the supernatant s9 fraction was placed in a 15 ml centrifuge tube to which 5 ml of pvp agnp suspensionwas added to achieve final 92 0 μg l 1 of ag this mixture was incubated in a biochemical incubator lbi 80 longyue shanghai for 96 h at 37 c with 12 h light and 12 h dark per day after 24 h at which time the ag had obviously released from the agnps 10 μl of the mixture was extracted with a pipette and dropped onto copper mesh after air drying the drop was observed with tem coupled with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx to confirm the elemental composition around agnp moreover 4 ml of mixture s9 and pvp agnp solutions were collected at 24 48 72 and 96 h for ag concentration determination 2 5 determination of total ag agnp and ag ⅰ concentrations the concentrations of total ag agnp and soluble ag in solutions and the concentrations of agnps and ag ⅰ including the complexed ag i and free ag obtained by subtracting the agnp content from the total ag content in the sample boyle and goss 2018 dong et al 2020 in larvae were determined using both icp ms and sp icp ms see sections 1 7 and 1 8 in supporting information including information on quality assurance and quality control during icp ms and sp icp ms analysis tables s3 s5 in detail soluble ag species in exposure solutions included ag agno3 aq agoh aq agso4 and so on herein ag ⅰ in larvae included the complexed ag i and free ag hsiao et al 2015 yan et al 2019 in addition ag ⅰ concentration of mixture s9 and pvp agnp was were determined using icp ms as described in section 1 8 in supporting information the accumulation of agnps in larvae after agnp exposure was examined with tem the treatment procedure is shown in the supporting information examples of agnp suspension in exposure solution and in larvae detected by sp icp ms are shown in fig s1a and b 2 6 models 2 6 1 agnp dissolution model several previous reports have used the classical noyes whitney rate equation eq 1 to describe the dissolution of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles majedi et al 2014 peretyazhko et al 2014 skrdla et al 2019 a first order rate equation has in many circumstances been proven to be effective to model the kinetics of the agnp dissolution process quik et al 2011 scown et al 2010 1 d a g i o n t d t k 1 a g i o n e q a g i o n t where agion t is the amount of released metal ion after a given time amount volume 1 k1 is the first order dissolution rate constant and agion eq is the total percentage of released ag extrapolated as t moves towards infinity a first order rate equation also describes the kinetics of the agnp precipitation process as follows manteghian and ghader 2009 2 d a g total t d t k 2 a g t o t a l e q a g t o t a l t where agtotal t is the total amount of ag after a given time amount volume 1 k2 is the first order precipitation rate constant and agtotal eq is the total amount of ag that was extrapolated as t moves toward infinity eq 3 then agnp t is the amount of agnp after a given time amount volume 1 3 a g n p t a g t o t a l t a g i o n t 2 6 2 tk model a first order kinetic one compartment tk model was used to simulate the internal ag concentration in zebrafish larvae for the respective agno3 and agnp exposure concentrations the basic assumption of the one compartment model is that the ag in the organism is treated as a whole which is likely to be suitable for larval organisms stadnicka michalak et al 2014 in this study ag ⅰ in the whole body included two compartments organically bound ag complexed ag i and free ag the time course of the ag concentration in whole larvae cint t amount mass 1 is simulated based on the following equation tan and wang 2011 4 d c int t d t k i n c w t k o u t c int t where cw t amount volume 1 is the ag exposure concentration over time and kin is the uptake rate constant volume amount 1 time 1 and kout is the elimination rate constant time 1 during the depuration process the time course of the ag concentration in a whole larvae cint t amount mass 1 is simulated based on the following equation 5 d c int t d t k o u t c int t 2 6 3 td model the td model included two assumptions i e stochastic distribution sd and individual tolerance it which led to two different results for ag toxicity predictions jager et al 2011 sd assumes that all zebrafish larvae have the same sensitivity and that death happens stochastically at the individual level whereas it assumes that all larvae have different sensitivities and that death does not happen at the same time because the threshold for death complies with an individual tolerance distribution the sd model complies with the basic principle that the hazard h t dimensionless occurs and the survival probability s t dimensionless consequently decreases when the ag concentration in metabolically available species exceeds the threshold concentration cit amount mass 1 s t is determined as follows jager et al 2011 6 d h t d t k k c int t c i t h 0 if c 1 t c it else d h t d t h 0 7 s t e h t 8 s 0 t e h 0 t in these equations h0 is hazard rate in the control group time 1 and s0 t is the survival probability of larvae in the control group in this study h0 was set to zero because zebrafish larvae did not suffer mortality in the control cit was previously defined as the highest bioavailable dose of ag that larvae could tolerate without causing an elevated hazard rate whereas kk is the hazard rate mass amount 1 time 1 caused by per unit of excess metal above cit therefore cit defines the boundary value between safety and damage toxicity and kk determines the severity of damage toxicity when it occurs the it model assumes that the threshold for death complies with an individual tolerance distribution which is presented in eqs 9 and 10 nyman et al 2012 the scaled internal concentration c int is the maximum biological dose in zebrafish larvae during exposure time 0 to t and the max function selects the largest value of the biological dose metric c int that occurred until time t the cumulative threshold distribution f t is the log logistic cumulative distribution function for the threshold eq 9 the resulting s t is determined following eq 10 nyman et al 2012 9 f t 1 1 max c int τ β 0 τ t α 10 s t 1 f t e h 0 t where β is the median of the distribution amount mass 1 α determines the width of the distribution and h0 is the control hazard rate time 1 2 6 4 model parameterization the one compartment tk parameters kin and kout and td parameters kk and cit for sd α and β for it were estimated using the nelder mead method via the fitode package in r version 3 5 0 http www r project org the single agno3 depuration data were used to fit kout the internal ag concentration data from both single agno3 constant and pulsed exposure as described in section constant and pulsed agno3 toxicity tests were used to fit kin and kout for one compartment firstly ag efflux was calculated based on primary ag subtracted by retained ag kout were estimated through above eq 5 from data on internal ag retained during depuration time from 24 to 96 h in a single agno3 exposure using the nelder mead method in r secondly with kout kept fixed kin values were estimated from the time course of ag accumulation data from single agno3 accumulation tests then the internal ag concentrations and survival data in a single agno3 exposure were used to fit threshold and kk for the sd model or α and β for the it model further details on model parameterization are provided in the supporting information 2 6 5 model validation accumulation and survival of low and high concentration pvp agnps were respectively predicted by a tk td model based on single ag parameters fitted by single ag pulsed exposure data according to ag released from agnps we designed increasing ag pulsed concentrations furthermore the accumulation and survival of single ag pulsed concentrations were predicted by the aforementioned tk td model because a continuous time point pulse exposure experiment would be difficult perhaps impossible to perform we designed gradually increasing ag concentrations only at 24 48 72 and 96 h and we observed accumulation and survival at these time points however it is possible to simulate the theoretical accumulation and survival values of increasing ag concentrations at continuous time points 2 7 statistical analysis all treatments were repeated three times and each treatment was conducted in triplicate in each time i e n 3 3 which met the underlying assumptions of a normal distribution or approximately normal distribution to use the independent sample t test thus all experimental data are represented as means standard deviations to exclude the influence of the solvent on ag toxicity to larval zebrafish we conducted toxicity tests for the raw materials used in pvp agnp synthesis for details of quality assurance and quality control see the supporting information figs s2 s4 at each time point a mass balance was performed by taking into account agnp and total ag concentrations in exposure solution and body data were rejected if the sum of solutions and body metals varied by 10 from the initial concentration as ultratrace impurities would have a limited influence on the results we simplified our calculations by assuming that 100 of 107ag was from 107agnps in exposed larvae and solutions the concentrations of ag species e g ag and agcl aq in the exposure solutions were estimated using visual minteq version 3 0 http www2 lwr kth se english oursoftware vminteq through inputting the concentrations of k na ca2 mg2 cl no3 and so4 2 measured by ion chromatography ics 5000 thermo usa for example the distribution of each ag species in the 10 μg l ag in low ionic strength solution was shown in table s6 free ag was identified as the major ag species accounting for approximately 99 of all soluble ag species the larvae were placed and rinsed in ultrapure water for approximately 1 h prior to the toxicity test to ensure that feces was not produced to introduce extra dissolved organic carbon doc into the exposure solutions the background concentrations of nonessential ag in organisms were negligible the ph and measured dissolved concentrations of ag k na ca2 mg2 cl no3 and so4 2 in low ionic water were used as input parameters and the concentrations of free ag were inputs in tk td modeling the one compartment tk td model was implemented and solved in r 3 5 0 http www r project org first we found that single agno3 acute toxicity data from test zebrafish larvae constant and pulsed exposures respectively measured body residues and survival could be used and therefore produced a one compartment tk td model for single ag tk and td parameters for constant ag and pulsed ag were compared using spss 22 0 and independent sample t test p 0 05 second we determined how special cases of the one compartment tk model explained the ag data for low and high level pvp agnp accumulation and how special cases of the it and sd models explain the data for low and high level pvp agnp survival data in addition we found that the tk td model explained the accumulation and survival of larvae exposed to gradually increasing agno3 pulsed concentrations the model simulation values were compared with time course independent accumulation and toxicity data from zebrafish subjected to individual exposure systems at 6 24 48 72 and 96 h comparisons between the observed and modeled accumulations or survival rates were regressed through the 1 1 line with r 2 as the coefficient of dependence mean comparisons of ag concentrations in 92 0 μg l total ag of pvp agnp suspension with and without s9 solution was conducted using spss 22 0 according to independent sample t test n 3 3 p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanoparticle and exposure characterization the stock pvp agnps 101 82 mg l 1 were analyzed by two methods to provide two lines of evidence for primary particle size tem and hydrodynamic diameter dls the mean size of primary particles was 47 8 nm fig s5a including a 42 1 nm core agnp and 5 70 nm surface coating pvp fig s5b the hydrodynamic diameter was 53 3 2 30 nm at the beginning of exposure which was slightly smaller than the measured particle size 69 1 3 10 nm with a zeta potential of 5 82 mv and dispensability index pdi of 0 35 at 96 h fig s6a dls is a delicate method for detecting pvp coated nanoparticles it detects small amounts of large sized particles formed by agglomeration or aggregation which can cause ambiguity when determining particle sizes roemer et al 2011 therefore tem was also used to confirm that the particle sizes were not due to agglomerates dobrovolskaia et al 2009 in the present study tem revealed the particle to be compact spherical well dispersed and stable fig s6b shows absorption spectra for agnps all samples presented the characteristic surface plasmon of pvp agnps 42 1 nm pvp agnps present a narrow band with a peak absorbance of 418 nm transferred nanoparticle concentrations must therefore be determined in exposure solutions to confirm the toxicity of nanoparticles pradhan et al 2016 a capping agent such as pvp which promotes colloidal stability could enhance nanospecific effects because it makes aggregation and agglomeration less likely qi et al 2016 in this study the aggregation of 40 nm agnp could be mild and remain undetected or aggregation may be avoided altogether as pvp improves dispersion of agnps and prevents aggregation and agglomeration in addition the final concentrations of various metal nanoparticles have been reported at 30 80 of initial administered concentrations pradhan et al 2016 3 2 tk td processes for single constant and pulsed agno3 exposure the efflux of ag was fitted well by the one compartment tk model fig s7 during the first 24 h after depuration efflux was rapid the estimated kout was 3 30 0 704 10 2 h 1 for ag fig s7 table 1 after the initial 24 h of rapid elimination the retained metals were in slow efflux kout is similar to the efflux rate constants 0 031 0 043 h 1 reported in previous studies on metal biokinetics chen et al 2011 diez ortiz et al 2015 as shown in fig 2 a agno3 was present in the exposure water with an ag concentration of 10 0 μg l 1 during the 96 h period the one compartment tk model could fit the observed accumulation data well fig 2b the uptake rate constant kin was estimated at 1 92 0 412 10 2 l g 1 h 1 table 1 keeping these tk parameters kin and kout fixed the td parameters kk and cit were estimated from the survival data from toxicity tests over time the one compartment td model described the time process observed in the survival data well fig 2c for sd the parameters cit and kk were estimated at 2 53 0 271 g μg 1 h 1 and 0 480 0 0902 respectively for it α and β were estimated at 7 61 0 872 μg g 1 and 1 31 0 593 respectively table 1 fig 2d shows ag levels during the agno3 pulse exposure the uptake rate constant kin was estimated at 1 71 0 303 10 2 l g 1 h 1 via the one compartment tk model for sd the parameters cit and kk in the td model were estimated at 2 55 0 162 g μg 1 h 1 and 0 589 0 0511 respectively for it α and β were estimated at 6 80 0 433 μg g 1 and 1 77 0 170 respectively table 1 in general sd fitted constant and pulsed ag exposure better than it as indicated by r2 values table 1 in agno3 toxicity tests larvae would successively die which complied with the sd assumption that an organism had an increased probability to die other than it assumption that a certain fraction of the population could survive jager et al 2011 there was no significant difference independent sample t test p 0 05 between tk and td parameters for constant ag and pulsed ag respectively thus we used tk td parameters for pulsed ag to predict accumulation and toxicity of ag gradually released from pvp agnps in zebrafish larvae 3 3 bioaccumulation and toxicity of pvp agnps 3 3 1 dissolution kinetics of pvp agnps the low exposure concentration pvp agnp suspension ag at 92 0 μg l 1 showed increased concentrations of free ag in solution during the 96 h exposure fig 3 a herein variation of concentration of soluble ag species released from agnps was also computed by inputting concentrations of k na ca2 mg2 cl no3 and so4 2 in low ionic water into visualminteq free ag was identified as the major ag species accounting for approximately 99 of all soluble ag species dissolution reached a steady state after 72 h the dissolution rate k1 of pvp agnp was estimated by fitting free ag data using eq 1 and was 2 32 0 304 10 2 h 1 the precipitation rate k2 of pvp agnps was 9 50 2 52 10 3 h 1 during 96 h the time course dissolution of the high exposure concentration pvp agnp suspension ag at 255 μg l 1 was also validated fig 3b the first order dissolution dynamic process of the high concentration pvp agnp suspension was well fitted by eqs 1 and 2 with k1 at 2 94 0 717 10 2 h 1 and k2 at 1 95 0 403 10 2 h 1 r2 of 0 84 0 91 and 0 89 for total ag agnps and free ag respectively based on the assumption of primary particle size assuming spherical particles using stokes formula eq s1 we calculated the theoretical precipitation distance of the agnp suspension as 1 0 mm during the 96 h exposure the precipitation in pvp agnps was not significant during this exposure period as indicated by the consistent turbidity of pvp agnps over 96 h as shown in figs s8 s11 the turbidity of the pvp agnp suspension changed slightly during the 96 h period we found that the actual concentration of pvp agnps was 80 that of the initial concentration after 96 h the pvp agnp dissolution rate constants for pvp agnp suspensions with ag at 92 0 or 255 μg l 1 were within the range of dissolution rates from 11 values 0 00047 0 017 h 1 from two previous studies dobias and bernier latmani 2013 kittler et al 2010 but greater than the mean value fig s12 all data and references are provided in table s6 which was attributed to that ag release from pvp agnp occurred in low ionic strength water rather than ultrapure water it was reported that the increasing of ionic strength e g na and cl could promote on the dissolution of agnp zhao et al 2021 in addition in this study the two dissolution rates were dependent on the original concentration of agnps as also reported previously pradhan et al 2016 3 3 2 tk and td processes of pvp agnps to determine distribution patterns of agnps in zebrafish larvae the tissue distribution of accumulated low concentration pvp agnps ag at 92 0 μg l 1 was observed by tem fig s13 the bioaccumulation of agnps was detected in the gills and intestines of exposed larvae but not in the control animals suggesting that agnps accumulated in these two organs from which they could be passed to the blood and transported to other organs for both low and high concentration pvp agnp suspensions ag at 92 0 and 255 μg l 1 respectively agnps were bioaccumulated in the gas bladders of larvae fig 4 b c e and f the presence of agnps in the gills was confirmed by tem slicing and energy dispersive x ray point analysis fig 4h i from which ag cl p and s were confirmed to be present after the larvae were transferred to fresh ultrapure water the agnps in body were eliminated faster than ag but there was no obvious difference in the amounts of them retained at the end of exposure fig s14 agnps were retained at about 5 levels in the body whereas ag were retained at about 22 levels in the body in the gills of zebrafish larvae pvp agnps were seemingly combined with enzymes proteins and some anions as indicated by the cl p and s signals originating from the surroundings of ag nanoparticles yan et al 2018 which occurred within 24 h of the initial exposure and extended to 96 h in previous studies daphnia magna santos rasera et al 2019 and prochilodus lineatus ale et al 2018 were shown to take up nanomaterials from test solutions thus aquatic organisms especially filter feeding copepods such as d magna could be at risk of bioaccumulation following exposure to nanoparticles as shown in fig 5 a for the low concentration exposure agno3 was present in the exposure solution with ag at 4 40 μg l 1 during 0 6 h 6 66 μg l 1 during 6 24 h 12 3 μg l 1 during 24 48 h 15 4 μg l 1 during 48 72 h and 17 8 μg l 1 during 72 96 h pvp agnps were present in the exposure solution with agnp at 86 8 0 803 μg l 1 and free ag major species in soluble ag present at 4 40 0 522 μg l 1 at the beginning silver was not detected in the control solution fig 5a also shows that during a 96 h exposure to 42 nm pvp agnps with a concentration of 86 8 μg l 1 larvae continuously accumulated agnps over time fig 5b at the end of the 96 h exposure total ag agnps and ag i in larvae exceeded 13 2 0 243 11 8 0 450 and 7 90 0 404 μg g 1 respectively as shown in fig 5d for the high concentration exposure agno3 was present in the exposure solution with ag at 6 02 μg l 1 during 0 6 h 12 7 μg l 1 during 6 24 h 15 0 μg l 1 during 24 48 h 18 3 μg l 1 during 48 72 h and 27 3 μg l 1 during 72 96 h pvp agnps were present in the exposure solution with agnp at 251 1 32 μg l 1 and free ag major species in soluble ag present at 6 02 0 504 μg l 1 at the beginning again silver was not detected in the control water fig 5d shows that during a 96 h exposure to 42 nm pvp agnps with 251 μg l 1 of agnp increased ag accumulation was observed over observed and modeled time courses in zebrafish larvae fig 5e in agnp treatments the internal ag i concentration and exposure time increased before and eventually reached equilibrium after approximately 72 h in the organisms the highest concentrations of ag i after 96 h were 30 8 0 406 μg g 1 following exposure to pvp agnps and 9 90 1 00 μg g 1 following exposure to pulsed agno3 treatment in both the low and high concentration agnp exposures time course data of the internal ag i concentration during the uptake and elimination processes were well described by eq 4 fig 5b and e respectively in both cases the tk model was statistically significant p 0 05 and could satisfactorily explain the observed internal ag i concentrations for the low concentration exposure the r2 and rmse for ag i accumulations from virtually pulsed agno3 treatments were 0 81 and 1 15 respectively and from pulsed agno3 treatments were 0 92 and 0 73 respectively for the high concentration exposure the r2 and rmse for ag i accumulation from virtually pulsed agno3 treatment were 0 90 and 0 17 respectively and for pulsed agno3 treatment were 0 95 and 0 12 respectively the tk predicted internal ag i concentrations for virtually pulsed agno3 were obviously higher than that for pulsed agno3 treatment and observed internal ag i concentrations for pulsed agno3 treatment rmse for virtually pulsed agno3 was much larger than that for pulsed agno3 treatment the rmse for the low agnp concentrations 1 15 and 0 73 was higher than the high agnp concentrations 0 17 and 0 12 which was possibly due to the suitable tk td parameters estimated by using higher pulsed gradient 5 30 μg l agno3 data in both exposure cases agnps released more ag into zebrafish larvae than single ag pulsed exposure and the virtually simulated accumulation values of increasing ag concentrations at continuous time points in our study agnps released almost twice as many ag in zebrafish larvae compared with the levels observed in a single ag exposure system similarly in vivo study of hepg2 and a549 cells showed that proportions of 107ag 109ag and ratios of 107ag to total 107ag in cells gradually elevated after the beginning of exposure yu et al 2019 indicating the action of a trojan horse type mechanism i e agnps released ag after internalization where ag concentrations after passing through 3 kda membranes millipore were detected by icp ms previous studies have speculated that agnps toxicity was attributed to this trojan horse type mechanism de matteis et al 2015 hsiao et al 2015 furthermore agnps absorbed on cell membrane surface are known to continue releasing ag and further forming inorganic ag s complexes extracellularly whereas ag organosulfur complexes are primarily formed intracellularly zhang et al 2020 ag release reached equilibrium in pvp agnp suspensions with ag at 255 μg l after approximately 72 h consistent with a previous report wang and wang 2014 for both the low and high concentration exposures the survival rates of zebrafish larvae decreased over time after exposure to agno3 and pvp agnps respectively fig 5c and f respectively indeed larval mortality rapidly increased after 24 h of ag exposure in both exposure cases the survival rates were well predicted using the td sd model and estimated parameters threshold and kk listed in table 1 p 0 05 the survival rates described by the td sd model were in good agreement with the observed values in the low concentration exposure fig 5c the r2 and rmse for ag toxicity from agnps were 0 90 and 0 09 respectively and from pulsed agno3 treatment were 0 95 and 0 03 respectively the r2 and rmses for ag toxicity from virtually pulsed agno3 treatment were 0 91 and 0 06 respectively and from pulsed agno3 treatment were 0 95 and 0 03 respectively in the high concentration exposure fig 5f the r2 and rmse for ag toxicity from agnps were 0 93 and 0 06 respectively and from pulsed agno3 treatment were 0 96 and 0 03 respectively the r2 and rmse for ag toxicity from virtually pulsed agno3 treatment were 0 93 and 0 06 respectively and from pulsed agno3 treatment were 0 96 and 0 03 respectively in both exposure scenarios the survival rates of larvae exposed to agnps were lower than those of larvae exposed to pulsed agno3 treatments and the virtually simulated survival values of increasing ag concentrations at continuous time points however for both exposure cases the survival rates predicted by the td it model were not consistent with the observed values r2 and rmse values were lower and higher respectively fig s15a b the difference in the survivorship between pulsed agno3 and agnp exposure scenarios can be attributed to the enhanced localized or intracellular dissolution of the agnps when present in solution with larvae compared to just ag alone fig 5c and f the predicted toxicity of ag was in agreement with the actual toxicity observed in the exposure system thus the toxicity contribution of agnps toward zebrafish larvae can be largely attributed to their enhanced localized or intracellular release of ag nevertheless it remains unclear to what extent and by which mechanism the dissolved ag contributes to agnp toxicity mostly because an appropriate analytical method is currently lacking for quantitatively distinguish agnp toxicity and soluble ag toxicity as the appearance of agnp was always accompanied by ag however the results of our tk td modeling combined with our ag pulsed exposure method now demonstrate the extent to which dissolved ag contributes to agnp toxicity our model considers the combined ion particle mechanism because the particle needs to be present in the organisms to have increased localized intracellular ionization 3 4 liver s9 fraction and pvp agnps in vitro as shown in fig s16b and c subcellular s9 fractions might cause the pvp coated ag particles to remove the capping agents the removing ration of 0 63 shown in fig s17 and favor the release of many ag as indicated by increased ag levels over 96 h in s9 solution that included the low concentration pvp agnp suspension ag at 92 0 μg l 1 fig s18 there were significant differences p 0 05 in ag release between pvp agnp with s9 fraction group and without s9 fraction group at 72 and 96 h other than 24 and 48 h thus another piece of evidence showed that agnp taking off pvp was liable to release ag and further the ag caused observed toxicity in addition s9 fraction alone was not responsible for the double higher accumulated ag i concentrations in agnp exposures than agno3 exposure fig 5b whereas ag release did not double when s9 fraction was included fig s18 combined with elemental composition around ag particle by edx s was mainly confirmed to be present fig s19 we speculated that subcellular fractions s9 had thiol groups sh inclined to strongly bind with ag wetzel et al 2021 whereas ag organosulfur complexes are primarily formed intracellularly zhang et al 2020 however we did not quantify the change in ligand density of ag particles before and after incubation with the s9 fractions future studies will use a much more convincing and robust technique involving nuclear magnetic resonance nmr to quantitatively determine ligand loss to further verify that pvp coating is quantitatively lost based on our results we propose two possible mechanisms of ag internalization 1 the direct uptake of ag released by agnps 2 s9 components stimulate the losing pvp coating of agnps the dissolution of agnps occurred after taking off the coating or at the same time in a previous study oyster larvae directly ingested particulate ag in vivo dissolution of agnps occurred and the nanoparticles were less bioavailable than ag while intracellular ag mostly obtained from soluble ag especially that which was originated from ingested agnps zhang et al 2020 taken together these findings suggest that agnps enter the larvae after which the oxidative dissolution process leads to internalization of ag across the cell membrane and ultimately translocation between tissues for our findings tks suggest that intracellular dissolution of agnps occurs in organisms whereas tds indicate a similar intracellular active portion of internalized ag most likely as ag which interacts with the relevant cellular metal homeostasis together with cellular targets to produce toxic effects this does not preclude that some ag exists as nanoparticle form in organisms but it indicates that potentially internalized nanoparticles make less contribution to certain direct or specific toxic effects we can conclude that dissolved ag causes a substantial proportion of the mortality observed in fish after exposed to pvp agnp on the contrary transcriptional analysis of fathead minnows after exposure to pvp agnps has shown that a great number of possible biological and toxicological pathways in both the brain and liver differ from those pathways in fish after exposure to agno3 indicating that not all toxic effects are due to ag released from pvp agnps however there was no direct evidence that pvp agnps existed as particles rather than ag in target organs garcia reyero et al 2014 our method for dosing in ag i equivalent to localized intracellular dissolution of agnp is needed further research is necessary to elucidate the contributions of each np property e g size and shape and would be most productively pursued by using the same experimental conditions that have successfully demonstrated the ability to distinguish ion and particle toxicity contributions given that np size and shape is known to influence surface reactivity and physical interactions with organisms bao et al 2018 particle size is a topic deserving investigation that could provide insightful contributions to resolving the ion and particle mechanisms 4 conclusions the toxicity of agnp has been studied in a number of aquatic organisms fabrega et al 2011 tortella et al 2020 however whether these toxicities were caused by the agnps themselves the ag released from the agnps or both is currently debatable choi et al 2008 zhang and wang 2019 we directly quantified the existence of ag investigated the dissolution kinetics of agnps and determined the dissolution process of ag in zebrafish larvae based on a novel pulsed ag exposure method our study finds direct evidence for agnp induced toxicity largely originating from dissolved ag from the original agnps moreover it is well known that agnp continuously releases ag increasing ag concentration in the actual exposure system regardless of the laboratory or the natural environment and we proposed a pulsed ag agno3 exposure to simulate increasing ag concentration a key question challenging the risk assessment of agnps is whether their risk effects are driven by the same mechanism of toxic action that is due to ag artal et al 2020 shao and wang 2020 our study provides a framework by which to quantify the toxicity contribution of dissolved ag to agnp toxicity via a developed tk td model for larval survival the contribution of ag toxicity was the key factor in our tk td model of agnp toxicity additional in vitro and in vivo studies should explore the potential similarities and differences in sublethal toxicity endpoints which should also be considered when using the tk td model for toxicity assessment taken together our results indicate that a combination of in vivo exposures in vitro assays and in silico tools can be used to effectively assess the environmental and human related risks of nanoparticles declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they havcone no known competing

16668,determining the bioavailability and toxicity mechanism of silver nanoparticles agnps is challenging as ag is continuously released by external or internal agnp dissolution in the actual exposure system regardless of the laboratory or the natural environment here a novel pulsed gradient ag agno3 exposure was conducted with zebrafish danio rerio larvae to simulate dissolved gradient concentrations of ag from polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp coated agnps the accumulation and toxicity of the pulsed gradient ag agno3 and in the meantime the released ag from pvp agnps were predicted using a toxicokinetic toxicodynamic tk td model with obtained ag parameters in order to further understand the possible mechanism of pvp agnp releasing ag in the body subcellular fractions s9 of zebrafish were also used to incubate with agnps in vitro to mimic the realistic in vivo scenarios in the tk process in vivo analysis showed that agnps released around twice as many ag into the body than were detected with a single ag pulse exposure system this was supported by evidence that subcellular s9 fractions might cause the pvp agnps to lose the capping agent and favor ag release in the td process toxicity survival rate was predicted by the total bodily ag i concentration suggesting that agnp toxicity in larvae was mainly due to gradually released ag rather than agnps themselves this study helps clarify the role of ag in agnp toxicity and offers a novel framework by which to investigate the toxicity of metal nanoparticles and corresponding metal ions in biological systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords silver nanoparticle silver ion toxicokinetic toxicodynamic zebrafish danio rerio polyvinylpyrrolidone 1 introduction nanomaterials are applied in many industrial and technological sectors encompassing information technology food safety energy cosmetics pharmaceuticals and agriculture alvino et al 2020 leonel et al 2021 quik et al 2015 scalisi et al 2020 silver nanoparticles agnp are universally used in nanomaterials and particularly in consumer products such as detergents plastics textiles and atopic dermatitis creams as well as in antimicrobials for water treatments because of their strong antibacterial properties de leersnyder et al 2019 lu et al 2020 silveira valente et al 2020 consequently around 360 450 tons of agnps are produced globally per year lazareva and keller 2014 the mass production of agnps has led to pollution of aquatic environments lazareva and keller 2014 with agnp levels of 24 0 770 μg l 1 having been detected in surface water aznar et al 2017 xiao et al 2019 the toxicity of agnp has been studied in a number of aquatic organisms including fish plants invertebrates microalgae and bacteria fabrega et al 2011 tortella et al 2020 evidence suggests that agnps could lead to lipid peroxidation huang et al 2018 biomass reduction photosynthetic efficiency reduction rajala et al 2018 phytoplankton assemblage chen et al 2018 sugar and protein metabolism ribosome function histones and disruption of energy production novo et al 2015 however whether these toxicities were caused by the agnps themselves the ag released from the agnps or both is currently debatable choi et al 2008 zhang and wang 2019 some studies have suggested that the toxicity originates from the original agnps themselves rather than the dissolved ag or biosynthesized agnps choi et al 2008 huang et al 2018 contrastingly other reports have shown that agnp toxicity is mainly induced by dissolved ag rather than agnp rajala et al 2018 zhang and wang 2019 other studies however have attributed agnp toxicity to dissolved ag in addition to direct particle specific effects i e one or the other is not solely responsible ahlberg et al 2014 miao et al 2010 silver nitrate agno3 exposure is often used as a ionizing control in studies aiming to reveal the toxicity contributions of ag agnps and combined ag agnp boehme et al 2017 hu et al 2020 novo et al 2015 rosario et al 2020 which is largely attributed to the ag release via oxidation and dissolution of the surface ag atoms stabryla et al 2018 such studies often employ constant concentrations of agnps along with agno3 exposure systems in which ag concentrations remain constant boehme et al 2017 hu et al 2020 novo et al 2015 rosario et al 2020 ignoring the fact that ag is gradually released from agnps in solution i e ag concentrations in actual exposure systems gradually increase due to the dissolution of agnp hu et al 2020 this process will affect the subsequent accumulation and toxicity of ag in organisms in which the toxicity of released ag may wrongly be determined as the toxicity of agnps themselves obviously we realized the differences in constant ag concentration versus gradual ag release and there is need to conduct the control of pulse dose ag to mimic ion release occurring in agnp systems thus to clarify the toxicity mechanism of agnps the following three processes must be quantified 1 the dissolution of agnps in the exposure solution 2 the toxicokinetic tk process of agnp and ag and 3 the toxicodynamic td process of both in the organism bachler et al 2013 shao and wang 2020 topuz and van gestel 2015 tk td model as a robust mechanistic approach can integrate time course toxic effects on many endpoints teng et al 2016 wang and tan 2019 tk deals with the time course absorption distribution metabolism and elimination of toxicants by linking external exposure concentrations to biologically effective concentrations whereas td describes the time processes by which toxic actions lead to subsequent damage hazard in organisms we suggest that tk td modeling could be used to quantify the biodistribution of agnps and corresponding released ag and it could determine whether toxicity is mediated by the accumulation of particles or originates from the released ag however to the best of our knowledge the toxicity of agnps has yet to be accurately quantified by tk td modeling bachler et al 2013 shao and wang 2020 in the present study we aimed to explore the mechanism of agnp toxicity in zebrafish danio rerio larvae exposed to polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp coated agnps and agno3 respectively using a combination of in vivo in vitro and in silico methods illustrated in fig 1 first we determined the dissolution process of agnps in the exposure solution and quantified the concentration gradient of ag gradually released from agnps via a first order dissolution model second we used pulsed rather than constant agno3 exposures to simulate and quantify the concentration gradient of released ag entering the larvae via a tk model to isolate the accumulation contribution of the ion finally from agnps in solution or in larvae we distinguished the contribution of released ag to agnp toxicity via a td model to isolate the toxicity contribution of the ion in addition to clarifying the role of ag in three above processes of agnp toxicity this study offers a new framework to investigate the toxicities of other metal nanoparticles and their released metal ions in biological systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of agnps pvp molecular weight 58 000 coated agnps were used in our experiment see supporting information for agnp suspension synthesis and preparation as pvp is a coating commonly used to stabilize dispersed nanoparticles all characterization analyses were conducted with the obtained aqueous dispersions of agnps particle size distribution was measured by dynamic light scattering dls using a zetasizer nano zs malvern uk and transmission electron microscopy tem using a talos l120c g2 transition electron microscope fei czech republic the dls size measurement was performed in triplicate using backscatter 173 detection on 3 5 ml samples in 4 5 ml plastic cuvette four sided transparent polystyrene optical path 10 mm containing 107 mg l 1 pvp agnps after 15 min of sonication 550 sonic dismembrator fisher scientific using tem the sizes of at least 200 particles were measured for each of three pvp agnps with the microscope operated at 200 kv see supporting information 1 3 absorption spectra were measured using a shimadzu uv vis spectrophotometer model no uv1601u whereas the produced nanoparticles were characterized using a s2000 uv vis spectrometer ocean optics inc 2 2 organisms as a representative model zebrafish danio rerio has many advantages e g rapid development optical transparency in early life stages and low cost usage and has been widely used to explore toxic action mechanisms of many chemicals to represent a risk to the fish inhabiting the freshwater environments parng 2005 zebrafish have been cultured in our laboratory for 6 years for the maintenance and toxicity testing of these fish we followed oecd guidelines oecd 203 and 210 zebrafish were cultured in 20 l aquariums filled with filtered tap water filtered through a gf c membrane with a 1 2 μm pore size millipore watford uk table s1 provides the parameters of the water e g total organic carbon toc ph and the concentrations of inorganic ions k na ca2 mg2 cl no3 and so4 2 the zebrafish were fed with newly hatched brine shrimp artemia salina twice a day and maintained with a 12 12 h light dark photoperiod at a constant temperature of 26 0 5 c three day old 72 h post fertilization hpf larvae were used in the experiments because of their transparent bodies which provide good visibility to various internal organs the larvae were not fed during the 96 h experiment to eliminate the influence of food on ag accumulation in the body 2 3 constant and pulsed agno3 toxicity tests for toxicity testing we aimed to reveal toxicity differences in constant versus gradient concentrations of ag exposure the ag exposure concentrations 5 30 μg l 1 were in relevance of 10 90 lethal concentration lc from 24 to 120 hpf reported in zebrafish boyle and goss 2018 robinson et al 2020 in detail larvae were collected from their culture stock placed in a 6 well plate containing 10 ml of low ionic strength water the exact composition is provided in table s2 and allowed to acclimate for 60 min for constant agno3 exposure larvae were exposed to 10 0 μg l 1 of ag in agno3 over a period from 0 to 96 h the ag exposure solutions were completely renewed with fresh 10 0 μg l 1 of ag every 24 h at 24 h some exposed larvae were transferred into fresh low ionic water for the remaining period up to 96 h the living larvae were collected and mortality was observed during 72 h depuration experiments the solutions were completely renewed with fresh low ionic water every 24 h and there was no ag and or ag complexes in low ionic water to contribute to the internal ag data as indicated by that ag concentration in solutions were below limit of detection lod 0 114 μg l ag for ag by icp ms for pulsed agno3 exposure the larvae were exposed to a 5 00 μg l 1 ag pulse in agno3 during 0 6 h a 10 0 μg l 1 ag pulse in agno3 during 6 24 h a 15 0 μg l 1 ag pulse in agno3 during 24 48 h a 20 0 μg l 1 ag pulse in agno3 during 48 72 h and finally a 30 0 μg l 1 ag pulse in agno3 during 72 96 h during the experiment which comprised three replicates 30 larvae pre replicate survival was recorded and living larvae were collected at 0 6 24 48 72 and 96 h 2 4 pvp agnp accumulation and toxicity tests 2 4 1 real time monitoring of dissolution kinetics of pvp agnps the protocol for monitoring the release kinetics of ag from pvp agnps was similar to a previously reported method zhang and wang 2019 briefly the stock pvp agnp suspension 102 mg l 1 ag atom concentrations detected by icp ms was respectively diluted 1000 times and 400 times with low ionic strength water table s2 to produce solutions with 92 0 and 255 μg l 1 ag atom concentrations detected by icp ms in terms of environmental relevance similar levels of nanoparticulate ag have been reported in taihu lake china xiao et al 2019 river meuse river ijssel the netherlands and river isar germany peters et al 2018 agnp exposure concentration is regarded as a major factor affecting bioaccumulation and biotransformation wang et al 2014 at various time points 0 6 24 48 72 and 96 h the dissolution kinetics of the pvp agnps were measured by single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry sp icp ms and conventional centrifugal ultrafiltration followed by icp ms detection for quality comparison see section 1 9 and tables s3 s5 in supporting information 2 4 2 real time monitoring of tk and td process of pvp agnps for real time monitoring of pvp agnp tk and td processes zebrafish larvae were collected from the glass petri dish φ120 mm placed in a 6 well plate 30 individuals per well containing 10 ml of low ionic strength water and allowed to acclimate for 60 min afterwards larvae were exposed to two concentrations of pvp agnp suspensions with ag at 92 0 and 255 μg l 1 respectively for 96 h 2 4 3 pulsed agno3 toxicity tests to mimic the dissolution kinetics of pvp agnp suspensions larvae were collected from the glass petri dish φ120 mm placed in a 6 well plate containing 10 ml of low ionic strength water and allowed to acclimate for 60 min after which they were exposed to pulsed agno3 for 96 h in these experiments pulsed ag concentrations were selected according to the real time monitoring of dissolution kinetics from pvp agnp suspensions total ag atom concentrations of 92 0 and 255 μg l 1 the ag exposure solutions were renewed at various time points i e 0 6 24 48 72 and 96 h during the experiment which comprised three replicates 30 larvae pre replicate survival was recorded and living larvae were collected at 0 6 24 48 72 and 96 h following collection 5 ml of etching solution 10 mm na2s2o3 5h2o in phosphate buffered saline pbs was added to each well of the plates containing the larvae which were incubated for 30 s to remove surface attached ag from the larvae zhang and wang 2019 the larvae were then washed three times with 3 ml of pbs per wash and sacrificed in ice bath finally the collected larvae were digested and the accumulation kinetics of ag and pvp agnps were measured by icp ms 2 4 4 depuration of pvp agnps from larvae to test for depuration of pvp agnps larvae were exposed to 92 0 and 255 μg l 1 respectively of ag in pvp agnp suspensions for 96 h however at 24 h some exposed larvae were transferred to fresh low ionic strength water for the remaining period up to 96 h during the experiment which comprised three replicates 30 larvae pre replicate survival was recorded and living larvae were collected at 0 6 24 48 72 and 96 h herein there were no enough living larvae collected at 48 72 and 96 h for 255 μg l 1 of ag in pvp agnp suspensions to reach limit of detection lod 0 122 μg l ag for ag content by sp icp ms and thus we cannot obtain internal ag data 2 4 5 liver s9 fraction and pvp agnps in vitro in vitro biotransformation assays were widely used in pharmacology and human toxicology to screen drugs for metabolism gomez lechon et al 2016 typically subcellular fractions or isolated hepatocytes such as post mitochondrial supernatants s9 fractions are ubiquitous in the liver which is the main organ for drug biotransformation in vertebrates kropf et al 2020 laue et al 2020 in addition it is verified that it have thiol groups sh musavi and kakkar 2003 which was inclined to strongly bind with ag wetzel et al 2021 to test the possible reaction between pvp agnp and s9 fraction 30 larvae were placed in a 10 ml centrifuge tube and rinsed with a prechilled 0 15 m kcl solution three times to remove hemoglobin which can inhibit microsomal enzyme activity subsequently 6 ml of tris hcl buffer solution was added to the tube and the larvae were homogenized with an electric homogenizer rod 20 000 rev min 1 for 2 min after which the mixture was centrifuged at high speed 9000 g for 10 min afterwards 5 ml of the supernatant s9 fraction was placed in a 15 ml centrifuge tube to which 5 ml of pvp agnp suspensionwas added to achieve final 92 0 μg l 1 of ag this mixture was incubated in a biochemical incubator lbi 80 longyue shanghai for 96 h at 37 c with 12 h light and 12 h dark per day after 24 h at which time the ag had obviously released from the agnps 10 μl of the mixture was extracted with a pipette and dropped onto copper mesh after air drying the drop was observed with tem coupled with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx to confirm the elemental composition around agnp moreover 4 ml of mixture s9 and pvp agnp solutions were collected at 24 48 72 and 96 h for ag concentration determination 2 5 determination of total ag agnp and ag ⅰ concentrations the concentrations of total ag agnp and soluble ag in solutions and the concentrations of agnps and ag ⅰ including the complexed ag i and free ag obtained by subtracting the agnp content from the total ag content in the sample boyle and goss 2018 dong et al 2020 in larvae were determined using both icp ms and sp icp ms see sections 1 7 and 1 8 in supporting information including information on quality assurance and quality control during icp ms and sp icp ms analysis tables s3 s5 in detail soluble ag species in exposure solutions included ag agno3 aq agoh aq agso4 and so on herein ag ⅰ in larvae included the complexed ag i and free ag hsiao et al 2015 yan et al 2019 in addition ag ⅰ concentration of mixture s9 and pvp agnp was were determined using icp ms as described in section 1 8 in supporting information the accumulation of agnps in larvae after agnp exposure was examined with tem the treatment procedure is shown in the supporting information examples of agnp suspension in exposure solution and in larvae detected by sp icp ms are shown in fig s1a and b 2 6 models 2 6 1 agnp dissolution model several previous reports have used the classical noyes whitney rate equation eq 1 to describe the dissolution of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles majedi et al 2014 peretyazhko et al 2014 skrdla et al 2019 a first order rate equation has in many circumstances been proven to be effective to model the kinetics of the agnp dissolution process quik et al 2011 scown et al 2010 1 d a g i o n t d t k 1 a g i o n e q a g i o n t where agion t is the amount of released metal ion after a given time amount volume 1 k1 is the first order dissolution rate constant and agion eq is the total percentage of released ag extrapolated as t moves towards infinity a first order rate equation also describes the kinetics of the agnp precipitation process as follows manteghian and ghader 2009 2 d a g total t d t k 2 a g t o t a l e q a g t o t a l t where agtotal t is the total amount of ag after a given time amount volume 1 k2 is the first order precipitation rate constant and agtotal eq is the total amount of ag that was extrapolated as t moves toward infinity eq 3 then agnp t is the amount of agnp after a given time amount volume 1 3 a g n p t a g t o t a l t a g i o n t 2 6 2 tk model a first order kinetic one compartment tk model was used to simulate the internal ag concentration in zebrafish larvae for the respective agno3 and agnp exposure concentrations the basic assumption of the one compartment model is that the ag in the organism is treated as a whole which is likely to be suitable for larval organisms stadnicka michalak et al 2014 in this study ag ⅰ in the whole body included two compartments organically bound ag complexed ag i and free ag the time course of the ag concentration in whole larvae cint t amount mass 1 is simulated based on the following equation tan and wang 2011 4 d c int t d t k i n c w t k o u t c int t where cw t amount volume 1 is the ag exposure concentration over time and kin is the uptake rate constant volume amount 1 time 1 and kout is the elimination rate constant time 1 during the depuration process the time course of the ag concentration in a whole larvae cint t amount mass 1 is simulated based on the following equation 5 d c int t d t k o u t c int t 2 6 3 td model the td model included two assumptions i e stochastic distribution sd and individual tolerance it which led to two different results for ag toxicity predictions jager et al 2011 sd assumes that all zebrafish larvae have the same sensitivity and that death happens stochastically at the individual level whereas it assumes that all larvae have different sensitivities and that death does not happen at the same time because the threshold for death complies with an individual tolerance distribution the sd model complies with the basic principle that the hazard h t dimensionless occurs and the survival probability s t dimensionless consequently decreases when the ag concentration in metabolically available species exceeds the threshold concentration cit amount mass 1 s t is determined as follows jager et al 2011 6 d h t d t k k c int t c i t h 0 if c 1 t c it else d h t d t h 0 7 s t e h t 8 s 0 t e h 0 t in these equations h0 is hazard rate in the control group time 1 and s0 t is the survival probability of larvae in the control group in this study h0 was set to zero because zebrafish larvae did not suffer mortality in the control cit was previously defined as the highest bioavailable dose of ag that larvae could tolerate without causing an elevated hazard rate whereas kk is the hazard rate mass amount 1 time 1 caused by per unit of excess metal above cit therefore cit defines the boundary value between safety and damage toxicity and kk determines the severity of damage toxicity when it occurs the it model assumes that the threshold for death complies with an individual tolerance distribution which is presented in eqs 9 and 10 nyman et al 2012 the scaled internal concentration c int is the maximum biological dose in zebrafish larvae during exposure time 0 to t and the max function selects the largest value of the biological dose metric c int that occurred until time t the cumulative threshold distribution f t is the log logistic cumulative distribution function for the threshold eq 9 the resulting s t is determined following eq 10 nyman et al 2012 9 f t 1 1 max c int τ β 0 τ t α 10 s t 1 f t e h 0 t where β is the median of the distribution amount mass 1 α determines the width of the distribution and h0 is the control hazard rate time 1 2 6 4 model parameterization the one compartment tk parameters kin and kout and td parameters kk and cit for sd α and β for it were estimated using the nelder mead method via the fitode package in r version 3 5 0 http www r project org the single agno3 depuration data were used to fit kout the internal ag concentration data from both single agno3 constant and pulsed exposure as described in section constant and pulsed agno3 toxicity tests were used to fit kin and kout for one compartment firstly ag efflux was calculated based on primary ag subtracted by retained ag kout were estimated through above eq 5 from data on internal ag retained during depuration time from 24 to 96 h in a single agno3 exposure using the nelder mead method in r secondly with kout kept fixed kin values were estimated from the time course of ag accumulation data from single agno3 accumulation tests then the internal ag concentrations and survival data in a single agno3 exposure were used to fit threshold and kk for the sd model or α and β for the it model further details on model parameterization are provided in the supporting information 2 6 5 model validation accumulation and survival of low and high concentration pvp agnps were respectively predicted by a tk td model based on single ag parameters fitted by single ag pulsed exposure data according to ag released from agnps we designed increasing ag pulsed concentrations furthermore the accumulation and survival of single ag pulsed concentrations were predicted by the aforementioned tk td model because a continuous time point pulse exposure experiment would be difficult perhaps impossible to perform we designed gradually increasing ag concentrations only at 24 48 72 and 96 h and we observed accumulation and survival at these time points however it is possible to simulate the theoretical accumulation and survival values of increasing ag concentrations at continuous time points 2 7 statistical analysis all treatments were repeated three times and each treatment was conducted in triplicate in each time i e n 3 3 which met the underlying assumptions of a normal distribution or approximately normal distribution to use the independent sample t test thus all experimental data are represented as means standard deviations to exclude the influence of the solvent on ag toxicity to larval zebrafish we conducted toxicity tests for the raw materials used in pvp agnp synthesis for details of quality assurance and quality control see the supporting information figs s2 s4 at each time point a mass balance was performed by taking into account agnp and total ag concentrations in exposure solution and body data were rejected if the sum of solutions and body metals varied by 10 from the initial concentration as ultratrace impurities would have a limited influence on the results we simplified our calculations by assuming that 100 of 107ag was from 107agnps in exposed larvae and solutions the concentrations of ag species e g ag and agcl aq in the exposure solutions were estimated using visual minteq version 3 0 http www2 lwr kth se english oursoftware vminteq through inputting the concentrations of k na ca2 mg2 cl no3 and so4 2 measured by ion chromatography ics 5000 thermo usa for example the distribution of each ag species in the 10 μg l ag in low ionic strength solution was shown in table s6 free ag was identified as the major ag species accounting for approximately 99 of all soluble ag species the larvae were placed and rinsed in ultrapure water for approximately 1 h prior to the toxicity test to ensure that feces was not produced to introduce extra dissolved organic carbon doc into the exposure solutions the background concentrations of nonessential ag in organisms were negligible the ph and measured dissolved concentrations of ag k na ca2 mg2 cl no3 and so4 2 in low ionic water were used as input parameters and the concentrations of free ag were inputs in tk td modeling the one compartment tk td model was implemented and solved in r 3 5 0 http www r project org first we found that single agno3 acute toxicity data from test zebrafish larvae constant and pulsed exposures respectively measured body residues and survival could be used and therefore produced a one compartment tk td model for single ag tk and td parameters for constant ag and pulsed ag were compared using spss 22 0 and independent sample t test p 0 05 second we determined how special cases of the one compartment tk model explained the ag data for low and high level pvp agnp accumulation and how special cases of the it and sd models explain the data for low and high level pvp agnp survival data in addition we found that the tk td model explained the accumulation and survival of larvae exposed to gradually increasing agno3 pulsed concentrations the model simulation values were compared with time course independent accumulation and toxicity data from zebrafish subjected to individual exposure systems at 6 24 48 72 and 96 h comparisons between the observed and modeled accumulations or survival rates were regressed through the 1 1 line with r 2 as the coefficient of dependence mean comparisons of ag concentrations in 92 0 μg l total ag of pvp agnp suspension with and without s9 solution was conducted using spss 22 0 according to independent sample t test n 3 3 p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanoparticle and exposure characterization the stock pvp agnps 101 82 mg l 1 were analyzed by two methods to provide two lines of evidence for primary particle size tem and hydrodynamic diameter dls the mean size of primary particles was 47 8 nm fig s5a including a 42 1 nm core agnp and 5 70 nm surface coating pvp fig s5b the hydrodynamic diameter was 53 3 2 30 nm at the beginning of exposure which was slightly smaller than the measured particle size 69 1 3 10 nm with a zeta potential of 5 82 mv and dispensability index pdi of 0 35 at 96 h fig s6a dls is a delicate method for detecting pvp coated nanoparticles it detects small amounts of large sized particles formed by agglomeration or aggregation which can cause ambiguity when determining particle sizes roemer et al 2011 therefore tem was also used to confirm that the particle sizes were not due to agglomerates dobrovolskaia et al 2009 in the present study tem revealed the particle to be compact spherical well dispersed and stable fig s6b shows absorption spectra for agnps all samples presented the characteristic surface plasmon of pvp agnps 42 1 nm pvp agnps present a narrow band with a peak absorbance of 418 nm transferred nanoparticle concentrations must therefore be determined in exposure solutions to confirm the toxicity of nanoparticles pradhan et al 2016 a capping agent such as pvp which promotes colloidal stability could enhance nanospecific effects because it makes aggregation and agglomeration less likely qi et al 2016 in this study the aggregation of 40 nm agnp could be mild and remain undetected or aggregation may be avoided altogether as pvp improves dispersion of agnps and prevents aggregation and agglomeration in addition the final concentrations of various metal nanoparticles have been reported at 30 80 of initial administered concentrations pradhan et al 2016 3 2 tk td processes for single constant and pulsed agno3 exposure the efflux of ag was fitted well by the one compartment tk model fig s7 during the first 24 h after depuration efflux was rapid the estimated kout was 3 30 0 704 10 2 h 1 for ag fig s7 table 1 after the initial 24 h of rapid elimination the retained metals were in slow efflux kout is similar to the efflux rate constants 0 031 0 043 h 1 reported in previous studies on metal biokinetics chen et al 2011 diez ortiz et al 2015 as shown in fig 2 a agno3 was present in the exposure water with an ag concentration of 10 0 μg l 1 during the 96 h period the one compartment tk model could fit the observed accumulation data well fig 2b the uptake rate constant kin was estimated at 1 92 0 412 10 2 l g 1 h 1 table 1 keeping these tk parameters kin and kout fixed the td parameters kk and cit were estimated from the survival data from toxicity tests over time the one compartment td model described the time process observed in the survival data well fig 2c for sd the parameters cit and kk were estimated at 2 53 0 271 g μg 1 h 1 and 0 480 0 0902 respectively for it α and β were estimated at 7 61 0 872 μg g 1 and 1 31 0 593 respectively table 1 fig 2d shows ag levels during the agno3 pulse exposure the uptake rate constant kin was estimated at 1 71 0 303 10 2 l g 1 h 1 via the one compartment tk model for sd the parameters cit and kk in the td model were estimated at 2 55 0 162 g μg 1 h 1 and 0 589 0 0511 respectively for it α and β were estimated at 6 80 0 433 μg g 1 and 1 77 0 170 respectively table 1 in general sd fitted constant and pulsed ag exposure better than it as indicated by r2 values table 1 in agno3 toxicity tests larvae would successively die which complied with the sd assumption that an organism had an increased probability to die other than it assumption that a certain fraction of the population could survive jager et al 2011 there was no significant difference independent sample t test p 0 05 between tk and td parameters for constant ag and pulsed ag respectively thus we used tk td parameters for pulsed ag to predict accumulation and toxicity of ag gradually released from pvp agnps in zebrafish larvae 3 3 bioaccumulation and toxicity of pvp agnps 3 3 1 dissolution kinetics of pvp agnps the low exposure concentration pvp agnp suspension ag at 92 0 μg l 1 showed increased concentrations of free ag in solution during the 96 h exposure fig 3 a herein variation of concentration of soluble ag species released from agnps was also computed by inputting concentrations of k na ca2 mg2 cl no3 and so4 2 in low ionic water into visualminteq free ag was identified as the major ag species accounting for approximately 99 of all soluble ag species dissolution reached a steady state after 72 h the dissolution rate k1 of pvp agnp was estimated by fitting free ag data using eq 1 and was 2 32 0 304 10 2 h 1 the precipitation rate k2 of pvp agnps was 9 50 2 52 10 3 h 1 during 96 h the time course dissolution of the high exposure concentration pvp agnp suspension ag at 255 μg l 1 was also validated fig 3b the first order dissolution dynamic process of the high concentration pvp agnp suspension was well fitted by eqs 1 and 2 with k1 at 2 94 0 717 10 2 h 1 and k2 at 1 95 0 403 10 2 h 1 r2 of 0 84 0 91 and 0 89 for total ag agnps and free ag respectively based on the assumption of primary particle size assuming spherical particles using stokes formula eq s1 we calculated the theoretical precipitation distance of the agnp suspension as 1 0 mm during the 96 h exposure the precipitation in pvp agnps was not significant during this exposure period as indicated by the consistent turbidity of pvp agnps over 96 h as shown in figs s8 s11 the turbidity of the pvp agnp suspension changed slightly during the 96 h period we found that the actual concentration of pvp agnps was 80 that of the initial concentration after 96 h the pvp agnp dissolution rate constants for pvp agnp suspensions with ag at 92 0 or 255 μg l 1 were within the range of dissolution rates from 11 values 0 00047 0 017 h 1 from two previous studies dobias and bernier latmani 2013 kittler et al 2010 but greater than the mean value fig s12 all data and references are provided in table s6 which was attributed to that ag release from pvp agnp occurred in low ionic strength water rather than ultrapure water it was reported that the increasing of ionic strength e g na and cl could promote on the dissolution of agnp zhao et al 2021 in addition in this study the two dissolution rates were dependent on the original concentration of agnps as also reported previously pradhan et al 2016 3 3 2 tk and td processes of pvp agnps to determine distribution patterns of agnps in zebrafish larvae the tissue distribution of accumulated low concentration pvp agnps ag at 92 0 μg l 1 was observed by tem fig s13 the bioaccumulation of agnps was detected in the gills and intestines of exposed larvae but not in the control animals suggesting that agnps accumulated in these two organs from which they could be passed to the blood and transported to other organs for both low and high concentration pvp agnp suspensions ag at 92 0 and 255 μg l 1 respectively agnps were bioaccumulated in the gas bladders of larvae fig 4 b c e and f the presence of agnps in the gills was confirmed by tem slicing and energy dispersive x ray point analysis fig 4h i from which ag cl p and s were confirmed to be present after the larvae were transferred to fresh ultrapure water the agnps in body were eliminated faster than ag but there was no obvious difference in the amounts of them retained at the end of exposure fig s14 agnps were retained at about 5 levels in the body whereas ag were retained at about 22 levels in the body in the gills of zebrafish larvae pvp agnps were seemingly combined with enzymes proteins and some anions as indicated by the cl p and s signals originating from the surroundings of ag nanoparticles yan et al 2018 which occurred within 24 h of the initial exposure and extended to 96 h in previous studies daphnia magna santos rasera et al 2019 and prochilodus lineatus ale et al 2018 were shown to take up nanomaterials from test solutions thus aquatic organisms especially filter feeding copepods such as d magna could be at risk of bioaccumulation following exposure to nanoparticles as shown in fig 5 a for the low concentration exposure agno3 was present in the exposure solution with ag at 4 40 μg l 1 during 0 6 h 6 66 μg l 1 during 6 24 h 12 3 μg l 1 during 24 48 h 15 4 μg l 1 during 48 72 h and 17 8 μg l 1 during 72 96 h pvp agnps were present in the exposure solution with agnp at 86 8 0 803 μg l 1 and free ag major species in soluble ag present at 4 40 0 522 μg l 1 at the beginning silver was not detected in the control solution fig 5a also shows that during a 96 h exposure to 42 nm pvp agnps with a concentration of 86 8 μg l 1 larvae continuously accumulated agnps over time fig 5b at the end of the 96 h exposure total ag agnps and ag i in larvae exceeded 13 2 0 243 11 8 0 450 and 7 90 0 404 μg g 1 respectively as shown in fig 5d for the high concentration exposure agno3 was present in the exposure solution with ag at 6 02 μg l 1 during 0 6 h 12 7 μg l 1 during 6 24 h 15 0 μg l 1 during 24 48 h 18 3 μg l 1 during 48 72 h and 27 3 μg l 1 during 72 96 h pvp agnps were present in the exposure solution with agnp at 251 1 32 μg l 1 and free ag major species in soluble ag present at 6 02 0 504 μg l 1 at the beginning again silver was not detected in the control water fig 5d shows that during a 96 h exposure to 42 nm pvp agnps with 251 μg l 1 of agnp increased ag accumulation was observed over observed and modeled time courses in zebrafish larvae fig 5e in agnp treatments the internal ag i concentration and exposure time increased before and eventually reached equilibrium after approximately 72 h in the organisms the highest concentrations of ag i after 96 h were 30 8 0 406 μg g 1 following exposure to pvp agnps and 9 90 1 00 μg g 1 following exposure to pulsed agno3 treatment in both the low and high concentration agnp exposures time course data of the internal ag i concentration during the uptake and elimination processes were well described by eq 4 fig 5b and e respectively in both cases the tk model was statistically significant p 0 05 and could satisfactorily explain the observed internal ag i concentrations for the low concentration exposure the r2 and rmse for ag i accumulations from virtually pulsed agno3 treatments were 0 81 and 1 15 respectively and from pulsed agno3 treatments were 0 92 and 0 73 respectively for the high concentration exposure the r2 and rmse for ag i accumulation from virtually pulsed agno3 treatment were 0 90 and 0 17 respectively and for pulsed agno3 treatment were 0 95 and 0 12 respectively the tk predicted internal ag i concentrations for virtually pulsed agno3 were obviously higher than that for pulsed agno3 treatment and observed internal ag i concentrations for pulsed agno3 treatment rmse for virtually pulsed agno3 was much larger than that for pulsed agno3 treatment the rmse for the low agnp concentrations 1 15 and 0 73 was higher than the high agnp concentrations 0 17 and 0 12 which was possibly due to the suitable tk td parameters estimated by using higher pulsed gradient 5 30 μg l agno3 data in both exposure cases agnps released more ag into zebrafish larvae than single ag pulsed exposure and the virtually simulated accumulation values of increasing ag concentrations at continuous time points in our study agnps released almost twice as many ag in zebrafish larvae compared with the levels observed in a single ag exposure system similarly in vivo study of hepg2 and a549 cells showed that proportions of 107ag 109ag and ratios of 107ag to total 107ag in cells gradually elevated after the beginning of exposure yu et al 2019 indicating the action of a trojan horse type mechanism i e agnps released ag after internalization where ag concentrations after passing through 3 kda membranes millipore were detected by icp ms previous studies have speculated that agnps toxicity was attributed to this trojan horse type mechanism de matteis et al 2015 hsiao et al 2015 furthermore agnps absorbed on cell membrane surface are known to continue releasing ag and further forming inorganic ag s complexes extracellularly whereas ag organosulfur complexes are primarily formed intracellularly zhang et al 2020 ag release reached equilibrium in pvp agnp suspensions with ag at 255 μg l after approximately 72 h consistent with a previous report wang and wang 2014 for both the low and high concentration exposures the survival rates of zebrafish larvae decreased over time after exposure to agno3 and pvp agnps respectively fig 5c and f respectively indeed larval mortality rapidly increased after 24 h of ag exposure in both exposure cases the survival rates were well predicted using the td sd model and estimated parameters threshold and kk listed in table 1 p 0 05 the survival rates described by the td sd model were in good agreement with the observed values in the low concentration exposure fig 5c the r2 and rmse for ag toxicity from agnps were 0 90 and 0 09 respectively and from pulsed agno3 treatment were 0 95 and 0 03 respectively the r2 and rmses for ag toxicity from virtually pulsed agno3 treatment were 0 91 and 0 06 respectively and from pulsed agno3 treatment were 0 95 and 0 03 respectively in the high concentration exposure fig 5f the r2 and rmse for ag toxicity from agnps were 0 93 and 0 06 respectively and from pulsed agno3 treatment were 0 96 and 0 03 respectively the r2 and rmse for ag toxicity from virtually pulsed agno3 treatment were 0 93 and 0 06 respectively and from pulsed agno3 treatment were 0 96 and 0 03 respectively in both exposure scenarios the survival rates of larvae exposed to agnps were lower than those of larvae exposed to pulsed agno3 treatments and the virtually simulated survival values of increasing ag concentrations at continuous time points however for both exposure cases the survival rates predicted by the td it model were not consistent with the observed values r2 and rmse values were lower and higher respectively fig s15a b the difference in the survivorship between pulsed agno3 and agnp exposure scenarios can be attributed to the enhanced localized or intracellular dissolution of the agnps when present in solution with larvae compared to just ag alone fig 5c and f the predicted toxicity of ag was in agreement with the actual toxicity observed in the exposure system thus the toxicity contribution of agnps toward zebrafish larvae can be largely attributed to their enhanced localized or intracellular release of ag nevertheless it remains unclear to what extent and by which mechanism the dissolved ag contributes to agnp toxicity mostly because an appropriate analytical method is currently lacking for quantitatively distinguish agnp toxicity and soluble ag toxicity as the appearance of agnp was always accompanied by ag however the results of our tk td modeling combined with our ag pulsed exposure method now demonstrate the extent to which dissolved ag contributes to agnp toxicity our model considers the combined ion particle mechanism because the particle needs to be present in the organisms to have increased localized intracellular ionization 3 4 liver s9 fraction and pvp agnps in vitro as shown in fig s16b and c subcellular s9 fractions might cause the pvp coated ag particles to remove the capping agents the removing ration of 0 63 shown in fig s17 and favor the release of many ag as indicated by increased ag levels over 96 h in s9 solution that included the low concentration pvp agnp suspension ag at 92 0 μg l 1 fig s18 there were significant differences p 0 05 in ag release between pvp agnp with s9 fraction group and without s9 fraction group at 72 and 96 h other than 24 and 48 h thus another piece of evidence showed that agnp taking off pvp was liable to release ag and further the ag caused observed toxicity in addition s9 fraction alone was not responsible for the double higher accumulated ag i concentrations in agnp exposures than agno3 exposure fig 5b whereas ag release did not double when s9 fraction was included fig s18 combined with elemental composition around ag particle by edx s was mainly confirmed to be present fig s19 we speculated that subcellular fractions s9 had thiol groups sh inclined to strongly bind with ag wetzel et al 2021 whereas ag organosulfur complexes are primarily formed intracellularly zhang et al 2020 however we did not quantify the change in ligand density of ag particles before and after incubation with the s9 fractions future studies will use a much more convincing and robust technique involving nuclear magnetic resonance nmr to quantitatively determine ligand loss to further verify that pvp coating is quantitatively lost based on our results we propose two possible mechanisms of ag internalization 1 the direct uptake of ag released by agnps 2 s9 components stimulate the losing pvp coating of agnps the dissolution of agnps occurred after taking off the coating or at the same time in a previous study oyster larvae directly ingested particulate ag in vivo dissolution of agnps occurred and the nanoparticles were less bioavailable than ag while intracellular ag mostly obtained from soluble ag especially that which was originated from ingested agnps zhang et al 2020 taken together these findings suggest that agnps enter the larvae after which the oxidative dissolution process leads to internalization of ag across the cell membrane and ultimately translocation between tissues for our findings tks suggest that intracellular dissolution of agnps occurs in organisms whereas tds indicate a similar intracellular active portion of internalized ag most likely as ag which interacts with the relevant cellular metal homeostasis together with cellular targets to produce toxic effects this does not preclude that some ag exists as nanoparticle form in organisms but it indicates that potentially internalized nanoparticles make less contribution to certain direct or specific toxic effects we can conclude that dissolved ag causes a substantial proportion of the mortality observed in fish after exposed to pvp agnp on the contrary transcriptional analysis of fathead minnows after exposure to pvp agnps has shown that a great number of possible biological and toxicological pathways in both the brain and liver differ from those pathways in fish after exposure to agno3 indicating that not all toxic effects are due to ag released from pvp agnps however there was no direct evidence that pvp agnps existed as particles rather than ag in target organs garcia reyero et al 2014 our method for dosing in ag i equivalent to localized intracellular dissolution of agnp is needed further research is necessary to elucidate the contributions of each np property e g size and shape and would be most productively pursued by using the same experimental conditions that have successfully demonstrated the ability to distinguish ion and particle toxicity contributions given that np size and shape is known to influence surface reactivity and physical interactions with organisms bao et al 2018 particle size is a topic deserving investigation that could provide insightful contributions to resolving the ion and particle mechanisms 4 conclusions the toxicity of agnp has been studied in a number of aquatic organisms fabrega et al 2011 tortella et al 2020 however whether these toxicities were caused by the agnps themselves the ag released from the agnps or both is currently debatable choi et al 2008 zhang and wang 2019 we directly quantified the existence of ag investigated the dissolution kinetics of agnps and determined the dissolution process of ag in zebrafish larvae based on a novel pulsed ag exposure method our study finds direct evidence for agnp induced toxicity largely originating from dissolved ag from the original agnps moreover it is well known that agnp continuously releases ag increasing ag concentration in the actual exposure system regardless of the laboratory or the natural environment and we proposed a pulsed ag agno3 exposure to simulate increasing ag concentration a key question challenging the risk assessment of agnps is whether their risk effects are driven by the same mechanism of toxic action that is due to ag artal et al 2020 shao and wang 2020 our study provides a framework by which to quantify the toxicity contribution of dissolved ag to agnp toxicity via a developed tk td model for larval survival the contribution of ag toxicity was the key factor in our tk td model of agnp toxicity additional in vitro and in vivo studies should explore the potential similarities and differences in sublethal toxicity endpoints which should also be considered when using the tk td model for toxicity assessment taken together our results indicate that a combination of in vivo exposures in vitro assays and in silico tools can be used to effectively assess the environmental and human related risks of nanoparticles declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they havcone no known competing

16669,wastewater treatment a major issue at the european level focuses on improving surface water and groundwater quality preserving the receiving environment and ensuring a sustainable use of water soil infiltration is increasingly practiced downstream of wastewater treatment plants particularly in rural areas without surface water bodies as is the use of soil as an additional buffer and treatment step however the design of infiltration areas on heterogeneous soils remains an extremely complex task due to the costly and time consuming spatial measurement of saturated hydraulic conductivity ks this article proposes integrating 2d electrical resistivity tomography and infiltration tests into a bayesian maximum entropy method yielding a vertical mapping of soil heterogeneities at a metric scale this updated method will facilitate infiltration area design in a heterogeneous soil setting graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater treatment plant design bayesian maximum entropy saturated hydraulic conductivity electrical resistivity tomography infiltration test 1 introduction despite the advances achieved in wastewater treatment plants over the last few decades treated wastewater tww can still exert a strong impact on downstream receiving rivers aubertheau et al 2017 this is especially true in french rural areas where treatment plants are mainly dedicated to treating carbonaceous pollution due to their small capacities 1000 population equivalent medde 2015 consequently the application of an extensive process like soil infiltration has become increasingly practiced as an option to provide tertiary treatment it consists of tww discharge over a large surface area trenches ponds basins or meadows allowing for gradual infiltration through the soil the pollutants nitrogen and phosphorus are naturally treated by biodegradation processes or retained in the soil the design and management of a tww infiltration area is mainly based on an estimation of the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ks in order to calculate the discharge capacity and evaluate its treatment potential siegrist 2014 however ks remains one of the most difficult soil properties to determine mahapatra et al 2020 and its spatial variability can significantly influence tww infiltration zhang et al 2019 infiltration tests are usually carried out using the porchet constant head method which outputs direct and local measurements of ks and requires 1 to 4 hours per test depending on the soil type for heterogeneous soils the estimation of ks requires numerous measurements to establish confident predictions of tww discharge warrick et al 1977 this protocol can prove to be invasive and time consuming nevertheless an incorrect estimations of ks could lead to malfunctions in the tww infiltration areas via i premature clogging mckinley and siegrist 2011 ii over infiltration and groundwater contamination and iii under infiltration leading to puddling and olfactory nuisances morugán coronado et al 2011 for the estimation of ks variability bisone et al 2017 proposed using geophysical methods on tww infiltration areas with a subjective delineation of heterogeneity in order to locate a few infiltration tests for an optimal design geophysical methods allow visualizing soil structures through the measurement of a given physical parameter wave speed electrical resistivity er elasticity romero ruiz et al 2018 such methods are non intrusive and yield physical information on large soil volumes yet still involve significant uncertainties loke et al 2013 in the environmental sciences for near surface 0 2 m investigations electrical resistivity tomography ert is a widely used method whenever 2d vertical information is required hellman et al 2017 the er signal is a function of a number of soil properties including the nature of solid constituents particle size and distribution the arrangement of voids porosity pore size distribution connectivity water content the er of the fluid and the temperature samouëlian et al 2005 telford et al 1990 on the other hand the er signal has no direct dependence on ks attwa and ali 2018 weller and slater 2019 their physical relationship tends to be specific to the given soil type and is difficult to transpose directly to heterogeneous soils doussan and ruy 2009 only a few articles have explored the notion of using ert to determine soil ks with er two approaches were found to be extremely attractive the first employs empirical relationships between er and ks vogelgesang et al 2020 while the second adds a hydrodynamic model constrained by geophysics during the inversion process farzamian et al 2015 the former is a simple method yet still generates a high level of ks estimation uncertainty whereas the latter is probably the most robust method but requires an extensive numerical approach and tends not to be well adapted to tww infiltration area design the 2d estimation of ks from geophysical measurements and point measurements necessitates the use of other emerging methods for simple and robust applications e g data fusion methods dezert et al 2019 li et al 2019 data fusion refers to the process of integrating multiple data sources in order to produce more accurate and useful information until now no paper has yet to be published regarding data fusion between ert and ks among all data fusion methods bayesian maximum entropy bme seems to be the best adapted method bme is a nonlinear spatial estimator that rigorously accounts for spatial variability and the non gaussian characteristic of uncertain data here uncertainty is represented by a variance the powerful bme method of modern spatiotemporal geostatistics christakos et al 2002 provides a non linear and non gaussian extension to classical linear geostatistics that is not limited by this linear constraint in comparison to the others methods bme is a general approach that does not make any assumptions regarding the linearity of the estimator the normality of the underlying probability laws or the homogeneity of the spatial distribution considering the dataset the bme method of spatial analysis and mapping provides precise rules of incorporating priori information infiltration data reliable but sparse soft data and ert data dense with high uncertainty soft data christakos et al 2002 showed that bme is a relevant method for predicting spatial data encompassing several environmental parameters for instance it has been successfully used to predict water table variations d or et al 2001 and estimate soil salinity douaik et al 2005 these examples suggest that the bme method is suitable to estimate 2d ks maps the aim of this paper is to merge ks and ert measurements in order to obtain the most accurate estimation of ks thus providing new tww infiltration area design elements 2 materials and methods the methodology adopted herein to evaluate the benefit of bme is based on a classical approach widely used in the geophysical literature radulescu et al 2007 it is composed of three steps the first step consists of constructing synthetic datasets based on three synthetic ks reference models k s r e f and then simulating the ert measurements and infiltration tests for each model the second step adapts evaluates and determines the bme method limits by means of the synthetic datasets created in the previous step through defining the optimal number of hard data points 14 24 or 50 for a homogeneous water content wc of 0 25 m3 m 3 validating a robust sampling strategy of hard data assessing the impact of soil moisture variation in the model the third step validates the bme method on a field dataset 2 1 synthetic datasets the synthetic datasets generated from k s r e f fig 1 a are organized into both hard and soft data soft data generation consists of simulating the geophysical measurement and deriving hydraulic conductivity denoted k s geo from ert fig 1b hard data on the other hand are local estimations of ks sampled directly from k s r e f these data correspond to a simulation of the infiltration tests fig 1c as for k s geo the first step entails simulating soil wc based on groundwater flow modeling which will provide a realistic soil wc data distribution sectioni in taking wc and soil type into account petrophysical relationships drawn from the literature will be used to calculate true electrical resistivity e r true sectionii and simulate apparent electrical resistivity e r app for each ks model section a next we will invert e r app data to obtain interpreted electrical resistivity e r interp section b lastly e r interp data will be transformed into k s geo data section 2 3 fig 2 shows the synthetic dataset for synthetic soils models 1 2 and 3 generated following this strategy the three columns in each figure represent respectively models 1 2 and 3 the rows present the following a l o g 10 k s r e f b wc c l o g 10 e r t r u e d l o g 10 e r a p p and e l o g 10 e r i n t e r p in fig 2 row a presents three different k s r e f anomalies shown with a metric horizontal extension these three models have been chosen based on various criteria the first model is a field case presented in an article bisone et al 2017a devoted to the study of an infiltration site the two other geological configurations are known to be difficult to reconstruct using ert telford et al 1990 in the bme framework all data are introduced in log10 for computational purposes 2 2 1 soft data generation 2 2 1 1 subsurface flow modeling water content estimation according to fig 1b the first soft data generation step calls for wc simulation using subsurface flow modeling for variably saturated soils as suggested in audebert et al 2016 we will employ a single continuum model based on richard s equation richards 1931 completed with mualem van genuchten s retention model which expresses the relationship between water pressure and effective saturation retention properties as well as between relative ks and effective saturation to simulate tww subsurface flow we ran comsol multiphysics 5 4 with a subsurface flow module the study domain is a 2d vertical profile 29 2 m long and 6 m high the water flow boundary conditions were set as follows i no flow on the top and sides and ii seepage face for the bottom as in audebert et al 2016 to assign all hydraulic parameters we extracted from the literature 12 soil types with known parameters considering lo g 10 k s r e f for each cell in table 1 we sought the ks corresponding to the closest k s r e f value and assigned the remaining hydraulic parameters θs α and n to simulate subsurface flow with variable soil saturation the model was initialized to the total saturation soil water content equals the soil porosity during a requisite time interval the model was left to simulate soil drainage until the water table was close to 4 m deep this value was chosen so that the given configuration could be considered free of any water table influence on the infiltration test within the first 2 m of soil a variable time step from a few seconds to a few hours is used to allow a better optimization of the hydrodynamic simulation the simulation lasted approximately 6 hours depending on the model this set up produced variable 2d wc maps for the constant wc model we simply chose a value of 0 25 m3 m 3 during the ert monitoring when the water content is low it is difficult to measure accurately the soil electrical resistivity due to the low circulation of the electric current in the soil moreover when the soil water content lies close to saturation the measured electrical resistivity is dominated by that of the water however when the soil water content is between these two limit values we can see the spatial contrast in soil electrical resistivity in this study we set the soil water content value to 0 25 this value is close to the field capacity that we could meet in the field after a period without rain for the rest of the paper the bme is tested on a constant wc model wc 0 25 and then on a variable wc model 2 2 1 2 petrophysical relationship just a few articles in the literature include the petrophysical relationship in determining ks with the true electrical resistivity of soil e r true vogelgesang et al 2020 soil wc can be considered as the most influential parameter on e r true it is necessary therefore to take the variability of wc and ks into account in the relationship to generate synthetic 2d electrical resistivity datasets to evaluate bme method fig 2c according to the literature potential physical relationships between er and wc are specific to a given soil type brunet et al 2010 for this study we introduced an empirical relationship e r ref to estimate the true electrical resistivity e r true first we search and extracted well documented wc and er pairs measured in the laboratory for broad sandy loamy and clayey soil textures wunderlich et al 2013 second each texture is associated with specific l o g 10 k s values of 4 7 and 10 respectively mallants et al 2003 third to cover the full range of l o g 10 k s with a 0 2 resolution a 2d interpolated map of e r ref was estimated as a function of ks and wc which were derived from the 3 soil types fig 3 forth to estimate e r true for each cell of the model the closest wc and l o g 10 k s values are sought in e r ref fig 3 the found value is assigned to this cell the result is presented in the c row the empirical relation between l o g 10 e r r e f wc and ks is valid in the case of an unsaturated zone this hypothesis makes the relationship independent of other soil properties such as ph and the content of exchangeable anions moreover the sizing is performed before the design of infiltration areas for tww so the effect of tww on infiltration is not taken into account 2 2 1 3 electrical resistivity tomography the ert measurement has been well described in the geophysical literature clement et al 2020 e r app is measured by injecting electric current into the ground with two current electrodes in measuring the potential difference between two other electrodes this device is called a quadrupole the distribution of er in the soil is determined by operating many quadrupoles at various positions along a line of electrodes installed at the surface of the soil at the end of the measurement sequence all quadrupoles are inverted using an inversion code telford et al 1990 2 2 1 3 1 forward modeling to simulate e r app on each of the three synthetic er models c we ran the comsol multiphysics and matlab f3dm 3 08 package which is commonly used in geophysics forward modeling with the ac dc module quasi stationary electromagnetic field in accordance with electromagnetic field theory to evaluate the potential difference induced by the injected current clement and moreau 2016 a gaussian noise distribution with a 3 standard deviation relative error was added to the e r app dataset to simulate the noise commonly recorded in the field friedel 2003 an acquisition line of 72 electrodes was implemented at a 0 4 m spacing a complete sequence of 829 quadrupoles was carried out with wenner arrays 2 2 1 3 2 inversion procedure the synthetic e r app was inverted using pygimli an open source multi method library for geophysics modeling and inversion rücker et al 2017 a finite element method relying on regular grid models was applied to solve the forward problem in the routine inversion program an isotropic smoothness constrained regularization and a quasi gauss newton optimization method were both used along with a fixed regularization parameter λ 30 zweight 1 0 this inversion procedure produced an e r interp map günther and rücker 2011 2 2 1 3 3 uncertainties an interpreted ert is not the perfect image of e r true the smooth nature of electrical current implies a loss of resolution when moving away from the electrodes this is due to both the character of the method which measures variations of apparent electrical resistivity from the surface and the current image reconstruction tools which use algorithms that produce smoothed contours in some parts of the inverted model the er value of a cell has a very low impact on the measured e r app it is therefore of paramount importance to account for the uncertainty on ert the total uncertainty of er depends on the inversion process the measured data and the loss of information with depth calculating total uncertainty is a long and complex process consequently it is proposed herein to estimate uncertainty by means of simple inversion indicators derived from the geophysical literature namely coverage resolution radius friedel 2003 or doi d carrière et al 2014 all inversion indicator calculations require knowledge of the fréchet derivative matrix g n m also called the jacobian matrix or sensitivity matrix eq 1 1 g i j d i m j i 1 n j 1 m where d i and m j are the e r app data and model parameter respectively a single sensitivity value g i j indicates the change in apparent resistivity data d i m with respect to a small change in model parameter m j g is used to determine how a change in resistivity of model cell j affects the measured value of d i in our case we have opted for model resolution r m where the r m matrix is calculated by inversion software according to the following formula eq 2 günther 2004 2 r m g t w d t w d g λ c t c 1 g t w d t w d g where g is the sensitivity matrix w d a diagonal matrix containing the data errors λ the damping parameter and c the a priori model covariance matrix the diagonal element r ii indicates how the inverted model of er is resolved if all diagonal elements of r m equal 1 then the exact model is perfectly resolved the further the r m diagonal element from 1 the poorer the resolution in accordance with the ideas of friedel 2003 a resolution radius for each model cell can be determined from the diagonal elements of the resolution matrix r ii let s assume a piecewise constant cell resolution with r ies i as the radius of a cell circle having a perfect resolution of 1 for a cell of dimensions δ x i and i δ z i the resolution radius is defined by eq 3 below 3 r res i δ x i δ z i π r ii the resolution matrix r res allows assessing the reliability of the inverted models according to the degree of resolution specific to each cell r res is therefore the most suitable indicator for unstructured or irregular bert meshes for this reason r res has been chosen as an uncertainty to be introduced into the bme section 2 3 2 1 2 hard data generation hydraulic conductivity sampling method for synthetic soil models 1 2 and 3 we have sampled synthetic hard data l o g 10 k s h by extracting the l o g 10 k s l value from l o g 10 k s ref fig 2a it is assumed that our measurements of l o g 10 k s h have a zero variance we used e r interp data and a random selection technique to optimize the ks sample location as per the following strategy 50 of the number of points were manually sampled above and below the anomalies 25 of the points were sampled in the upper part of the e r interp map where r res has low uncertainty our e r interp maps were divided into three ranges between the min and max values in each range an equivalent number of points were randomly sampled 25 were sampled in the area with the lowest r res these points were sampled entirely randomly owing to the poor performance of ert in this area for this step the spatialization of ks using bme method has been tested with three differing sample numbers i e 14 24 and 50 these values were selected because the strategy applied here required at least 8 points beyond 50 points on the other hand the improvement was no longer significant results not shown moreover more than 50 values is not realistic for characterizing an infiltration area as the sampling would take too long regarding the minimum value below 14 samples the correlation coefficient is no longer satisfactory results not shown 2 2 field data 2 2 1 soft data measurements the experimental site is located in france and had already been studied in previous articles benz navarrete et al 2019 it comprises a fairly heterogeneous agricultural plot and is relatively tabular in its sandy loam surface presenting sandy lenses in loam over its depth ert acquisitions were carried out using iris instruments syscal pro 72 electrodes resistivity meter iris instruments france the ert profile was acquired with a wenner array type and a 0 25 m electrode spacing to cover the proposed profile length 45 m and maintain reasonable subsurface lateral resolution the roll along acquisition technique was performed with 48 electrode overlaps the contact resistance was continuously measured at less than 4 kohms the 2d image of the e r interp profile was inverted with the pygimli software rücker et al 2017 a 2d flat inversion was carried out we chose an isotropic smoothness constraint with a z weight of 1 and a lambda value of 30 günther 2004 loke 1999 moreover we used a tetrahedral mesh with 2 920 cells 2 2 2 hard data measurements according to the sampling strategy presented in the previous section we select 23 infiltration test locations the aardvark permeameter developed by soil moisture inc usa was used to measure the infiltration rate from the measured flow rate l o g 10 k s could be estimated by applying reynolds and elrick s equation elrick et al 1989 the procedure consists in manually drilling a hole with augers to the depth at which the test is to be performed then a measurement probe is inserted inside the hole connected by a pipe to a water tank this probe provides a constant hydraulic pressure during the test the water tank is placed on a scale while water is infiltrating into the soil the weight of the tank is measured at constant time intervals the test stops when the weight change between two measurements remains constant indicating the achievement of the steady state regime the elementary volume of the infiltration test measurements is 0 15 m3 2 3 bme fusion method the bayesian maximum entropy bme method and its bmelib numerical implementation christakos et al 2002 serre and christakos 1999 provide a mathematically rigorous framework that incorporates information from several data sources featuring different uncertainties and point densities these data have been organized into both hard data corresponding to exact measurements and soft data with a given uncertainty the spatial random field y x z lo g 10 k s x z indicates lo g 10 k s of the soil at location x z where x m is the longitudinal coordinate along our study transect and z m the depth y h y s and y k denote y at the hard data points where y h is obtained from geotechnical measurements the soft data points where y s is derived from ert and petrophysical relationships and the estimation point respectively bme relies on two principles i maximum entropy theory processes the general knowledge base of means and covariances g m y co v y and produces a prior f g pdf probability density function describing the spatial process and ii epistemic bayesian conditioning updates this prior f g pdf with the site specific knowledge base s which then yields a bme posterior pdf f k describing the value y k at any estimation point here s y h f s where y h lo g 10 k s h x z is the measurement of the hard geotechnical data and f s is a pdf describing the uncertainty associated with soft geophysical data moreover the bme posterior pdf is given by 4 f k y k a f g y h y s y k f s y s d y s where a is a normalization constant the mean m y of field y x z is set to a first degree polynomial while the covariance co v y is obtained by fitting an anisotropic covariance model to experimental covariance values calculated from the y h data a covariance model quantifies the degree of similarity between pairs of measurements in terms of their separation distance and the orientation of the line between such pairs see chils and delfiner 1999 for details on how covariance models describe the variability of spatial processes also olea 2006 provided details on fitting a covariance model to experimental covariance values obtained from a covariogram analysis in this study the experimental covariance values are calculated based on a sample size of y h measurements the anisotropy model fitted to these experimental covariance values is assumed to be exponential with a major direction aligned with the x longitudinal axis and a ratio of covariance ranging along the major direction over the covariance ranging along the transverse direction the soft data pdf f s y s is obtained by transforming lo g 10 e r interp into lo g 10 k s geo mastrocicco et al 2010 proposed a log linear relationship between er and ks hence the need for a linear regression of the observed lo g 10 k s geo with respect to their corresponding lo g 10 e r interp then for each node of the inversion grid where a lo g 10 e r interp is available but for which lo g 10 k s h was not measured we set f s y s to a gaussian pdf with a mean equal to the value predicted by linear regression y s lo g 10 k s g e o however for bme to work efficiently we must set the variance σ s 2 x z of f s y s to a value that captures the uncertainty in the y s obtained from lo g 10 e r interp at location x z 5 σ s 2 x z r res x z mean r res σ y h 2 z mean z σ z 2 this can be accomplished by using the following where r res x z is the resolution radius section c mean r res x z its mean σ y h 2 the variance of y h z the absolute value of depth mean z its mean and σ z 2 a parameter obtained by maximizing the r 2 of validation as explained in previous section the terms r res x z mean r res and z mean z are unitless while both σ y h 2 and σ z 2 have units of lo g 10 m s 1 2 the first term ineq 5 is equal to the resolution radius normalized to a variance while the second term is a gradient with depth also normalized to a variance combined these two terms allow the bme to account for the fact that the uncertainty in the soft geophysical data increases with both r res and depth 2 4 bme validation strategy we adopted a validation strategy to compare the estimation error of three methods kriging of the hard data alone geophysics i e geophysical data alone and bme i e fusion of both hard data and geophysical data for the numerical simulations we computed the estimation error by comparing the estimated ks with lo g 10 k s r e f our field study was limited to lo g 10 k s h at nh sampled locations in which case we conducted a cross validation analysis lee et al 2009 the validation statistics used to assess model performance were mean square estimation error mse mean estimation error me variance of estimation error ve and square of the pearson correlation coefficient r² christensen 2018 3 results 3 1 numerical approach 3 1 1 evaluation of hard data number

where l o g 10 k s h has been sampled equals 10 24 and 50 respectively the rows offer the following row 1 lo g 10 k s ref row 2 lo g 10 e r interp data the black circles indicate the sampling

summarize the following statistical tools mse me ve and r² applied to evaluate the performance of these estimation methods 3 1 1 1 synthetic soil of model 1 fig 4b 3 shows the lo g 10 e r interp map for a 50 point sampling nh 50 conducted on a two layer soil the surface displays an initial layer depth 0 2 5 m with an estimated lo g 10 e r interp of 1 8 two anomalies are present in this layer at x 5 m and 22 m the synthetic reference model fig 4a shows two anomalies with the same thickness whereas the anomalies are deformed and stretched downward in fig 4b at depth the layer with lo g 10 e r interp of 1 4 is more reduced than that in the reference model it starts at the x 2 5 m position and disappears at the x 17 m position in fig 4c 3 the lo g 10 k s geo distribution is very similar to the lo g 10 e r interp map in fig 4d 3 the result of kriging based solely on lo g 10 k s h reveals a highly smoothed map however the bme results lie closest to the reference model the surface anomalies are in the correct position and the shape of the anomaly is closer to reality fig 4f 3 reducing the number of samples to 24 hard data lo g 10 k s h produces no noticeable change in the proposed lo g 10 k s geo map kriging is more likely to overwhelm the anomalies the bme fusion method provides an attractive lo g 10 k s bme estimate with a reasonable number of samples let s note that reducing the number of points at depth reduces resolution of the anomaly at the position x 10 m and z 3 5 m the 14 sampling points are insufficient to cover all anomalies which obviously influences the kriging results and geophysical transformation by the empirical law therefore the bme fusion method is closest to the reference model indeed the bme is capable of delineating large sand anomalies yet it tends to underestimate the extent of the clay anomaly at depth this finding can be explained by the lack of resolution of the ert method at depth where information from soft data is less reliable fig 4e and g exhibit the variance for both the kriging and bme methods the information given by the σ krig 2 map is weak for data close to the ks hard value σ bme 2 is minimized compared to σ krig 2 all visual results have been confirmed by error estimators which are more efficient for the bme 3 1 1 1 1 synthetic soil of model 2 fig 5 shows the spatialization of lo g 10 ks fig 5b 3 presents the lo g 10 e r interp map and estimated lo g 10 k s h for 50 sampling points in fig 5c 3 lo g 10 k s geo reveals the three clay anomalies on the surface but the silty anomaly is not apparent the clay anomalies are stretched towards the bottom in fig 5d 3 kriging serves to identify the four anomalies however even with such a large sample kriging merges the two near surface anomalies at the position x 16 m in fig 5f 3 the anomalies are correctly delineated with bme we can observe that kriging deteriorates and merges the anomalies bme would appear to be better with 24 points than with 50 because the loam anomaly is more sharply defined with 24 points in reality this outcome is due to the differentiation in the selected sampling points more specifically with a minimal number of 14 ks hard data results maintain the same trend as with 50 and 24 points table 3 shows that for 50 lo g 10 k s h sampling points the bme method slightly improves the estimation result in terms of correlation r² 0 82 for nh 14 vs r² 0 84 for nh 50 and targeting mse around 0 3 the increase in number of samples from 14 to 24 points degrades the kriging estimate in terms of correlation this trend is linked to the random sampling that in this case has selected points of lesser interest regardless of the number of samples the r² calculation demonstrates that bme once again produces the highest value in this second model 3 1 1 1 2 synthetic soil of model 3 fig 6 presents the results of the spatialization of lo g 10 k s for 50 points fig 6b 3 lo g 10 e r interp indicates the presence of two sand anomalies with a lo g 10 e r interp of 2 and one loam anomaly with a lo g 10 e r interp of 1 7 meanwhile ert does not show the deep clay layer in fig 6c 3 lo g 10 k s geo follows the lo g 10 e r interp map the kriging result in fig 6d 3 exposes a deep loam layer with well delimited anomalies at the surface however the method tends to merge anomalies the bme results in fig 6f 3 clearly identify the 3 anomalies as well as the loamy layer with 24 points kriging fig 6d 2 of the surface anomaly is merged the near surface anomalies and deep layer are well distinguished in fig 6g 2 with bme methods however the first anomaly on the left has been attenuated with 14 points bme correctly reproduced fig 6g 1 the near surface anomalies except for the loamy layer at depth visually the bme method produces the best results table 4 of the statistical indicators confirms that bme is regardless of the number of points always higher than kriging or geophysical transformation in conclusion the bme method seems to extract the best information from geophysical transformation and kriging however the number of samples does influence the spatialization of ks by bme in taking the results and statistical analysis into account we feel that 20 infiltration test points offers a valuable number of points 3 1 2 influence of variable soil wc this section will consider the influence of variable soil wc with 24 hard data values and the three same lo g 10 k s ref models all results are presented in fig 7 each column of the figure lists all results for the various models fig 7b displays lo g 10 e r interp which has decreased in depth and increased at the surface this change can be explained by the variable wc obtained from the groundwater flow model model 1 in fig 7 shows that the simple petrophysical transformation of the data does not highlight the variations in lo g 10 ks let s also note that the anomalies are heavily distorted along with the presence of an artifact at the 15 m position of the clay anomaly at depth for model 2 four anomalies are distinguished though a deep stretching of the central anomaly can be observed fig 7c 2 model 3 exhibits the three anomalies but the clay layer is poorly defined the loamy layer lo g 10 k s r e f 7 fig 7a 3 at depth has been replaced by a clay layer lo g 10 k s g e o 9 fig 7c 3 the bme method is the one that best estimates the lo g 10 ks data compared to the reference models the bme spatialization lo g 10 k s b m e actually reproduces all anomalies of the three distinct models table 5 reports on the statistical tools used to evaluate the performance of estimators kriging geophysics bme for all three models it can be observed that the statistical analysis applied to the models studied shows a strong correlation between the reference model and the bme method result for example on model 3 the correlation coefficient r² equals 0 77 for the bme vs 0 66 for kriging or 0 08 for kriging geophysics the lower mse value obtained with bme 0 43 reflects bme s high accuracy and targeting although data from the lo g 10 e r interp map are degraded this has nevertheless allowed bme to improve the ks spatialization an extremely encouraging result that underscores bme performance 3 2 field validation fig 8 presents the field result of a single ert profile and 23 infiltration test lo g 10 k s h values in fig 8a ert results are presented on a 45 m line also the lo g 10 e r interp points of low sensitivity coverage 0 7 are masked it can be acknowledged that the lo g 10 e r interp measurement in this area is not realistic the lo g 10 e r interp data show variations from 1 to 2 2 lo g 10 ω m infiltration tests as represented by red points have allowed us to determine that the lo g 10 k s h of the parcel varies between 3 and 7 lo g 10 m s 1 this value is standard for limagne soils which are often called black soil these soils contain varying clay and sand contents which explains the lo g 10 k s h bornand et al 1984 the position of lo g 10 k s h was identified according to the sampling strategy presented above fig 8c presents the mapping of lo g 10 k s krig based solely on infiltration test data observations can be made of a surface layer with an average value of 5 lo g 10 m s 1 a deep anomaly at the position x 20 m and z 2 m with a value of 6 lo g 10 m s 1 and another deep anomaly at the position x 4 m and z 2 m with a value of 3 lo g 10 m s 1 fig 8d provides the map of lo g 10 k s geo from the petrophysical relationship let s note the various layers between 0 and 1 m with values on the order of lo g 10 k s geo 4 lo g 10 m s 1 we can also distinguish a deep layer with values between 5 and 6 lo g 10 m s 1 inclusive bme behaves here as the fusion of kriging and geophysical data the surface layer is taken into account and the deep anomalies highlighted by lo g 10 k s h appear in the final model of ks from a visual standpoint bme takes the best features from both kriging and geophysics based on cross validation and statistical analysis mse me ve and r² bme slightly improves results with a high r² correlation index of 0 78 and a low root mean square error of 0 46 according to our statistical analysis the bme method proves to be the most highly focused accurate and correlated method table 6 4 discussion previous results lead the ensuing discussion to three points namely i the lack of validation data for bme generalization ii the sampling strategy and iii its future applications 4 1 lack of validation data due to the lack of validation data it is extremely difficult to consolidate these approaches in the field this work has proposed a static analysis to evaluate the bme data fusion methodology as a means of overcoming the absence of validation data nevertheless the statistical indicator for 24 points is not adequately significant and the method would require validation at other sites with a larger set of available ks data in spite of this fact the method has allowed obtaining for the very first time an impressive map of ks based on the available parcel information to improve these bme methods in the future an expanded number of measurements at well known reference sites will be necessary to date the bme is an efficient spatialization method but cannot be definitively generalized 4 2 sampling strategy the sampling strategy is based on ert data for selecting the optimal ks measurement location in the field such strategy has proven to be successful but there is still space for improvement indeed ert does not recognize all potential anomalies we have limited this bias by splitting our sampling strategy into two parts first sampling by electrical resistivity er over a range with low uncertainty for the ert measurements then sampling randomly where uncertainty is high this sampling strategy is suitable because it allows to minimize and optimally locate the sampling points when investigating a tww infiltration area with the bme method it can also be improved indirectly by enhancing the electrical resistivity tomography method itself indeed the development of inversion codes and solutions to better estimate the data uncertainty could allow obtaining better results these improvements are not possible today and do not meet the objective of the paper presented the fact that a 14 point simulation better provides better results than the 24 point simulation is probably related to the ert uncertainty 4 3 future applications and outlook the contribution of the saturation hydraulic conductivity map for the design of a tww infiltration area is considerable indeed the hydraulic conductivity at saturation condition allows the calculation of the daily infiltration capacity that will be brought to the soil there are therefore three ways to take into account the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks from these new maps the first way is based on using the average ks value for the field plot which is more representative of reality generally 3 to 10 infiltration tests are carried out which do not cover all the spatial heterogeneity of the infiltration area a complete map of ks providing it spatial heterogeneity would allow operators to calculate an average ks value close to reality this average value will make it possible to reduce the safety coefficient and indirectly allow optimizing the design and the functioning of the infiltration area the second solution is to calculate the ks by zoning i e dividing the infiltration area into different zones of desired size and calculate the average ks value by zone then it will be possible to distribute the water according to the infiltration capacity of each zone the last solution is to introduce the spatial distribution of ks into a 3d groundwater modeling of the infiltration area this solution is probably the most complicated because it requires the knowledge of other model parameters than the ks the advantage of this solution is that the ks probability density function an output of the bme method allows carrying out a stochastic modelling this result will help the decision makers in designing the infiltration area according to the desired risk for infiltration area design conducting 24 infiltration tests remains too expensive consequently it can only be applied to those cases representing a serious risk for the environment in order to overcome this limitation we are proposing to focus future research efforts on combining ert and infiltration tests with less time consuming methods such as the dynamic penetrometer the bme method could also be generalized to other soil parameters e g wc and applications especially in the field of water resources management 5 conclusion this article has proposed a new approach to obtain ks spatial distribution based on the integration of ert and infiltration test data in the bme method this method allows for the fusion of point specific data with a null variance ks and distributed data with a specific variance er we have adapted the bme method to the specificities of both geophysical and geotechnical datasets the results of this study show that bme is a high performance method producing maps with a lower variance than any of the other methods tested kriging petrophysical relationship indeed bme offers a first level ks distribution as well as many new possibilities namely i the development of a new multi method approach to coupling geophysical and geotechnical methods ii application to other fields of geosciences and iii use of results in

16669,wastewater treatment a major issue at the european level focuses on improving surface water and groundwater quality preserving the receiving environment and ensuring a sustainable use of water soil infiltration is increasingly practiced downstream of wastewater treatment plants particularly in rural areas without surface water bodies as is the use of soil as an additional buffer and treatment step however the design of infiltration areas on heterogeneous soils remains an extremely complex task due to the costly and time consuming spatial measurement of saturated hydraulic conductivity ks this article proposes integrating 2d electrical resistivity tomography and infiltration tests into a bayesian maximum entropy method yielding a vertical mapping of soil heterogeneities at a metric scale this updated method will facilitate infiltration area design in a heterogeneous soil setting graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater treatment plant design bayesian maximum entropy saturated hydraulic conductivity electrical resistivity tomography infiltration test 1 introduction despite the advances achieved in wastewater treatment plants over the last few decades treated wastewater tww can still exert a strong impact on downstream receiving rivers aubertheau et al 2017 this is especially true in french rural areas where treatment plants are mainly dedicated to treating carbonaceous pollution due to their small capacities 1000 population equivalent medde 2015 consequently the application of an extensive process like soil infiltration has become increasingly practiced as an option to provide tertiary treatment it consists of tww discharge over a large surface area trenches ponds basins or meadows allowing for gradual infiltration through the soil the pollutants nitrogen and phosphorus are naturally treated by biodegradation processes or retained in the soil the design and management of a tww infiltration area is mainly based on an estimation of the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ks in order to calculate the discharge capacity and evaluate its treatment potential siegrist 2014 however ks remains one of the most difficult soil properties to determine mahapatra et al 2020 and its spatial variability can significantly influence tww infiltration zhang et al 2019 infiltration tests are usually carried out using the porchet constant head method which outputs direct and local measurements of ks and requires 1 to 4 hours per test depending on the soil type for heterogeneous soils the estimation of ks requires numerous measurements to establish confident predictions of tww discharge warrick et al 1977 this protocol can prove to be invasive and time consuming nevertheless an incorrect estimations of ks could lead to malfunctions in the tww infiltration areas via i premature clogging mckinley and siegrist 2011 ii over infiltration and groundwater contamination and iii under infiltration leading to puddling and olfactory nuisances morugán coronado et al 2011 for the estimation of ks variability bisone et al 2017 proposed using geophysical methods on tww infiltration areas with a subjective delineation of heterogeneity in order to locate a few infiltration tests for an optimal design geophysical methods allow visualizing soil structures through the measurement of a given physical parameter wave speed electrical resistivity er elasticity romero ruiz et al 2018 such methods are non intrusive and yield physical information on large soil volumes yet still involve significant uncertainties loke et al 2013 in the environmental sciences for near surface 0 2 m investigations electrical resistivity tomography ert is a widely used method whenever 2d vertical information is required hellman et al 2017 the er signal is a function of a number of soil properties including the nature of solid constituents particle size and distribution the arrangement of voids porosity pore size distribution connectivity water content the er of the fluid and the temperature samouëlian et al 2005 telford et al 1990 on the other hand the er signal has no direct dependence on ks attwa and ali 2018 weller and slater 2019 their physical relationship tends to be specific to the given soil type and is difficult to transpose directly to heterogeneous soils doussan and ruy 2009 only a few articles have explored the notion of using ert to determine soil ks with er two approaches were found to be extremely attractive the first employs empirical relationships between er and ks vogelgesang et al 2020 while the second adds a hydrodynamic model constrained by geophysics during the inversion process farzamian et al 2015 the former is a simple method yet still generates a high level of ks estimation uncertainty whereas the latter is probably the most robust method but requires an extensive numerical approach and tends not to be well adapted to tww infiltration area design the 2d estimation of ks from geophysical measurements and point measurements necessitates the use of other emerging methods for simple and robust applications e g data fusion methods dezert et al 2019 li et al 2019 data fusion refers to the process of integrating multiple data sources in order to produce more accurate and useful information until now no paper has yet to be published regarding data fusion between ert and ks among all data fusion methods bayesian maximum entropy bme seems to be the best adapted method bme is a nonlinear spatial estimator that rigorously accounts for spatial variability and the non gaussian characteristic of uncertain data here uncertainty is represented by a variance the powerful bme method of modern spatiotemporal geostatistics christakos et al 2002 provides a non linear and non gaussian extension to classical linear geostatistics that is not limited by this linear constraint in comparison to the others methods bme is a general approach that does not make any assumptions regarding the linearity of the estimator the normality of the underlying probability laws or the homogeneity of the spatial distribution considering the dataset the bme method of spatial analysis and mapping provides precise rules of incorporating priori information infiltration data reliable but sparse soft data and ert data dense with high uncertainty soft data christakos et al 2002 showed that bme is a relevant method for predicting spatial data encompassing several environmental parameters for instance it has been successfully used to predict water table variations d or et al 2001 and estimate soil salinity douaik et al 2005 these examples suggest that the bme method is suitable to estimate 2d ks maps the aim of this paper is to merge ks and ert measurements in order to obtain the most accurate estimation of ks thus providing new tww infiltration area design elements 2 materials and methods the methodology adopted herein to evaluate the benefit of bme is based on a classical approach widely used in the geophysical literature radulescu et al 2007 it is composed of three steps the first step consists of constructing synthetic datasets based on three synthetic ks reference models k s r e f and then simulating the ert measurements and infiltration tests for each model the second step adapts evaluates and determines the bme method limits by means of the synthetic datasets created in the previous step through defining the optimal number of hard data points 14 24 or 50 for a homogeneous water content wc of 0 25 m3 m 3 validating a robust sampling strategy of hard data assessing the impact of soil moisture variation in the model the third step validates the bme method on a field dataset 2 1 synthetic datasets the synthetic datasets generated from k s r e f fig 1 a are organized into both hard and soft data soft data generation consists of simulating the geophysical measurement and deriving hydraulic conductivity denoted k s geo from ert fig 1b hard data on the other hand are local estimations of ks sampled directly from k s r e f these data correspond to a simulation of the infiltration tests fig 1c as for k s geo the first step entails simulating soil wc based on groundwater flow modeling which will provide a realistic soil wc data distribution sectioni in taking wc and soil type into account petrophysical relationships drawn from the literature will be used to calculate true electrical resistivity e r true sectionii and simulate apparent electrical resistivity e r app for each ks model section a next we will invert e r app data to obtain interpreted electrical resistivity e r interp section b lastly e r interp data will be transformed into k s geo data section 2 3 fig 2 shows the synthetic dataset for synthetic soils models 1 2 and 3 generated following this strategy the three columns in each figure represent respectively models 1 2 and 3 the rows present the following a l o g 10 k s r e f b wc c l o g 10 e r t r u e d l o g 10 e r a p p and e l o g 10 e r i n t e r p in fig 2 row a presents three different k s r e f anomalies shown with a metric horizontal extension these three models have been chosen based on various criteria the first model is a field case presented in an article bisone et al 2017a devoted to the study of an infiltration site the two other geological configurations are known to be difficult to reconstruct using ert telford et al 1990 in the bme framework all data are introduced in log10 for computational purposes 2 2 1 soft data generation 2 2 1 1 subsurface flow modeling water content estimation according to fig 1b the first soft data generation step calls for wc simulation using subsurface flow modeling for variably saturated soils as suggested in audebert et al 2016 we will employ a single continuum model based on richard s equation richards 1931 completed with mualem van genuchten s retention model which expresses the relationship between water pressure and effective saturation retention properties as well as between relative ks and effective saturation to simulate tww subsurface flow we ran comsol multiphysics 5 4 with a subsurface flow module the study domain is a 2d vertical profile 29 2 m long and 6 m high the water flow boundary conditions were set as follows i no flow on the top and sides and ii seepage face for the bottom as in audebert et al 2016 to assign all hydraulic parameters we extracted from the literature 12 soil types with known parameters considering lo g 10 k s r e f for each cell in table 1 we sought the ks corresponding to the closest k s r e f value and assigned the remaining hydraulic parameters θs α and n to simulate subsurface flow with variable soil saturation the model was initialized to the total saturation soil water content equals the soil porosity during a requisite time interval the model was left to simulate soil drainage until the water table was close to 4 m deep this value was chosen so that the given configuration could be considered free of any water table influence on the infiltration test within the first 2 m of soil a variable time step from a few seconds to a few hours is used to allow a better optimization of the hydrodynamic simulation the simulation lasted approximately 6 hours depending on the model this set up produced variable 2d wc maps for the constant wc model we simply chose a value of 0 25 m3 m 3 during the ert monitoring when the water content is low it is difficult to measure accurately the soil electrical resistivity due to the low circulation of the electric current in the soil moreover when the soil water content lies close to saturation the measured electrical resistivity is dominated by that of the water however when the soil water content is between these two limit values we can see the spatial contrast in soil electrical resistivity in this study we set the soil water content value to 0 25 this value is close to the field capacity that we could meet in the field after a period without rain for the rest of the paper the bme is tested on a constant wc model wc 0 25 and then on a variable wc model 2 2 1 2 petrophysical relationship just a few articles in the literature include the petrophysical relationship in determining ks with the true electrical resistivity of soil e r true vogelgesang et al 2020 soil wc can be considered as the most influential parameter on e r true it is necessary therefore to take the variability of wc and ks into account in the relationship to generate synthetic 2d electrical resistivity datasets to evaluate bme method fig 2c according to the literature potential physical relationships between er and wc are specific to a given soil type brunet et al 2010 for this study we introduced an empirical relationship e r ref to estimate the true electrical resistivity e r true first we search and extracted well documented wc and er pairs measured in the laboratory for broad sandy loamy and clayey soil textures wunderlich et al 2013 second each texture is associated with specific l o g 10 k s values of 4 7 and 10 respectively mallants et al 2003 third to cover the full range of l o g 10 k s with a 0 2 resolution a 2d interpolated map of e r ref was estimated as a function of ks and wc which were derived from the 3 soil types fig 3 forth to estimate e r true for each cell of the model the closest wc and l o g 10 k s values are sought in e r ref fig 3 the found value is assigned to this cell the result is presented in the c row the empirical relation between l o g 10 e r r e f wc and ks is valid in the case of an unsaturated zone this hypothesis makes the relationship independent of other soil properties such as ph and the content of exchangeable anions moreover the sizing is performed before the design of infiltration areas for tww so the effect of tww on infiltration is not taken into account 2 2 1 3 electrical resistivity tomography the ert measurement has been well described in the geophysical literature clement et al 2020 e r app is measured by injecting electric current into the ground with two current electrodes in measuring the potential difference between two other electrodes this device is called a quadrupole the distribution of er in the soil is determined by operating many quadrupoles at various positions along a line of electrodes installed at the surface of the soil at the end of the measurement sequence all quadrupoles are inverted using an inversion code telford et al 1990 2 2 1 3 1 forward modeling to simulate e r app on each of the three synthetic er models c we ran the comsol multiphysics and matlab f3dm 3 08 package which is commonly used in geophysics forward modeling with the ac dc module quasi stationary electromagnetic field in accordance with electromagnetic field theory to evaluate the potential difference induced by the injected current clement and moreau 2016 a gaussian noise distribution with a 3 standard deviation relative error was added to the e r app dataset to simulate the noise commonly recorded in the field friedel 2003 an acquisition line of 72 electrodes was implemented at a 0 4 m spacing a complete sequence of 829 quadrupoles was carried out with wenner arrays 2 2 1 3 2 inversion procedure the synthetic e r app was inverted using pygimli an open source multi method library for geophysics modeling and inversion rücker et al 2017 a finite element method relying on regular grid models was applied to solve the forward problem in the routine inversion program an isotropic smoothness constrained regularization and a quasi gauss newton optimization method were both used along with a fixed regularization parameter λ 30 zweight 1 0 this inversion procedure produced an e r interp map günther and rücker 2011 2 2 1 3 3 uncertainties an interpreted ert is not the perfect image of e r true the smooth nature of electrical current implies a loss of resolution when moving away from the electrodes this is due to both the character of the method which measures variations of apparent electrical resistivity from the surface and the current image reconstruction tools which use algorithms that produce smoothed contours in some parts of the inverted model the er value of a cell has a very low impact on the measured e r app it is therefore of paramount importance to account for the uncertainty on ert the total uncertainty of er depends on the inversion process the measured data and the loss of information with depth calculating total uncertainty is a long and complex process consequently it is proposed herein to estimate uncertainty by means of simple inversion indicators derived from the geophysical literature namely coverage resolution radius friedel 2003 or doi d carrière et al 2014 all inversion indicator calculations require knowledge of the fréchet derivative matrix g n m also called the jacobian matrix or sensitivity matrix eq 1 1 g i j d i m j i 1 n j 1 m where d i and m j are the e r app data and model parameter respectively a single sensitivity value g i j indicates the change in apparent resistivity data d i m with respect to a small change in model parameter m j g is used to determine how a change in resistivity of model cell j affects the measured value of d i in our case we have opted for model resolution r m where the r m matrix is calculated by inversion software according to the following formula eq 2 günther 2004 2 r m g t w d t w d g λ c t c 1 g t w d t w d g where g is the sensitivity matrix w d a diagonal matrix containing the data errors λ the damping parameter and c the a priori model covariance matrix the diagonal element r ii indicates how the inverted model of er is resolved if all diagonal elements of r m equal 1 then the exact model is perfectly resolved the further the r m diagonal element from 1 the poorer the resolution in accordance with the ideas of friedel 2003 a resolution radius for each model cell can be determined from the diagonal elements of the resolution matrix r ii let s assume a piecewise constant cell resolution with r ies i as the radius of a cell circle having a perfect resolution of 1 for a cell of dimensions δ x i and i δ z i the resolution radius is defined by eq 3 below 3 r res i δ x i δ z i π r ii the resolution matrix r res allows assessing the reliability of the inverted models according to the degree of resolution specific to each cell r res is therefore the most suitable indicator for unstructured or irregular bert meshes for this reason r res has been chosen as an uncertainty to be introduced into the bme section 2 3 2 1 2 hard data generation hydraulic conductivity sampling method for synthetic soil models 1 2 and 3 we have sampled synthetic hard data l o g 10 k s h by extracting the l o g 10 k s l value from l o g 10 k s ref fig 2a it is assumed that our measurements of l o g 10 k s h have a zero variance we used e r interp data and a random selection technique to optimize the ks sample location as per the following strategy 50 of the number of points were manually sampled above and below the anomalies 25 of the points were sampled in the upper part of the e r interp map where r res has low uncertainty our e r interp maps were divided into three ranges between the min and max values in each range an equivalent number of points were randomly sampled 25 were sampled in the area with the lowest r res these points were sampled entirely randomly owing to the poor performance of ert in this area for this step the spatialization of ks using bme method has been tested with three differing sample numbers i e 14 24 and 50 these values were selected because the strategy applied here required at least 8 points beyond 50 points on the other hand the improvement was no longer significant results not shown moreover more than 50 values is not realistic for characterizing an infiltration area as the sampling would take too long regarding the minimum value below 14 samples the correlation coefficient is no longer satisfactory results not shown 2 2 field data 2 2 1 soft data measurements the experimental site is located in france and had already been studied in previous articles benz navarrete et al 2019 it comprises a fairly heterogeneous agricultural plot and is relatively tabular in its sandy loam surface presenting sandy lenses in loam over its depth ert acquisitions were carried out using iris instruments syscal pro 72 electrodes resistivity meter iris instruments france the ert profile was acquired with a wenner array type and a 0 25 m electrode spacing to cover the proposed profile length 45 m and maintain reasonable subsurface lateral resolution the roll along acquisition technique was performed with 48 electrode overlaps the contact resistance was continuously measured at less than 4 kohms the 2d image of the e r interp profile was inverted with the pygimli software rücker et al 2017 a 2d flat inversion was carried out we chose an isotropic smoothness constraint with a z weight of 1 and a lambda value of 30 günther 2004 loke 1999 moreover we used a tetrahedral mesh with 2 920 cells 2 2 2 hard data measurements according to the sampling strategy presented in the previous section we select 23 infiltration test locations the aardvark permeameter developed by soil moisture inc usa was used to measure the infiltration rate from the measured flow rate l o g 10 k s could be estimated by applying reynolds and elrick s equation elrick et al 1989 the procedure consists in manually drilling a hole with augers to the depth at which the test is to be performed then a measurement probe is inserted inside the hole connected by a pipe to a water tank this probe provides a constant hydraulic pressure during the test the water tank is placed on a scale while water is infiltrating into the soil the weight of the tank is measured at constant time intervals the test stops when the weight change between two measurements remains constant indicating the achievement of the steady state regime the elementary volume of the infiltration test measurements is 0 15 m3 2 3 bme fusion method the bayesian maximum entropy bme method and its bmelib numerical implementation christakos et al 2002 serre and christakos 1999 provide a mathematically rigorous framework that incorporates information from several data sources featuring different uncertainties and point densities these data have been organized into both hard data corresponding to exact measurements and soft data with a given uncertainty the spatial random field y x z lo g 10 k s x z indicates lo g 10 k s of the soil at location x z where x m is the longitudinal coordinate along our study transect and z m the depth y h y s and y k denote y at the hard data points where y h is obtained from geotechnical measurements the soft data points where y s is derived from ert and petrophysical relationships and the estimation point respectively bme relies on two principles i maximum entropy theory processes the general knowledge base of means and covariances g m y co v y and produces a prior f g pdf probability density function describing the spatial process and ii epistemic bayesian conditioning updates this prior f g pdf with the site specific knowledge base s which then yields a bme posterior pdf f k describing the value y k at any estimation point here s y h f s where y h lo g 10 k s h x z is the measurement of the hard geotechnical data and f s is a pdf describing the uncertainty associated with soft geophysical data moreover the bme posterior pdf is given by 4 f k y k a f g y h y s y k f s y s d y s where a is a normalization constant the mean m y of field y x z is set to a first degree polynomial while the covariance co v y is obtained by fitting an anisotropic covariance model to experimental covariance values calculated from the y h data a covariance model quantifies the degree of similarity between pairs of measurements in terms of their separation distance and the orientation of the line between such pairs see chils and delfiner 1999 for details on how covariance models describe the variability of spatial processes also olea 2006 provided details on fitting a covariance model to experimental covariance values obtained from a covariogram analysis in this study the experimental covariance values are calculated based on a sample size of y h measurements the anisotropy model fitted to these experimental covariance values is assumed to be exponential with a major direction aligned with the x longitudinal axis and a ratio of covariance ranging along the major direction over the covariance ranging along the transverse direction the soft data pdf f s y s is obtained by transforming lo g 10 e r interp into lo g 10 k s geo mastrocicco et al 2010 proposed a log linear relationship between er and ks hence the need for a linear regression of the observed lo g 10 k s geo with respect to their corresponding lo g 10 e r interp then for each node of the inversion grid where a lo g 10 e r interp is available but for which lo g 10 k s h was not measured we set f s y s to a gaussian pdf with a mean equal to the value predicted by linear regression y s lo g 10 k s g e o however for bme to work efficiently we must set the variance σ s 2 x z of f s y s to a value that captures the uncertainty in the y s obtained from lo g 10 e r interp at location x z 5 σ s 2 x z r res x z mean r res σ y h 2 z mean z σ z 2 this can be accomplished by using the following where r res x z is the resolution radius section c mean r res x z its mean σ y h 2 the variance of y h z the absolute value of depth mean z its mean and σ z 2 a parameter obtained by maximizing the r 2 of validation as explained in previous section the terms r res x z mean r res and z mean z are unitless while both σ y h 2 and σ z 2 have units of lo g 10 m s 1 2 the first term ineq 5 is equal to the resolution radius normalized to a variance while the second term is a gradient with depth also normalized to a variance combined these two terms allow the bme to account for the fact that the uncertainty in the soft geophysical data increases with both r res and depth 2 4 bme validation strategy we adopted a validation strategy to compare the estimation error of three methods kriging of the hard data alone geophysics i e geophysical data alone and bme i e fusion of both hard data and geophysical data for the numerical simulations we computed the estimation error by comparing the estimated ks with lo g 10 k s r e f our field study was limited to lo g 10 k s h at nh sampled locations in which case we conducted a cross validation analysis lee et al 2009 the validation statistics used to assess model performance were mean square estimation error mse mean estimation error me variance of estimation error ve and square of the pearson correlation coefficient r² christensen 2018 3 results 3 1 numerical approach 3 1 1 evaluation of hard data number figs 4 6 show the spatial distribution of lo g 10 ks for synthetic models 1 2 and 3 respectively the three columns in each figure represent the spatialization result when the number of sampling points where l o g 10 k s h has been sampled equals 10 24 and 50 respectively the rows offer the following row 1 lo g 10 k s ref row 2 lo g 10 e r interp data the black circles indicate the sampling

summarize the following statistical tools mse me ve and r² applied to evaluate the performance of these estimation methods 3 1 1 1 synthetic soil of model 1 fig 4b 3 shows the lo g 10 e r interp map for a 50 point sampling nh 50 conducted on a two layer soil the surface displays an initial layer depth 0 2 5 m with an estimated lo g 10 e r interp of 1 8 two anomalies are present in this layer at x 5 m and 22 m the synthetic reference model fig 4a shows two anomalies with the same thickness whereas the anomalies are deformed and stretched downward in fig 4b at depth the layer with lo g 10 e r interp of 1 4 is more reduced than that in the reference model it starts at the x 2 5 m position and disappears at the x 17 m position in fig 4c 3 the lo g 10 k s geo distribution is very similar to the lo g 10 e r interp map in fig 4d 3 the result of kriging based solely on lo g 10 k s h reveals a highly smoothed map however the bme results lie closest to the reference model the surface anomalies are in the correct position and the shape of the anomaly is closer to reality fig 4f 3 reducing the number of samples to 24 hard data lo g 10 k s h produces no noticeable change in the proposed lo g 10 k s geo map kriging is more likely to overwhelm the anomalies the bme fusion method provides an attractive lo g 10 k s bme estimate with a reasonable number of samples let s note that reducing the number of points at depth reduces resolution of the anomaly at the position x 10 m and z 3 5 m the 14 sampling points are insufficient to cover all anomalies which obviously influences the kriging results and geophysical transformation by the empirical law therefore the bme fusion method is closest to the reference model indeed the bme is capable of delineating large sand anomalies yet it tends to underestimate the extent of the clay anomaly at depth this finding can be explained by the lack of resolution of the ert method at depth where information from soft data is less reliable fig 4e and g exhibit the variance for both the kriging and bme methods the information given by the σ krig 2 map is weak for data close to the ks hard value σ bme 2 is minimized compared to σ krig 2 all visual results have been confirmed by error estimators which are more efficient for the bme 3 1 1 1 1 synthetic soil of model 2 fig 5 shows the spatialization of lo g 10 ks fig 5b 3 presents the lo g 10 e r interp map and estimated lo g 10 k s h for 50 sampling points in fig 5c 3 lo g 10 k s geo reveals the three clay anomalies on the surface but the silty anomaly is not apparent the clay anomalies are stretched towards the bottom in fig 5d 3 kriging serves to identify the four anomalies however even with such a large sample kriging merges the two near surface anomalies at the position x 16 m in fig 5f 3 the anomalies are correctly delineated with bme we can observe that kriging deteriorates and merges the anomalies bme would appear to be better with 24 points than with 50 because the loam anomaly is more sharply defined with 24 points in reality this outcome is due to the differentiation in the selected sampling points more specifically with a minimal number of 14 ks hard data results maintain the same trend as with 50 and 24 points table 3 shows that for 50 lo g 10 k s h sampling points the bme method slightly improves the estimation result in terms of correlation r² 0 82 for nh 14 vs r² 0 84 for nh 50 and targeting mse around 0 3 the increase in number of samples from 14 to 24 points degrades the kriging estimate in terms of correlation this trend is linked to the random sampling that in this case has selected points of lesser interest regardless of the number of samples the r² calculation demonstrates that bme once again produces the highest value in this second model 3 1 1 1 2 synthetic soil of model 3 fig 6 presents the results of the spatialization of lo g 10 k s for 50 points fig 6b 3 lo g 10 e r interp indicates the presence of two sand anomalies with a lo g 10 e r interp of 2 and one loam anomaly with a lo g 10 e r interp of 1 7 meanwhile ert does not show the deep clay layer in fig 6c 3 lo g 10 k s geo follows the lo g 10 e r interp map the kriging result in fig 6d 3 exposes a deep loam layer with well delimited anomalies at the surface however the method tends to merge anomalies the bme results in fig 6f 3 clearly identify the 3 anomalies as well as the loamy layer with 24 points kriging fig 6d 2 of the surface anomaly is merged the near surface anomalies and deep layer are well distinguished in fig 6g 2 with bme methods however the first anomaly on the left has been attenuated with 14 points bme correctly reproduced fig 6g 1 the near surface anomalies except for the loamy layer at depth visually the bme method produces the best results table 4 of the statistical indicators confirms that bme is regardless of the number of points always higher than kriging or geophysical transformation in conclusion the bme method seems to extract the best information from geophysical transformation and kriging however the number of samples does influence the spatialization of ks by bme in taking the results and statistical analysis into account we feel that 20 infiltration test points offers a valuable number of points 3 1 2 influence of variable soil wc this section will consider the influence of variable soil wc with 24 hard data values and the three same lo g 10 k s ref models all results are presented in fig 7 each column of the figure lists all results for the various models fig 7b displays lo g 10 e r interp which has decreased in depth and increased at the surface this change can be explained by the variable wc obtained from the groundwater flow model model 1 in fig 7 shows that the simple petrophysical transformation of the data does not highlight the variations in lo g 10 ks let s also note that the anomalies are heavily distorted along with the presence of an artifact at the 15 m position of the clay anomaly at depth for model 2 four anomalies are distinguished though a deep stretching of the central anomaly can be observed fig 7c 2 model 3 exhibits the three anomalies but the clay layer is poorly defined the loamy layer lo g 10 k s r e f 7 fig 7a 3 at depth has been replaced by a clay layer lo g 10 k s g e o 9 fig 7c 3 the bme method is the one that best estimates the lo g 10 ks data compared to the reference models the bme spatialization lo g 10 k s b m e actually reproduces all anomalies of the three distinct models table 5 reports on the statistical tools used to evaluate the performance of estimators kriging geophysics bme for all three models it can be observed that the statistical analysis applied to the models studied shows a strong correlation between the reference model and the bme method result for example on model 3 the correlation coefficient r² equals 0 77 for the bme vs 0 66 for kriging or 0 08 for kriging geophysics the lower mse value obtained with bme 0 43 reflects bme s high accuracy and targeting although data from the lo g 10 e r interp map are degraded this has nevertheless allowed bme to improve the ks spatialization an extremely encouraging result that underscores bme performance 3 2 field validation fig 8 presents the field result of a single ert profile and 23 infiltration test lo g 10 k s h values in fig 8a ert results are presented on a 45 m line also the lo g 10 e r interp points of low sensitivity coverage 0 7 are masked it can be acknowledged that the lo g 10 e r interp measurement in this area is not realistic the lo g 10 e r interp data show variations from 1 to 2 2 lo g 10 ω m infiltration tests as represented by red points have allowed us to determine that the lo g 10 k s h of the parcel varies between 3 and 7 lo g 10 m s 1 this value is standard for limagne soils which are often called black soil these soils contain varying clay and sand contents which explains the lo g 10 k s h bornand et al 1984 the position of lo g 10 k s h was identified according to the sampling strategy presented above fig 8c presents the mapping of lo g 10 k s krig based solely on infiltration test data observations can be made of a surface layer with an average value of 5 lo g 10 m s 1 a deep anomaly at the position x 20 m and z 2 m with a value of 6 lo g 10 m s 1 and another deep anomaly at the position x 4 m and z 2 m with a value of 3 lo g 10 m s 1 fig 8d provides the map of lo g 10 k s geo from the petrophysical relationship let s note the various layers between 0 and 1 m with values on the order of lo g 10 k s geo 4 lo g 10 m s 1 we can also distinguish a deep layer with values between 5 and 6 lo g 10 m s 1 inclusive bme behaves here as the fusion of kriging and geophysical data the surface layer is taken into account and the deep anomalies highlighted by lo g 10 k s h appear in the final model of ks from a visual standpoint bme takes the best features from both kriging and geophysics based on cross validation and statistical analysis mse me ve and r² bme slightly improves results with a high r² correlation index of 0 78 and a low root mean square error of 0 46 according to our statistical analysis the bme method proves to be the most highly focused accurate and correlated method table 6 4 discussion previous results lead the ensuing discussion to three points namely i the lack of validation data for bme generalization ii the sampling strategy and iii its future applications 4 1 lack of validation data due to the lack of validation data it is extremely difficult to consolidate these approaches in the field this work has proposed a static analysis to evaluate the bme data fusion methodology as a means of overcoming the absence of validation data nevertheless the statistical indicator for 24 points is not adequately significant and the method would require validation at other sites with a larger set of available ks data in spite of this fact the method has allowed obtaining for the very first time an impressive map of ks based on the available parcel information to improve these bme methods in the future an expanded number of measurements at well known reference sites will be necessary to date the bme is an efficient spatialization method but cannot be definitively generalized 4 2 sampling strategy the sampling strategy is based on ert data for selecting the optimal ks measurement location in the field such strategy has proven to be successful but there is still space for improvement indeed ert does not recognize all potential anomalies we have limited this bias by splitting our sampling strategy into two parts first sampling by electrical resistivity er over a range with low uncertainty for the ert measurements then sampling randomly where uncertainty is high this sampling strategy is suitable because it allows to minimize and optimally locate the sampling points when investigating a tww infiltration area with the bme method it can also be improved indirectly by enhancing the electrical resistivity tomography method itself indeed the development of inversion codes and solutions to better estimate the data uncertainty could allow obtaining better results these improvements are not possible today and do not meet the objective of the paper presented the fact that a 14 point simulation better provides better results than the 24 point simulation is probably related to the ert uncertainty 4 3 future applications and outlook the contribution of the saturation hydraulic conductivity map for the design of a tww infiltration area is considerable indeed the hydraulic conductivity at saturation condition allows the calculation of the daily infiltration capacity that will be brought to the soil there are therefore three ways to take into account the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks from these new maps the first way is based on using the average ks value for the field plot which is more representative of reality generally 3 to 10 infiltration tests are carried out which do not cover all the spatial heterogeneity of the infiltration area a complete map of ks providing it spatial heterogeneity would allow operators to calculate an average ks value close to reality this average value will make it possible to reduce the safety coefficient and indirectly allow optimizing the design and the functioning of the infiltration area the second solution is to calculate the ks by zoning i e dividing the infiltration area into different zones of desired size and calculate the average ks value by zone then it will be possible to distribute the water according to the infiltration capacity of each zone the last solution is to introduce the spatial distribution of ks into a 3d groundwater modeling of the infiltration area this solution is probably the most complicated because it requires the knowledge of other model parameters than the ks the advantage of this solution is that the ks probability density function an output of the bme method allows carrying out a stochastic modelling this result will help the decision makers in designing the infiltration area according to the desired risk for infiltration area design conducting 24 infiltration tests remains too expensive consequently it can only be applied to those cases representing a serious risk for the environment in order to overcome this limitation we are proposing to focus future research efforts on combining ert and infiltration tests with less time consuming methods such as the dynamic penetrometer the bme method could also be generalized to other soil parameters e g wc and applications especially in the field of water resources management 5 conclusion this article has proposed a new approach to obtain ks spatial distribution based on the integration of ert and infiltration test data in the bme method this method allows for the fusion of point specific data with a null variance ks and distributed data with a specific variance er we have adapted the bme method to the specificities of both geophysical and geotechnical datasets the results of this study show that bme is a high performance method producing maps with a lower variance than any of the other methods tested kriging petrophysical relationship indeed bme offers a first level ks distribution as well as many new possibilities namely i the development of a new multi method approach to coupling geophysical and geotechnical methods ii application to other fields of geosciences and iii use of results in
