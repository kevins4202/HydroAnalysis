10780,this paper presents an analysis of the quantitative correlations between corn yield and its influencing factors in daqing city china by establishing a cobb douglas production function model the effective precipitation corn planting area and chemical fertilizer and pesticide application rates were selected as the influencing factors of corn yield using the cobb douglas production function model the output elasticity and degree of influence for each factor on increasing grain yield were calculated the current fertilizer and pesticide application rates effective precipitation and planting area had positive effects on increasing corn yield and the daqing city area has the potential to produce more corn among the four influencing factors the amounts of pesticide applications had the greatest impact on corn yield followed by planting area amounts of chemical fertilizer applications and finally effective precipitation in this study we used remote sensing images combined with meteorological station data to calculate the effective precipitation in corn fields in daqing city the accuracy of this method was 0 01 11 0 greater than that of the traditional effective precipitation calculation method the innovation was the use of thiessen polygons to calculate regional precipitation by combining satellite images with ground meteorological station data the insufficient sensitivity of satellite inversion for precipitation short and heavy rainfalls cannot be detected and insufficient temporal resolution were avoided by using precipitation data from ground meteorological stations using satellite image interpretations the weight coefficient of precipitation could be confirmed according to the location and size of the study area improving the accuracy of thiessen polygons in calculating regional precipitation however this method still has limitations when calculating precipitation over a short time it can be limited by the cloudiness of satellite images when calculating the long term precipitation trend it can be limited by incomplete precipitation data from surface meteorological stations keywords remote sensing interpretation influencing factors effective precipitation thiessen polygon 1 introduction food security is the most basic issue related to human development the safety of food affects the stability and development of the world economy as the population grows lifestyles and diets change and food demand will increase by 70 by 2050 countries worldwide are facing pressure to maintain food supplies hoff 2011 corn is the most widely grown crop in china with a planting area that ranks first in the world wu and liu 2018 and its output ranks second in the world yang et al 2017 exploring the influencing factors of corn yield is of great significance for increasing corn yield potential corn yield and farmers incomes as well as ensuring food security li et al 2019a because of the wide range of corn planting areas there are differences in the environmental conditions and planting modes and the factors affecting corn yield are also complex when studying the possibility of increasing the corn yield in ghana marloes found that although corn yield can be increased by improving varieties and increasing growth rates the key to increasing corn yield depends on the interactions of household soil and management factors van loon et al 2019v bibi found that appropriate changes in the type and application of herbicides can increase corn yield bibi et al 2019 based on corn planting data from 15 countries li found that corn yield is closely related to yield per unit water usage yield per unit nitrogen applied and average temperature li et al 2019b suat found that farming methods have an impact on crop yield water use and economic benefits irmak et al 2019 zhao used the apsim corn model to analyze the effects of precipitation soil and technical management on corn yield the influence of various factors on corn yield varied in different corn planting regions in china zhao et al 2018 even in the same province corn yield will vary owing to factors such as accumulated temperature planting scale and soil texture jiang et al 2019 daqing city is located in the first accumulated temperature zone in heilongjiang province china an area suitable for corn planting and a main corn growing region zhu et al 2014 corn yield increased rapidly from 2000 to 2013 but started to decline in 2014 in this study corn yield was used as a research target and the factors affecting corn yield in 2001 2014 in daqing city a semi arid region of northeast china were collected by constructing a cobb douglas c d production function model a quantitative analysis of the correlations between corn yield and various influencing factors was performed and feasible changes were proposed to promote corn yield in daqing city the proposed correction method is unique in the following respects precipitation was calculated using a thiessen polygon this is different from the previously used weight calculation of a thiessen polygon area in this study the spatial distribution structure of the corn fields was obtained using a remote sensing interpretation method and the precipitation was calculated using the weight of the corn field area in a thiessen polygon which improved the accuracy of the actual precipitation used in corn planting 2 study area and data collection 2 1 study area daqing city is located in the west of heilongjiang province fig 1 with a geographical position between 45 22 and 47 28 north latitude and 123 44 to 125 48 east longitude and a total area of 21 000 square kilometers the study area belongs to the first accumulated temperature zone in heilongjiang province above 2700 c with an annual average temperature of 4 2 c from july to august the average temperature is 23 3 c the sunshine duration during the crop growing season may september is 1300 1350 h the precipitation during the growing period is generally above 350 480 mm accounting for more than 85 of the annual precipitation as of 2015 the corn planting area in daqing city accounted for 97 9 of the sown area of dryland crops in daqing city and the corn yield was about 4 5 million tons accounting for 97 60 of the dryland crop yield according to field surveys and data collection the land cover types in the study area are mainly corn fields paddy fields urban areas waters rivers lakes and reservoirs other land sand bare land other dryland crops saline alkali soil and meadow forest 2 2 data collection the traditional agricultural resource management was extensive and its information acquisition method is based on the combination census sample survey key survey and comprehensive survey it is reported from the village level and finally approved by the national bureau of statistics however owing to the disadvantage of agricultural planting dispersion spatial and temporal variability shi et al 2015 and inconsistent statistical methods the coherence of data not very accurate remote sensing image is an important means to obtain ground information high and medium resolution remote sensing images can be obtained by satellite airplane and radar through image analysis people can get the information they need agricultural remote sensing promotes agricultural production management and research from the traditional extensive stage to the precise stage zhao 2014 precision agriculture refers to the use of satellite data to investigate the current situation of farmland area and distribution and to monitor crop growth soil water content and other information agricultural quantitative remote sensing as one of the core of precision agriculture huang et al 2018 tang 2018 is widely used in agricultural resources survey crop yield estimation agricultural disaster monitoring etc chen et al 2016 in recent years with the emergence of various satellites with high spatial temporal and spectral resolution such as theos satellite radi 2011a eros b satellite radi 2011b optisar satellite constellation fox et al 2017 the accuracy of crop remote sensing identification classification land use and cover change monitoring has been constantly improved liu et al 2018 and agricultural quantitative remote sensing technology has been further developed in addition to remote sensing data meteorological and agricultural data availability was important in the selection of study time periods meteorological and agricultural data are obtained through meteorological stations and yearbooks when selecting remote sensing data it is necessary to avoid changes in ground cover type caused by geological meteorological disasters wang et al 2016 anthropogenic effectives seasonal differentiations etc and the imaging season of remote sensing image directly affects the quality of interpretation so it is necessary to select remote sensing images during the growing period of crops to interpret the image according to the attributes of the objects themselves and the differences between different regions of the same objects the optimum time is august september at this time corn crops are close to maturity but there is no harvest so it is convenient to distinguish different crops yang and liu 2008 while avoiding cloud cover poor image quality and other negative factors after screening two images were selected from 2001 and 2014 therefore the time period for this study was determined to be 2001 2014 2 2 1 remote sensing data the remote sensing images of the crop growth period show the types of ground objects more clearly therefore this paper selected a remote sensing image of the plant growth period may september for interpretation remote sensing images data set is provided by geospatial data cloud site computer network information center chinese academy of sciences http www gscloud cn because remote sensing images are interfered by the factors such as resolution and cloudiness only two images were screened from those of 2000 2014 they were taken on august 11 2001 and september 24 2014 and had image cloud cover of less than 1 the image of 2001 was selected from landsat 7 and the image of 2014 was selected from landsat 8 2 2 2 meteorological data eight meteorological stations qian gorlos qian an harbin anda tailai mingshui qiqihar and fuyu near daqing city were selected as the sources of meteorological data for this study fig 2 2 2 3 other data corn yield fertilizer application volume pesticide dosage planting area and other data were taken from the china statistical heilongjiang statistical and daqing statistical yearbooks 3 methods 3 1 remote sensing image interpretation 3 1 1 image preprocessing the remote sensing images were downloaded according to the latitude and longitude of the study area the image resolution was 30 m 30 m the projection mode was universal transverse mercator the ellipsoid was wgs84 and the resampling method selected was cubic convolution the area of interest was established on the downloaded image and the image was sequentially subjected to band merging radiometric calibration atmospheric correction and image mosaic it was divided according to the study area vector graphics different multilayer stack display can enhance different ground objects according to the summary of predecessors envi idl 2013 landsat 7 and landsat 8 both have suitable multilayer stacks for agricultural vegetation classification the multilayer stack of landsat 7 is band 5 near infrared 1 55 1 75 μm band 4 near infrared 0 77 0 90 μm and band 1 visible 0 45 0 52 μm and the multilayer stack of landsat 8 is band 6 short wave infrared 1 1 57 1 65 μm band 5 near infrared 0 85 0 88 μm and band 2 blue 0 45 0 51 μm the images were stretched linearly by 2 fig 3 corn yield fertilizer application volume pesticide dosage planting area and other data were taken from the china statistical heilongjiang statistical and daqing statistical yearbooks 3 1 2 remote sensing image classification supervised classifications were determined to extract feature information from remote sensing images the field survey and visual interpretation were carried out in turn and the land cover types in daqing city were divided into seven categories corn fields paddy fields meadow forest urban areas saline alkali soil other land sand bare land other dryland crops and waters training samples were delineated according to land type 3 1 3 classifier selection currently the classifiers commonly used in the supervised classification of the environment for visualizing images include parallelepiped minimum distance mahalanobis distance deng et al 2014 likelihood classification neural net classification and support vector machine classification the support vector machine classifier has the characteristics of strong adaptability fast learning speed and a small requirement for training scale it has a high classification accuracy mountrakis et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 therefore the support vector machine classifier was selected 3 1 4 evaluation method selection the confusion matrix method is a widely used classification accuracy evaluation method for remote sensing applications and can directly summarize the main classification accuracy information smits et al 2010 therefore we chose the confusion matrix method to evaluate the classification results 3 1 5 evaluation method selection in the results of remote sensing interpretation classification some misclassified pixels will inevitably occur which need to be eliminated or reclassified currently commonly used methods are majority minority analysis clump and sieve the clump will cause some smaller regions of interest to be included in the larger region of interest resulting in some errors in the final classification results the sieve will result in unclassified pixels in the study area leading to a reduction in the overall area deng et al 2014 so we chose to perform a majority minority analysis 3 2 method for calculating effective precipitation the main source of water for dryland crop growth is precipitation but precipitation is a meteorological variable that is difficult to measure accurately tapiador et al 2012 the objective law of uneven spatial and temporal distribution determines that it cannot be calculated by conventional linear methods the meteorological station is the most direct means to obtain precipitation data however the meteorological station network is also irregularly distributed in space and it is difficult to truly reflect the spatial distribution of actual precipitation common methods for calculating the amount of surface precipitation include the calculation of the average method the equal precipitation line method the thiessen polygon method the triangle method and the grid interpolation method liu 2018 long and liao 2012 among them the thiessen polygon method is widely used in hydrology qin et al 2017 yoshikawa and shiozawa 2006 meteorology and other fields because of its simple principle convenient calculation and objective results chen et al 2019 the thiessen polygon method also known as vertical bisection or weighted averaging is a method of calculating average precipitation the method first divides the area into a large number of acute triangles by connecting adjacent precipitation stations then makes vertical bisectors in each of the triangles the intersecting vertical bisectors around each station form a polygon and the area of the polygon is calculated the ratio of the area to the basin is used as the precipitation weight coefficient of each polygon finally the precipitation of each station is multiplied by the weight of the area occupied by the station however the area that needs to be determined in this study is the corn field area in daqing city therefore two improvements were made to the calculation process first if the calculation of the precipitation weight is made using the administrative area of daqing city then the correlation between precipitation and corn production cannot be accurately reflected therefore this study will use the ratio of the corn field area of each thiessen polygon in the study area obtained by remote sensing to the total area of the corn field in the study area as the precipitation weight coefficient on each thiessen polygon second only some of the total precipitation in may september can be used by crops therefore it is necessary to calculate the effective precipitation for each thiessen polygon a previous study liu et al 2009 found that when using the usda soil conservation service recommended method to calculate effective precipitation the effective precipitation will be too small or too large when calculating the effective precipitation in days and months it is more appropriate to calculate the effective precipitation over 10 days therefore the effective precipitation in this study was calculated over 10 days the thiessen polygon calculation formula is as follows 1 p f 1 p 1 f 2 p 2 f n p n f 1 f 2 f n 1 f i 1 n f i p i i 1 n a i p i where p represents the average precipitation in the study area the unit is mm pn represents the precipitation of each thiessen polygon the unit is mm fi represents the area of corn field in each thiessen polygon the unit is km2 n represents the number of meteorological stations around the study area f represents the total area of corn field in the study area the unit is km2 ai represents the weight of the corn fields at each meteorological station the effective precipitation calculation formula is as follows 2 p e p d 125 0 6 p d 125 p d 250 3 m m 125 3 0 1 p d p d 250 3 m m where pe represents the effective precipitation over 10 d the unit is mm and pd represents the amount of precipitation over 10 days the unit is mm 3 3 quantitative relationship analysis method for corn yield and its influencing factors 3 3 1 method selection for the agricultural industry studying the impact of various production factors can not only save agricultural production costs but can also increase the overall production capacity studying the impact of various factors of production on agricultural production is actually to calculate their contribution to agricultural production at present the main methods used in academia are data envelopment yan 2019 c d production function li and li 2018 lunduka et al 2019 and solow residual moghaddasi and pour 2016 among them the c d production model is widely used because it is suitable for calculating long term estimations and is easy to calculate zhu et al 2018 the c d production function model is shown below 3 y a i 1 n x i b i where y represents crop yield a represents an undetermined coefficient i represents the ith factor affecting crop yield n represents the total number of factors affecting crop yield xi represents the ith impact factor input and bi represents the elastic coefficient of the ith influence factor 3 3 2 impact factor screening there are various influencing factors on corn yield the necessary comprehensive selection of the indicators is difficult to achieve in practice therefore it is necessary to select the dominant factors from many influencing factors at the same time to avoid collinearity the indicators selected in this paper were direct influencing factors and indirect factors were not considered therefore based on the degree of impact on corn production the difficulty of data collection and the actual situation of agricultural production in daqing city referring to the indicators in the statistical yearbook the influencing factors were determined to be the amounts of chemical fertilizers and pesticides applied the amount of effective precipitation and the size of the corn planting area 4 results 4 1 remote sensing interpretation results in 2001 most of the corn fields were distributed in the southern part of the study area especially in the southeastern region by 2014 except for the corn fields distributed in the southeastern region the northern regions also had a wide distribution from 2001 to 2014 there were 629 41 km2 of corn fields were converted into six other types of land use 460 35 km2 were converted into meadow forest 89 04 km2 into other land 53 59 km2 into paddy fields 14 56 km2 into urban areas 8 58 km2 into waters and 2 99 km2 into saline alkali soil the conversion area accounted for 33 73 of the corn field area in 2001 by 2014 a total of 4368 89 km2 of land had been converted into corn fields including 147 39 km2 of urban areas 15 19 km2 of saline alkali soil 23 82 km2 of paddy fields 3479 13 km2 of meadow forest 692 43 km2 of other land and 9 93 km2 of waters corn field area converted from other types of land use accounted for 77 94 of the total area of corn fields in 2014 according to the classification results the cornfield area increased from 1866 03 km2 in 2001 to 5603 12 km2 in 2014 table 1 fig 4 shows the land use classifications of daqing city in 2001 and 2014 table 1 the closer the overall accuracy of the classification and the kappa coefficient are to 1 the more reliable the remote sensing result is deng et al 2014 warrens 2016 and the classification results were evaluated using a confusion matrix the overall accuracy coefficients of 2001 and 2014 were 96 40 and 99 67 respectively which were both greater than 95 the kappa coefficients of 2001 and 2014 were both greater than 0 9 at 0 9500 and 0 9930 respectively therefore the interpretation of the remote sensing data in this study was reasonable and reliable 4 2 effective precipitation calculation results the thiessen polygons for 2001 and 2014 are shown in fig 5 the ratio of corn field area in each thiessen polygon to the total corn field area in the study area was calculated as the precipitation weight of each thiessen polygon the seven types of land use present in 2001 and 2014 are shown in tables 2 and 3 as seen in tables 2 and 3 the total area error between 2001 and 2014 was less than 1 consequently the interpretation accuracy meets the requirements and the results are credible from 2001 2014 the rate of corn change in each year is unknown so in this study it is assumed that the annual rate of change of the cornfield area in each thiessen polygon is constant the proportional weights of the thiessen polygon on corn fields are shown in table 4 according to the precipitation recorded at the meteorological stations and the weight of precipitation the proportion of corn fields from 2001 to 2014 the annual effective precipitation of the study area was obtained table 5 4 3 analysis of factors affecting corn yield according to the collected corn yield corn planting area the amounts of chemical fertilizers and pesticides applied and the effective precipitation required for corn planting the input amounts of various material elements such as fertilizers were obtained table 6 the c d production function model was used to estimate the main influencing factors of corn production in daqing city the basic formula was as follows 4 y a c α p β r γ l δ the model expression obtained by logarithm transformation was as follows 5 ln y ln a α ln c β ln p γ ln r δ ln l where y represents corn yield as a dependent variable a represents the comprehensive technical level of the base period which is a constant term c represents the amount of chemical fertilizer applied p represents the amount of pesticide applied r represents the effective precipitation l represents the planting area and α β γ δ and ε represent their production elasticity levels respectively substituting the 2001 2014 data into the c d production model yielded the results the model s r2 value was 0 958 adjusted r2 value was 0 940 f test value was 51 93 and durbin watson value was 2 234 the coefficients are shown in table 7 according to the results in table 7 the model s expression was as follows 6 ln y 3 934 0 796 ln c 0 423 ln p 0 384 ln r 0 484 ln l the model was tested using the statistical data in the above tables the adjusted r2 value was 0 94 indicating that 94 of the corn yield increase effect was related to changes in fertilizer pesticide precipitation and planting area the t test value of each of the influencing factors except the constant term was not greater than its critical value t 1 4 at a significance level of 0 1 for agricultural production fertilizers pesticides land and precipitation are all indispensable moreover each variable had a significant effect on corn yield according to the durbin watson test there was no autocorrelation among the influencing factors therefore the results were retained model analysis 1 the sum of the output elasticity of each input factor was greater than 1 and it was positive indicating that the growth rate of corn production in daqing city is greater than the speed of corn material input thus corn planting in daqing city is in a sustainable growth stage and has the potential for increased grain production 2 although the t test values for chemical fertilizers pesticides planting area and precipitation were not significant the coefficients are positive indicating that these four variables have positive impacts on corn yield 3 according to standardization coefficients the order of influence for the various factors on corn yield is pesticide application amount planting area fertilizer application amount precipitation amount 5 discussion in the past most studies on agricultural precipitation were conducted directly with meteorological station data but the spatial distribution characteristics of farmland were neglected there is also satellite remote sensing for the indirect detection of precipitation but it is not sensitive enough to distinguish between light and heavy precipitation liu et al 2011 therefore this study proposed a feasible and effective method that can be used as an estimation for precision agriculture and seasonal crop area first the thiessen polygons were established using the locations of the meteorological stations near the study area and then the spatial distribution of the farmland as determined by satellite remote sensing was used to calculate the weight of the corn field area in each thiessen polygon the ratio of the corn field area to the total corn field area then the weight of the polygon area of thiessen polygon was replaced by the weight of the corn field area to calculate the effective precipitation of the farmland in order to understand the difference between the new method and the traditional method in calculating the effective precipitation this study also used the traditional thiessen polygon method to calculate the multi year effective precipitation in daqing city the traditional thiessen polygon weights are shown in table 8 then use the meteorological station precipitation traditional weights and formula 2 to calculate traditional effective precipitation compared with the traditional calculation of precipitation using the weight of the thiessen polygon the accuracy of effective precipitation calculated using the weight of the corn field increased by 0 01 11 in daqing city as is shown in table 9 although the method of using remote sensing interpretation plus meteorological station data to determine effective precipitation is more accurate than traditional effective precipitation there are still some problems the first is the accuracy of the remote sensing interpretation the interpretation of general farmland requires visual interpretation plus supervised classification the visual interpretation depends largely on the degree of human recognition of remote sensing features and the resolution of the images e g only 30 m for multispectral landsat 7 and 9 images moreover the location and number of samples selected will also affect the final supervised classification results second meteorological stations are also affected by wind evaporation environmental noise and the size and distribution of raindrops when recording precipitation michaelides et al 2009 and the distribution and failure of meteorological stations also affects the research from the results of the c d production function it can be understood that the production elasticity of the pesticide application amount was 0 423 indicating that for every 1 increase in the pesticide application rate the corn output was increased by 0 423 the pesticides used in daqing city are mainly herbicides and insecticides as seen in table 6 the increase in the rate of pesticide application was greater than the growth rate of the planting area this indicates that the increase in corn production is effective however it also indicates that the resistance of weeds and pests is increasing forcing the increased application of pesticides whether the utilization efficiency of pesticides is improving requires further research the planting area had a positive effect on the output of corn for every 1 increase in planting area the corn output increased by 0 484 the output elasticity of chemical fertilizers was 0 796 as the most obvious factor influencing the increase in corn planting yield the increased rate of fertilizer application was obviously less than that of planting area indicating that the application efficiency of fertilizers has improved the impact of precipitation on corn yield was small mainly because daqing city is in a semi arid area consequently most of the planted corn varieties are drought tolerant varieties with low demands for precipitation however precipitation is still an indispensable input factor for corn cultivation although this paper only analyzed the material influencing factors of corn production it provides significant guidance for agricultural production in daqing city in the agricultural production process the influencing factors included not only water fertilizer and pesticides at the input end but also factors such as climate jagustović et al 2019 soil quality akhtar et al 2018 labor costs agricultural subsidies and food price fluctuations majumder et al 2012 therefore further research is needed on the quantification of various non material influence factors of precision agriculture 6 conclusions this study quantified the factors affecting corn production in daqing city the innovation of this research was to combine satellite remote sensing with meteorological station data to calculate the effective precipitation of farmland compared with traditional effective precipitation calculation methods the accuracy increased by 0 01 11 in the past precipitation was calculated either by using satellite remote sensing technology or by using ground meteorological station data few studies used the combination of satellite remote sensing technology and ground meteorological station data to calculate precipitation this paper introduces and demonstrates the feasibility of this method using the c d production function model the water energy grain feeding mechanism of daqing city was quantitatively studied the standardization coefficients show that the amount of pesticide used played a decisive role in increasing corn production followed by the area planted and the amount of fertilizer used although precipitation had the least impact on grain production it is also indispensable according to the simulation results appropriate increases in the applications of pesticides and fertilizers can still increase food yields but science based chemical fertilizer and pesticide application guidelines are needed to avoid polluting the soil groundwater and rivers daqing city is located in a semi arid area with a low annual precipitation but there are many rivers lakes and reservoirs which can increase the irrigated corn field area to increase corn yield marek et al 2016 in future research we plan to improve the c d production function model by collecting more meteorological and agricultural economic data to provide guidance for the sustainable production of corn in daqing city there are also some difficulties encountered in conducting this research 1 because the area of this study area is large it is necessary to integrate three remote sensing images to show the entire study area because there is cloud interference when merging the remote sensing images of the same day only three remote sensing images with similar dates can be screened during the corn maturity period early august to the end of september for example in the three remote sensing images in 2014 two were september 24 and one was september 15 this affects the accuracy of remote sensing interpretation to a certain extent 2 in the process of screening 2000 2015 images only remote sensing images of 2001 and 2014 were obtained because remote sensing images of other years have more or less problems therefore when calculating the weight of the corn field in each thiessen polygon it can only be assumed that the change rate of the corn field area is constant which affects the amount of effective precipitation in the final calendar year to some extent funding this work was

10780,this paper presents an analysis of the quantitative correlations between corn yield and its influencing factors in daqing city china by establishing a cobb douglas production function model the

varied in different corn planting regions in china zhao et al 2018 even in the same province corn yield will vary owing to factors such as accumulated temperature planting scale and soil texture jiang et al 2019 daqing city is located in the first accumulated temperature zone in heilongjiang province china an area suitable for corn planting and a main corn growing region zhu et al 2014 corn yield increased rapidly from 2000 to 2013 but started to decline in 2014 in this study corn yield was used as a research target and the factors affecting corn yield in 2001 2014 in daqing city a semi arid region of northeast china were collected by constructing a cobb douglas c d production function model a quantitative analysis of the correlations between corn yield and various influencing factors was performed and feasible changes were proposed to promote corn yield in daqing city the proposed correction method is unique in the following respects precipitation was calculated using a thiessen polygon this is different from the previously used weight calculation of a thiessen polygon area in this study the spatial distribution structure of the corn fields was obtained using a remote sensing interpretation method and the precipitation was calculated using the weight of the corn field area in a thiessen polygon which improved the accuracy of the actual precipitation used in corn planting 2 study area and data collection 2 1 study area daqing city is located in the west of heilongjiang province fig 1 with a geographical position between 45 22 and 47 28 north latitude and 123 44 to 125 48 east longitude and a total area of 21 000 square kilometers the study area belongs to the first accumulated temperature zone in heilongjiang province above 2700 c with an annual average temperature of

approved by the national bureau of statistics however owing to the disadvantage of agricultural planting dispersion spatial and temporal variability shi et al 2015 and inconsistent statistical methods the coherence of data not very accurate remote sensing image is an important means to obtain ground information high and medium resolution remote sensing images can be obtained by satellite airplane and radar through image analysis people can get the information they need agricultural remote sensing promotes agricultural production management and research from the traditional extensive stage to the precise stage zhao 2014 precision agriculture refers to the use of satellite data to investigate the current situation of farmland area and distribution and to monitor crop growth soil water content and other information agricultural quantitative remote sensing as one of the core of precision agriculture huang et al 2018 tang 2018 is widely used in agricultural resources survey crop yield estimation agricultural disaster monitoring etc chen et al 2016 in recent years with the emergence of various satellites with high spatial temporal and spectral resolution such as theos satellite radi 2011a eros b satellite radi 2011b optisar satellite constellation fox et al 2017 the accuracy of crop remote sensing identification classification land use and cover change monitoring has been constantly improved liu et al 2018 and agricultural quantitative remote sensing technology has been further developed in addition to remote sensing data meteorological and agricultural data availability was important in the selection of study time periods meteorological and agricultural data are obtained through meteorological stations and yearbooks when selecting remote sensing data it is necessary to avoid changes in ground cover type caused by geological meteorological disasters wang et al 2016 anthropogenic effectives seasonal differentiations etc and the imaging season of remote sensing image directly affects the quality of interpretation so it is necessary to select remote sensing images during the growing period of crops to interpret the image according to the attributes of the objects themselves and the differences between different regions of the same objects the optimum time is august september at this time corn crops are close to maturity but there is no harvest so it is convenient to distinguish different crops yang and liu 2008 while avoiding cloud cover poor image quality and other negative factors after screening two images were selected from 2001 and 2014 therefore the time period for this study was determined to be 2001 2014 2 2 1 remote sensing data the remote sensing images of the crop growth period show the types of ground objects more clearly therefore this paper selected a remote sensing image of the plant growth period may september for interpretation remote sensing images data set is provided by geospatial data cloud site computer network information center chinese academy of sciences http www gscloud cn because remote sensing images are interfered by the factors such as resolution and cloudiness only two images were screened from those of 2000 2014 they were taken on august 11 2001 and september 24 2014 and had image cloud cover of less than 1 the image of 2001 was selected from landsat 7 and the image of 2014 was selected from landsat 8 2 2 2 meteorological data eight meteorological stations qian gorlos qian an harbin anda tailai mingshui qiqihar and fuyu near daqing city were selected as the sources of meteorological data for this study fig 2 2 2 3 other data corn yield fertilizer application volume pesticide dosage planting area and other data were taken from the china statistical heilongjiang statistical and daqing statistical yearbooks 3 methods 3 1 remote sensing image interpretation 3 1 1 image preprocessing the remote sensing images were downloaded according to the latitude and longitude of the study area the image resolution was 30 m 30 m the projection mode was universal transverse mercator the ellipsoid was wgs84 and the resampling method selected was cubic convolution the area of interest was established on the downloaded image and the image was sequentially subjected to band merging radiometric calibration atmospheric correction and image mosaic it was divided according to the study area vector graphics different multilayer stack display can enhance different ground objects according to the summary of predecessors envi idl 2013 landsat 7 and landsat 8 both have suitable multilayer stacks for agricultural vegetation classification the multilayer stack of landsat 7 is band 5 near infrared 1 55 1 75 μm band 4 near infrared 0 77 0 90 μm and band 1 visible 0 45 0 52 μm and the multilayer stack of landsat 8 is band 6 short wave infrared 1 1 57 1 65 μm band 5 near infrared 0 85 0 88 μm and band 2 blue 0 45 0 51 μm the images were stretched linearly by 2 fig 3 corn yield fertilizer application volume pesticide dosage planting area and other data were taken from the china statistical heilongjiang statistical and daqing statistical yearbooks 3 1 2 remote sensing image classification supervised classifications were determined to extract feature information from remote sensing images the field survey and visual interpretation were carried out in turn and the land cover types in daqing city were divided into seven categories corn fields paddy fields meadow forest urban areas saline alkali soil other land sand bare land other dryland crops and waters training samples were delineated according to land type 3 1 3 classifier selection currently the classifiers commonly used in the supervised classification of the environment for visualizing images include parallelepiped minimum distance mahalanobis distance deng et al 2014 likelihood classification neural net classification and support vector machine classification the support vector machine classifier has the characteristics of strong adaptability fast learning speed and a small requirement for training scale it has a high classification accuracy mountrakis et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 therefore the support vector machine classifier was selected 3 1 4 evaluation method selection the confusion matrix method is a widely used classification accuracy evaluation method for remote sensing applications and can directly summarize the main classification accuracy information smits et al 2010 therefore we chose the confusion matrix method to evaluate the classification results 3 1 5 evaluation method selection in the results of remote sensing interpretation classification some misclassified pixels will inevitably occur which need to be eliminated or reclassified currently commonly used methods are majority minority analysis clump and sieve the clump will cause some smaller regions of interest to be included in the larger region of interest resulting in some errors in the final classification results the sieve will result in unclassified pixels in the study area leading to a reduction in the overall area deng et al 2014 so we chose to perform a majority minority analysis 3 2 method for calculating effective precipitation the main source of water for dryland crop growth is precipitation but precipitation is a meteorological variable that is difficult to measure accurately tapiador et al 2012 the objective law of uneven spatial and temporal distribution determines that it cannot be calculated by conventional linear methods the meteorological station is the most direct means to obtain precipitation data however the meteorological station network is also irregularly distributed in space and it is difficult to truly reflect the spatial distribution of actual precipitation common methods for calculating the amount of surface precipitation include the calculation of the average method the equal precipitation line method the thiessen polygon method the triangle method and the grid interpolation method liu 2018 long and liao 2012 among them the thiessen polygon method is widely used in hydrology qin et al 2017 yoshikawa and shiozawa 2006 meteorology and other fields because of its simple principle convenient calculation and objective results chen et al 2019 the thiessen polygon method also known as vertical bisection or weighted averaging is a method of calculating average precipitation the method first divides the area into a large number of acute triangles by connecting adjacent precipitation stations then makes vertical bisectors in each of the triangles the intersecting vertical bisectors around each station form a polygon and the area of the polygon is calculated the ratio of the area to the basin is used as the precipitation weight coefficient of each polygon finally the precipitation of each station is multiplied by the weight of the area occupied by the station however the area that needs to be determined in this study is the corn field area in daqing city therefore two improvements were made to the calculation process first if the calculation of the precipitation weight is made using the administrative area of daqing city then the correlation between precipitation and corn production cannot be accurately reflected therefore this study will use the ratio of the corn field area of each thiessen polygon in the study area obtained by remote sensing to the total area of the corn field in the study area as the precipitation weight coefficient on each thiessen polygon second only some of the total precipitation in may september can be used by crops therefore it is necessary to calculate the effective precipitation for each thiessen polygon a previous study liu et al 2009 found that when using the usda soil conservation service recommended method to calculate effective precipitation the effective precipitation will be too small or too large when calculating the effective precipitation in days and months it is more appropriate to calculate the effective precipitation over 10 days therefore the effective precipitation in this study was calculated over 10 days the thiessen polygon calculation formula is as follows 1 p f 1 p 1 f 2 p 2 f n p n f 1 f 2 f n 1 f i 1 n f i p i i 1 n a i p i where p represents the average precipitation in the study area the unit is mm pn represents the precipitation of each thiessen polygon the unit is mm fi represents the area of corn field in each thiessen polygon the unit is km2 n represents the number of meteorological stations around the study area f represents the total area of corn field in the study area the unit is km2 ai represents the weight of the corn fields at each meteorological station the effective precipitation calculation formula is as follows 2 p e p d 125 0 6 p d 125 p d 250 3 m m 125 3 0 1 p d p d 250 3 m m where pe represents the effective precipitation over 10 d the unit is mm and pd represents the amount of precipitation over 10 days the unit is mm 3 3 quantitative relationship analysis method for corn yield and its influencing factors 3 3 1 method selection for the agricultural industry studying the impact of various production factors can not only save agricultural production costs but can also increase the overall production capacity studying the impact of various factors of production on agricultural production is actually to calculate their contribution to agricultural production at present the main methods used in academia are data envelopment yan 2019 c d production function li and li 2018 lunduka et al 2019 and solow residual moghaddasi and pour 2016 among them the c d production model is widely used because it is suitable for calculating long term estimations and is easy to calculate zhu et al 2018 the c d production function model is shown below 3 y a i 1 n x i b i where y represents crop yield a represents an undetermined coefficient i represents the ith factor affecting crop yield n represents the total number of factors affecting crop yield xi represents the ith impact factor input and bi represents the elastic coefficient of the ith influence factor 3 3 2 impact factor screening there are various influencing factors on corn yield the necessary comprehensive selection of the indicators is difficult to achieve in practice therefore it is necessary to select the dominant factors from many influencing factors at the same time to avoid collinearity the indicators selected in this paper were direct influencing factors and indirect factors were not considered therefore based on the degree of impact on corn production the difficulty of data collection and the actual situation of agricultural production in daqing city referring to the indicators in the statistical yearbook the influencing factors were determined to be the amounts of chemical fertilizers and pesticides applied the amount of effective precipitation and the size of the corn planting area 4 results 4 1 remote sensing interpretation results in 2001 most of the corn fields were distributed in the southern part of the study area especially in the southeastern region by 2014 except for the corn fields distributed in the southeastern region the northern regions also had a wide distribution from 2001 to 2014 there were 629 41 km2 of corn fields were converted into six other types of land use 460 35 km2 were converted into meadow forest 89 04 km2 into other land 53 59 km2 into paddy fields 14 56 km2 into urban areas 8 58 km2 into waters and 2 99 km2 into saline alkali soil the conversion area accounted for 33 73 of the corn field area in 2001 by 2014 a total of 4368 89 km2 of land had been converted into corn fields including 147 39 km2 of urban areas 15 19 km2 of saline alkali soil 23 82 km2 of paddy fields 3479 13 km2 of meadow forest 692 43 km2 of other land and 9 93 km2 of waters corn field area converted from other types of land use accounted for 77 94 of the total area of corn fields in 2014 according to the classification results the cornfield area increased from 1866 03 km2 in 2001 to 5603 12 km2 in 2014 table 1 fig 4 shows the land use classifications of daqing city in 2001 and 2014 table 1 the closer the overall accuracy of the classification and the kappa coefficient are to 1 the more reliable the remote sensing result is deng et al 2014 warrens 2016 and the classification results were evaluated using a confusion matrix the overall accuracy coefficients of 2001 and 2014 were 96 40 and 99 67 respectively which were both greater than 95 the kappa coefficients of 2001 and 2014 were both greater than 0 9 at 0 9500 and 0 9930 respectively therefore the interpretation of the remote sensing data in this study was reasonable and reliable 4 2 effective precipitation calculation results the thiessen polygons for 2001 and 2014 are shown in fig 5 the ratio of corn field area in each thiessen polygon to the total corn field area in the study area was calculated as the precipitation weight of each thiessen polygon the seven types of land use present in 2001 and 2014 are shown in tables 2 and 3 as seen in tables 2 and 3 the total area error between 2001 and 2014 was less than 1 consequently the interpretation accuracy meets the requirements and the results are credible from 2001 2014 the rate of corn change in each year is unknown so in this study it is assumed that the annual rate of change of the cornfield area in each thiessen polygon is constant the proportional weights of the thiessen polygon on corn fields are shown in table 4 according to the precipitation recorded at the meteorological stations and the weight of precipitation the proportion of corn fields from 2001 to 2014 the annual effective precipitation of the study area was obtained table 5 4 3 analysis of factors affecting corn yield according to the collected corn yield corn planting area the amounts of chemical fertilizers and pesticides applied and the effective precipitation required for corn planting the input amounts of various material elements such as fertilizers were obtained table 6 the c d production function model was used to estimate the main influencing factors of corn production in daqing city the basic formula was as follows 4 y a c α p β r γ l δ the model expression obtained by logarithm transformation was as follows 5 ln y ln a α ln c β ln p γ ln r δ ln l where y represents corn yield as a dependent variable a represents the comprehensive technical level of the base period which is a constant term c represents the amount of chemical fertilizer applied p represents the amount of pesticide applied r represents the effective precipitation l represents the planting area and α β γ δ and ε represent their production elasticity levels respectively substituting the 2001 2014 data into the c d production model yielded the results the model s r2 value was 0 958 adjusted r2 value was 0 940 f test value was 51 93 and durbin watson value was 2 234 the coefficients are shown in table 7 according to the results in table 7 the model s expression was as follows 6 ln y 3 934 0 796 ln c 0 423 ln p 0 384 ln r 0 484 ln l the model was tested using the statistical data in the above tables the adjusted r2 value was 0 94 indicating that 94 of the corn yield increase effect was related to changes in fertilizer pesticide precipitation and planting area the t test value of each of the influencing factors except the constant term was not greater than its critical value t 1 4 at a significance level of 0 1 for agricultural production fertilizers pesticides land and precipitation are all indispensable moreover each variable had a significant effect on corn yield according to the durbin watson test there was no autocorrelation among the influencing factors therefore the results were retained model analysis 1 the sum of the output elasticity of each input factor was greater than 1 and it was positive indicating that the growth rate of corn production in daqing city is greater than the speed of corn material input thus corn planting in daqing city is in a sustainable growth stage and has the potential for increased grain production 2 although the t test values for chemical fertilizers pesticides planting area and precipitation were not significant the coefficients are positive indicating that these four variables have positive impacts on corn yield 3 according to standardization coefficients the order of influence for the various factors on corn yield is pesticide application amount planting area fertilizer application amount precipitation amount 5 discussion in the past most studies on agricultural precipitation were conducted directly with meteorological station data but the spatial distribution characteristics of farmland were neglected there is also satellite remote sensing for the indirect detection of precipitation but it is not sensitive enough to distinguish between light and heavy precipitation liu et al 2011 therefore this study proposed a feasible and effective method that can be used as an estimation for precision agriculture and seasonal crop area first the thiessen polygons were established using the locations of the meteorological stations near the study area and then the spatial distribution of the farmland as determined by satellite remote sensing was used to calculate the weight of the corn field area in each thiessen polygon the ratio of the corn field area to the total corn field area then the weight of the polygon area of thiessen polygon was replaced by the weight of the corn field area to calculate the effective precipitation of the farmland in order to understand the difference between the new method and the traditional method in calculating the effective precipitation this study also used the traditional thiessen polygon method to calculate the multi year effective precipitation in daqing city the traditional thiessen polygon weights are shown in table 8 then use the meteorological station precipitation traditional weights and formula 2 to calculate traditional effective precipitation compared with the traditional calculation of precipitation using the weight of the thiessen polygon the accuracy of effective precipitation calculated using the weight of the corn field increased by 0 01 11 in daqing city as is shown in table 9 although the method of using remote sensing interpretation plus meteorological station data to determine effective precipitation is more accurate than traditional effective precipitation there are still some problems the first is the accuracy of the remote sensing interpretation the interpretation of general farmland requires visual interpretation plus supervised classification the visual interpretation depends largely on the degree of human recognition of remote sensing features and the resolution of the images e g only 30 m for multispectral landsat 7 and 9 images moreover the location and number of samples selected will also affect the final supervised classification results second meteorological stations are also affected by wind evaporation environmental noise and the size and distribution of raindrops when recording precipitation michaelides et al 2009 and the distribution and failure of meteorological stations also affects the research from the results of the c d production function it can be understood that the production elasticity of the pesticide application amount was 0 423 indicating that for every 1 increase in the pesticide application rate the corn output was increased by 0 423 the pesticides used in daqing city are mainly herbicides and insecticides as seen in table 6 the increase in the rate of pesticide application was greater than the growth rate of the planting area this indicates that the increase in corn production is effective however it also indicates that the resistance of weeds and pests is increasing forcing the increased application of pesticides whether the utilization efficiency of pesticides is improving requires further research the planting area had a positive effect on the output of corn for every 1 increase in planting area the corn output increased by 0 484 the output elasticity of chemical fertilizers was 0 796 as the most obvious factor influencing the increase in corn planting yield the increased rate of fertilizer application was obviously less than that of planting area indicating that the application efficiency of fertilizers has improved the impact of precipitation on corn yield was small mainly because daqing city is in a semi arid area consequently most of the planted corn varieties are drought tolerant varieties with low demands for precipitation however precipitation is still an indispensable input factor for corn cultivation although this paper only analyzed the material influencing factors of corn production it provides significant guidance for agricultural production in daqing city in the agricultural production process the influencing factors included not only water fertilizer and pesticides at the input end but also factors such as climate jagustović et al 2019 soil quality akhtar et al 2018 labor costs agricultural subsidies and food price fluctuations majumder et al 2012 therefore further research is needed on the quantification of various non material influence factors of precision agriculture 6 conclusions this study quantified the factors affecting corn production in daqing city the innovation of this research was to combine satellite remote sensing with meteorological station data to calculate the effective precipitation of farmland compared with traditional effective precipitation calculation methods the accuracy increased by 0 01 11 in the past precipitation was calculated either by using satellite remote sensing technology or by using ground meteorological station data few studies used the combination of satellite remote sensing technology and ground meteorological station data to calculate precipitation this paper introduces and demonstrates the feasibility of this method using the c d production function model the water energy grain feeding mechanism of daqing city was quantitatively studied the standardization coefficients show that the amount of pesticide used played a decisive role in increasing corn production followed by the area planted and the amount of fertilizer used although precipitation had the least impact on grain production it is also indispensable according to the simulation results appropriate increases in the applications of pesticides and fertilizers can still increase food yields but science based chemical fertilizer and pesticide application guidelines are needed to avoid polluting the soil groundwater and rivers daqing city is located in a semi arid area with a low annual precipitation but there are many rivers lakes and reservoirs which can increase the irrigated corn field area to increase corn yield marek et al 2016 in future research we plan to improve the c d production function model by collecting more meteorological and agricultural economic data to provide guidance for the sustainable production of corn in daqing city there are also some difficulties encountered in conducting this research 1 because the area of this study area is large it is necessary to integrate three remote sensing images to show the entire study area because there is cloud interference when merging the remote sensing images of the same day only three remote sensing images with similar dates can be screened during the corn maturity period early august to the end of september for example in the three remote sensing images in 2014 two were september 24 and one was september 15 this affects the accuracy of remote sensing interpretation to a certain extent 2 in the process of screening 2000 2015 images only remote sensing images of 2001 and 2014 were obtained because remote sensing images of other years have more or less problems therefore when calculating the weight of the corn field in each thiessen polygon it can only be assumed that the change rate of the corn field area is constant which affects the amount of effective precipitation in the final calendar year to some extent funding this work was

10781,the paper presents a model based optimization scheme for allocation of cropping areas and water the novelty of the scheme is that rather than using highly simplified models of crop response to deficit irrigation detailed dynamic models of crop soil atmosphere interactions are used to determine the crop water productivity function while the use of such models has traditionally been considered as prohibitive in terms of computation time the current scheme circumvents this limitation by using each model independently in a simple multi objective optimization procedure outside of the main optimization procedure once the optimization problem dealing with land and water allocation has been solved the same models are used to compute optimal irrigation schedules for each crop at each location during the season a simplified version of the optimization scheme can be used to update water allocation in response to discrepancies between the actual and forecasted weather or factors such as changes in water quota or crop prices the proposed scheme is illustrated for a hypothetical farm with four fields near davis ca the model aquacrop is used to determine optimal cropping and water allocation for simultaneous cultivation of maize and sunflower at that farm keywords aquacrop deficit irrigation irrigation scheduling optimal cropping simulation optimization modeling 1 introduction the combination of increasing water scarcity on the one hand and increasing food demand on the other hand poses great challenges to agriculture and it is imperative to develop tools that will help farmers use irrigation water more efficiently broadly speaking farmers must make two types of decisions strategic decisions such as what field or acreage to plant sow with what crop when to plant sow what kind of irrigation system to install etc and tactical decisions such as irrigation scheduling the main difference between these two types of decisions is that while strategic decisions must be made before the beginning of the season and are irreversible tactical decisions can be reviewed and modified during the season this ability to adjust tactical decisions is especially important due to the large uncertainties associated with factors such as weather forecasts crop value or in some regions water quotas while these two types of decisions are typically considered separately and solved using different approaches and different crop models the present paper describes a unified approach that is suitable for both types of problems numerous studies have been devoted to the general problem of land and water allocation to agriculture and potentially other users with conflicting interests which is not fundamentally different from the farmer s strategic level most of these studies followed the so called simulation optimization framework according to which models are used to predict the outcome of some management decisions and an optimizer is used to determine the set of optimal decisions schütze et al 2012 singh 2014 nguyen et al 2017 reviews of the relevant literature can be found in singh 2012 2014 these studies were conducted from the point of view of water managers or planning agencies and focused on allocation of land sometimes referred to as cropping pattern and water at the regional water district scale a characteristic common to almost all these studies is that they relied on overly simplistic models of crop yield in fact some studies did not consider deficit irrigation at all and required or assumed that all crop water demands are met e g sethi et al 2006 das et al 2015 singh 2015 those that did consider deficit irrigation assumed very simplistic relationships between water availability and yield reduction e g paul et al 2000 shangguan et al 2002 kuo et al 2003 prasad et al 2006 sahoo et al 2006 garg and dadhich 2014 the justification given for using oversimplified models is that models that describe crop soil atmosphere interactions accurately such as aquacrop raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 stics brisson et al 1998 2002 swap kroes et al 2000 and which are commonly used to determine irrigation scheduling e g saseendran et al 2008 vazifedoust et al 2008 he et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 nguyen et al 2017 jamal et al 2018 require excessive computation times a notable exception is the work of rafiee and shourian 2016 who used swat in their study that focused on optimal irrigation and crop pattern in the azadegan plain iran however rafiee and shourian 2016 formulated the optimization problem in such a way that it required running the swat models for each land water combination investigated by the optimization procedure see their figure 5 this kind of formulation leads to thousands of model runs even for relatively small problems by comparison in the approach described in the present work the crop soil atmosphere dynamic models are used outside of the main optimization procedure in order to generate irrigation yield relationships water productivity functions which are then used to solve the water and land allocation problem in this sense the present procedure is overall very similar to the traditional formulation e g garg and dadhich 2014 but with much more accurate irrigation yield relationships another advantage of the proposed formulation is that while the overall optimization problem is traditionally formulated as consisting of several layers and different models are used in each layer e g paul et al 2000 shangguan et al 2002 the present approach is readily applicable to both the strategic level and the tactical level i e irrigation scheduling 2 methodology 2 1 basic formulation the basic formulation of the proposed framework in given in eq 1 5 1 max a i j w i j z j 1 m i k j p i a i j y i j w i j α p w j 1 m i k j a i j w i j ω subject to 2 i 1 n j l i α a i j w i j w 3 i k j a i j a j j 4 w i j w ˆ i j i j 5 a i j 0 i j eq 1 corresponds to the net profit which has to be maximized while eqs 2 5 express the constraints that have to be satisfied by any acceptable solution in these equations p i kg is the value of crop i a i j m2 is the area of field j allocated to crop i y i j w i j ω kg m2 denotes the maximal yield of crop i that can be obtained on field j using the amount of irrigation water w i j mm under the weather ω p w is the price of water m3 and α is a conversion factor 10 3 m mm the number of fields considered in the analysis is m and the set k j consists of the indices of all the crops that can be grown on field j so that z is the difference between the value of the crops yields and the irrigation costs eq 2 expresses the constraint on the seasonal water quota n denotes the number of crops considered l i is the set containing the indices of all the fields that can be used to grow crop i and w m3 is the seasonal water quota eq 3 ensures that the area of each field j denoted a j m2 is not exceeded in equation 4 w ˆ i j mm denotes the irrigation which has already been applied so that this constraint ensures that the seasonal irrigation is not lower than the irrigation applied before the current day eq 5 ensures trivial non negativity of allocated areas clearly when optimizing only irrigation amounts while assuming that crop areas are given tactical level constraint 5 is no longer relevant and in eq 1 maximization is performed only on w i j the main novelty in the present study is the way the relationship between irrigation and yield of each crop y i j w i j ω is determined as mentioned above in most studies related to water allocation this relationship is assumed to be given a priori based for instance on literature or best practice tables such relationships or ad hoc models are very crude approximations and fail to capture the complex relationships that exist between crop soil weather and irrigation management in the present work rather than using such a priori given functions the water productivity function wpf are estimated for each specific crop soil combination using a dynamic crop model together with a model based multi objective framework inspired from the one described in linker and kisekka 2017 briefly this multi objective framework can be summarized as follows given a crop model and weather sequence covering the whole season the growing season is split into n intervals and a deficit irrigation threshold t k is associated with each interval i e whenever the soil water content reaches the threshold a predetermined amount of water a mm is applied optimal combinations of these n irrigation thresholds are determined by solving 6 max t 1 t 2 t n k i k y t 1 t 2 t n where y t 1 t 2 t n denotes the yield predicted by the dynamic crop model and i k denotes the irrigation events which result from the threshold sequence t 1 t 2 t n the multi objective problem defined in eq 6 has an infinite number of optimal solutions that correspond to irrigation yield combinations which are such that one variable can be improved only by worsening the other in optimization terminology these points are the so called non dominated solutions and form the pareto front of the problem for the purpose of land and water allocation these non dominated solutions provide an approximation of the crop water productivity function wpf the reader is referred to linker et al 2016 and linker and kisekka 2017 for additional details the general flowchart of the complete procedure is presented in fig 1 assuming n s soils fields and n c crops the first step consists of solving n s n c multi objective optimization problem eq 6 the product of each optimization is a set of non dominated irrigation yield combinations that can be approximated by a second degree polynomial this polynomial provides the approximation of the crop water productivity function needed for optimal allocation of land and water the second step consists of solving the simultaneous area and water allocation problem eqs 1 5 in most practical cases the raw optimal solution would not be suitable as is for a farmer who would take into account additional operational constraints such as for instance the desire not to fragment fields or not grow crop on too small an area although in theory such constraints could be included in the problem definition the list of such constraints could be quite long and it would be unrealistic to require from the farmer to think ahead of time of all the constraints and formulate them adequately to avoid such a problem the present mathematical formulation is kept as simple as possible with the implicit assumption that the farmer will use the optimal solution as a starting point to which adjustments can be made more specifically the farmer should make adjustments to the area allocations after which the optimal water allocation is recomputed the strategic level planning ends once an acceptable solution from farmer s point of view has been obtained the optimal irrigation schedule corresponding to the desired water amount is determined for each each soil combination see appendix a for technical details and implementation in the fields is started during the season the water allocation only problem can be re solved to account for discrepancies between the forecasted and actual weather and or changes in some of the prices or constraints the advantage of the proposed scheme is three fold first as can be clearly observed in the flowchart fig 1 the crop soil atmosphere dynamic models are used outside of the land water allocation optimization procedure contrary to a straightforward scheme such as the one described by rafiee and shourian 2016 so that the computation burden is reduced very significantly this in turns enables the use of complex dynamic crop models such as aquacrop stics or swap which were previously considered as too demanding computation wise for strategic level optimization these models are continuously improved extended to new crops and validated at new locations by crop modeling experts and encapsulate all the current knowledge about crop soil atmosphere interactions given the general formulation of eq 1 5 the crop models can be switched in a plug and play fashion independently from the optimization procedure itself so that the most up to date models can always be used after minimal adjustments second using the same models for the computations at the strategic and tactical levels avoids any potential mismatch and ensure that performance degradation at the implementation stage due to poor modeling of the crop soil atmosphere interactions is minimized third re estimating the wpfs at each decision point using updated weather data and forecasts ensures that the tactical level decisions are based on the most up to date information available 2 2 additional optional constraints for clarity the proposed framework was described in eqs 1 5 with the minimal set of constraints additional constraints or costs can be

β i j n i β i j 0 or 1 i j other constraints could be added in a similar manner although such changes do not alter the optimization problem fundamentally it must be noticed that while a solution to the optimization problem described by eqs 1 5 always exists imposing such additional constraints may result in a problem that has no solution 3 illustrative examples the implementation of the proposed

the areas of the four fields were set arbitrarily to 15 000 m2 16 000 m2 17 000 m2 and 18 000 m2 respectively the nominal prices were set to 200 t for cotton 500 t for sunflower and 0 1 m3 for water the nominal water quota for the season was 31 000 m3 when solving the multi objective problem eq 6 the growing season of each crop was split into five periods as detailed in linker and syliaos 2016 and it was assumed that each irrigation event consisted of 40 mm two types of results are presented strategic level results namely water and area allocations at the beginning of the season and tactical level results namely adjustment of water allocation every 20 days in response to 1 discrepancy between forecasted and actual weather only and 2 discrepancy between forecasted and actual weather together with change in water quota during the season all simulations used 2016 as test year and the average weather of the 10 previous years 1996 2015 was used in stead of forecasts as in linker and sylaios 2016 all the computations were performed in matlab which invoked aquacrop plug in v5 0 the land water allocation optimization eqs 1 5 was solved using the constrained particle swarm optimization solver available at https www mathworks com matlabcentral fileexchange 25986 the computation time on the i7 7700 16gb pc used in this study was approximately 8 s the multi objective optimization eq 6 was solved using the procedure developed by herrero et al 2007 available at https www mathworks com matlabcentral fileexchange 31080 ev moga multiobjective evolutionary algorithm the computation time was approximately 2 min for each crop soil combination 3 1 strategic level results the first step was to obtain approximate water productivity functions for all possible crop soil combinations using the multi objective optimization procedure eq 6 using the average of years 1996 2015 as expected weather the results are shown graphically in fig 2 where the symbols correspond to all the combinations investigated by the optimization procedure the symbols correspond to the non dominated points and the solid line corresponds to the second degree polynomial approximation see appendix b for details about polynomial fitting after obtaining these functions the optimization problem eqs 1 5 was solved without any additional constraint and after imposing a minimal maize yield of 10 tons the results are presented in the top half of tables 2 and 3 respectively these tables show the area of each field allocated to each crop the recommended seasonal irrigation in mm and corresponding water allocation in m3 as well as the expected yields and profit it can be seen how the additional maize yield constraint affected both water and area allocations in order to fulfill the constraint the cumulative area and water allocated to maize were increased by approximately 35 and 25 respectively the expected profit was reduced by 2 5 as mentioned above the raw optimal solutions would not be readily acceptable for a farmer and for the sake of discussion it was assumed that in order to reduce field fragmentation the farmer would adjust the area allocation as indicated in bold in the bottom half of tables 2 and 3 the correspondingly adjusted water amounts yields and profits appear in the remain cells of the tables in both cases water was re allocated in such a way that the expected yields and profit remained very close to the original optimal ones in fact the expected profits were negligibly higher 0 1 and 0 4 respectively due to the stopping criteria used in the numerical procedure 3 2 tactical level results 3 2 1 adjustments due only to weather it was assumed that the area allocation and initial water allocation were as shown in the bottom half of table 2 and the amount of water allocated to each crop field combination was updated every 20 days the resulting water amounts and expected profit are shown in fig 3 which shows how water allocation was adjusted in response to the actual weather the corresponding variation in expected profit is also shown in the figure the end of season results are summarized in table 4 which shows the results expected at the beginning of the season top the results obtained with 20 day updates middle and the results that would be obtained by applying the irrigation schedules determined at the beginning of the season without any updates bottom compared to the no updates scenario updating of the irrigation schedules resulted in 2 75 increase in maize yield together with a 3 reduction of irrigation overall updating the irrigation schedules reduced the loss of profit due to imperfect weather forecasts by 15 3 2 2 adjustments due to weather and change in water quota as before it was assumed that the area allocation and initial water allocation were that shown in the bottom half of table 2 and the amount of water allocated to each crop field combination was updated every 20 days however a 20 reduction of the water quota was imposed on day 60 from 31 000 m3 to 24 800 m3 the results are summarized in fig 4 and table 5 it can be observed in fig 4 that the main reductions were imposed in field 3 2091 m3 and 964 m3 for sunflower and maize respectively field 4 1552 m3 and field 2 911 m3 overall the water allocation was reduced by 28 and 19 for maize and sunflower respectively for comparison the bottom part of table 5 also shows the results that would be obtained by applying the irrigation schedules determined at the beginning of the season until day 60 and reducing irrigation uniformly after day 60 in order to fulfill the new quota 25 reduction of all future irrigations since 5596 m3 were applied before day 60 relative to the profit expected at the beginning of the season with 31 000 m3 quota updating the irrigation schedules reduced the loss of profit by 15 4 conclusion a new optimization scheme for determining land and water allocation has been developed compared to a straightforward formulation that would require running all the crop models for each land water combination investigated in the proposed scheme the detailed computation wise demanding crop soil atmosphere dynamic models are used only outside of main optimization procedure although in the present paper the procedure was illustrated on a small scale problem since the overall computation time increases only roughly linearly with the number of crops times areas fields combinations investigated it could be readily applied to larger scale problems while multi level approaches traditionally rely on different models at the various levels in the proposed scheme the same detailed models are used to determine seasonal water allocation and detailed irrigation schedules which minimizes the risk of performance degradation at the implementation stage due to poor modeling of the crop soil atmosphere interactions at the coarse level furthermore the generic formulation ensures that switching crop models requires only minimal technical adjustments so that the most up to date models can always be used funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors declaration of competing interest none appendix a determination of irrigation schedule the numerical procedure used to solve the multi objective optimization eq 6 yields only a small number of non dominated points i e optimal irrigation yield combinations and the corresponding irrigation schedules which are the days on which the amount of water set a priori a mm is applied in general the amount of water allocated to the crop by the land water allocation optimization does not coincide with one of these combinations and it is necessary to estimate the irrigation schedule by interpolation as follows denoting i 1 i 2 i q the set of non dominated irrigations and d i the irrigation recommended by the land water allocation optimization find the irrigation i k for which the difference i i d i is minimum determine the scaling factor s i k d i the irrigation schedule corresponding to the irrigation recommended by the land water allocation optimization is then the one of i k but with each irrigation event consisting of s a mm instead of a mm appendix b polynomial approximation of wpf as can be seen in fig 2 in some cases the wpf levels off very abruptly and the second order approximation is valid only until the maximum yield is reached for some crops yield can decrease due to over irrigation but this behavior was not observed in the present study accordingly the points that fulfilled the following conditions were discarded before fitting the polynomial marginal yield local derivative t ha mm less than 10 of average marginal yield and yield above 90 of maximum yield in fig 2 each polynomial approximation solid line is shown only in the range over which it was fitted the corresponding maximum irrigation was imposed as upper bound when solving the water allocation problem 
10781,the paper presents a model based optimization scheme for allocation of cropping areas and water the novelty of the scheme is that rather than using highly simplified models of crop response to deficit irrigation detailed dynamic models of crop soil atmosphere interactions are used to determine the crop water productivity function while the use of such models has traditionally been considered as prohibitive in terms of computation time the current scheme circumvents this limitation by using each model independently in a simple multi objective optimization procedure outside of the main optimization procedure once the optimization problem dealing with land and water allocation has been solved the same models are used to compute optimal irrigation schedules for each crop at each location during the season a simplified version of the optimization scheme can be used to update water allocation in response to discrepancies between the actual and forecasted weather or factors such as changes in water quota or crop prices the proposed scheme is illustrated for a hypothetical farm with four fields near davis ca the model aquacrop is used to determine optimal cropping and water allocation for simultaneous cultivation of maize and sunflower at that farm keywords aquacrop deficit irrigation irrigation scheduling optimal cropping simulation optimization modeling 1 introduction the combination of increasing water scarcity on the one hand and increasing food demand on the other hand poses great challenges to agriculture and it is imperative to develop tools that will help farmers use irrigation water more efficiently broadly speaking farmers must make two types of decisions strategic decisions such as what field or acreage to plant sow with what crop when to plant sow what kind of irrigation system to install etc and tactical decisions such as irrigation scheduling the main difference between these two types of decisions is that while strategic decisions must be made before the beginning of the season and are irreversible tactical decisions can be reviewed and modified during the season this ability to adjust tactical decisions is especially important due to the large uncertainties associated with factors such as weather forecasts crop value or in some regions water quotas while these two types of decisions are typically considered separately and solved using different approaches and different crop models the present paper describes a unified approach that is suitable for both types of problems numerous studies have been devoted to the general problem of land and water allocation to agriculture and potentially other users with conflicting interests which is not fundamentally different from the farmer s strategic level most of these studies followed the so called simulation optimization framework according to which models are used to predict the outcome of some management decisions and an optimizer is used to determine the set of optimal decisions schütze et al 2012 singh 2014 nguyen et al 2017 reviews of the relevant literature can be found in singh 2012 2014 these studies were conducted from the point of view of water managers or planning agencies and focused on allocation of land sometimes referred to as cropping pattern and water at the regional water district scale a characteristic common to almost all these studies is that they relied on overly simplistic models of crop yield in fact some studies did not consider deficit irrigation at all and required or assumed that all crop water demands are met e g sethi et al 2006 das et al 2015 singh 2015 those that did consider deficit irrigation assumed very simplistic relationships between water availability and yield reduction e g paul et al 2000 shangguan et al 2002 kuo et al 2003 prasad et al 2006 sahoo et al 2006 garg and dadhich 2014 the justification given for using oversimplified models is that models that describe crop soil atmosphere interactions accurately such as aquacrop raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 stics brisson et al 1998 2002 swap kroes et al 2000 and which are commonly used to determine irrigation scheduling e g saseendran et al 2008 vazifedoust et al 2008 he et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 nguyen et al 2017 jamal et al 2018 require excessive computation times a notable exception is the work of rafiee and shourian 2016 who used swat in their study that focused on optimal irrigation and crop pattern in the azadegan plain iran however rafiee and shourian 2016 formulated the optimization problem in such a way that it required running the swat models for each land water combination investigated by the optimization procedure see their figure 5 this kind of formulation leads to thousands of model runs even for relatively small problems by comparison in the approach described in the present work the crop soil atmosphere dynamic models are used outside of the main optimization procedure in order to generate irrigation yield relationships water productivity functions which are then used to solve the water and land allocation problem in this sense the present procedure is overall very similar to the traditional formulation e g garg and dadhich 2014 but with much more accurate irrigation yield relationships another advantage of the proposed formulation is that while the overall optimization problem is traditionally formulated as consisting of several layers and different models are used in each layer e g paul et al 2000 shangguan et al 2002 the present approach is readily applicable to both the strategic level and the tactical level i e irrigation scheduling 2 methodology 2 1 basic formulation the basic formulation of the proposed framework in given in eq 1 5 1 max a i j w i j z j 1 m i k j p i a i j y i j w i j α p w j 1 m i k j a i j w i j ω subject to 2 i 1 n j l i α a i j w i j w 3 i k j a i j a j j 4 w i j w ˆ i j i j 5 a i j 0 i j eq 1 corresponds to the net profit which has to be maximized while eqs 2 5 express the constraints that have to be satisfied by any acceptable solution in these equations p i kg is the value of crop i a i j m2 is the area of field j allocated to crop i y i j w i j ω kg m2 denotes the maximal yield of crop i that can be obtained on field j using the amount of irrigation water w i j mm under the weather ω p w is the price of water m3 and α is a conversion factor 10 3 m mm the number of fields considered in the analysis is m and the set k j consists of the indices of all the crops that can be grown on field j so that z is the difference between the value of the crops yields and the irrigation costs eq 2 expresses the constraint on the seasonal water quota n denotes the number of crops considered l i is the set containing the indices of all the fields that can be used to grow crop i and w m3 is the seasonal water quota eq 3 ensures that the area of each field j denoted a j m2 is not exceeded in equation 4 w ˆ i j mm denotes the irrigation which has already been applied so that this constraint ensures that the seasonal irrigation is not lower than the irrigation applied before the current day eq 5 ensures trivial non negativity of allocated areas clearly when optimizing only irrigation amounts while assuming that crop areas are given tactical level constraint 5 is no longer relevant and in eq 1 maximization is performed only on w i j the main novelty in the present study is the way the relationship between irrigation and yield of each crop y i j w i j ω is determined as mentioned above in most studies related to water allocation this relationship is assumed to be given a priori based for instance on literature or best practice tables such relationships or ad hoc models are very crude approximations and fail to capture the complex relationships that exist between crop soil weather and irrigation management in the present work rather than using such a priori given functions the water productivity function wpf are estimated for each specific crop soil combination using a dynamic crop model together with a model based multi objective framework inspired from the one described in linker and kisekka 2017 briefly this multi objective framework can be summarized as follows given a crop model and weather sequence covering the whole season the growing season is split into n intervals and a deficit irrigation threshold t k is associated with each interval i e whenever the soil water content reaches the threshold a predetermined amount of water a mm is applied optimal combinations of these n irrigation thresholds are determined by solving 6 max t 1 t 2 t n k i k y t 1 t 2 t n where y t 1 t 2 t n denotes the yield predicted by the dynamic crop model and i k denotes the irrigation events which result from the threshold sequence t 1 t 2 t n the multi objective problem defined in eq 6 has an infinite number of optimal solutions that correspond to irrigation yield combinations which are such that one variable can be improved only by worsening the other in optimization terminology these points are the so called non dominated solutions and form the pareto front of the problem for the purpose of land and water allocation these non dominated solutions provide an approximation of the crop water productivity function wpf the reader is referred to linker et al 2016 and linker and kisekka 2017 for additional details the general flowchart of the complete procedure is presented in fig 1 assuming n s soils fields and n c crops the first step consists of solving n s n c multi objective optimization problem eq 6 the product of each optimization is a set of non dominated irrigation yield combinations that can be approximated by a second degree polynomial this polynomial provides the approximation of the crop water productivity function needed for optimal allocation of land and water the second step consists of solving the simultaneous area and water allocation problem eqs 1 5 in most practical cases the raw optimal solution would not be suitable as is for a farmer who would take into account additional operational constraints such as for instance the desire not to fragment fields or not grow crop on too small an area although in theory such constraints could be included in the problem definition the list of such constraints could be quite long and it would be unrealistic to require from the farmer to think ahead of time of all the constraints and formulate them adequately to avoid such a problem the present mathematical formulation is kept as simple as possible with the implicit assumption that the farmer will use the optimal solution as a starting point to which adjustments can be made more specifically the farmer should make adjustments to the area allocations after which the optimal water allocation is recomputed the strategic level planning ends once an acceptable solution from farmer s point of view has been obtained the optimal irrigation schedule corresponding to the desired water amount is determined for each each soil combination see appendix a for technical details and implementation in the fields is started during the season the water allocation only problem can be re solved to account for discrepancies between the forecasted and actual weather and or changes in some of the prices or constraints the advantage of the proposed scheme is three fold first as can be clearly observed in the flowchart fig 1 the crop soil atmosphere dynamic models are used outside of the land water allocation optimization procedure contrary to a straightforward scheme such as the one described by rafiee and shourian 2016 so that the computation burden is reduced very significantly this in turns enables the use of complex dynamic crop models such as aquacrop stics or swap which were previously considered as too demanding computation wise for strategic level optimization these models are continuously improved extended to new crops and validated at new locations by crop modeling experts and encapsulate all the current knowledge about crop soil atmosphere interactions given the general formulation of eq 1 5 the crop models can be switched in a plug and play fashion independently from the optimization procedure itself so that the most up to date models can always be used after minimal adjustments second using the same models for the computations at the strategic and tactical levels avoids any potential mismatch and ensure that performance degradation at the implementation stage due to poor modeling of the crop soil atmosphere interactions is minimized third re estimating the wpfs at each decision point using updated weather data and forecasts ensures that the tactical level decisions are based on the most up to date information available 2 2 additional optional constraints for clarity the proposed framework was described in eqs 1 5 with the minimal set of constraints additional constraints or costs can be readily added to this basic formulation for instance minimum yield c i desired for crop i j l i a i j y i j w i j c i water quota w i for crop i j l i a i j w i j w i water quota ω j for field j i a i j w i j ω j operational costs associated with growing crop i on field j eq 1 is modified as max a i j w i j z j 1 m i k j p i a i j y i j w i j ω α p w j 1 m i k j a i j w i j j 1 m i k j φ i j a i j where φ i j a i j is a non linear function describing the operational cost of growing crop i on an area a i j on field j constraint on the number of fields on which crop i is cultivated n i eqs 1 and 3 are replaced respectively by 1b max a i j w i j z j 1 m i k j p i β i j a i j y i j w i j ω α p w j 1 m i k j β i j a i j w i j 3b i k j β i j a i j a j and the following constraints are added j l i β i j n i β i j 0 or 1 i j other constraints could be added in a similar manner although such changes do not alter the optimization problem fundamentally it must be noticed that while a solution to the optimization problem described by eqs 1 5 always exists imposing such additional constraints may result in a problem that has no solution 3 illustrative examples the implementation of the proposed

the nominal water quota for the season was 31 000 m3 when solving the multi objective problem eq 6 the growing season of each crop was split into five periods as detailed in linker and syliaos 2016 and it was assumed that each irrigation event consisted of 40 mm two types of results are presented strategic level results namely water and area allocations at the beginning of the season and

all the combinations investigated by the optimization procedure the symbols correspond to the non dominated points and the solid line corresponds to the second degree polynomial approximation see appendix b for details about polynomial fitting after obtaining these functions the optimization problem eqs 1 5 was solved without any additional constraint and after imposing a minimal maize yield of 10 tons the results are presented in the top half of tables 2 and 3 respectively these tables show the area of each field allocated to each crop the recommended seasonal irrigation in mm and corresponding water allocation in m3 as well as the expected yields and profit it can be seen how the additional maize yield constraint affected both water and area allocations in order to fulfill the constraint the cumulative area and water allocated to maize were increased by approximately 35 and 25 respectively the expected profit was reduced by 2 5 as mentioned above the raw optimal solutions would not be readily acceptable for a farmer and for the sake of discussion it was assumed that in order to reduce field fragmentation the farmer would adjust the area allocation as indicated in bold

adjusted in response to the actual weather the corresponding variation in expected profit is also shown in the figure the end of season results are summarized in table 4 which shows the results expected at the beginning of the season top the results obtained with 20 day updates middle and the results that would be obtained by applying the irrigation schedules determined at the beginning of

overall updating the irrigation schedules reduced the loss of profit due to imperfect weather forecasts by 15 3 2 2 adjustments due to weather and change in water quota as before it was assumed that the area allocation and initial water allocation were that shown in the bottom half of table 2 and the amount of water allocated to each crop field combination was updated every 20 days however a 20 reduction of the water quota was imposed on day 60 from 31 000 m3 to 24 800 m3 the results are summarized in fig 4 and table 5 it can be observed in fig 4 that the main reductions were imposed in field 3 2091 m3 and 964 m3 for sunflower and maize respectively field 4 1552 m3 and field 2 911 m3 overall the water allocation was reduced by 28 and 19 for maize and sunflower respectively for comparison the bottom part of table 5 also shows the results that would be obtained by applying the irrigation schedules determined at the beginning of the season until day 60 and reducing irrigation uniformly after day 60 in order to fulfill the new quota 25 reduction of all future irrigations since 5596 m3 were applied before day 60 relative to the profit expected at the beginning of the season with 31 000 m3 quota updating the irrigation schedules reduced the loss of profit by 15 4 conclusion a new optimization scheme for determining land and water allocation has been developed compared to

significantly exposed to yield reduction jefferies 1994 therefore the estimation of potato crop evapotranspiration is of great relevance for better water management especially in arid and semi arid regions where irrigation is needed to stabilize and increase agricultural production evapotranspiration et is a vital variable for hydrological and agro meteorological studies and especially for the optimization of water use in agricultural sector a particular attention is given to the estimation of crop evapotranspiration etc in arid and semi arid regions under water scarcity and when crops are exposed to different abiotic stresses water salinity etc however modelling of etc is a complex process due to its nonlinear structure and intricate relationship between meteorological and crop parameters moreover the measurements of crop evapotranspiration are tedious and prone to errors due to difficulties to consider adequately numerous factors that affect the uniformity and stability of the soil plant atmosphere continuum allen et al 2011 consequently the investigation of the most appropriate and accurate methodology for et estimate remains a priority topic for water resources planning and management on farm irrigation scheduling crop growth simulations and climate change studies there are different methods and techniques for measurement or estimation of et each of them has advantages and disadvantages according to its usage and data requirements the direct measurement of et can be done by gravimetric method using weighting lysimeters however installation and maintenance of lysimeters is costly and it has also spatial and temporal limitations dinpashoh 2006 indirect methods are based on i soil measurements hillel 1982 quantification of soil water balance components ii atmospheric measurements campbell and norman 1998 ding et al 2010 jovanovic et al 2018 surface energy balance and turbulent exchange of fluxes e g bowen ratio eddy covariance and scintillometry and iii plant canopy measurements including sap flow smith and allen 1996 or remote sensing techniques nonetheless these methods require extensive measurements and data elaboration and are prone to multiple sources of errors jovanovic et al 2018 the penman monteith pm equation is one of the most widely used methods to assess reference grass evapotranspiration eto from weather variables it is recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations as a standard method fao pm for eto estimate allen et al 1998 this method was tested against many other equations under different climatic conditions and for various time steps adopted for et estimate the overall results of comparison have demonstrated the superiority of fao pm for eto estimate in respect to other equations and empirical methods lopez urrea et al 2006 ali and shui 2009 pereira et al 2015 however this approach requires a large number of meteorological variables including air temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity which should be measured at reference agro meteorological sites for most locations around the world and especially in developing countries these data are not easily available and or are of suspicious quality as an alternative to the above approaches different machine learning techniques can be applied for et estimate as more economical and less time consuming methodologies however these methods are difficult to develop due to nonlinear dynamic complexity of evapotranspiration process which depends on the interaction of several meteorological and crop variables traore et al 2010 marti and gasque 2010 moreover the accuracy of et estimate by mathematical approaches depends on the number of available meteorological parameters and quality of measured input data since the beginning of this century the machine learning algorithms have been increasingly applied for modelling et kumar et al 2002 trajkovic et al 2003 pal and deswal 2009 marti and gasque 2010 kumar et al 2011 kisi et al 2015 yassin et al 2016 mattar 2018 mehdizadeh 2018 antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 studied the estimation of daily eto using the artificial neural network ann and empirical methods in northern greece the results demonstrated that the application of ann had satisfactory performance dou and yang 2018 investigated the extreme learning machine elm

square support vector regression lssvr multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and m5 model tree m5tree models for forecasting monthly eto in the mediterranean region of turkey these models performed better than the empirical methods of hargreaves and samani 1985 and valiantzas 2013 among three different heuristic regression approaches the lssvr model was the most successful tabari et al 2013 studied the anfis and support vector machines svm for modelling potato etc in the northwest of iran the predictions of anfis and svm were compared to the empirical methods of blaney criddle makkink turc priestley taylor hargreaves and ritchie the results demonstrated that anfis and svm techniques simulated better potato etc than all empirical methods abyaneh et al 2011 investigated the performance of ann and svm models for predicting garlic etc in western iran the modelling results were compared with lysimeter data they found that ann and svm models are appropriate for simulation of garlic etc feng et al 2016 examined the elm and regression neural network grnn models for estimating maize etc on the china plateau the models with meteorological and crop input data demonstrated their suitability for maize etc estimation tang et al 2018 compared svm and ann optimized by genetic algorithm in estimation of etc for rainfed maize field under non mulching and partial mulching film conditions they pointed out that the models with meteorological and crop data performed better than the models with only meteorological inputs the present study investigated the performance of three different machine learning algorithms knn ann and adaboost for the estimation of potato etc when applied with four scenarios of meteorological input data availability in this context the study aimed to identify the best modelling technique for each specific input data scenario comparing one well known and frequently used method ann with two other methods knn and adaboost which are not applied yet for crop et estimate 2 materials and methods 2 1 dataset description the study is based on the results of experimental trials carried out in 2009 and 2010 at the mediterranean agronomic institute of bari ciheam bari valenzano southern italy 41 03 16 n 16 52 e 72 m altitude daily weather data were acquired by an automatic agro meteorological station located near the experimental field the observed meteorological parameters referred to air temperature t solar radiation rn air relative humidity rh and wind speed at 2 m height u2 fig 1 presents seasonal variation of meteorological variables during the potato growing seasons in 2009 and 2010 average mean air temperature was 18 4 c in 2009 and 16 2 c in 2010 average solar radiation was 23 0 mj m2 day 1 in 2009 and 19 8 mj m2 day 1 in 2010 average mean air relative humidity was 65 8 in 2009 and 67 5 in 2010 and average wind speed was 0 9 m s 1 in 2009 and 1 2 m s 1 in 2010 respectively according to the köppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 the climate is typically mediterranean with hot and dry summer season the average 30 year annual precipitation is 523 mm generally concentrated during the autumn winter season from november to march potato cv spunta was planted with a density of 5 plants m 2 spunta is one of the most widely cultivated cultivars in the mediterranean region ierna 2010 this cultivar is a medium early potato with long regular and very large tubers moreover it has good germination potential high yield potential moderate resistance to diseases and tolerance to water stress the planting dates were 17th and 3rd of march in 2009 and 2010 respectively while the harvesting dates were 10th july 2009 and 19th june 2010 the present study focussed on full irrigation regime applied during the whole growing season irrigation scheduling was based on an excel irrigation tool todorovic 2006 that uses meteorological soil and crop data for a day by day estimation of crop evapotranspiration and soil water balance in the effective root zone the gravimetric method based on the conventional oven dry weight and multiplied by the bulk density qiu et al 2001 was used during each growing season to measure soil water content in the root zone and to make eventual adjustments of soil water content estimated by the model surface drip irrigation was applied regularly to keep the soil water in the root zone within the pre defined threshold of 55 in respect to total available water content in the root zone further information about the experimental layout and data was provided by cantore et al 2014 reference evapotranspiration eto was estimated by the fao pm equation allen et al 1998 as 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 rn is the net solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2day 1 t is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c δ is the slope of the saturated vapour pressure curve kpa c 1 y is the psychometric constant 0 066 kpa c 1 es and ea are saturated and prevailing actual vapour pressure kpa respectively and u2 is the mean daily wind speed m s 1 measured at 2 m height the saturation vapour pressure es was estimated as 2 e s e 0 t m a x e 0 t m i n 2 where e0 t is the saturation vapour pressure kpa at the air temperature t and tmax and tmin

crop coefficient kc that integrates the crop specific characteristics crop transpiration and soil evaporation during the growing season 5 e t c k c e t o the length of phenological stages was observed regularly in the field during the study period 2009 2010 table 1 four major growing stages were distinguished as initial up to the beginning of stem elongation crop development until the starting of

from the fao 56 allen et al 1998 as kcini fao 0 5 kcmid fao 1 15 and kcend fao 0 75 the kc values of mid season and late season were adjusted for the site specific climatic conditions and crop height

are crop coefficient adopted from the fao 56 for middle and end season of potato crop growth respectively u2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 and rhmin is the minimum relative humidity 2 2 machine learning methods various machine learning methods exist in the literature these methods serve as efficient tools in data mining tasks in this study three machine learning techniques are applied for the estimation of potato crop evapotranspiration these techniques are k nearest neighbour knn artificial neural networks ann and adaptive boosting adaboost these methods are briefly described here below 2 2 1 k nearest neighbour knn the k nearest neighbour knn method is a conventional non parametric method cover and hart 1967 which is a type of lazy learning or instance based learning algorithm the function is approximated only locally and all calculations are deferred until classification this method is simple but thanks to its effectiveness simplicity intuitiveness and competitiveness it has the ability to solve both classification and regression problems having dimensions up to moderate size fig 2 demonstrates the knn decision rule for two classes k 1 and k 3 in fig 2a an unknown sample x is classified by using one known sample which is closest to the x in fig 2b three closest samples to x are used for classification for knn classification k nearest neighbours are found using the euclidean distance approach eq 8 then the majority class is chosen within the nearest k samples the euclidian distance equation can be written as 8 d x y i 1 n x i y i 2 in this formula d is the euclidian distance x and y are the data points consisting of n dimensions i is an index number despite the advantages given above the knn method has a few limitations when the training dataset is large the knn method can take long running time due to calculation of the distance in each query example to all training samples however kd tree can be used to speed up knn searches for large data this method is very sensitive to irrelevant and redundant characteristics and it is unclear what distance to use and which feature will be used to produce the best results therefore these drawbacks should be taken into consideration when making the classification imandoust and bolandraftar 2013 2 2 2 artificial neural networks ann the ann model is one of the most well known and widely adopted machine learning methods also for modelling in hydrological studies kumar et al 2011 this method has an ability to learn from a training dataset and store the pattern of the data as weighted connections of neurons after training when a new data is applied to the ann algorithm it recognizes the pattern from the data and classify it finally the algorithm gives result quickly and accurately fig 3 shows the typical multi layer ann structure the ann model consist of three layers input hidden and output input layer represents the input variables while output layer shows unknown variables hidden layer where the data are processed is presented between input and output layers moreover hidden layer is essential for nonlinear data each layer includes an array of artificial neurons therefore each of the neurons is connected with next or previous layer 2 2 3 adaptive boosting adaboost the adaboost model is one of the most effective recognition methods in the field of machine learning and one of the most widely used boosting methods since it has very accurate estimation and the simplicity of application of codes wu et al 2007 in general the adaboost is presented for the issue of feature classification and regression the working principle of this method is i the model selects a training subset randomly in the beginning ii it repetitively trains the model by selecting the training set based on the accurate estimation of the last training iii the model assigns the higher weight to wrong classified observations thus these observations get high probability for classification in the next repetition it also assigns the weight to the trained classifier in each repetition accuracy of the classifier therefore the more accurate classifier gets high weight this model works until the complete training data places without any error and reached to the specified maximum number of estimator fig 4 in summary this method is firstly the ensemble classifier trains its weak learners individually and then combines their estimations decisions to define a final decision 2 3 model development and performance evaluation three machine learning methods knn ann and adaboost were employed to simulate and predict daily potato etc to set up these models meteorological variables mean air temperature solar radiation wind speed mean relative humidity and crop data kc and duration of growing stages were used as input a correlation matrix between the meteorological input variables and crop et was developed and presented in table 2 the aim of these correlations was to determine which weather parameters could afford the best estimation of potato etc accordingly four scenarios were analysed by adding the next closest correlation the results showed that the correlation between etc and mean air temperature 0 84 is higher than with other meteorological variables this means that the air temperature has the greatest impact on etc among the weather parameters in fact the air temperature methods for estimation of et e g hargreaves and samani 1985 show the best performance in arid and semi arid regions the second highest correlation of 0 80 was obtained between etc and solar radiation solar radiation together with air temperature is among main drivers of et process however the radiation based methods show better performance in humid than environments where the aerodynamic term of combination equation is relatively small allen et al 1998 wind speed and mean relative humidity were negatively correlated with etc with the values of 0 08 and 0 53 respectively accordingly four combinations of meteorological inputs were created and analysed by three different machine learning algorithms these combinations of meteorological inputs were classified by adding the next closest correlation and they include scenario 1 mean air temperature scenario 2 mean air temperature and solar radiation scenario 3 mean air temperature solar radiation and wind speed and scenario 4 mean air temperature solar radiation wind speed and mean relative humidity the purpose of these scenarios was to test the performance of three machine learning techniques for different combinations of weather input data all datasets were normalized to improve the performance of the model in this study the following equation was used 9 z x μ σ where x is the original data μ is the mean value and σ is the standard deviation of the data two years of daily data were divided into two subsets 70 of the data were used for training and the remaining data 30 were used for testing a k fold cross validation was used in prediction error estimation for the larger dataset the data were divided into 10 subsets and the models were trained and tested each time using a portion of available patterns in this way every data point gets to be in a validation set exactly once and gets to be in a training set k 1 times random distribution in all data was performed in these two subsets the flowchart of the modelling procedure is shown in fig 5 the performance of different machine learning models was evaluated using the mean squared error mse root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae modelling efficiency ef nash and sutcliffe 1970 and coefficient of determination r2 and slope of regression forced through the origin between measured and simulated etc the daily etc values generated by the different machine learning models si were transformed into daily errors comparing them with the observed values oi o is the mean value

higher values confirmed higher model performance 3 results 3 1 adjustment of crop coefficient for weather and crop height in both growing seasons weather variables showed expected trend fig 1 mean air temperature and solar radiation increased with the advancement of growing season while mean air relative humidity showed decreasing trend wind speed fluctuated significantly during growing seasons the potato growing period was 115 days in 2009 and 109 days in 2010 table 1 in 2009 the length of initial crop development mid season and late season stage was 24 37 27 and 27 days respectively in 2010 the length of four growing stages was 24 46 31 and 11 days respectively using eqs 6 and 7 the values of kcmid and kcend were modified according to the measured potato height 0 66 m instead of 0 6 m as indicated in the fao 56 and average values of minimum relative humidity and wind speed for both growing stages hence the values of kcmid and kcend were respectively 1 14 and 0 72 for 2009 and 1 11 and 0 76 for 2010 3 2 machine learning methods three machine learning algorithms were run for training and testing subsets with four different scenarios of available meteorological input data the overall results of modelling performance are presented by statistical indicators in tables 3 5 for knn ann and adaboost model respectively a comparison based on the regression analysis forced through the origin between observed and simulated etc data is presented in figs 6 8 for ann knn and adaboost models respectively considering four scenarios combinations of input meteorological variables in general for all models the 1st scenario with only mean air temperature data showed more scattering than other combinations of input weather variables the best fitting was observed for the 4th combination with inputs of mean air temperature solar radiation wind speed and mean relative humidity 3 2 1 performance of knn method the best performance of the knn model was observed when the k was fixed to 5 i e when five closest samples were used for classification the statistical results of etc estimate using knn model with four combinations of meteorological input data knn1 knn2 knn3 and knn4 indicated the lowest performance of the model when crop et was estimated only with mean air temperature data a relevant improvement of et estimate more than 50 by means of mse rmse and mae was observed for the second scenario when solar radiation data are included as input together with mean air temperature data knn2 in that case in respect to scenario 1 the slope of regression forced through the origin was improved from 0 947 to 0 980 r2 from 0 813 to 0 968 ef from 0 848 to 0 970 mse from 0 623 to 0 123 mm day 1 rmse from 0 790 to 0 351 mm day 1 and mae from 0 563 to 0 263 mm day 1 the statistical parameters indicated similar performances of knn machine learning technique for the 3rd knn3 and 4th knn4 combination of input meteorological data comparison of observed and simulated crop et values for knn model are presented in fig 6 overall the knn model demonstrated tendency to slightly underestimate measured crop et excellent performances of knn were observed for scenarios 2 and 3 with the slope of regression forced through the origin of 0 980 and 0 990 respectively 3 2 2 performance of ann method when the ann model was applied the number of neurons in the hidden layer was optimized the most appropriate results were obtained for the ann 2 3 4 5 5 1 which means that the model consists of 2 neurons for 1st scenario 3neurons for 2nd scenario 4 neurons for 3rd scenario and 5 neurons for 4th scenario in input variables 5 neurons in the hidden layer and 1 output layer the rectified linear unit relu function was used as the activation function in the present study the performance of ann model for estimating daily etc over training and testing periods were assessed using four scenarios of availability of meteorological data table 4 for the testing subset the ann1 method fed only with mean air temperature data had the lowest performance with considering ef 0 766 mse 0 951 mm day 1 rmse 0 975 mm day 1 and mae 0 766 mm day 1 the regression forced through the origin indicated a slight overestimation of the model with slope of 1 029 and coefficient of determination r2 of 0 668 a relevant improvement of etc estimate was noticed for scenario 2 with the reduction of rmse to 0 584 mm day 1 of mae to 0 454 mm day 1 and of mse to 0 341 mm day 1 and with the increase of ef to 0 816 the slope of the regression equation forced through the origin was increased 1 072 while the coefficient of determination r2 was improved 0 936 a slight improvement of model performance was noted for scenarios 3 and 4 i e when the number of meteorological input variables was increased to 3 and 4 respectively the best performance was observed for the ann4 with inputs of mean air temperature solar radiation wind speed and mean relative humidity in that case r2 was 0 985 with the slope of regression forced through the origin of 0 991 ef was 0 986 mse was 0 057 mm day 1 rmse was 0 239 mm day 1 and mae was 0 166 mm day 1 in general it is observed that among all models integrating mean air temperature solar radiation wind speed and mean relative humidity data scenario 4 the ann method showed the best performance based on the statistical parameters in the testing period comparison of observed and simulated crop et values for ann model are presented in fig 7 the ann model showed the overestimation of the observed crop et by 2 9 7 2 and 6 4 for the scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively nevertheless for the 4th scenario the slope of regression forced through the origin was 0 991 with r2 of 0 985 3 2 3 performance of adaboost method a decision tree was boosted using the adaboost machine learning technique the best results were obtained for the number of estimators fixed to 50 and the number of learning rates fixed to 1 according to the results table 5 it can be noticed that adaboost method produced the poorest performance for scenario 1 with mse rmse mae ef r2 and slope of regression equal to 1 018 mm day 1 1 009 mm day 1 0 711 mm day 1 0 758 0 689 and 0 968 respectively the performance of adaboost was improved significantly more than 50 in terms of rmse mae and mse for second scenario adaboost2 a slight further improvement of model performance was observed for scenarios 3 and 4 adaboost model demonstrated the best performance for potato et estimate when scenario 4 of data availability was used with mse of 0 150 mm day 1 rmse of 0 388 mm day 1 mae of 0 301 mm day 1 ef of 0 968 r2 of 0 962 and slope of regression forced through the origin foxed to 0 959 comparison of observed and simulated crop et values for adaboost model are presented in fig 8 the adaboost model underestimated daily crop et observed in the field for all scenarios of availability of meteorological data according to the slope of regression line forced through the origin the overall underestimation was between 3 2 for scenario 1 and 7 2 for scenario 2 4 discussion the kcmid and kcend values differed in two years due to different weather conditions inputs rhmin and u2 in eqs 6 and 7 the calibrated kcmid and kcend values were compared with the results from other studies slatni et al 2011 reported kcmid equals to 1 12 for potato crop in tunisia which is close to the kcmid values calibrated in this study for the conditions of southern italy similarly parent and anctil 2012 found kcend 0 78 in south eastern canada which is in agreement with the results of this study nevertheless tabari et al 2013 reported kcmid and kcend values of 1 25 and 0 85 respectively which are slightly greater than those used in the present study therefore the adjustment of mid season and late season kc data to account for specific growing conditions should be adopted in the practice in order to improve crop et estimate the results of this study demonstrated that all the applied models knn ann and adaboost were able to describe nonlinear relationships between weather and crop parameters and to simulate adequately crop et moreover these nonparametric models have advantages in respect to empirical methods and to the fao pm equation since they require no knowledge of internal variables and offer simple solutions for non linear and multi variable functions kişi 2015 wang et al 2017 therefore they are particularly suitable in the areas characterized by limited weather observations which is a common case at many worldwide locations the type of input variables played a key role in the accuracy of et estimation with the machine learning models therefore all the applied models knn ann and adaboost were analysed under four different scenarios in order to understand to model performance under different number of input data that could occurred in the practice in this way each model indicates performance under different scenarios that were developed by correlation matrix each of machine learning algorithms can estimate crop et using as input only one weather parameter nevertheless in general the statistical parameters indicated the best performance of all models for the 4th scenario of weather data availability with full meteorological data while the lowest performance were observed for the 1st scenario with only temperature data these results confirmed the correlation between the input meteorological variables and potato etc that was reported in table 2 according to the presented results the knn model demonstrated the best performance for etc estimation when input meteorological data were limited i e for scenarios 1 2 and 3 the ann model was superior to other approaches only for the 4th scenario when all meteorological variables were used for etc estimate the latter observation is in agreement with the findings of tang et al 2018 who indicated that the ann method with full meteorological data performs better than other machine learning methods similarly aghajanloo et al 2013 applied the ann model with full meteorological data and 5 neurons in hidden layer for crop et estimate in a semi arid region of iran they reported smaller rmse but also smaller r2 in the testing phase in respect to the results of the present study several other studies confirmed that using all meteorological variables as input provides the best results in etc estimation abyaneh et al 2011 estimated the garlic etc with ann and anfis models and different meteorological variables and concluded that the use of all meteorological parameters provides better performance of the models in respect to the limited input parameters similar results were pointed out also by tabari et al 2013 when svm and anfis models were applied to estimate potato etc in iran according to our knowledge the knn and adaboost models were tested in the present study for the first time to predict crop et both models demonstrated good performance in the range of the ann method which is frequently used in et studies therefore these two machine learning techniques could be applied as an alternative to the ann method in general the knn model showed slightly better performance than adaboost this could mean that the knn decision rules focusing on the characteristics of the nearest neighbours resemble properly the behaviour of meteorological parameters and their correlation with crop evapotranspiration it should be pointed out that the performance of knn2 with mean air temperature and solar radiation was better than with any other combination of meteorological input data moreover the knn model was superior in respect to other machine learning techniques when only mean air temperature was used in et estimation and the statistical parameters were elaborated only for the testing subset the knn with only mean air temperature scenario 1 has similar performance as the elm machine learning method with full meteorological data feng et al 2016 the evapotranspiration estimate with knn did not improve with the 3rd and 4th combination of meteorological parameters which is fully in the agreement with the correlation matrix between crop et and meteorological variables table 2 in fact only mean air temperature and solar radiation have positive correlation with crop evapotranspiration on the contrary two other models ann and adaboost improved their performance in respect to the scenario 2 when the 3rd and 4th scenarios of meteorological data were used similarly to the ann the adaboost showed the best performance when all meteorological variables were used this can be explained by the fact that ann and adaboost applied much more complex algorithms in respect to the knn model which allowed them to enhance their performance with additional sets of input variables even when they are not positively correlated to crop evapotranspiration 5 conclusions the application of machine learning techniques in the fields of hydrology and environmental studies including agriculture and et estimate has been increasing in the last years this is due to reinforcement of agro meteorological networks equipped with the latest generation of sensors real time data acquisition and availability through the data cloud technologies and employment of powerful computing machines able to elaborate huge amount of data almost instantaneously in this context there is a need to test et estimates simulated by different machine learning methods and to compare them with detailed experimental data and et measurements in the present study knn and adaboost techniques were introduced for the first time to predict daily etc in order to investigate modelling performance with different scenarios of availability of meteorological input data and in respect to a well know machine learning technique as it is the ann model this model was used in many previous studies as a benchmarking tool in order to analyse the performance of new machine learning techniques the comparison of performances of three machine learning techniques was undertaken for four scenarios of availability of meteorological input data since in the practice it is a common situation the overall results indicated that the application of knn modelling technique with only mean air temperature or with combination of air temperature and solar radiation might be an adequate alternative solution to the use of other more complex machine learning algorithms and full meteorological datasets this finding is particularly relevant for marginal rural areas in developing countries where weather data are incomplete and they are usually limited only to air temperature information the present study focussed on the crop et estimate under optimal water supply certainly a future challenge might be to use the machine learning techniques for estimation of crop et under limited water supply and water stress conditions which is a common case for mediterranean environments in this case the determination of crop coefficient as a multifactor dependent parameter might be especially important thus further studies should be carried out to confirm and evaluate the applicability of knn and adaboost models for etc forecasting under different environmental conditions and input data availability this is of particular relevance for irrigated agriculture which faces numerous challenges on the road towards a more sustainable and efficient water use acknowledgment we are grateful to dr fatma wassar and dr burak yılmaz for sharing their precious knowledge this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors 
10782,crop evapotranspiration etc is a complex and non linear process difficult to measure and estimate accurately this complexity can be solved applying the machine learning techniques with different meteorological input variables this study investigated the performance of k nearest neighbour knn artificial neural networks ann and adaptive boosting adaboost models to predict daily potato etc using four scenarios of available meteorological data as air temperature scenario 1 air temperature and solar radiation scenario 2 air temperature solar radiation and wind speed scenario 3 and air temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity scenarios 4 the analysis was based on the results of experimental trials carried out in southern italy in 2009 and 2010 and focussed on the potato crop cultivation under optimal water supply the results of etc estimation with different machine learning techniques were compared with etc obtained from the soil water balance model based on the fao penman monteith approach and gravimetric measurements of soil water content in the crop root zone the best performances were observed with the knn model with r2 of 0 813 0 968 and 0 965 slope of regression 0 947 0 980 and 0 991 modelling efficiency ef of 0 848 0 970 and 0 972 root mean square error rmse of 0 790 0 351 and 0 355 mm day 1 mean absolute error mae of 0 563 0 263 and 0 274 mm day 1 and mean squared error mse of 0 623 0 123 and 0 126 mm day 1 for scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively when all meteorological variables were available scenario 4 the ann model produced slightly better statistical indicators therefore the knn model could be recommended for the estimation of etc when limited meteorological data are available otherwise the ann model should be applied keywords

in the world with 388 2 million tons harvested on 19 3 million hectares of land faostat 2017 in the mediterranean basin potato is cultivated at about one million hectares with an average production of 32 million mg of tubers cantore et al 2014 potato is considered to be very sensitive to water stress van loon 1981 and even in short time periods without water the tuber production can be significantly exposed to yield reduction jefferies 1994 therefore the estimation of potato crop evapotranspiration is of great relevance for better water management especially in arid and semi arid regions where irrigation is needed to stabilize and increase agricultural production evapotranspiration et is a vital variable for hydrological and agro meteorological studies and especially for the optimization of water use in agricultural sector a particular attention is given to the estimation of crop evapotranspiration etc in arid and semi arid regions under water scarcity and when crops are exposed to different abiotic stresses water salinity etc however modelling of etc is a complex process due to its nonlinear structure and intricate relationship between meteorological and crop parameters moreover the measurements of crop evapotranspiration are tedious and prone to errors due to difficulties to consider adequately numerous factors that affect the uniformity and stability of the soil plant atmosphere continuum allen et al 2011 consequently the investigation of the most appropriate and accurate methodology for et estimate remains a priority topic for water resources planning and management on farm irrigation scheduling crop growth simulations and climate change studies there are different methods and techniques for measurement or estimation of et each of them has advantages and disadvantages according to its usage and data requirements the direct measurement of et can be done by gravimetric method using weighting lysimeters however installation and maintenance of lysimeters is costly and it has also spatial and temporal limitations dinpashoh 2006 indirect methods are based on i soil measurements hillel 1982 quantification of soil water balance components ii

iii plant canopy measurements including sap flow smith and allen 1996 or remote sensing techniques nonetheless these methods require extensive measurements and data elaboration and are prone to multiple sources of errors jovanovic et al 2018 the penman monteith pm equation is one of the most widely used methods to assess reference grass evapotranspiration eto from weather variables it is recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations as a standard method fao pm for eto estimate allen et al 1998 this method was tested against many other equations under different climatic conditions and for various time steps adopted for et estimate the overall results of comparison have demonstrated the superiority of fao pm for eto estimate in respect to other equations and empirical methods lopez urrea et al 2006 ali and shui 2009 pereira et al 2015 however this approach requires a large number of meteorological variables including air temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity which should be measured at reference agro meteorological sites for most locations around the world and especially in developing countries these data are not easily available and or are of suspicious quality as an alternative to the above approaches different machine learning techniques can be applied for et estimate as more economical and less time consuming methodologies however these methods are difficult to develop due to nonlinear dynamic complexity of evapotranspiration process which depends on the interaction of several meteorological and crop variables traore et al 2010 marti and gasque 2010 moreover the accuracy of et estimate by mathematical approaches depends on the number of available meteorological parameters and quality of measured input data since the beginning of this century the machine learning algorithms have been increasingly applied for modelling et kumar et al 2002 trajkovic et al 2003 pal and deswal 2009 marti

2013 studied the anfis and support vector machines svm for modelling potato etc in the northwest of iran the predictions of anfis and svm were compared to the empirical methods of blaney criddle makkink turc priestley taylor hargreaves and ritchie the results demonstrated that anfis and svm techniques simulated better potato etc than all empirical methods abyaneh et al 2011 investigated the performance of ann and svm models for predicting garlic etc in western iran the modelling results were compared with lysimeter data they found that ann and svm models are appropriate for simulation of garlic etc feng et al 2016 examined the elm and regression neural network grnn models for estimating maize etc on the china plateau the models with meteorological and crop input data demonstrated

conditions they pointed out that the models with meteorological and crop data performed better than the models with only meteorological inputs the present study investigated the performance of three different machine learning algorithms knn ann and adaboost for the estimation of potato etc when applied with four scenarios of meteorological input data availability in this context the study aimed to identify the best modelling technique for each specific input data scenario comparing one well known and frequently used method ann with two other methods knn and adaboost which are not applied yet for crop et estimate 2 materials and methods 2 1 dataset description the study is based on the results of experimental trials carried out in 2009 and 2010 at the mediterranean agronomic institute of bari ciheam bari valenzano southern italy 41 03 16 n 16 52 e 72 m altitude daily weather data were acquired by an automatic agro meteorological station located near the experimental field the observed meteorological parameters referred to air temperature t solar radiation rn air relative humidity rh and wind speed at 2 m height u2 fig 1 presents seasonal variation of meteorological variables during the potato growing seasons in 2009 and 2010 average mean air temperature was 18 4 c in 2009 and 16 2 c in 2010 average solar radiation was 23 0 mj m2 day 1 in 2009 and 19 8 mj m2 day 1 in 2010 average

kottek et al 2006 the climate is typically mediterranean with hot and dry summer season the average 30 year annual precipitation is 523 mm generally concentrated during the autumn winter season from november to march potato cv spunta was planted with a density of 5 plants m 2 spunta is one of the most widely cultivated cultivars in the mediterranean region ierna 2010 this cultivar is a medium early potato with long regular and very large tubers moreover it has good germination potential high yield potential moderate resistance to diseases and tolerance to water stress the planting dates were 17th and 3rd of march in 2009 and 2010 respectively while the harvesting dates were 10th july 2009 and 19th june 2010 the present study focussed on full irrigation regime applied during the whole growing season irrigation scheduling was based on an excel irrigation tool todorovic 2006 that uses meteorological soil and crop data for a day by day estimation of crop evapotranspiration and soil water balance in the effective root zone the gravimetric method based on the conventional oven dry weight and multiplied by the bulk density qiu et al 2001 was used during each growing season to measure soil water content in the root zone and to make eventual adjustments of soil water content estimated by the model surface drip irrigation was applied regularly to keep the soil water in the root zone within the pre defined threshold of 55 in respect to total available water content in the root zone further information about the experimental layout and data was provided by cantore et al 2014 reference evapotranspiration eto was estimated by the fao pm equation allen et al 1998 as 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where eto is the reference

are crop coefficient adopted from the fao 56 for middle and end season of potato crop growth respectively u2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 and rhmin is the minimum relative humidity 2 2 machine learning methods various machine learning methods exist in the literature these methods serve as efficient tools in data mining tasks in this study three machine learning techniques are applied for the estimation of potato crop evapotranspiration these techniques are k nearest neighbour knn artificial neural networks ann and adaptive boosting adaboost these methods are briefly described here below 2 2 1 k nearest neighbour knn the k nearest neighbour knn method is a conventional non parametric method cover and hart 1967 which is a type of lazy learning or instance based learning algorithm the function is approximated only locally and all calculations are deferred until classification this method is simple but thanks to its effectiveness simplicity intuitiveness and competitiveness it has the ability to solve both classification and regression problems having dimensions up to moderate size fig 2 demonstrates the knn decision rule for two classes k 1 and k 3 in fig 2a an unknown sample x is classified by using one known sample which is closest to the x in fig 2b three closest samples to x are used for classification for knn classification k nearest neighbours are found using the euclidean distance approach eq 8 then the majority class is chosen within the nearest k samples the euclidian distance equation can be written as 8 d x y i 1 n x i y i 2 in this formula d is the euclidian distance x and y are the data points consisting of n dimensions i is an index number despite the advantages given above the knn method has a few limitations when the training dataset is large the knn method can take long running time due to calculation of the distance in each query example to all training samples however kd tree can be used to speed up knn searches for large data this method is very sensitive to irrelevant and redundant characteristics and it is unclear what distance to use and which feature will be used to produce the best results therefore these drawbacks should be taken into consideration when making the classification imandoust and bolandraftar 2013 2 2 2 artificial neural networks ann the ann model is one of the most well known and widely adopted machine learning methods also for modelling in hydrological studies kumar et al 2011 this method has an ability to learn from a training dataset and store the pattern of the data as weighted connections of neurons after training when a new data is applied to the ann algorithm it recognizes the pattern from the data and classify it finally the algorithm gives result quickly and accurately fig 3 shows the typical multi layer ann structure the ann model consist of three layers input hidden and output input layer represents the input variables while output layer shows unknown variables hidden layer where the data are processed is presented between input and output layers moreover hidden layer is essential for nonlinear data each layer includes an array of artificial neurons therefore each of the neurons is connected with next or previous layer 2 2 3 adaptive boosting adaboost the adaboost model is one of the most effective recognition methods in the field of machine learning and one of the most widely used boosting methods since it has very accurate estimation and the simplicity of application of codes wu et al 2007 in general the adaboost is presented for the issue of feature classification and regression the working principle of this method is i the model selects a training subset randomly in the beginning ii it repetitively trains the model by selecting the training set based on the accurate estimation of the last training iii the model assigns the higher weight to wrong classified observations thus these observations get high probability for classification in the next repetition it also assigns the weight to the trained classifier in each repetition accuracy of the classifier therefore the more accurate classifier gets high weight this model works until the complete training data places without any error and reached to the specified maximum number of estimator fig 4 in summary this method is firstly the ensemble classifier trains its weak learners individually and then combines their estimations decisions to define a final decision 2 3 model development and performance evaluation three machine learning methods knn ann and adaboost were employed to simulate and predict daily potato etc to set up these models meteorological variables mean air temperature solar radiation wind speed mean relative humidity and crop data kc and duration of growing stages were used as input a correlation matrix between the meteorological input variables and crop et was developed and presented in table 2 the aim of these correlations was to determine which weather parameters could afford the best estimation of potato etc accordingly four scenarios were analysed by adding the next closest correlation the results showed that the correlation between etc and mean air temperature 0 84 is higher than with other meteorological variables this means that the air temperature has the greatest impact on etc among the weather parameters in fact the air temperature methods for estimation of et e g hargreaves and samani 1985 show the best performance in arid and semi arid regions the second highest correlation of 0 80 was obtained between etc and solar radiation solar radiation together with air temperature is among main drivers of et process however the radiation based methods show better performance in humid than environments where the aerodynamic term of combination equation is relatively small allen et al 1998 wind speed and mean relative humidity were negatively correlated with etc with the values of 0 08 and 0 53 respectively accordingly four combinations of meteorological inputs were created and analysed by three different machine learning algorithms these combinations of meteorological inputs were classified by adding the next closest correlation and they include scenario 1 mean air temperature scenario 2 mean air temperature and solar radiation scenario 3 mean air temperature solar radiation and wind speed and scenario 4 mean air temperature solar radiation wind speed and mean relative humidity the purpose of these scenarios was to test the performance of three machine learning techniques for different combinations of weather input data all datasets were normalized to improve the performance of the model in this study the following equation was used 9 z x μ σ where x is the original data μ is the mean value and σ is the standard deviation of the data two years of daily data were divided into two subsets 70 of the data were used for training and the remaining data 30 were used for testing a k fold cross validation was used in prediction error estimation for the larger dataset the data were divided into 10 subsets and the models were trained and tested each time using a portion of available patterns in this way every data point gets to be in a validation set exactly once and gets to be in a training set k 1 times random distribution in all data was performed in these two subsets the flowchart of the modelling procedure is shown in fig 5 the performance of different machine learning models was evaluated using the mean squared error mse root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae modelling efficiency ef nash and sutcliffe 1970 and coefficient of determination r2 and slope of regression forced through the origin between measured and simulated etc the daily etc values generated by the different machine learning models si were transformed into daily errors comparing them with the observed values oi o is the mean value

higher values confirmed higher model performance 3 results 3 1 adjustment of crop coefficient for weather and crop height in both growing seasons weather variables showed expected trend fig 1 mean air temperature and solar radiation increased with the advancement of growing season while mean air relative humidity showed decreasing trend wind speed fluctuated significantly during growing seasons the potato growing period was 115 days in 2009 and 109 days in 2010 table 1 in 2009 the length of initial crop development mid season and late season stage was 24 37 27 and 27 days respectively in 2010 the length of four growing stages was 24 46 31 and 11 days respectively using eqs 6 and 7 the values of kcmid and kcend were modified according to the measured potato height 0 66 m instead of 0 6 m as indicated in the fao 56 and average values of minimum relative humidity and wind speed for both growing stages hence the values of kcmid and kcend were respectively 1 14 and 0 72 for 2009 and 1 11 and 0 76 for 2010 3 2 machine learning methods three machine learning algorithms were run for training and testing subsets with four different scenarios of available meteorological input data the overall results of modelling performance are presented by statistical indicators in tables 3 5 for knn ann and adaboost model respectively a comparison based on the regression analysis forced through the origin between observed and simulated etc data is presented in figs 6 8 for ann knn and adaboost models respectively considering four scenarios combinations of input meteorological variables in general for all models the 1st scenario with only mean air temperature data showed more scattering than other combinations of input weather variables the best fitting was observed for the 4th combination with inputs of mean air temperature solar radiation wind speed and mean relative humidity 3 2 1 performance of knn method the best performance of the knn model was observed when the k was fixed to 5 i e when five closest samples were used for classification the statistical results of etc estimate using knn model with four combinations of meteorological input data knn1 knn2 knn3 and knn4 indicated the lowest performance of the model when crop et was estimated only with mean air temperature data a relevant improvement of et estimate more than 50 by means of mse rmse and mae was observed for the second scenario when solar radiation data are included as input together with mean air temperature data knn2 in that case in respect to scenario 1 the slope of regression forced through the origin was improved from 0 947 to 0 980 r2 from 0 813 to 0 968 ef from 0 848 to 0 970 mse from 0 623 to 0 123 mm day 1 rmse from 0 790 to 0 351 mm day 1 and mae from 0 563 to 0 263 mm day 1 the statistical parameters indicated similar performances of knn machine learning technique for the 3rd knn3 and 4th knn4 combination of input meteorological data comparison of observed and simulated crop et values for knn model are presented in fig 6 overall the knn model demonstrated tendency to slightly underestimate measured crop et excellent performances of knn were observed for scenarios 2 and 3 with the slope of regression forced through the origin of 0 980 and 0 990 respectively 3 2 2 performance of ann method when the ann model was applied the number of neurons in the hidden layer was optimized the most appropriate results were obtained for the ann 2 3 4 5 5 1 which means that the model consists of 2 neurons for 1st scenario 3neurons for 2nd scenario 4 neurons for 3rd scenario and 5 neurons for 4th scenario in input variables 5 neurons in the hidden layer and 1 output layer the rectified linear unit relu function was used as the activation function in the present study the performance of ann model for estimating daily etc over training and testing periods were assessed using four scenarios of availability of meteorological data table 4 for the testing subset the ann1 method fed only with mean air temperature data had the lowest performance with considering ef 0 766 mse 0 951 mm day 1 rmse 0 975 mm day 1 and mae 0 766 mm day 1 the regression forced through the origin indicated a slight overestimation of the model with slope of 1 029 and coefficient of determination r2 of 0 668 a relevant improvement of etc estimate was noticed for scenario 2 with the reduction of rmse to 0 584 mm day 1 of mae to 0 454 mm day 1 and of mse to 0 341 mm day 1 and with the increase of ef to 0 816 the slope of the regression equation forced through the origin was increased 1 072 while the coefficient of determination r2 was improved 0 936 a slight improvement of model performance was noted for scenarios 3 and 4 i e when the number of meteorological input variables was increased to 3 and 4 respectively the best performance was observed for the ann4 with inputs of mean air temperature solar radiation wind speed and mean relative humidity in that case r2 was 0 985 with the slope of regression forced through the origin of 0 991 ef was 0 986 mse was 0 057 mm day 1 rmse was 0 239 mm day 1 and mae was 0 166 mm day 1 in general it is observed that among all models integrating mean air temperature solar radiation wind speed and mean relative humidity data scenario 4 the ann method showed the best performance based on the statistical parameters in the testing period comparison of observed and simulated crop et values for ann model are presented in fig 7 the ann model showed the overestimation of the observed crop et by 2 9 7 2 and 6 4 for the scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively nevertheless for the 4th scenario the slope of regression forced through the origin was 0 991 with r2 of 0 985 3 2 3 performance of adaboost method a decision tree was boosted using the adaboost machine learning technique the best results were obtained for the number of estimators fixed to 50 and the number of learning rates fixed to 1 according to the results table 5 it can be noticed that adaboost method produced the poorest performance for scenario 1 with mse rmse mae ef r2 and slope of regression equal to 1 018 mm day 1 1 009 mm day 1 0 711 mm day 1 0 758 0 689 and 0 968 respectively the performance of adaboost was improved significantly more than 50 in terms of rmse mae and mse for second scenario adaboost2 a slight further improvement of model performance was observed for scenarios 3 and 4 adaboost model demonstrated the best performance for potato et estimate when scenario 4 of data availability was used with mse of 0 150 mm day 1 rmse of 0 388 mm day 1 mae of 0 301 mm day 1 ef of 0 968 r2 of 0 962 and slope of regression forced through the origin foxed to 0 959 comparison of observed and simulated crop et values for adaboost model are presented in fig 8 the adaboost model underestimated daily crop et observed in the field for all scenarios of availability of meteorological data according to the slope of regression line forced through the origin the overall underestimation was between 3 2 for scenario 1 and 7 2 for scenario 2 4 discussion the kcmid and kcend values differed in two years due to different weather conditions inputs rhmin and u2 in eqs 6 and 7 the calibrated kcmid and kcend values were compared with the results from other studies slatni et al 2011 reported kcmid equals to 1 12 for potato crop in tunisia which is close to the kcmid values calibrated in this study for the conditions of southern italy similarly parent and anctil 2012 found kcend 0 78 in south eastern canada which is in agreement with the results of this study nevertheless tabari et al 2013 reported kcmid and kcend values of 1 25 and 0 85 respectively which are slightly greater than those used in the present study therefore the adjustment of mid season and late season kc data to account for specific growing conditions should be adopted in the practice in order to improve crop et estimate the results of this study demonstrated that all the applied models knn ann and adaboost were able to describe nonlinear relationships between weather and crop parameters and to simulate adequately crop et moreover these nonparametric models have advantages in respect to empirical methods and to the fao pm equation since they require no knowledge of internal variables and offer simple solutions for non linear and multi variable functions kişi 2015 wang et al 2017 therefore they are particularly suitable in the areas characterized by limited weather observations which is a common case at many worldwide locations the type of input variables played a key role in the accuracy of et estimation with the machine learning models therefore all the applied models knn ann and adaboost were analysed under four different scenarios in order to understand to model performance under different number of input data that could occurred in the practice in this way each model indicates performance under different scenarios that were developed by correlation matrix each of machine learning algorithms can estimate crop et using as input only one weather parameter nevertheless in general the statistical parameters indicated the best performance of all models for the 4th scenario of weather data availability with full meteorological data while the lowest performance were observed for the 1st scenario with only temperature data these results confirmed the correlation between the input meteorological variables and potato etc that was reported in table 2 according to the presented results the knn model demonstrated the best performance for etc estimation when input meteorological data were limited i e for scenarios 1 2 and 3 the ann model was superior to other approaches only for the 4th scenario when all meteorological variables were used for etc estimate the latter observation is in agreement with the findings of tang et al 2018 who indicated that the ann method with full meteorological data performs better than other machine learning methods similarly aghajanloo et al 2013 applied the ann model with full meteorological data and 5 neurons in hidden layer for crop et estimate in a semi arid region of iran they reported smaller rmse but also smaller r2 in the testing phase in respect to the results of the present study several other studies confirmed that using all meteorological variables as input provides the best results in etc estimation abyaneh et al 2011 estimated the garlic etc with ann and anfis models and different meteorological variables and concluded that the use of all meteorological parameters provides better performance of the models in respect to the limited input parameters similar results were pointed out also by tabari et al 2013 when svm and anfis models were applied to estimate potato etc in iran according to our knowledge the knn and adaboost models were tested in the present study for the first time to predict crop et both models demonstrated good performance in the range of the ann method which is frequently used in et studies therefore these two machine learning techniques could be applied as an alternative to the ann method in general the knn model showed slightly better performance than adaboost this could mean that the knn decision rules focusing on the characteristics of the nearest neighbours resemble properly the behaviour of meteorological parameters and their correlation with crop evapotranspiration it should be pointed out that the performance of knn2 with mean air temperature and solar radiation was better than with any other combination of meteorological input data moreover the knn model was superior in respect to other machine learning techniques when only mean air temperature was used in et estimation and the statistical parameters were elaborated only for the testing subset the knn with only mean air temperature scenario 1 has similar performance as the elm machine learning method with full meteorological data feng et al 2016 the evapotranspiration estimate with knn did not improve with the 3rd and 4th combination of meteorological parameters which is fully in the agreement with the correlation matrix between crop et and meteorological variables table 2 in fact only mean air temperature and solar radiation have positive correlation with crop evapotranspiration on the contrary two other models ann and adaboost improved their performance in respect to the scenario 2 when the 3rd and 4th scenarios of meteorological data were used similarly to the ann the adaboost showed the best performance when all meteorological variables were used this can be explained by the fact that ann and adaboost applied much more complex algorithms in respect to the knn model which allowed them to enhance their performance with additional sets of input variables even when they are not positively correlated to crop evapotranspiration 5 conclusions the application of machine learning techniques in the fields of hydrology and environmental studies including agriculture and et estimate has been increasing in the last years this is due to reinforcement of agro meteorological networks equipped with the latest generation of sensors real time data acquisition and availability through the data cloud technologies and employment of powerful computing machines able to elaborate huge amount of data almost instantaneously in this context there is a need to test et estimates simulated by different machine learning methods and to compare them with detailed experimental data and et measurements in the present study knn and adaboost techniques were introduced for the first time to predict daily etc in order to investigate modelling performance with different scenarios of availability of meteorological input data and in respect to a well know machine learning technique as it is the ann model this model was used in many previous studies as a benchmarking tool in order to analyse the performance of new machine learning techniques the comparison of performances of three machine learning techniques was undertaken for four scenarios of availability of meteorological input data since in the practice it is a common situation the overall results indicated that the application of knn modelling technique with only mean air temperature or with combination of air temperature and solar radiation might be an adequate alternative solution to the use of other more complex machine learning algorithms and full meteorological datasets this finding is particularly relevant for marginal rural areas in developing countries where weather data are incomplete and they are usually limited only to air temperature information the present study focussed on the crop et estimate under optimal water supply certainly a future challenge might be to use the machine learning techniques for estimation of crop et under limited water supply and water stress conditions which is a common case for mediterranean environments in this case the determination of crop coefficient as a multifactor dependent parameter might be especially important thus further studies should be carried out to confirm and evaluate the applicability of knn and adaboost models for etc forecasting under different environmental conditions and input data availability this is of particular relevance for irrigated agriculture which faces numerous challenges on the road towards a more sustainable and efficient water use acknowledgment we are grateful to dr fatma wassar and dr burak yılmaz for sharing their

scenarios showed significant trend of increasing annual maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation and a significant decreasing trend of future rainfall second the average aquifer salinity is expected to increase from an average of 4 2 ds m 1 in 2018 to about 5 3 ds m 1 in 2050 seawater intrusion was identified as the main cause for this remarkable increase finally nir is expected to increase from an average value of 1459 mm year 1 during 2008 2018 to 1473 1950 mm year 1 during 2019 2050 depending on climate change scenario applied increase in aquifer salinity significantly contributed to this rapid increase of nir we believe that our results should be considered in developing adaptation strategies to manage future water resources in coastal areas

systems in the date palm growing countries it is widely cultivated in many arid or semi arid zones of the world such as north africa middle east south america south africa and australia king and thomas 2014 for it high caloric value and has been a staple crop in the mena for thousands of years date palm has naturally adapted to arid and semi arid conditions of these regions haj amor et al 2017 date palms provide numerous environmental benefits such as resistance to land erosion fao 2012 furthermore the date palms play a big role in the fight to stave off climate change since these trees absorb carbon dioxide to a significantly greater extent than other trees due to its large size sharif et al 2010 due to these positive benefices the oases ecosystems have been subject to many interventions and efforts from the global decision makers to conserve the date palms properly king and thomas 2014 in recent years the sustainability of oases ecosystems has been threatened by several serious factors such as the scarcity of irrigation water and the poor management of soil resources fao 2017 furthermore the sustainability of oases tends to be more critical due to the negative effects of climate change i e higher temperatures and fluctuating rainfall king and thomas 2014 the future climate is estimated to change gradually with an average temperature rise by up to 4 8 c by the end of the 21st century and rainfall is likely to change depending on latitude ipcc 2013 this potential change in climate will affect oases agriculture and may lead to biodiversity losses in several ways such as depletion of the limited water resources degradation of soil and water qualities and increase of soil erosion king and thomas 2014 furthermore it is expected that date palm water demandwill increase over the next few decades due to rising temperatures and evaporative demand chowdhury et al 2013 depending on location and climate conditions the crop requires a potential evapotranspiration value of 1400 to 3200 mm year 1 to grow and produce dates of good quality tripler et al 2011 climate change may increase this water demand because of a projected decrease in effective precipitation and increase in crop evapotranspiration shahid 2011 therefore quantification of the impacts of climate change on irrigation water requirement is essential for controlling irrigation practices saving water and for longterm water resources development and planning as revealed by several studies e g daccachea et al 2011 hwan et al 2013 quantification of the impacts of climate change on irrigation water demand would help to match applied irrigation to actual water demand however it was observed that a few studies have been conducted to understand the impacts of future climate change on irrigation water demand of date palm e g chowdhury et al 2013 alabdulkader et al 2016 moreover it is hypothesized that other unfavorable conditions may further increase total crop water demand such as increasing irrigation water salinity phogat et al 2018 were not considered indeed irrigation with saline water requires the application of more water to enable the leaching of salts from the root zone in order to prevent their excessive accumulation the leaching fraction is defined as the fraction of the amount of water draining beyond the root zone relative to the amount of applied irrigation water this water application must be considered in order to evaluate the impact of water salinity on total irrigation water requirement letey et al 2011 due to the limited rainfall in many date palm growing countries e g tunisia algeria etc shallow aquifers in coastal areas are commonly used as a primary irrigation source water salinity is more critical in the coastal areas due to increased salinity intrusion into shallow aquifers because of projected sea level rise chun et al 2018 the main objective of this study is to analysis the impacts of climate change on irrigation water requirements of date palm in a coastal oasis of tunisia from 2019 to 2050 by considering both rising temperatures and changes in irrigation water salinity of the coastal aquifer the study applied sdsm statistical downscaling model to project future climate variables in the oasis from 2019 to 2050 applied the sutra saturated unsaturated transport model to evaluate the salinity trend in irrigation water and used the cropwat software to calculate net irrigation water requirement nir 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description from 2008 2018 field experiments were carried out at metouia oasis 33 58 n 10 00 e a coastal oasis lies in gabes city southeastern tunisia fig 1 the oasis is bordered to the mediterranean sea to the east fig 1 the oasis is considered as one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to climate change rizzi et al 2016 the oasis extends to an area of 270 ha the soil in the oasis showed two textural classes sand and loamy sand the dominant cropping system is the date palms that are planted with a density of 100 palms ha 1 surface irrigation basin irrigation is the applied method for palms irrigation the oasis is characterized by an arid climate with high temperatures from 26 2 28 3 c low rainfall 200 mm year 1 and high potential evapotranspiration 1500 mm year 1 the oasis is characterized by a high relative humidity more than 40 and strong winds wind speed higher than 2 5 m s 1 thereby contributing to increased risks of dust generation yin et al 2005 the source of irrigation is a coastal aquifer known as a quaternary sandy aquifer spreading a vast area across the metouia region the sandy aquifer is covered by a clayey sand layer an unconsolidated sand containing 70 sand 29 clay and 1 silt the depth of the aquifer is 58 m and its average thickness is 35 m fig 2 the average electrical conductivity ec of the aquifer groundwater is 4 24 ds m 1 data for 2018 a perched shallow groundwater is also present in the oasis the shallow groundwater depths range between 2 3 and 2 6 m the average electrical conductivity of the water in this perched groundwater is 10 2 ds m 1 data for 2018 in order to avoid the negative effects of this shallow groundwater on soils the oasis was equipped with a subsurface drainage system 2 2 methodological framework the present study quantifies the change in net irrigation water requirement nir of date palm at the metouia oasis from 2019 to 2050 under various climate change scenarios during this period changes in electrical conductivity of the irrigation water was considered as a major factor on nir therefore a methodological framework fig 3 was developed based on three successive steps i climate change projections the future climate scenarios of metouia oasis was projected using the outputs of a general circulation model for the 2019 2050 period ii irrigation water electrical conductivity eciw estimations calibrated and validated sutra saturated unsaturated transport model was used to estimate eciw changes for the quaternary aquifer from 2019 to 2050 iii nir calculations the results obtained from step 1 i e projected and corrected climate variables and step 2 irrigation water eciw were used to calculate the annual nir for the period of 2019 to 2050 2 3 climate change projections general circulation models gcms are common tools for climate change projection in this study the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 which is widely applied to assess global and regional climate change was used to project future climate variables future climate projections in cmip5 were modelled with representative concentration pathways rcps for greenhouse gases and future population distributions follows the shared socioeconomic pathways ssps the rcps represent different climate scenarios determined by future greenhouse gas emissions and their impacts on radiative forcing in this study three rcps scenarios were considered

the optimal model which can give the good simulation of climate variables the performances of these 37 models in simulating each climate variable i e maximum temperature minimum temperature wind speed solar radiation and rainfall for the historical reference period 1964 2013 in metouia region were assessed against observations the relative root mean square error rrmse eq 1 and kling gupta efficiency kge eq 2 were calculated and used as statistical indicators for evaluating the performance of climate variables the smaller the rrmse the better the simulation effect also in a perfect model with no data errors the kge value is equal to 1 gupta et al 2009 values of rrmse and kge were presented in table 1 based on these statistical results i e table 1 hadcm3 was selected because of its good simulation of climate variables table 1 shows only the results of temperature variable but good results were also ensured for the other climate variables 1 rrmse r m s e r m s e m e d i a n r

average of measured eciw and n is the number of measurements because the spatial resolution of hadcm3 output 3 75 2 5 cubasch et al 2013 is large relative to the studied oasis the climate change scenarios were downscaled at the oasis scale by statistical downscaling tool sdsm using the method proposed by wood et al 2004 which has been tested and widely applied to downscale climate variables to a 0 12 spatial scale hopmans and maurer 2008 the sdsm was used to develop the future climate scenario including data for maximum temperature minimum temperature wind speed solar radiation and rainfall daily data these downscaled data were bias corrected by comparing the past model data with historical observed data 1964 2013 period see appendix a the relative humidity rh was not available from the hadcm3 consequently rh was calculated as the ratio between actual water vapour pressure and saturation vapour pressure that are function of temperature equations used for this calculation were reported in eccel 2012 the climate projections obtained were used as inputs to sutra model to estimate the futures irrigation water electrical conductivities and as inputs to cropwat software to calculate nir in metouia oasis furthermore two non parametric tests mann kendall and sen s slope were applied to detect the trends in climate parameters annual values for the past 1964 2013 and future 2019 2050 periods the mann kendall and sen s tests were used worldwide and were demonstrated good agreement of performance in detection of the trend for climate variables for more details about these statistical tests see gocic and trajkovic 2013 2 4 projection of possible changes in irrigation water electrical conductivities in this step at an aquifer monitoring well installed in metouia oasis we quantified the annual change in electrical conductivity eciw of quaternary aquifer from 2019 to 2050 compared to eciw of a reference period 2008 2018 for the 3 selected climate scenarios rcp8 5 rcp6 0 and rcp4 5 projected and corrected climate data were exploited as input data in sutra model in addition to other required data change in eciw was simulated through modeling of seawater intrusion process resulted from sea level rise and change in fresh water recharge as consequences of climate change conditions during 2019 2050 in the following sections we present details about the sutra modeling 2 4 1 sutra model description sutra model is a finite element simulation model which has been widely applied for simulating seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers in near well chun et al 2018 a detailed description of this program was reported in voss and provost 2002 the seawater intrusion process is mathematically described as variably density saturated flow coupled with non reactive solute transport of total dissolved solids or chloride hence sutra applied eq 3 fluid mass balance equation and eq 4 solute mass balance equation to express the transport of salts in the aquifer 3 s w

simulate aquifer flow and solute transport modelmuse software winston 2009 was used to generate irregular quadrilateral finite element meshes and to construct input files for sutra model a streamline from 200 m distant to coastline to the monitoring well was stretched and two dimensional irregular meshes were created along the stretched streamline in fig 4 we show the properties of the simulated domain the properties of the sands sediments of the aquifer and the upper clayey sand layer fig 2 such as hydraulic conductivity porosity etc were specified for the simulated domain 2 4 3 required data for sutra the following data were collected from the study area through an intensive field work i aquifer levels la and water electrical conductivity eciw data were measured on a daily basis in a monitoring well which was installed in the oasis in 2008 this well is located at 1320 m from the coastal line la was measured using a water level sensor diver di240 van essen instrument furthermore an eciw sensor was installed in the well at 44 m depth in order to measure eciw fig 4 the eciw data expressed in ds m 1 were converted to total dissolved solids tds using a linear relationship developed by sapi study team 2015 where 0 83 is found to be the local slope between aquifer eciw ds m 1 and aquifer tds g l 1 ii climate data for the reference period 2008 2018 were measured on a daily basis by an automatic meteorological station installed in the studied oasis for the future period 2019 2030 the downscaled and bias corrected climate variables from echam3 model were used iii daily sea level measurements were obtained from the national institute of science and technology of the sea nists tunisia the available sea level data from 1981 to 2018 fig 5 were exploited to project the possible sea level rise under climate change for the future period 2019 2050 details about this projection were reported in details in chun et al 2018 the projected sea level rises were specified as boundary conditions iv flow and solute transport parameters were assigned to the model cells in table 2 we summarized these parameters with their methods or sources of determination and their values used for the simulation v the boundary conditions were defined by freshwater recharge rates hydrostatic seawater pressures identified based on sea level rise and seawater concentrations determined during the reference period i e from 1st january 2008 to 31th december 2018 fig 4 the total dissolved solids tds of recharge due to rainfall is zero i e c 0 kg tds kg fluid also the last measured freshwater recharge rates hydrostatic seawater pressures and seawater concentrations in 31th december 2018 were used as initial condition for the future simulation 2019 2050 2 4 4 sutra calibration and validation the measured water electrical conductivity eciw of the quaternary aquifer from 2008 to 2012 were used for the calibration of the transport parameters i e longitudinal dispersivity and transverse dispersivity whereas those during 2013 2018 were used for the validation the calibrated longitudinal dispersivity and transverse dispersivity were noted in table 2 the sutra results for current climate 2008 2018 modeling were validated based on a comparison between the measured and simulated eciw values during this period for this comparison three statistical indicators root mean square error rmse model efficiency me and relative error re were calculated in order to evaluate sutra performance 5 r m s e 1 n s i m i 2 6 m e 1 i 1 n s i m i 2 i 1 n m i m 2 7 r e 1 n i 1 n s i m i

s cropwat software smith 1991 was selected as a tool to determine the annual net irrigation water requirement nir of date palms from 2019 to 2050 under the selected climate change scenarios rcp8 5 rcp6 0 and rcp4 5 nir was estimated on a daily basis then the yearly nir for each year was determined in order to identify year to year differences in nir over the studied period cropwat has been widely used with success in assessing irrigation requirements under various climate and crop conditions in this study nir was determined with consideration of the amount of irrigation required for crop evapotranspiration leaching requirement effective rainfall and the effects of future salinity trend in irrigation source i e irrigation water electrical conductivities firstly cropwat was used to estimate reference evapotranspiration et0 crop evapotranspiration etc and effective rainfall er then using excel software the sutra outputs i e irrigation water electrical conductivities for 2019 2050 period were exploited in order to estimate nir based on the following equation fao 1997 8 nir k c e t 0 1 lr er where kc is the crop growth stage coefficient for date palms et0 is the reference evapotranspiration kc et0 is the crop evapotranspiration lr is the leaching requirement and er is the effective rainfall the crop growth stage coefficient kc for date palms kc 0 85 0 95 was obtained from fao database allen et al 1998 the leaching requirement lr is defined as the minimum water amount required for removing salts from the root zone rhoades 1974 developed the following equation for determining lr 9 l r e c i w 5 e c e e c i w where eciw is the irrigation water electrical conductivity expressed in ds m 1 and ece is the crop salt tolerance threshold expressed in ds m 1 ayres and westcot 1985 reported the crop salt tolerance information using the salt tolerance threshold value ece and the percent yield decline per unit increase in soil salinity beyond the threshold value for the date palm they mentioned that ece 6 8 ds m 1 at 90 yield potential over the reference period 2008 2018 for each year lr was calculated according to the measured electrical conductivity of applied irrigation water fig 6 over the future period 2019 2050 for each year lr was calculated according to the simulated electrical conductivity of irrigation water fig 6 using the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 et0 was calculated based on the downscaled and bias corrected daily climate data from 2019 to 2050 er is the amount of rainfall that is effectively stored in the soil er was computed as a simulation output from cropwat from the rainfall projections following the usda soil conservation service method the non parametric mann kendall test was applied to detect the trends in nir etc et0 lr and er for the past 2008 2018 and future 2019 2050 periods furthermore in order to evaluate any significant differences between the results that were obtained under the climate scenarios rcp8 5 rcp6 0 and rcp4 5 nir results were analyzed using the tukey test p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 future climate conditions in metouia oasis the results of the mann kendall test on the investigated climate parameters for both the past 1964 2013 and future 2019 2050 periods in metouia oasis are illustrated in table 3 positive values of mann kendall test indicate increasing trends while negative values indicate decreasing trends gocic and trajkovic 2013 hence the hadcm3 model showed significant increasing trends of annual maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation for both the past 1964 2013 and future 2019 2050 period table 3 for the same location study similar increasing trends were also reported in metdsd 2014 however the model showed a significant decreasing trend of annual rainfall table 3 such changes in climatic parameters may increase the aridity condition in the studied oasis furthermore as shown in table 3 in comparison to the trends of the future period 2019 2050 higher values of mann kendall trends during the past period 2064 2013 were noted these critical trends could be the consequences of enormous greenhouse gases derived from the huge industrial activities since the installation of icc industrial chemical company in gabes city in 1960 eea 2010 as confirmed by ipcc 2013 the greenhouse gases from industrial activities are considered as the main driver of observed climate change during the past centuries for the future period 2019 2050 the hadcm3 model returns the same decreasing trend in annual rainfall and the same increasing trend in other climate parameters i e maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation for the three greenhouse gas emissions scenarios considered table 3 the increasing trend in temperature maximum and minimum values may mainly attributed to the high co2 concentrations in the atmosphere whereas the decreasing trend in rainfall could be the consequences of decreased cloud coverage since we found an increased solar radiation the estimated future climate observations could be so useful for several sectors such as water resources agriculture soil resources etc for their future sustainable management and planning ahmed et al 2018 the results of the sen s slope tests on the investigated climate parameters for both the past 1964 2013 and future 2019 2050 periods in metouia oasis are presented fig 7 as shown in fig 7 it is clear that the highest increase in maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation were observed for the highest greenhouse gas emissions scenario rcp8 5 scenario whereas the lowest increase were found for the lowest greenhouse gas emissions scenario rcp4 5 scenario the highest and lowest decreases in rainfall were also found for highest and lowest emission scenarios several similar future climate trends with hadcm3 model were also observed across all arid countries e g laux et al 2010 ahmed et al 2018 these possible future climate conditions may lead to more pressure on water resources coastal and deep aquifers in gabes city therefore proper agricultural water management should be highly considered to conserve the water resources 3 2 future irrigation water electrical conductivity prior to the future 2019 2050 simulation of irrigation water electrical conductivity eciw with sutra model the measured and the simulated eciw from 2008 to 2018 i e baseline period were compared in order to evaluate the performance of used model fig 6 table 4 showed the average values of measured and simulated eciw during this baseline period under various climate scenarios in addition to the values of rmse me and re indicators that were used for model evaluation the low values of rmse 0 16 0 41 ds m 1 i e close to 0 coupled with the obtained me values 0 66 0 81 i e close to 1 demonstrated that sutra model successfully evaluated salinity of aquifer which was resulted due to seawater intrusion this demonstration was also supported by the small re values 1 89 2 75 i e close to 0 the differences between the measured and simulated eciw could be the result of some measurements errors for some input data chun et al 2018 on the other hand as shown in fig 6 it was observed that the measured eciw was increased from 3 1 in 2008 to 4 2 ds m 1 in 2018 under normal exploitation of the quaternary aquifer i e there in not overexploitation this significant increasing in eciw confirmed that seawater intrusion did already take place in the aquifer during the last 10 years 2008 2018 previous international studies e g colombani et al 2015 chun et al 2018 have also demonstrated the significant contribution of seawater to the rapid coastal aquifer salinity increase in our study high values of hydraulic conductivity of aquifer zone table 2 coupled with the low values of recharge rates table 2 could be the main factors that were allowed to facile intrusion of seawater within the aquifer colombani et al 2015 additionally as discussed in the above section section 3 1 the climate change which was occurred in gabes coast during the last years as a result of high greenhouse gases emission could be a contributor for this seawater intrusion colombani et al 2015 furthermore the simulated eciw from 2019 to 2050 fig 6 demonstrated that the aquifer salinity will continue to increase under the three climate scenarios rcp8 5 rcp6 0 and rcp4 5 selected for the future simulation for all these scenarios as shown in fig 6 eciw is expected to reach critical level about 5 3 ds m 1 by 2050 which allowed classifying the irrigation water as high saline water therefore greater attention to seawater intrusion phenomenon in the studied region is so urgent to assure sustainable use of quaternary aquifer the rcp8 5 rcp6 0 and rcp4 5 emissions are high compared to the actual greenhouse gases emissions in gabes region over 2008 2018 8479 kt co2 eq yr data from industrial chemical company tunisia this could explain the steep increase in eciw from 2019 to 2050 based on sutra model estimations it was revealed that the studied costal area gabes coast was affected from seawater intrusion the expected climate change from 2019 to 2050 would lead to additional intrusion of seawater toward the aquifer particularly during summer season when demand for coastal aquifer was at its maximum in this regard some management practices such as reduce water use and reduce pump depth need to be conducted to avoid or at least minimize the progressive increase in irrigation water salinity 3 3 irrigation water requirement under current and future climate conditions fig 8 showed changes in net irrigation water requirement nir crop evapotranspiration etc reference crop evapotranspiration et0 leaching requirement lr and effective rainfall er for both past 2008 2018 and future 2019 2050 periods as shown in fig 8 nir is expected to increase progressively from an average value of 1459 mm year 1 during 2008 2018 to 1473 1950 mm year 1 during 2019 2050 depending on climate change scenarios the highest increase trend in nir was observed for the highest greenhouse gas emissions scenario a2 scenario whereas the lowest increase trend was recorded for the lowest greenhouse gas emissions scenario b2 scenario similar variation with these two scenarios were also noted for etc and et0 etc and et0 depend in high part on temperature acharjee et al 2017 hence the future change in these three variables could be the consequences of the increasing trend in monthly temperatures from 2019 to 2050 table 3 decreasing trends of rainfall contribute to increase in nir the amount of effective rainfall is very small compared to the nir for date palm in the study region therefore the changes in annual effective rainfall would not much affect the nir however based on the positive values of mann kendall trends table 5 we can revealed that the increasing trends in irrigation water salinity from 2019 to 2050 fig 6 and in leaching requirement fig 8 were significantly contributed to increase the nir no significant impact of effective rainfall on the nir was detected table 5 on another hand there are significant differences in the nir change between the three climate scenarios table 5 this is because these three parameters i e nir etc and et0 depend in high part on climate variables acharjee et al 2017 that showed difference between the three climate scenarios fig 7 due to the minor change in rainfall with the three climate scenarios no significant difference in the er was detected this confirmed that increase in climatic water requirement and lr contributed to the large part of increase in nir table 6 under the rapid increase in nir due to climate change and because irrigation of date palms is mainly from non renewable aquifers zammouri et al 2007 an adequate adaptation measure that can minimize the greenhouse gases emission and efficient irrigation water management appear as two adaptation strategies of capital importance to sustain date palm s productivity in tunisia as both the climate variables and salinity of applied water are important for irrigation management a close monitoring of these factors can be helpful for better water management planning regular measurement of irrigation water salinity is so needed also set up good quality meteorological stations in the tunisian oases i e date palm fields for close monitoring and regular evaluation of changes in climatic parameters would be so useful to take anticipatory decision related to agricultural water management to cope with climate change acharjee et al 2017 4 conclusion this study quantified the effects of climate change on net irrigation water requirement of date palms under future salinity trend in costal aquifer in a tunisian oasis this quantification was performed following a methodological framework which was developed based on various tools sdsm sutra and cropwat the findings of this study revealed that expected climate change from 2019 to 2050 in the studied oasis would mainly decrease annual rainfall and increase monthly minimum and maximum temperatures furthermore during this future period the aquifer salinity is expected to vary from an average value of 4 2 ds m 1 in 2018 to about 5 3 ds m 1 in 2050 the seawater intrusion was identified as a main factor for this remarkable increase under these conditions the net irrigation water requirement of date palms which depends mainly on climate variables and water salinity is expected to increase from an average value of 1459 mm year 1 during 2008 2018 to 1473 1950 mm year 1 during 2019 2050 salinity trend in used aquifer was significantly contributed to this rapid increasing responding to this increased irrigation requirements improving resiliency and adaptive capacity and responding to increased water salinity due to seawater intrusion are some of the adaptation measures that can offsets the potential negative impacts of climate change in date palms production the potential developed adaption measures must be evaluated before recommending to

10783,in coastal saline areas many studies ignore salinity problems when quantifying the impacts of climate change on irrigation water requirement based on 11 years 2008 2018 of field investigations in a tunisian coastal oasis this study simulated the changes in salinity in a coastal aquifer and quantified changes in net irrigation requirement nir of date palm under climate change considering required changes in leaching requirement the future salinity in the aquifer was simulated based on sea level rise and changes in aquifer recharge the study applied a statistical downscaling model sdsm to project future climate variables from 2019 to 2050 the sutra model to evaluate the change in aquifer salinity and applied cropwat software to calculate nir three climate change scenarios were considered rcp8 5 very high emission scenario rcp6 0 medium emission scenario and rcp4 5 lowest emission scenario several useful finding were revealed in this study first these three climate change scenarios showed significant trend of increasing annual maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation and a significant decreasing trend of future rainfall second the average aquifer salinity is expected to increase from an average of 4 2 ds m 1 in 2018 to about 5 3 ds m 1 in 2050 seawater intrusion was identified as the main cause for this remarkable increase finally nir is expected to increase from an average value of 1459 mm year 1 during 2008 2018 to 1473 1950 mm year 1 during 2019 2050 depending on climate change scenario applied increase in aquifer salinity significantly contributed to this rapid increase of nir we believe that our results should be considered in developing adaptation strategies to manage future water resources in coastal areas

interventions and efforts from the global decision makers to conserve the date palms properly king and thomas 2014 in recent years the sustainability of oases ecosystems has been threatened by several serious factors such as the scarcity of irrigation water and the poor management of soil resources fao 2017 furthermore the sustainability of oases tends to be more critical due to the negative effects of climate change i e higher temperatures and fluctuating rainfall king and thomas 2014 the future climate is estimated to change gradually with an average temperature rise by up to 4 8 c by the end of the 21st century and rainfall is likely to change depending on latitude ipcc 2013 this potential change in climate will affect oases agriculture and may lead to biodiversity losses in several ways such as depletion of the limited water resources degradation of soil and water qualities and increase of soil erosion king and thomas 2014 furthermore it is expected that date palm water demandwill increase over the next few decades due to rising temperatures and evaporative demand chowdhury et al 2013 depending on location and climate conditions the crop requires a potential evapotranspiration value of 1400 to 3200 mm year 1 to grow and produce dates of good quality tripler et al 2011 climate change may increase this water demand because of a projected decrease in effective precipitation and increase in crop evapotranspiration shahid 2011 therefore quantification of the impacts of climate change on irrigation water requirement is essential for controlling irrigation practices saving water and for longterm water resources development and planning as revealed by several studies e g daccachea et al 2011 hwan et al 2013 quantification of the impacts of climate change on irrigation water demand would help to match applied irrigation to actual water demand however it was observed that a few studies have been conducted to understand the impacts of future climate change on irrigation water demand of date palm e g chowdhury et al 2013 alabdulkader et al 2016 moreover it is hypothesized that other unfavorable conditions may further increase total crop water demand such as increasing irrigation water salinity phogat et al 2018 were not considered indeed irrigation with saline water requires the application of more water to enable the leaching of salts from the root zone in order to prevent their excessive accumulation the leaching fraction is defined as the fraction of the amount of water draining beyond the root zone relative to the amount of applied irrigation water this water application must be considered in order to evaluate the impact of water salinity on total irrigation water requirement letey et al 2011 due to the limited rainfall in many date palm growing countries e g tunisia algeria etc shallow aquifers in coastal areas are commonly used as a primary irrigation source water salinity is more critical in the coastal areas due to increased salinity intrusion into shallow aquifers because of projected sea level rise chun et al 2018 the main objective of this study is to analysis the impacts of climate change on irrigation water requirements of date palm in a coastal oasis of tunisia from 2019 to 2050 by considering both rising temperatures and changes in irrigation water salinity of the coastal aquifer the study applied sdsm statistical downscaling model to project future climate variables in the oasis from 2019 to 2050 applied the sutra saturated unsaturated transport model to evaluate the salinity trend in irrigation water and used the cropwat software to calculate net irrigation water requirement nir 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description from 2008 2018 field experiments were carried out at metouia oasis 33 58 n 10 00 e a coastal oasis lies in gabes city southeastern tunisia fig 1 the oasis is bordered to the mediterranean sea to the east fig 1 the oasis is considered as one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to climate change rizzi et al 2016 the oasis extends to an area of 270 ha the soil in the oasis showed two textural classes sand and loamy sand the dominant cropping system is the date palms that are planted with a density of 100 palms ha 1 surface irrigation basin irrigation is the applied method for palms irrigation the oasis is characterized by an arid climate with high temperatures from 26 2 28 3 c low rainfall 200 mm year 1 and high potential evapotranspiration 1500 mm year 1 the oasis is characterized by a high relative humidity more than 40 and strong winds wind speed higher than 2 5 m s 1 thereby contributing to increased risks of dust generation yin et al 2005 the source of irrigation is a coastal aquifer known as a quaternary sandy aquifer spreading a vast area across the metouia region the sandy aquifer is covered by a clayey sand layer an unconsolidated sand containing 70 sand 29 clay and 1 silt the depth of the aquifer is 58 m and its average thickness is 35 m fig 2 the average electrical conductivity ec of the aquifer groundwater is 4 24 ds m 1 data for 2018 a perched shallow groundwater is also present in the oasis the shallow groundwater depths range between 2 3 and 2 6 m the average electrical conductivity of the water in this perched groundwater is 10 2 ds m 1 data for 2018 in order to avoid the negative effects of this shallow groundwater on soils the oasis was equipped with a subsurface drainage system 2 2 methodological framework the present study quantifies the change in net irrigation water requirement nir of date palm at the metouia oasis from 2019 to 2050 under various climate change scenarios during this period changes in electrical conductivity of the irrigation water was considered as a major factor on nir therefore a methodological framework fig 3 was developed based on three successive steps i climate change projections the future climate scenarios of metouia oasis was projected using the outputs of a general circulation model for the 2019 2050 period ii irrigation water electrical conductivity eciw estimations calibrated and validated sutra saturated unsaturated transport model was used to estimate eciw changes for the quaternary aquifer from 2019 to 2050 iii nir calculations the results obtained from step 1 i e projected and corrected climate variables and step 2 irrigation water eciw were used to calculate the annual nir for the period of 2019 to 2050 2 3 climate change projections general circulation models gcms are common tools for climate change projection in this study the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 which is widely applied to assess global and regional climate change was used to project future climate variables future climate projections in cmip5 were modelled with representative concentration pathways rcps for greenhouse gases and future population distributions follows the shared socioeconomic pathways ssps the rcps represent different climate scenarios determined by future greenhouse gas emissions and their impacts on radiative forcing in this study three rcps scenarios were considered rcp8 5 very high emission scenario rcp6 0 medium emission scenario and rcp4 5 lowest emission scenario in this study the performances of 37 global climate models gcms of cmip5 access 1 0 access 1 3

the optimal model which can give the good simulation of climate variables the performances of these 37 models in simulating each climate variable i e maximum temperature minimum temperature wind speed solar radiation and rainfall for the historical reference period 1964 2013 in metouia region were assessed against observations the relative root mean square error rrmse eq 1 and kling gupta efficiency kge eq 2 were calculated and used as statistical indicators for evaluating the performance of climate variables the smaller the rrmse the better the simulation effect also in a perfect model with no data errors the kge value is equal to 1 gupta et al 2009 values of rrmse and kge were presented in table 1 based on these statistical results i e table 1 hadcm3 was selected because of its good simulation of climate variables table 1 shows only the results of temperature variable but good results were also ensured for the other climate variables 1 rrmse r m s e r m s e m e d i a n r

average of measured eciw and n is the number of measurements because the spatial resolution of hadcm3 output 3 75 2 5 cubasch et al 2013 is large relative to the studied oasis the climate change scenarios were downscaled at the oasis scale by statistical downscaling tool sdsm using the method proposed by wood et al 2004 which has been tested and widely applied to downscale climate variables to a 0 12 spatial scale hopmans and maurer 2008 the sdsm was used to develop the future climate scenario including data for maximum temperature minimum temperature wind speed solar radiation and rainfall daily data these downscaled data were bias corrected by comparing the past model data with historical observed data 1964 2013 period see appendix a the relative humidity rh was not available from the hadcm3 consequently rh was calculated as the ratio between actual water vapour pressure and saturation vapour pressure that are function of temperature equations used for this calculation were reported in eccel 2012 the climate projections obtained were used as inputs to sutra model to estimate the futures irrigation water electrical conductivities and as inputs to cropwat software to calculate nir in metouia oasis furthermore two non parametric tests mann kendall and sen s slope were applied to detect the trends in climate parameters annual values for the past 1964 2013 and future 2019 2050 periods the mann kendall and sen s tests were used worldwide and were demonstrated good agreement of performance in detection of the trend for climate variables for more details about these statistical tests see gocic and trajkovic 2013 2 4 projection of possible changes in irrigation water electrical conductivities in this step at an aquifer monitoring well installed in metouia oasis we quantified the annual change in electrical conductivity eciw of quaternary aquifer from 2019 to 2050 compared to eciw of a reference period 2008 2018 for the 3 selected climate scenarios rcp8 5 rcp6 0 and rcp4 5 projected and corrected climate data were exploited as input data in sutra model in addition to other required data change in eciw was simulated through modeling of seawater intrusion process resulted from sea level rise and change in fresh water recharge as consequences of climate change conditions during 2019 2050 in the following sections we present details about the sutra modeling 2 4 1 sutra model description sutra model is a finite element simulation model which has been widely applied for simulating seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers in near well chun et al 2018 a detailed description of this program was reported in voss and provost 2002 the seawater intrusion process is mathematically described as variably density saturated flow coupled with non reactive solute transport of total dissolved solids or chloride hence sutra applied eq 3 fluid mass balance equation and eq 4 solute mass balance equation to express the transport of salts in the aquifer 3 s w

simulate aquifer flow and solute transport modelmuse software winston 2009 was used to generate irregular quadrilateral finite element meshes and to construct input files for sutra model a streamline from 200 m distant to coastline to the monitoring well was stretched and two dimensional irregular meshes were created along the stretched streamline in fig 4 we show the properties of the simulated domain the properties of the sands sediments of the aquifer and the upper clayey sand layer fig 2 such as hydraulic conductivity porosity etc were specified for the simulated domain 2 4 3 required data for sutra the following data were collected from the study area through an intensive field work i aquifer levels la and water electrical conductivity eciw data were measured on a daily basis in a monitoring well which was installed in the oasis in 2008 this well is located at 1320 m from the coastal line la was measured using a water level sensor diver di240 van essen instrument furthermore an eciw sensor was installed in the well at 44 m depth in order to measure eciw fig 4 the eciw data expressed in ds m 1 were converted to total dissolved solids tds using a linear relationship developed by sapi study team 2015 where 0 83 is found to be the local slope between aquifer eciw ds m 1 and aquifer tds g l 1 ii climate data for the reference period 2008 2018 were measured on a daily basis by an automatic meteorological station installed in the studied oasis for the future period 2019 2030 the downscaled and bias corrected climate variables from echam3 model were used iii daily sea level measurements were obtained from the national institute of science and technology of the sea nists tunisia the available sea level data from 1981 to 2018 fig 5 were exploited to project the possible sea level rise under climate change for the future period 2019 2050 details about this projection were reported in details in chun et al 2018 the projected sea level rises were specified as boundary conditions iv flow and solute transport parameters were assigned to the model cells in table 2 we summarized these parameters with their methods or sources of determination and their values used for the simulation v the boundary conditions were defined by freshwater recharge rates hydrostatic seawater pressures identified based on sea level rise and seawater concentrations determined during the reference period i e from 1st january 2008 to 31th december 2018 fig 4 the total dissolved solids tds of recharge due to rainfall is zero i e c 0 kg tds kg fluid also the last measured freshwater recharge rates hydrostatic seawater pressures and seawater concentrations in 31th december 2018 were used as initial condition for the future simulation 2019 2050 2 4 4 sutra calibration and validation the measured water electrical conductivity eciw of the quaternary aquifer from 2008 to 2012 were used for the calibration of the transport parameters i e longitudinal dispersivity and transverse dispersivity whereas those during 2013 2018 were used for the validation the calibrated longitudinal dispersivity and transverse dispersivity were noted in table 2 the sutra results for current climate 2008 2018 modeling were validated based on a comparison between the measured and simulated eciw values during this period for this comparison three statistical indicators root mean square error rmse model efficiency me and relative error re were calculated in order to evaluate sutra performance 5 r m s e 1 n s i m i 2 6 m e 1 i 1 n s i m i 2 i 1 n m i m 2 7 r e 1 n i 1 n s i m i

s cropwat software smith 1991 was selected as a tool to determine the annual net irrigation water requirement nir of date palms from 2019 to 2050 under the selected climate change scenarios rcp8 5 rcp6 0 and rcp4 5 nir was estimated on a daily basis then the yearly nir for each year was determined in order to identify year to year differences in nir over the studied period cropwat has been widely used with success in assessing irrigation requirements under various climate and crop conditions in this study nir was determined with consideration of the amount of irrigation required for crop evapotranspiration leaching requirement effective rainfall and the effects of future salinity trend in irrigation source i e irrigation water electrical conductivities firstly cropwat was used to estimate reference evapotranspiration et0 crop evapotranspiration etc and effective rainfall er then using excel software the sutra outputs i e irrigation water electrical conductivities for 2019 2050 period were exploited in order to estimate nir based on the following equation fao 1997 8 nir k c e t 0 1 lr er where kc is the crop growth stage coefficient for date palms et0 is the reference evapotranspiration kc et0 is the crop evapotranspiration lr is the leaching requirement and er is the effective rainfall the crop growth stage coefficient kc for date palms kc 0 85 0 95 was obtained from fao database allen et al 1998 the leaching requirement lr is defined as the minimum water amount required for removing salts from the root zone rhoades 1974 developed the following equation for determining lr 9 l r e c i w 5 e c e e c i w where eciw is the irrigation water electrical conductivity expressed in ds m 1 and ece is the crop salt tolerance threshold expressed in ds m 1 ayres and westcot 1985 reported the crop salt tolerance information using the salt tolerance threshold value ece and the percent yield decline per unit increase in soil salinity beyond the threshold value for the date palm they mentioned that ece 6 8 ds m 1 at 90 yield potential over the reference period 2008 2018 for each year lr was calculated according to the measured electrical conductivity of applied irrigation water fig 6 over the future period 2019 2050 for each year lr was calculated according to the simulated electrical conductivity of irrigation water fig 6 using the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 et0 was calculated based on the downscaled and bias corrected daily climate data from 2019 to 2050 er is the amount of rainfall that is effectively stored in the soil er was computed as a simulation output from cropwat from the rainfall projections following the usda soil conservation service method the non parametric mann kendall test was applied to detect the trends in nir etc et0 lr and er for the past 2008 2018 and future 2019 2050 periods furthermore in order to evaluate any significant differences between the results that were obtained under the climate scenarios rcp8 5 rcp6 0 and rcp4 5 nir results were analyzed using the tukey test p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 future climate conditions in metouia oasis the results of the mann kendall test on the investigated climate parameters for both the past 1964 2013 and future 2019 2050 periods in metouia oasis are illustrated in table 3 positive values of mann kendall test indicate increasing trends while negative values indicate decreasing trends gocic and trajkovic 2013 hence the hadcm3 model showed significant increasing trends of annual maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation for both the past 1964 2013 and future 2019 2050 period table 3 for the same location study similar increasing trends were also reported in metdsd 2014 however the model showed a significant decreasing trend of annual rainfall table 3 such changes in climatic parameters may increase the aridity condition in the studied oasis furthermore as shown in table 3 in comparison to the trends of the future period 2019 2050 higher values of mann kendall trends during the past period 2064 2013 were noted these critical trends could be the consequences of enormous greenhouse gases derived from the huge industrial activities since the installation of icc industrial chemical company in gabes city in 1960 eea 2010 as confirmed by ipcc 2013 the greenhouse gases from industrial activities are considered as the main driver of observed climate change during the past centuries for the future period 2019 2050 the hadcm3 model returns the same decreasing trend in annual rainfall and the same increasing trend in other climate parameters i e maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation for the three greenhouse gas emissions scenarios considered table 3 the increasing trend in temperature maximum and minimum values may mainly attributed to the high co2 concentrations in the atmosphere whereas the decreasing trend in rainfall could be the consequences of decreased cloud coverage since we found an increased solar radiation the estimated future climate observations could be so useful for several sectors such as water resources agriculture soil resources etc for their future sustainable management and planning ahmed et al 2018 the results of the sen s slope tests on the investigated climate parameters for both the past 1964 2013 and future 2019 2050 periods in metouia oasis are presented fig 7 as shown in fig 7 it is clear that the highest increase in maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation were observed for the highest greenhouse gas emissions scenario rcp8 5 scenario whereas the lowest increase were found for the lowest greenhouse gas emissions scenario rcp4 5 scenario the highest and lowest decreases in rainfall were also found for highest and lowest emission scenarios several similar future climate trends with hadcm3 model were also observed across all arid countries e g laux et al 2010 ahmed et al 2018 these possible future climate conditions may lead to more pressure on water resources coastal and deep aquifers in gabes city therefore proper agricultural water management should be highly considered to conserve the water resources 3 2 future irrigation water electrical conductivity prior to the future 2019 2050 simulation of irrigation water electrical conductivity eciw with sutra model the measured and the simulated eciw from 2008 to 2018 i e baseline period were compared in order to evaluate the performance of used model fig 6 table 4 showed the average values of measured and simulated eciw during this baseline period under various climate scenarios in addition to the values of rmse me and re indicators that were used for model evaluation the low values of rmse 0 16 0 41 ds m 1 i e close to 0 coupled with the obtained me values 0 66 0 81 i e close to 1 demonstrated that sutra model successfully evaluated salinity of aquifer which was resulted due to seawater intrusion this demonstration was also supported by the small re values 1 89 2 75 i e close to 0 the differences between the measured and simulated eciw could be the result of some measurements errors for some input data chun et al 2018 on the other hand as shown in fig 6 it was observed that the measured eciw was increased from 3 1 in 2008 to 4 2 ds m 1 in 2018 under normal exploitation of the quaternary aquifer i e there in not overexploitation this significant increasing in eciw confirmed that seawater intrusion did already take place in the aquifer during the last 10 years 2008 2018 previous international studies e g colombani et al 2015 chun et al 2018 have also demonstrated the significant contribution of seawater to the rapid coastal aquifer salinity increase in our study high values of hydraulic conductivity of aquifer zone table 2 coupled with the low values of recharge rates table 2 could be the main factors that were allowed to facile intrusion of seawater within the aquifer colombani et al 2015 additionally as discussed in the above section section 3 1 the climate change which was occurred in gabes coast during the last years as a result of high greenhouse gases emission could be a contributor for this seawater intrusion colombani et al 2015 furthermore the simulated eciw from 2019 to 2050 fig 6 demonstrated that the aquifer salinity will continue to increase under the three climate scenarios rcp8 5 rcp6 0 and rcp4 5 selected for the future simulation for all these scenarios as shown in fig 6 eciw is expected to reach critical level about 5 3 ds m 1 by 2050 which allowed classifying the irrigation water as high saline water therefore greater attention to seawater intrusion phenomenon in the studied region is so urgent to assure sustainable use of quaternary aquifer the rcp8 5 rcp6 0 and rcp4 5 emissions are high compared to the actual greenhouse gases emissions in gabes region over 2008 2018 8479 kt co2 eq yr data from industrial chemical company tunisia this could explain the steep increase in eciw from 2019 to 2050 based on sutra model estimations it was revealed that the studied costal area gabes coast was affected from seawater intrusion the expected climate change from 2019 to 2050 would lead to additional intrusion of seawater toward the aquifer particularly during summer season when demand for coastal aquifer was at its maximum in this regard some management practices such as reduce water use and reduce pump depth need to be conducted to avoid or at least minimize the progressive increase in irrigation water salinity 3 3 irrigation water requirement under current and future climate conditions fig 8 showed changes in net irrigation water requirement nir crop evapotranspiration etc reference crop evapotranspiration et0 leaching requirement lr and effective rainfall er for both past 2008 2018 and future 2019 2050 periods as shown in fig 8 nir is expected to increase progressively from an average value of 1459 mm year 1 during 2008 2018 to 1473 1950 mm year 1 during 2019 2050 depending on climate change scenarios the highest increase trend in nir was observed for the highest greenhouse gas emissions scenario a2 scenario whereas the lowest increase trend was recorded for the lowest greenhouse gas emissions scenario b2 scenario similar variation with these two scenarios were also noted for etc and et0 etc and et0 depend in high part on temperature acharjee et al 2017 hence the future change in these three variables could be the consequences of the increasing trend in monthly temperatures from 2019 to 2050 table 3 decreasing trends of rainfall contribute to increase in nir the amount of effective rainfall is very small compared to the nir for date palm in the study region therefore the changes in annual effective rainfall would not much affect the nir however based on the positive values of mann kendall trends table 5 we can revealed that the increasing trends in irrigation water salinity from 2019 to 2050 fig 6 and in leaching requirement fig 8 were significantly contributed to increase the nir no significant impact of effective rainfall on the nir was detected table 5 on another hand there are significant differences in the nir change between the three climate scenarios table 5 this is because these three parameters i e nir etc and et0 depend in high part on climate variables acharjee et al 2017 that showed difference between the three climate scenarios fig 7 due to the minor change in rainfall with the three climate scenarios no significant difference in the er was detected this confirmed that increase in climatic water requirement and lr contributed to the large part of increase in nir table 6 under the rapid increase in nir due to climate change and because irrigation of date palms is mainly from non renewable aquifers zammouri et al 2007 an adequate adaptation measure that can minimize the greenhouse gases emission and efficient irrigation water management appear as two adaptation strategies of capital importance to sustain date palm s productivity in tunisia as both the climate variables and salinity of applied water are important for irrigation management a close monitoring of these factors can be helpful for better water management planning regular measurement of irrigation water salinity is so needed also set up good quality meteorological stations in the tunisian oases i e date palm fields for close monitoring and regular evaluation of changes in climatic parameters would be so useful to take anticipatory decision related to agricultural water management to cope with climate change acharjee et al 2017 4 conclusion this study quantified the effects of climate change on net irrigation water requirement of date palms under future salinity trend in costal aquifer in a tunisian oasis this quantification was performed following a methodological framework which was developed based on various tools sdsm sutra and cropwat the findings of this study revealed that expected climate change from 2019 to 2050 in the studied oasis would mainly decrease annual rainfall and increase monthly minimum and maximum temperatures furthermore during this future period the aquifer salinity is expected to vary from an average value of 4 2 ds m 1 in 2018 to about 5 3 ds m 1 in 2050 the seawater intrusion was identified as a main factor for this remarkable increase under these conditions the net irrigation water requirement of date palms which depends mainly on climate variables and water salinity is expected to increase from an average value of 1459 mm year 1 during 2008 2018 to 1473 1950 mm year 1 during 2019 2050 salinity trend in used aquifer was significantly contributed to this rapid increasing responding to this increased irrigation requirements improving resiliency and adaptive capacity and responding to increased water salinity due to seawater intrusion are some of the adaptation measures that can offsets the potential negative impacts of climate change in date palms production the potential developed adaption measures must be evaluated before recommending to

10784,based on sufficient pollutants in pretreated swine wastewater psw this study aimed to explore feasibility of growing water spinach ws in a hydroponic system using psw as a liquid fertilizers in a hydroponic system the tolerance values of ws to cu ⅱ zn ⅱ total phosphorus tp and ammonium n nh4 n in culture solution were found to be 0 5 2 0 150 and 300 mg l 1 respectively in the hydroponic

sw is one of the major environmental pollutants which can cause the serious environmental hazards such as depletion of dissolved oxygen toxicity to fish eutrophication diseases ethaemoglobinaemia hypertension and stomach cancer etc quan et al 2010 cao et al 2019b phosphorus another major pollutant in sw is an important non renewable resource that makes a major contribution to agricultural and industrial development previous references reported that the available and accessible reserves of clean phosphate rock will be depleted in the next 50 years unless effective measures are taken to manage this resource cao et al 2019a huang et al 2016 therefore in order to improve the sustainable development of phosphorus resource the recovery of phosphorus from wastewaters has been received great attention worldwide heavy metals hms such as cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ which are also environmental pollutants are commonly used as additives in animal feed to improve growth performance of livestock and satisfy mineral requirements however owing to low absorptive capacity by the animals a large amount of mineral additives in animal feeds are added to assure proper animal nutrition the most of the unutilized hms are excreted and accumulated in the livestock manure previous studies reported that the absorption rates of cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ were only 10 20 feng et al 2018 cao et al 2019c zhou et al 2018 the scientists and public worry about the potential risks of hms on soils food safety human health and living organisms if sw is directly applied to agricultural land due to its toxicity persistence carcinogenicity and mutagenicity li et al 2018 he et al 2018 therefore an environmentally friendly and cost effective technology for removal of pollutants from sw is urgently needed due to the limitations in available freshwater for irrigation interest in utilization of sw in agriculture has been increasing as it represents an alternative source of water and nutrients for plant crops carvalho et al 2018a hydroponics defined as the technique of plant cultivation without soil using only water and dissolved nutrients has the advantages of faster growth high productivity easy handling and greater efficiency of water use bito et al 2013 carvalho et al 2018b hydroponic cultivation with wastewater has been shown to absorb the pollutants in the wastewater through plant uptake and produce commercially valuable plants which reduce water usage and waste discharge amount to the environment wang et al 2017 hydroponic cultivation based on resource recovery is a desirable and ecological alternative that has the potential to achieve extraction of n and p from recoverable sources as well as to improve the economics of sw treatment leading to sustainable technologies various studies have demonstrated removal efficiencies ranging from 47 to 91 for pollutants nitrogen and phosphorus using hydroponics planted with different plant species haddad et al 2012 mant et al 2003 in addition to pollutant removal hydroponics can be used to grow biomass for value added materials or energy which also attracts interest in agro processing industries previous studies reported that several vegetables water spinach silverbeet tomato radish and lettuce had been commonly employed as targeted hydroponic plants to use n and p source from nutrient rich wastewater for their growth krishnasamy et al 2012 kumar et al 2016 chen et al 2016 water spinach ws is one of the most valuable green vegetables which offers diuretic calming coagulant demulcent laxative and other beneficial properties this leafy vegetable can be processed into a variety of products such as tinctures infusions or therapeutic spinach juice kumar et al 2016 while the hydroponic system with wastewater utilization has potential to offer a dual advantage of pollution reduction and crop production there is a lack of detailed scientific research data on the effectivenesss of swine wastewater as a liquid fertilizer for production of vegetables in hydroponic system including tolerance to pollutants growth rate yield toxicity of heavy metal and quality of vegetables hence the present study aims to evaluate the feasibility of simultaneous cultivation of ws and purification of psw in hydroponic system including 1 investigate the effects of nh4 n tp cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ on the growth and yield of ws in hydroponic systems 2 identify the tolerance of ws to nh4 n tp cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ 3 evaluate the quality of ws and pollutants removal from psw via hydroponic systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sw was obtained from a pig farm in fengcheng jiangxi province china and then stored at 4 c the experiment was conducted immediately after the sample was transported to the laboratory due to high

variance multiple comparison tests between were also performed with 95 confidence interval 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ on growth of ws the effects of cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ on growth of ws in hydroponic system are shown in fig 1 a d as seen in fig 1a the growth rate gradually decreased with increasing of cu ⅱ concentration after 20 d in the hydroponic system the growth rate of ws at the control 0 25 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 mg l 1 cu ⅱ concentration was 242 1 148 3 160 7 96 4 106 7 and 92 6 respectively based on initial height about 10 12 cm at transplanting the results showed that the cu ⅱ concentration over 0 25 mg l 1 had an inhibitory effect on the growth rate of ws in addition when the cu ⅱ concentration was over 0 5 mg l 1 there were some yellow leaves in ws worse yet the ws was close to death at 3 0 mg l 1 cu ⅱ concentration after 20 d of hydroponic culture the variation in the fresh weight of ws showed a parabolic trend with increased cu ⅱ concentration fig 1c the fresh weight of stem leaf and root showed significant differences between different cu ⅱ concentrations after 20 d hydroponic culture the fresh weight of stem leaf and root significantly increased to 10 67 and 8 76 g at 1 0 mg l 1 cu ⅱ which increased by 19 38 and 505 05 compared with the control group respectively the data showed that cu ⅱ below 1 0 mg l 1 could improve the growth of ws compared to the control but cu ⅱ above 1 0 mg l 1 at 2 0 and 3 0 mg l 1 drastically decreased the fresh weight indicating the cu ⅱ over 1 0 mg l 1 showed toxicity to ws after 20 d hydroponic culture the maximum fresh weight of stem leaf was 11 22 g which was an increase of 24 48 compared to the control group at 0 25 mg l 1 cu ⅱ the growth rate of ws at control 0 25 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 mg l 1 zn ⅱ concentration was 242 1 145 0 121 1 130 4 119 0 and 141 7 respectively based on initial height about 10 12 cm at transplanting fig 1b the more dead leaves and few leaves appeared in ws at 3 0 mg l 1 zn ⅱ concentration after 20 d of hydroponic culture indicating that there was toxicity to the ws when zn ⅱ concentration exceeded 3 mg l 1 in hydroponic system the fresh weight of stem leaf and root significantly increased from 8 97 g and 1 4 g to 11 52 g and 5 28 g respectively at 0 5 mg l 1 zn ⅱ after 20 d hydroponic culture which was an increase of 28 4 and 272 7 respectively compared to the control group fig 1d shows the maximum fresh weight of ws at 0 5 mg l 1 zn ⅱ concentration the root weight of ws had no significant difference for concentration from 0 25 to 2 0 mg l 1 zn ⅱ after 20 d hydroponic culture although there was a maximum growth rate for ws via control group the maximum fresh stem leaf weight was obtained at condition of 0 25 mg l 1 for cu ⅱ and 0 5 mg l 1 for zn ⅱ in the hydroponic system the growth rate of ws was calculated on the basis of height of main stem excluding the branches growth of ws and the fresh weight of ws included weight of all parts above the root as seen from the figure of ws in fig 1 the control group showed fewer branches and thin stem of ws while other group was more branches and crude stem therefore the higher growth rate and lower fresh weight of ws were showed in the control group the effect of zn ⅱ on the growth of ws was similar to cu ⅱ in the hydroponic the cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ increased the yield of ws within a limited concentration but the inhibitory effect of zn ⅱ on growth was less than that of cu ⅱ which showed that tolerance of ws to zn ⅱ was higher than to cu ⅱ basing on observations of the growth rate yield and color of ws the cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ concentrations should be below 1 0 mg l 1 and 2 0 mg l 1 respectively in a hydroponic system 3 2 cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ residue in ws although cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ are essential for a variety of biomolecules to maintain the normal structural function and proliferation of cells these metals also pose a considerable hazard to human health in excessive amounts pirsaheb et al 2016 the residue amount of cu u and zn ⅱ in ws is shown in fig 2 the residue amount of cu ⅱ and zn nd in ws significantly increased with the increase of heavy metal concentration in the hydroponic solution after 20 d hydroponic culture the zn ⅱ residue amount in ws was higher than cu ⅱ as seen in fig 2a and b the residue amount of cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ in the fresh stem leaf of ws showed no significant difference and remained at 1 51 and 3 31 mg kg 1 respectively when both cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ concentrations were below 0 5 mg l 1 in the hydroponic solution however the residue amount in stem leaf increased significantly as the cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ concentrations were increased in the hydroponic solution the residue amount of cu sed significin the wet stem leaf increased to 2 51 and 15 03 mg kg 1 respectively but remained lower than the safety standards for agricultural production in china cu ⅱ 10 zn ⅱ 20 gb 13106 1991 gb 15199 1994 in contrast the residue amount of cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ in the root of ws drastically increased as these metal concentrations were increased in the hydroponic solution and reached levels of up to 24 31 and 70 61 mg l 1 respectively 3 3 effect of total phosphate on growth of ws phosphorus is an essential macro nutrient for plants and exists as phosphate po4 3 p in organic and inorganic forms in wastewaters which can affect the uptake of other nutrition photosynthesis function and synthesis of carbohydrate neocleous and savvas 2019 phosphorus is taken up by plant roots as phosphate mainly in the predominant form of phosphate therefore biological recovery of phosphorus from wastewater can be achieved by the combination of plant cell uptake for growth both as macrophytes uptake as well as biofilm growth akratos and tsihrintzis 2007 the effect of phosphorus concentration po4 3 p on the growth of ws in a hydroponic solution is shown in fig 3 the results showed that the control group had the highest growth rate of ws increasing by 500 after a 20 d hydroponic culture the growth rate of ws was 244 4 212 5 195 2 and 241 5 at conditions of 50 100 150 and 200 mg l 1 phosphorus concentration respectively as seen from the picture of ws in fig 3 there were more branches and leaves to create high fresh weight compared with the control group on ws at high phosphorus concentrations the growth of ws should be comprehensively evaluated on the basis of the growth rate yield and morphology of ws in single 200 mg l 1 tp solution the ws showed higher growth rate of ws but not had higher yield and appeared yellow leaves and withered in later stage from the picture of ws in fig 3 therefore the single 200 mg l 1 tp solution was not really ideal concentration for growth of ws the ws appeared yellow leaves and withered when the phosphorus concentration was over 150 mg l 1 indicating that the phosphorus concentration in hydroponic solution had exceeded the toxicity tolerance of ws for phosphorus while the concentration of tp in culture solution was higher than the tolerance the ws can show faster growth rate as absorption of tp in short time and then wither previous references reported the tp concentration and availability in vegetables increase first and then decrease when vegetables are cultured in high tp concentration solution in addition higher tp concentration in solution also inhibits the absorption of macro elements n k ca metal etc photosynthesis and synthesis of carbohydrates yao et al 2010 doaglas et al 1983 as shown in fig 3b the fresh weight of ws significantly increased to 30 94 g per plant 19 97 g fresh stem leaf 10 82 g fresh root weight as phosphorus concentrations increased to 150 mg l 1 increase of 195 82 compared to the control group 25 mg l 1 phosphorus but when the tp concentration reached 200 mg l 1 in hydroponic solution the fresh weight of ws drastically decreased to 20 49 g per plant overall this result shows that increasing the phosphorus concentration significantly improved the growth of ws as long as the tp remained below 150 mg l 1 in the hydroponic solution however the growth of ws was inhibited with tp above 150 mg l 1 due to toxicity of the high po4 3 concentration and inhibition of vegetables metabolitsm therefore the tolerance of ws to phosphorus was 150 mg l 1 in hydroponic solution 3 4 effect of nh4 n on growth of ws nitrogen is a vital element for all living organisms because it is the component of deoxyribonucleic acid dna ribonucleic acid rna amino acids proteins and other cell components wong et al 2017 ammonia nitrogen nh4 n a pollutant in the wastewater can be utilized directly by plants in the hydroponic systems as a nutrient and mainly stored as the form of organic nitrogen in plants however high nh4 n concentrations in sw has toxicity to the growth of plants krishnasmy et al 2012 the effect of nh4 n on ws is presented in fig 4 fig 4a showed that there was a maximum growth rate of ws 500 in the control group 50 mg l 1 nh4 n after 20 d in hydroponic culture the growth rate of ws was 200 200 271 4 165 2 132 and 145 8 with 100 200 300 400 500 and 600 mg l 1 nh4 n concentration respectively increasing nh4 n concentrations in the hydroponic solution increased the leaves and branches of ws which caused a high fresh weight of ws compared with the control group however there were yellow leaves on the ws after 20 d of hydroponic culture when the nh4 n concentration was over 500 mg l 1 due to the toxicity of high nh4 n the addition of nh4 n significantly increased the fresh weight of ws the fresh stem leaf weights of ws were 21 69 19 88 19 39 13 20 12 53 and 13 27 g per plant at the condition of 100 200 300 400 500 and 600 mg l 1 nh4 n respectively the fresh weight of ws increased by 146 26 125 65 120 10 49 86 42 25 and 50 56 respectively compared to the control group 8 81 g per plant respectively however the weight of ws began to decrease dramatically when the nh4 n concentration was over 300 mg l 1 viewing from the growth rate yield and color of ws the nh4 n concentration in the hydroponic solution should be no more than 300 mg l 1 nh4 n is mainly absorbed directly by ws in hydroponics as a nutrient and stored as organic nitrogen which reduces its concentration in the wastewater further reduction of nitrogen content from the wastewater takes place by biomass assimilation in the microbiological processes which adsorbs nh4 n gebeyehu et al 2018 3 5 effect of diluted pretreated swine wastewater psw the undiluted psw contained higher pollutants which could inhibit the growth of ws in order to explore optimal conditions for psw to support the growth of ws a range of dilution levels of psw were investigated the effect of dilution of psw on growth of ws is shown in fig 5 fig 5a showed that there was no significant difference between undiluted psw and the control p 0 05 the cumulative growth of ws increased by 781 6 375 9 267 6 235 7 314 2 and 167 7 after 30 d hydroponic cultivation at 0 2 4 6 8 and 10 times diluted psw respectively however ws appeared to develop yellow leaves when the dilution of psw was above 2 times apparently due to a deficiency of nutrients fig 5b showed that the fresh weight of ws significantly decreased with increasing of dilution the psw the maximum fresh weight of ws was obtained with undiluted psw which was 29 94 g per plant increasing by 38 9 compared to the control group 21 55 g per plant the fresh stem leaf weight was 24 14 g per plant at undiluted psw which was 1 32 times that of the control group as shown earlier in table 1 the nh4 n and tp concentrations in psw were 170 4 and 43 68 mg l 1 respectively which were higher than the control group but still below the tolerances of ws therefore the psw was able to improve the growth of ws however when the psw was diluted 2 to 1 the nh4 n and tp concentration in the hydroponic solution dropped below the control solution therefore the yield and quality of ws significantly decreased as the psw continued to be further diluted 3 6 nutrients content and safety of ws the characteristics of ws cultured in undiluted psw in a hydroponic system are shown in table 2 the results showed that ws with high nutrients and yield could be obtained in a hydroponic system with undiluted psw the cumulative growth and fresh stem leaf weights of the ws were 275 68 and 8 13 g per plant respectively after 20 d hydroponic culture in undiluted psw although the cumulative growth of ws was lower than the control group 326 67 the fresh stem leaf weight of ws cultured in undiluted psw was higher than the control group 5 93 g per plant increasing by 37 10 the chlorophyll a chlorophyll b β carotene and sugar of ws cultured in undiluted psw were 1 41 0 51 0 32 and 48 74 mg g 1 fresh weight respectively which increased by 51 61 37 84 39 13 and 89 87 compared to control group ashraf et al 2019 reported that the chorophyll content is correlated with the nitrogen which is more when the amount of nitrogen is more in addition the pb ⅱ hg ⅱ as ⅴ and cd ⅱ content in ws met the safety standard of agriculture product in china gb 18406 1 2001gb 6 1 2001gb 18406 1 2001 these results showed the feasibility of hydroponic production of ws in psw 3 7 pollutants removal from psw the variations of nh4 n cod and tp concentrations in psw during the study period are presented in table 3 the results showed that nh4 n cod and tp concentrations of psw significantly decreased from 170 4 152 5 and 43 68 mg l 1 to 19 77 108 75 and 3 32 mg l 1 respectively after 20 d hydroponic culture in undiluted psw corresponding to removal rates of 87 91 29 54 and 92 38 respectively these reduced levels met the national discharge standard of livestock wastewater gb 18596 2002gb 6 2001gb 18596 2002 nh4 n 80 mg l 1 cod 400 mg l 1 and tp 8 mg l 1 removal of these nutrients could be attributed to plant and microbial uptake and retention adsorption onto root media the plants is direct removal of nutrients through both direct uptake and creation of conducive environment for microorganisms that use nitrogen and phosphorous as nutrients gebeyehu et al 2018 in addition the removal rates of cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ were 64 29 and 49 53 respectively the removal of pollutants from psw was mainly due to the interactions of various species of bacteria plant roots gravel sun and water they all contributed both directly and indirectly in the removal of pollutants from the wastewater 4 conclusion this study results showed that hydroponic technology using wastewater as a liquid fertilizer was a promising eco friendly option for simultaneous vegetable production and pollutants removal from swine wastewater the tolerances of ws to cu ⅱ zn ⅱ phosphorus and nh4 n were obtained to be 0 5 2 0 150 and 300 mg l 1 in this hydroponic system the production and nutrients content of ws chlorophyll a chlorophyll b β carotene and sugar were also higher than control group the hms content of ws met the safety standard for agricultural production in china after the 20 d hydroponic culture the removal rate of nh4 n tp cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ concentration in psw was up to 87 91 92 38 64 29 and 49 53 respectively in the future the vital role played by microorganisms will need to be further explored in applications of hydroponic systems for vegetable production and wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no

10784,based on sufficient pollutants in pretreated swine wastewater psw this study aimed to explore feasibility of growing water spinach ws in a hydroponic system using psw as a liquid fertilizers in a hydroponic system the tolerance values of ws to cu ⅱ zn ⅱ total phosphorus tp and ammonium n nh4 n in culture solution were found to be 0 5 2 0 150 and 300 mg l 1 respectively in the hydroponic systems the fresh stem leaf production of ws in undiluted psw increased by 38 9 compared to the control group formula b of leafy vegetable solution culture in south china agricultural university and the concentration of nutrients chlorophyll a chlorophyll b β carotene and sugar of ws was also higher than the control group the concentration of pb ⅱ hg ⅱ as ⅴ and cr ⅱ in ws was all below the safety standard content for agriculture production in china after 20 d hydroponic culture the nh4 n tp cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ concentration in psw significantly decreased to 19 77 80 3 32 8 0 0 15 2 0 and 0 54 5 0 mg l 1 corresponding to removal rate of 87 91 92 38 64 29 and 49 53 respectively which met the national discharge standard of livestock wastewater in china keywords swine wastewater hydroponic system water spinach heavy metal nh4 n 1 introduction in recent years the rapid growth of intensive pig farming in china has led to produce an enormous amount of swine wastewater sw cao et al 2019a huang et al 2019 the concentration of pollutants in sw far exceeds the national discharge standard of these pollutants for livestock wastewater gb 18596 2001gb 6 2001gb 18596 2001 nh4 n 80 mg l 1 cod 400 mg l 1 and tp 8 mg l 1 thus the direct discharge of sw without adequate treatment has caused anegative effect on the ecological environment and human health gebeyehu et al 2018 quan et al 2010 the nh4 n in sw is one of the major environmental pollutants which can cause the serious environmental hazards such as depletion of dissolved oxygen toxicity to fish eutrophication diseases ethaemoglobinaemia hypertension and stomach cancer etc quan et al 2010 cao et al 2019b phosphorus another major pollutant in sw is an important non renewable resource that makes a major contribution to agricultural and industrial development previous references reported that the available and accessible reserves of clean phosphate rock will be depleted in the next 50 years unless effective measures are taken to manage this resource cao et al 2019a huang et al 2016 therefore in order to improve the sustainable development of phosphorus resource the recovery of phosphorus from wastewaters has been received great attention worldwide heavy metals hms such as cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ which are also environmental pollutants are commonly used as additives in animal feed to improve growth performance of livestock and satisfy mineral requirements however owing to low absorptive capacity by the animals a large amount of mineral additives in animal feeds are added to assure proper animal nutrition the most of the unutilized hms are excreted and accumulated in the livestock manure previous studies reported that the absorption rates of cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ were only 10 20 feng et al 2018 cao et al 2019c zhou et al 2018 the scientists and public worry about the potential risks of hms on soils food safety human health and living organisms if sw is directly applied to agricultural land due to its toxicity persistence carcinogenicity and mutagenicity li et al 2018 he et al 2018 therefore an environmentally friendly and cost effective technology for removal of pollutants from sw is urgently needed due to the limitations in available freshwater for irrigation interest in utilization of sw in agriculture has been increasing as it represents an alternative source of water and nutrients for plant crops carvalho et al 2018a hydroponics defined as the technique of plant cultivation without soil using only water and dissolved nutrients has the advantages of faster growth high productivity easy handling and greater efficiency of water use bito et al 2013 carvalho et al 2018b hydroponic cultivation with wastewater has been shown to absorb the pollutants in the wastewater through plant uptake and

ecological alternative that has the potential to achieve extraction of n and p from recoverable sources as well as to improve the economics of sw treatment leading to sustainable technologies various studies have demonstrated removal efficiencies ranging from 47 to 91 for pollutants nitrogen and phosphorus using hydroponics planted with different plant species haddad et al 2012 mant et al 2003 in addition to pollutant removal hydroponics can be used to grow biomass for value added materials or energy which also attracts interest in agro processing industries previous studies reported that

variance multiple comparison tests between were also performed with 95 confidence interval 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ on growth of ws the effects of cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ on growth of ws in hydroponic system are shown in fig 1 a d as seen in fig 1a the growth rate gradually decreased with increasing of cu ⅱ concentration after 20 d in the hydroponic system the growth rate of ws at the control 0 25 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 mg l 1 cu ⅱ concentration was 242 1 148 3 160 7 96 4 106 7 and 92 6 respectively based on initial height about 10 12 cm at transplanting the results showed that the cu ⅱ concentration over 0 25 mg l 1 had an inhibitory effect on the growth rate of ws in addition when the cu ⅱ concentration was over 0 5 mg l 1 there were some yellow leaves in ws worse yet the ws was close to death at 3 0 mg l 1 cu ⅱ concentration after 20 d of hydroponic culture the variation in the fresh weight of ws showed a parabolic trend with increased cu ⅱ concentration fig 1c the fresh weight of stem leaf and root showed significant differences between different cu ⅱ concentrations after 20 d hydroponic culture the fresh weight of stem leaf and root significantly increased to 10 67 and 8 76 g at 1 0 mg l 1 cu ⅱ which increased by 19 38 and 505 05 compared with the control group respectively the data showed that cu ⅱ below 1 0 mg l 1 could improve the growth of ws compared to the control but cu ⅱ above 1 0 mg l 1 at 2 0 and 3 0 mg l 1 drastically decreased the fresh weight indicating the cu ⅱ over 1 0 mg l 1 showed toxicity to ws after 20 d hydroponic culture the maximum fresh weight of stem leaf was 11 22 g which was an increase of 24 48 compared to the control group at 0 25 mg l 1 cu ⅱ the growth rate of ws at control 0 25 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 mg l 1 zn ⅱ concentration was 242 1 145 0 121 1 130 4 119 0 and 141 7 respectively based on initial height about 10 12 cm at transplanting fig 1b the more dead leaves and few leaves appeared in ws at 3 0 mg l 1 zn ⅱ concentration after 20 d of hydroponic culture indicating that there was toxicity to the ws when zn ⅱ concentration exceeded 3 mg l 1 in hydroponic system the fresh weight of stem leaf and root significantly increased from 8 97 g and 1 4 g to 11 52 g and 5 28 g respectively at 0 5 mg l 1 zn ⅱ after 20 d hydroponic culture which was an increase of 28 4 and 272 7 respectively compared to the control group fig 1d shows the maximum fresh weight of ws at 0 5 mg l 1 zn ⅱ concentration the root weight of ws had no significant difference for concentration from 0 25 to 2 0 mg l 1 zn ⅱ after 20 d hydroponic culture although there was a maximum growth rate for ws via control group the maximum fresh stem leaf weight was obtained at condition of 0 25 mg l 1 for cu ⅱ and 0 5 mg l 1 for zn ⅱ in the hydroponic system the growth rate of ws was calculated on the basis of height of main stem excluding the branches growth of ws and the fresh weight of ws included weight of all parts above the root as seen from the figure of ws in fig 1 the control group showed fewer branches and thin stem of ws while other group was more branches and crude stem therefore the higher growth rate and lower fresh weight of ws were showed in the control group the effect of zn ⅱ on the growth of ws was similar to cu ⅱ in the hydroponic the cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ increased the yield of ws within a limited concentration but the inhibitory effect of zn ⅱ on growth was less than that of cu ⅱ which showed that tolerance of ws to zn ⅱ was higher than to cu ⅱ basing on observations of the growth rate yield and color of ws the cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ concentrations should be below 1 0 mg l 1 and 2 0 mg l 1 respectively in a hydroponic system 3 2 cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ residue in ws although cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ are essential for a variety of biomolecules to maintain the normal structural function and proliferation of cells these metals also pose a considerable hazard to human health in excessive amounts pirsaheb et al 2016 the residue amount of cu u and zn ⅱ in ws is shown in fig 2 the residue amount of cu ⅱ and zn nd in ws significantly increased with the increase of heavy metal concentration in the hydroponic solution after 20 d hydroponic culture the zn ⅱ residue amount in ws was higher than cu ⅱ as seen in fig 2a and b the residue amount of cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ in the fresh stem leaf of ws showed no significant difference and remained at 1 51 and 3 31 mg kg 1 respectively when both cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ concentrations were below 0 5 mg l 1 in the hydroponic solution however the residue amount in stem leaf increased significantly as the cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ concentrations were increased in the hydroponic solution the residue amount of cu sed significin the wet stem leaf increased to 2 51 and 15 03 mg kg 1 respectively but remained lower than the safety standards for agricultural production in china cu ⅱ 10 zn ⅱ 20 gb 13106 1991 gb 15199 1994 in contrast the residue amount of cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ in the root of ws drastically increased as these metal concentrations were increased in the hydroponic solution and reached levels of up to 24 31 and 70 61 mg l 1 respectively 3 3 effect of total phosphate on growth of ws phosphorus is an essential macro nutrient for plants and exists as phosphate po4 3 p in organic and inorganic forms in wastewaters which can affect the uptake of other nutrition photosynthesis function and synthesis of carbohydrate neocleous and savvas 2019 phosphorus is taken up by plant roots as phosphate mainly in the predominant form of phosphate therefore biological recovery of phosphorus from wastewater can be achieved by the combination of plant cell uptake for growth both as macrophytes uptake as well as biofilm growth akratos and tsihrintzis 2007 the effect of phosphorus concentration po4 3 p on the growth of ws in a hydroponic solution is shown in fig 3 the results showed that the control group had the highest growth rate of ws increasing by 500 after a 20 d hydroponic culture the growth rate of ws was 244 4 212 5 195 2 and 241 5 at conditions of 50 100 150 and 200 mg l 1 phosphorus concentration respectively as seen from the picture of ws in fig 3 there were more branches and leaves to create high fresh weight compared with the control group on ws at high phosphorus concentrations the growth of ws should be comprehensively evaluated on the basis of the growth rate yield and morphology of ws in single 200 mg l 1 tp solution the ws showed higher growth rate of ws but not had higher yield and appeared yellow leaves and withered in later stage from the picture of ws in fig 3 therefore the single 200 mg l 1 tp solution was not really ideal concentration for growth of ws the ws appeared yellow leaves and withered when the phosphorus concentration was over 150 mg l 1 indicating that the phosphorus concentration in hydroponic solution had exceeded the toxicity tolerance of ws for phosphorus while the concentration of tp in culture solution was higher than the tolerance the ws can show faster growth rate as absorption of tp in short time and then wither previous references reported the tp concentration and availability in vegetables increase first and then decrease when vegetables are cultured in high tp concentration solution in addition higher tp concentration in solution also inhibits the absorption of macro elements n k ca metal etc photosynthesis and synthesis of carbohydrates yao et al 2010 doaglas et al 1983 as shown in fig 3b the fresh weight of ws significantly increased to 30 94 g per plant 19 97 g fresh stem leaf 10 82 g fresh root weight as phosphorus concentrations increased to 150 mg l 1 increase of 195 82 compared to the control group 25 mg l 1 phosphorus but when the tp concentration reached 200 mg l 1 in hydroponic solution the fresh weight of ws drastically decreased to 20 49 g per plant overall this result shows that increasing the phosphorus concentration significantly improved the growth of ws as long as the tp remained below 150 mg l 1 in the hydroponic solution however the growth of ws was inhibited with tp above 150 mg l 1 due to toxicity of the high po4 3 concentration and inhibition of vegetables metabolitsm therefore the tolerance of ws to phosphorus was 150 mg l 1 in hydroponic solution 3 4 effect of nh4 n on growth of ws nitrogen is a vital element for all living organisms because it is the component of deoxyribonucleic acid dna ribonucleic acid rna amino acids proteins and other cell components wong et al 2017 ammonia nitrogen nh4 n a pollutant in the wastewater can be utilized directly by plants in the hydroponic systems as a nutrient and mainly stored as the form of organic nitrogen in plants however high nh4 n concentrations in sw has toxicity to the growth of plants krishnasmy et al 2012 the effect of nh4 n on ws is presented in fig 4 fig 4a showed that there was a maximum growth rate of ws 500 in the control group 50 mg l 1 nh4 n after 20 d in hydroponic culture the growth rate of ws was 200 200 271 4 165 2 132 and 145 8 with 100 200 300 400 500 and 600 mg l 1 nh4 n concentration respectively increasing nh4 n concentrations in the hydroponic solution increased the leaves and branches of ws which caused a high fresh weight of ws compared with the control group however there were yellow leaves on the ws after 20 d of hydroponic culture when the nh4 n concentration was over 500 mg l 1 due to the toxicity of high nh4 n the addition of nh4 n significantly increased the fresh weight of ws the fresh stem leaf weights of ws were 21 69 19 88 19 39 13 20 12 53 and 13 27 g per plant at the condition of 100 200 300 400 500 and 600 mg l 1 nh4 n respectively the fresh weight of ws increased by 146 26 125 65 120 10 49 86 42 25 and 50 56 respectively compared to the control group 8 81 g per plant respectively however the weight of ws began to decrease dramatically when the nh4 n concentration was over 300 mg l 1 viewing from the growth rate yield and color of ws the nh4 n concentration in the hydroponic solution should be no more than 300 mg l 1 nh4 n is mainly absorbed directly by ws in hydroponics as a nutrient and stored as organic nitrogen which reduces its concentration in the wastewater further reduction of nitrogen content from the wastewater takes place by biomass assimilation in the microbiological processes which adsorbs nh4 n gebeyehu et al 2018 3 5 effect of diluted pretreated swine wastewater psw the undiluted psw contained higher pollutants which could inhibit the growth of ws in order to explore optimal conditions for psw to support the growth of ws a range of dilution levels of psw were investigated the effect of dilution of psw on growth of ws is shown in fig 5 fig 5a showed that there was no significant difference between undiluted psw and the control p 0 05 the cumulative growth of ws increased by 781 6 375 9 267 6 235 7 314 2 and 167 7 after 30 d hydroponic cultivation at 0 2 4 6 8 and 10 times diluted psw respectively however ws appeared to develop yellow leaves when the dilution of psw was above 2 times apparently due to a deficiency of nutrients fig 5b showed that the fresh weight of ws significantly decreased with increasing of dilution the psw the maximum fresh weight of ws was obtained with undiluted psw which was 29 94 g per plant increasing by 38 9 compared to the control group 21 55 g per plant the fresh stem leaf weight was 24 14 g per plant at undiluted psw which was 1 32 times that of the control group as shown earlier in table 1 the nh4 n and tp concentrations in psw were 170 4 and 43 68 mg l 1 respectively which were higher than the control group but still below the tolerances of ws therefore the psw was able to improve the growth of ws however when the psw was diluted 2 to 1 the nh4 n and tp concentration in the hydroponic solution dropped below the control solution therefore the yield and quality of ws significantly decreased as the psw continued to be further diluted 3 6 nutrients content and safety of ws the characteristics of ws cultured in undiluted psw in a hydroponic system are shown in table 2 the results showed that ws with high nutrients and yield could be obtained in a hydroponic system with undiluted psw the cumulative growth and fresh stem leaf weights of the ws were 275 68 and 8 13 g per plant respectively after 20 d hydroponic culture in undiluted psw although the cumulative growth of ws was lower than the control group 326 67 the fresh stem leaf weight of ws cultured in undiluted psw was higher than the control group 5 93 g per plant increasing by 37 10 the chlorophyll a chlorophyll b β carotene and sugar of ws cultured in undiluted psw were 1 41 0 51 0 32 and 48 74 mg g 1 fresh weight respectively which increased by 51 61 37 84 39 13 and 89 87 compared to control group ashraf et al 2019 reported that the chorophyll content is correlated with the nitrogen which is more when the amount of nitrogen is more in addition the pb ⅱ hg ⅱ as ⅴ and cd ⅱ content in ws met the safety standard of agriculture product in china gb 18406 1 2001gb 6 1 2001gb 18406 1 2001 these results showed the feasibility of hydroponic production of ws in psw 3 7 pollutants removal from psw the variations of nh4 n cod and tp concentrations in psw during the study period are presented in table 3 the results showed that nh4 n cod and tp concentrations of psw significantly decreased from 170 4 152 5 and 43 68 mg l 1 to 19 77 108 75 and 3 32 mg l 1 respectively after 20 d hydroponic culture in undiluted psw corresponding to removal rates of 87 91 29 54 and 92 38 respectively these reduced levels met the national discharge standard of livestock wastewater gb 18596 2002gb 6 2001gb 18596 2002 nh4 n 80 mg l 1 cod 400 mg l 1 and tp 8 mg l 1 removal of these nutrients could be attributed to plant and microbial uptake and retention adsorption onto root media the plants is direct removal of nutrients through both direct uptake and creation of conducive environment for microorganisms that use nitrogen and phosphorous as nutrients gebeyehu et al 2018 in addition the removal rates of cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ were 64 29 and 49 53 respectively the removal of pollutants from psw was mainly due to the interactions of various species of bacteria plant roots gravel sun and water they all contributed both directly and indirectly in the removal of pollutants from the wastewater 4 conclusion this study results showed that hydroponic technology using wastewater as a liquid fertilizer was a promising eco friendly option for simultaneous vegetable production and pollutants removal from swine wastewater the tolerances of ws to cu ⅱ zn ⅱ phosphorus and nh4 n were obtained to be 0 5 2 0 150 and 300 mg l 1 in this hydroponic system the production and nutrients content of ws chlorophyll a chlorophyll b β carotene and sugar were also higher than control group the hms content of ws met the safety standard for agricultural production in china after the 20 d hydroponic culture the removal rate of nh4 n tp cu ⅱ and zn ⅱ concentration in psw was up to 87 91 92 38 64 29 and 49 53 respectively in the future the vital role played by microorganisms will need to be further explored in applications of hydroponic systems for vegetable production and wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no
