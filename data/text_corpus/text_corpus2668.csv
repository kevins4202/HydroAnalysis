13340,cooling water circuits represent a high water saving potential that has not been fully exploited yet due to the risk of legionella outbreaks according to legislation cooling circuits are subjected to specific biocide treatments which must be considered when water reuse is planned biocide effectiveness mainly depends on the type of installation its operating regime and the interactions with other chemicals therefore water reuse is critical because its physical chemical and microbiological characteristics beside deposit and corrosion problems may reduce the biocidal power and produce a health risk however there is a lack of knowledge on the compatibility of reclaimed water with biocides and on long term maintenance problems this paper validates the long term performance of an industrial cooling tower using reclaimed water obtained after the treatment of bottle washing water the compatibility study of the reused water with three non oxidant commercial products from the tp11 group quaternary ammonium tetrakis hydroxymethyl phosphonium sulphate and isothiazolone shows a reduction lower than 20 of the biocide efficiency between periodic additions isothiazolone based biocide was tested with reclaimed water during 1 year at industrial scale without detecting any problem results show that water quality was always within the values allowed by legislation and slightly better when using reclaimed water lower ecotoxicity of the purge and higher biocidal residual concentration with the reuse strategy water savings of 3750 m3 y were obtained furthermore to minimize the legionella and corrosion risks an optimal control of the cooling tower has been developed based on correlations graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cooling towers tp11 legionella biocides

wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction the increasing water concern is promoting the implementation of strategies to reclaim and reuse water in industrial processes besides environmental and corporative image advantages industries must also benefit from improved process efficiency and cost reductions to facilitate the implementation of water reuse concepts the reuse of industrial reclaimed water is limited by its quality and by the quality requirements of the different uses cooling circuits are high water intensive and present a high potential for water savings however the used of reclaimed water is limited due to the risk of the proliferation of legionella bacteria 1 in spain legislation regulates both the use of reclaimed water royal decree 1620 2007 2 and legionella prevention in cooling systems royal decree 865 2003 3 which is based on biocide treatments in general biocides need to be effective accomplish ecotoxicity limits and be compatible with the water quality and with the presence of other biocides 4 therefore for water reuse in cooling towers it is important to assess the compatibility and effectiveness of the used biocide with the reclaimed water biocides are classified into 22 types by the european chemical agency echa 5 tp11 type biocides are liquid preservatives used in refrigeration systems and industrial processes included in the main group 2 which refers to preservatives 6 7 the use of tp11 biocides with reclaimed water implies the compliance with european legislation for both biocide regulation eu no 528 2012 8 and water reuse regulation eu 2020 741 9 quaternary ammonium derivatives are tp11 biocides and include benzalkonium chloride benzethonium chloride methylbenzethonium chloride cetalconium chloride cetylpyridinium chloride cetrimonium cetrimide tetraethylammonium bromide didecyldimethylammonium chloride and domiphenium bromide 10 the preparation of quaternary ammonium halides is based on the exhaustive alkylation of the amines 11 in general they are effective as algaecides and bactericides at neutral or slightly alkaline ph however their effectiveness against fungi is very low 12 furthermore its effectiveness is reduced by the presence of organic matter surfactants and detergents and at high water hardness 13 tetrakis hydroxymethyl phosphoric sulphate thps is also a widely used active ingredient in biocides due to the presence of disulfide bridges 14 although it is expensive it is water soluble and provides very good bactericidal properties among its main advantages are the low toxicity of the decomposition products and the possibility of operating at a wide ph range however the use of thps can lead to biofilm formation depending on the water quality 15 16 more recent is the use of isothiazolones which are characterized by their high reactivity and biocidal potential due to the presence of 5 chloro 3 isothiazolone whose preferential decomposition is towards thioacillus chloride 17 18 its bactericidal power allows to work in a wide ph range 19 biocide are widely used in most industrial sectors and there are many studies assessing their performance however most studies do not provide an overall assessment for their performance when water circuits are closed the effluent is reused or reclaimed water from other sources is used 20 21 atei et al have reported the successful performance of 2 2 dibromo 3 nitrilopropionamide at a constant concentration with reclaimed water from the petrochemical industry after a membrane treatment 22 in the case of cooling towers table 1 summarizes the studies related to the use of biocides with different water qualities the studies cover a wide conductivity range 7 76 to 2200 μs cm being the lower values for fresh water or highly treated water a few cases consider pilot studies of 1 2 months 17 18 22 however longer times covering all seasons are necessary to assure the correct functionality of the tower operation under different conditions most studies are focused on the use of highly oxidizing substances mainly chlorine derivatives 17 18 22 however they require the use of anticorrosive and antifouling chemical products 17 18 27 which on the other hand should be minimized to reduce the toxicity of the cooling tower purge and to reduce the cost in the case of non oxidizing biocides isothiazolones were used in combination with an oxidizing biocide 27 these chemicals act slowly and they are usually added in large weekly doses in this case their compatibility with the water is critical since the effectiveness must be maintained between dosages from the safety point of view special attention must be given to the legionella control which can be transmitted by aerosols as a consequence of the tower operation itself this parameter can be used as an indicator to determine the compatibility of the reclaimed water with the used biocide unfortunately only two studies 18 19 table 1 evaluate this parameter which should be analyzed at long term with controls every 3 months to obtain more conclusive results according to the state of the art the critical consequences of a poor compatibility between biocides and reclaimed water from different sources have not been fully studied yet non oxidizing active substances should be further studied since they produce a lower degradation of the installation furthermore it is necessary to extend the research considering industrial plants and long term studies to assess the evolution of the residual biocide concentration as a function of water quality variations the microbiological quality of the cooling process the demand of scale and corrosion inhibitors and to identify deposits and corrosion problems on the other hand potential cost savings in cooling towers must be further highlighted as a driver for water saving and for the implementation of circular economy concepts 27 based on the identified research gaps this paper studies the compatibility of reclaimed water from bottle disinfection in a food factory with three types active substances of non oxidizing biocides thps isothiazolone and quaternary ammonium derivatives reclaimed water was obtained by treating the effluent from the industrial washing and disinfection of juice bottles 1 additionally the long term reuse of the reclaimed water as make up water of a cooling tower using isothiazolone biocide was assessed and compared with a similar tower using drinking water finally to facilitate the control of cooling towers and minimize the risks of legionella and corrosion correlations between different parameters water quality parameters and the performance of the tower have been studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and analytical methods the reclaimed water used in this study comes from a process of washing and disinfection of polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles in a spanish juice plant the bottles disinfection is carried out with osmotic water with peracetic acid as biocide after disinfection residual hydrogen peroxide was removed by a catalytic decomposition process with activated carbon to minimize the oxidation of the cooling circuit 1 the reclaimed water has the adequate physical chemical properties table 2 to comply with current legislation for water reuse in cooling systems biocides were supplied by fupinax spain and uses as received without dilution table 3 the concentration of biocides was determined by titration using the specific commercial kit for each of them supplied by the manufacturers the basis of the titration reaction is not provided since it belongs to the know how of the suppliers the ph the electrical conductivity and temperature were measured using a hanna hi98130 device spain precision 0 01 and 0 01 ms cm respectively turbidity was measured with a hanna hi93703c turbidimeter spain precision 5 following iso 7027 hydrogen peroxide was measured by a titration method with a hanna hi3844 equipment spain precision 0 25 mg l free chlorine was measured using the adaptation of epa s dpd 330 5 method with hanna hi83399 02 photometer spain precision 0 03 mg l and total iron ion content was measured using an adaptation of the epa 315b phenanthroline method with a checker hanna hi721 device spain precision 0 04 mg l ecotoxicity using luminescent microorganisms vibrio fischeri was evaluated this parameter has been used to assess the effect of pollutants such as triclosan 21 pesticides and herbicides 24 and biocides such as malathion and diazion 25 in wastewater and antifoulants in marine environments 28 the ecotoxicity was analyzed following the une en iso 11348 2 2009 standard determination of the inhibitory effect of water samples on the luminescence of vibrio fischeri luminescent bacteria test 2 2 experimental procedure the efficiency of the three biocides was assessed using the reclaimed water that was going to be reused as make up water in one of the cooling towers of the juice factory this recovered water coming from the washing and disinfection of pet bottles was treated with activated carbon to remove the residual hydrogen peroxide to avoid any damage in the cooling towers installations due to oxidation 1 although the characteristics of the regenerated water accomplish with the spanish legislation the performance of already used biocides with this reclaimed water must be evaluated fig 1 shows the procedure to test the biocides performance the different phases of the research are laboratory industrial implementation and industrial validation of the research the biocides were initially dosed at the concentration recommended by the manufacturers table 3 500 mg l for isothiazolone 50 mg l for thps and 100 mg l for quaternary ammonium salts the experiments were performed with 1 l of water split up into three aliquots one for each biocide the water was mixed with the biocide using a slow magnetic agitation 100 rpm along the experiment at 30 minute intervals the residual biocidal product was quantified to determine its persistence and compatibility with the treated effluent the experiments were performed during 5 h considering that if the residual concentration was kept at the recommended dose after 5 h the compatibility of the biocide with the effluent can be assured subsequently the effectiveness of the selected biocide was evaluated during 1 year in an industrial cooling tower through the determination of ph turbidity electrical conductivity and concentrations of hydrogen peroxide free chlorine iron ion concentration and residual biocide in this industrial phase the synergy between the selected biocide and the sodium hypochlorite was studied because both active substances are usually combined if the chemical analyses of the facility or the microbiological analyses failed finally samples were taken from the cooling tower purge while using the reclaimed water to measure the ecotoxicity the performance of the cooling tower using reclaimed water was compared with a similar one using drinking water with an average conductivity of 800 μs cm all experiments were replicated three times in the laboratory phase during the industrial phase official measurements were carried out in the cooling towers according to the legislation 3 daily measurement one replicate were taken 5 days per week always at the same time 14 00 h for 10 weeks the wide range of data was used to feed the corresponding regression models 2 3 experimental design correlations between the parameters were studied by performing the analysis of the multivariate correlation as well as the analysis of variance anova using the multiple correlation package excel microsoft the parameters considered to find the correlations were the residual concentration of biocide the iron ion concentration the residual concentration of free chlorine ph and electrical conductivity in the industrial phase the dosing pumps operated under a set point that provided a fixed initial concentration of free chlorine and isothiazolones of 2 20 mg l and 500 mg l respectively from the dosed time these concentrations started to decrease as a function of water chemistry operation regime of the cooling tower purging etc the residual concentrations of biocide and free chlorine were considered as the main parameters for the correlations the residual concentration of biocide provides critical information about the performance of the biocide in the cooling tower on the other hand the iron ion concentration is an indicative of the possible corrosion and depreciation phenomena in the installations first degree empirical polynomial equation eq 1 where y is the dependent variable xi represents the independent variables and b0 and bi are the corresponding regression coefficients were selected for the correlation because it provided the best fit after trying multiple adjustments to different functions 1 y b 0 σb i x i the correlations studied were effect of both ph 7 0 8 6 and electrical conductivity 1500 3000 μs cm on the residual biocide concentration as dependent variable effect of both ph 7 0 and 8 6 and residual free chlorine concentration 0 06 2 20 mg l on the residual biocide concentration as dependent variable effect of both residual biocide concentration 100 500 mg l and residual free chlorine concentration 0 06 2 20 mg l on the iron ion concentration as dependent variable these correlations were calculated based on the data from 70 days and 50 daily measurements in the installation the pareto s diagram was obtained with excel microsoft to determine the influence of the studied parameters on the process 3 results and discussion 3 1 preliminary laboratory trials of biocides compatibility with regenerated water although the regenerated water accomplishes the legislation limit to be reused before its use at industrial scale its compatibility with different biocides used at the plant need to be asses in order to assure a good performance in the cooling towers and to select the most adequate without corrosion issues fig 2 shows the evolution of the concentration of each studied biocide during 5 h initial doses are those recommended by the manufacturer based on table 3 isothiazolone biocide had the higher decrease in concentration 20 being only 10 for the other two biocides all biocides maintained an adequate residual concentration after a contact time with the reclaimed water of 5 h applying the manufacturer s recommended dose it is concluded that the regenerated water and the active ingredients of the tested biocides are compatible none of them has a reduction percentage higher than 50 of the initial concentration being the 20 reduction in the isothiazolones the highest one even the quaternary ammonium salts whose optimum working ph is neutral or slightly alkaline 23 has shown an adequate stable residual concentration the higher reduction of isothiazolones in the regenerated water could be related to their structure cyclic ketones which can be oxidized into an ester by peroxyacids or hydrogen peroxide according to the baeyer villiger reaction 26 the regenerated water was treated to remove the hydrogen peroxide with acid washed activated carbon however it can still have traces of peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide beside the acetic acid in the water that can promote the baeyer villiger reaction and therefore oxidized isothiazolone sayantan 2020 29 also observed this oxidation reaction working with porous materials in presence of hydrogen peroxide at trace level the possibility of oxidation of acetic acid to isothiazolone has also been considered however silva et al 2020 30 determined that isothiazolones in their biodegradable degradation processes one of their products is acetic acid so this oxidation and therefore degradation is not contemplated in turn the acidity of the medium produced by acetic acid favours the biocidal action of isothiazolones so acetic acid can be considered a promoter of their biocidal action 30 for the rest of the biocides the percentages of variation are practically minimal so it can be concluded that they are fully compatible with the regenerated effluent given the successful results achived by the three products for the industrial scale study isothiazolones biocide was selected despite its higher concentration reduction because it was the one being used in the cooling towers of the plant the use of this active substance is conditioned by the plant s own criteria because it has excellent functionality for legionella prevention and its cost is intermediate in the tp11 biocides market this aspect will make it possible to evaluate in the ecotoxicity analysis the response of the same with the regenerated effluent 3 2 industrial scale results the industrial reclaimed water was reused in one of the cooling circuit of the factory using the isothiazolones as biocide water parameters were monitored daily to determine the stability of the quality of the reclaimed water and of the cooling process water on one hand and to asses the potential chemical interactions on the other the study has been carried out during 70 calendar days of process operation table 4 shows the average value of the parameters per week including the maximum and minimum values of the weekly averages as well as the maximum and minimum values of the specific daily measurements according to the supplier isothiazolone residual biocide concentration should be maintained between 100 and 500 mg l in the cooling process water the values measured during the 10 weeks trial have always met that criterion as shown in table 4 moreover minimum residual concentration of 50 daily measurements was 100 mg l and the maximum value was 500 mg l strictly meeting the criteria minimum and maximum weekly average values also show a good biocide performance during the cooling tower operation the ph of the cooling water circuit is close to neutral due to the gradual water evaporation typical of this type of circuits this is a good indication of the recovered water performance and its chemical stability it should be considered that under normal cooling conditions the evaporation process in cooling circuits leads to a water ph as consequence of the evaporation of pure water that leaves the salts in the cooling water producing the alkalization of the medium it is usual depending on the supply water to use ph reducers however in this case it is not necessary due the quality of the reclaimed water ph values above 8 5 greatly increase the risk of calcification with the subsequent associated issues mainly reduction of heat transmission coefficients greater risk of legionella proliferation and a lower biocide efficiency however win this case ph was maintained neutral between 7 and 8 avoiding calcification and or corrosion phenomena thanks to a well balance process water as it has already been mentioned the reclaimed water contains acetic acid as the result of the peracetic acid decomposition which acts as a neutralization buffer avoiding an excessive increase of the ph in the cooling towers due to water evaporation therefore the presence of acetic acid has several advantages as the reduction of the calcification phenomena the improvement of energy yields the lower risk of a reservoir for legionella proliferation and the reduction of corrosion phenomena under calcification deposits the addition of sodium hypochlorite to improve the control of aerobic microorganisms that remained in non oxidizing values that were not aggressive for the installation the iron ion concentration values shown in table 4 are also within the established limit to avoid corrosion phenomena in the metallic components of the refrigeration circuits the official results corresponding to the preventive maintenance of the cooling towers installation corroborate the effectiveness of the use of reclaimed water with isothiazolones as biocide accomplishing with current legislation royal decree 865 2003 3 all the microbiological parameters shown in table 5 legionella spp and aerobes at two temperatures are completely satisfactory legionella spp was not detected in the measurements performed every three months and the aerobic counts were always well below 10 000 cfu that is the maximum level allowed to complete the investigation samples were taken from the cooling tower purge to evaluate the ecotoxicity of this effluent comparison was made with another tower of similar characteristics using fresh water average conductivity of 800 μs cm and the same isothiazolones biocide table 6 the ecotoxicity results provide an overview of the entire reuse concept it can be observed that the ecotoxicity values are higher in the tower using fresh water although both towers operate under similar residual biocide concentration and conductivity it is possible that the reclaimed water produces a reduction in the biocide concentration due to its interaction with other species present in the water therefore the reuse of reclaimed water provides an additional environmental advantage due to the lower toxicity of the purge 3 3 correlations between cooling towers variables the results obtained at the industrial scale were used to generate new knowledge on the main water variables that affect the biocide efficiency the proposed correlations are specific to the operating regime and the climatic conditions of the target cooling tower however they can serve as a reference in future studies although during the full trial all parameters were within the legislation limits several anomalous values were observed in the daily measurements therefore pareto s diagram was applied to all anomalous values to determine which of them were statistically significant parameters are those that sums up 80 of accumulated frequency fig 3 considering the total amount of values those anomalous are very few therefore none of them are significant the out of range values for the concentration of iron ion were those above 1 5 mg l because the limit is 2 0 mg l likewise the out of range values for free chlorine were those above 2 0 mg l because it would exceed the legal limit in the case of residual isothiazolone biocide values under 250 mg l were considered out of range because it s very low residual concentration the out of range values of electrical conductivity and ph were those above 2 5 ms cm and 8 5 respectively because the tendency of the water to fouling increases negatively affecting the level of maintenance and the energy efficiency the parameter that showed the most out of range values in the studied period was the residual isothiazolone concentration followed by the electrical conductivity and the iron ion concentration the least frequent were the ph and the concentration of residual free chlorine 80 of the accumulative frequency was only reached with the residual isothiazolone concentration and the electrical conductivity this aspect is highly relevant when possible deviations are studied since the less influential factors are those more regulated by the legislation being the most influential factors those that should be controlled when deviations are produced to assure the operability of the cooling process several correlations were proposed and studied it is important to consider that all the correlations were obtained for an initial concentration of isothiazolones of 500 mg l and an initial free chlorine concentration of 2 2 mg l supplied through the corresponding calibrated dosing pumps therefore the variables considered in the models were the residual concentrations of both free chlorine and isothiazolones initially the effect of ph and conductivity was studied on the residual biocide concentration however in this case no linear correlation was found table 7 because the statistical analysis that considers the multivariate regression resulted in inadequate values of both r2 and f value this last parameter is higher than the level α corresponding to the selected confidence subsequently the effect of ph and residual free chlorine was studied on the residual biocide concentration table 8 finding a good correlation the statistical analysis of the multivariate regression provides adequate values of both r2 and f value being the f value lower than the level α corresponding to the selected confidence interval according to the negative sign of the coefficients of the independent variables the concentration of the residual biocide increases when ph and or residual free chlorine decrease it is expected that the correlation of residual biocide concentration with acetic acid would be determined by the ph having a higher residual concentration of biocide when the concentration of acetic acid is higher and the ph is lower therefore as the reclaimed water used in the cooling tower has an acid ph that increases up to nearly neutral values it makes sense that there is a higher residual concentration of biocide while the ph is lower to decrease thereafter that explains the higher concentration of residual biocide obtained at laboratory scale fig 2 where there is no evaporation process and therefore neither the ph increase observed at industrial scale table 4 in the case of residual free chlorine concentration which is a biocide with greater oxidizing power it makes sense that as free chlorine is consumed in the system more isothiazolone remains without being degraded finally the effect of residual biocide concentration and residual free chlorine concentration on iron ion concentration was studied as in the previous case these variables showed proper correlation table 9 the statistical analysis that considers the multivariate regression gives adequate values of both r2 and f being the f value lower than α corresponding to the selected confidence interval so it is concluded that there is correlation between the three variables the positive sign of the coefficients implies an increase in the concentration of iron ion when residual biocide and or residual free chlorine concentrations increase leading to higher corrosion levels the chlorine coefficient is about 10 times higher corroborating the higher oxidizing power in order to provide greater detail for process optimization regression models were analyzed to ensure that the manufacturer s recommended dose of biocide is accomplished and the iron ion concentration is below the value specified by current legislation the intervals studied for the considered parameters in the simulation with the model that correlates the residual biocide concentration mg l with the ph and the residual free chlorine table 8 were biocide it is possible to operate at high concentrations to ensure maximum asepsis of the water however it is recommended to work between 100 and 500 mg l of residual concentration this would be more environmentally friendly and cheaper ph was studied in the interval allowed by the royal decree 865 2003 3 between 6 5 and 9 0 residual free chlorine was studied in the interval allowed by the royal decree 865 2003 3 between 0 0 and 2 00 mg l table 10 shows the predicted concentration of residual biocide as a function of the residual free chlorine concentration and the ph the process works under optimum residual biocide concentration 100 500 mg l by keeping the ph between 7 30 and 7 70 for any residual free chlorine value under study 0 2 00 mg l that is the 34 of the analyzed points green region however it is not possible to work at ph values higher than 8 1 and residual free chlorine concentration above 0 6 mg l because at these conditions the residual biocide concentration does not reach the minimum recommended value that is the 8 5 of the analyzed points yellow region in the ph interval between 6 5 and 6 7 for any studied value of residual free chlorine concentration high values of biocide are obtained which is technically effective but economically expensive that is the 23 8 of the analyzed points blue region the remaining points usually for ph above 8 5 and any studied residual free chlorine value make the algorithm invalid that is the 33 3 of the analyzed points red region white values provide 95 confidence because they are in the limits of the model which are the maximum and minimum daily measurement intervals table 11 shows the iron ion concentration corrosion level as a function of chlorine and biocide concentrations the permitted values for chlorine are 0 2 mg l and the biocide dosages are 100 500 mg l irrespective of the ratio of variables at different concentrations a corrosion level higher than that specified by current legislation 2 00 mg l is never reached this aspect indicates the compatibility of the reclaimed water with the approved biocides reaching 73 of the points depending on the resolution of the measuring equipment green zone there is an important tendency the higher the concentration of chlorine and biocide the higher the degree of corrosion in the installation red zone from industrial experience it is considered that an iron ion concentration above 0 95 mg l indicates an increase in corrosion phenomena red zone for the resolution of the measuring equipment a minimum percentage of situations under this effect when the biocide is higher than 650 mg l outside the manufacturer s recommendation and when iron and when iron is above 0 95 mg l is observed 27 of the points red zone white values provide 95 confidence because they are interpolated in the maximum and minimum daily measurement intervals 3 4 industrial validation of the models the validation of the correlation models has been carried out with the data obtained from the official maintenance program of cooling towers in subsequent months table 12 shows the obtained ranges of values the measured values and the predicted residual isothiazolone concentration and the iron ion concentration values obtained with the regression models shown in table 8 and table 9 are presented in figs 4 and 5 respectively the good agreement between real and predicted values allows the validation of the models in economic terms the replacement of drinking water by the reclaimed effluent in one cooling tower represents a 100 water savings 3740 m3 year with an economic saving of 9874 year the cost of fresh water is 2 64 m3 4 conclusions reclaimed water coming from activated carbon treatment of wastewater from bottle is compatible with various commercial biocides quaternary ammonium salts tetrakis hydroxymethyl phosphonium sulphate thps and isothiazolones and can be successfully used as make up water in cooling towers at the recommended biocide doses the tested products maintain the residual concentrations above the recommended ones with losses between 10 and 20 in 5 h the long term industrial reuse of the reclaimed water in a cooling tower using isothiazolones as main biocide was successfully carried out all microbiological analyses complied with the specifications and no negative effects were observed after one year the application of the reuse water concept obtained additional benefits when compared with a cooling tower using drinking water as make up water as for example a higher residual biocidal concentration and a lower ecotoxicity of the purge evaporation of the water during the cooling process leads to an increase in the ph however the chemical composition of the water remains stable without the need of ph control and with minimum calcification risks a successful correlation was obtained at industrial scale between the residual biocide concentration and the residual free chlorine concentration and the ph r2 0 9143 higher residual biocide concentrations are achieved at lower values of both ph and free residual chlorine to predict corrosion problems a successful correlation was obtained between the iron ion concentration and the residual free chlorine and the residual biocide concentrations in all cases iron ion concentration values were below the limit of current legislation even under high concentration of both residual biocide and residual free chlorine these models open new possibilities for a better control of cooling towers from the economic point of view the replacement of drinking water by reclaimed water in one cooling tower represents 3740 m3 of water saving per year with an economic saving of 9874 year therefore the plant will use reclaimed water in all the cooling towers in relation to future research this study can be extended to obtain an industrial response with the other two active substances not evaluated in the industrial phase thps quaternary ammonium salts and others for application in other sector the biocide compatibility with other reclaimed water sources should be further explored it is also proposed to carry out more frequent ecotoxicity analysis to assess the possibility of finding a correlation with other variables declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

13340,cooling water circuits represent a high water saving potential that has not been fully exploited yet due to the risk of legionella outbreaks according to legislation cooling circuits are subjected to specific biocide treatments which must be considered when water reuse is planned biocide effectiveness mainly depends on the type of installation its operating regime and the interactions with other chemicals therefore water reuse is critical because its physical chemical and microbiological characteristics beside deposit and corrosion problems may reduce the biocidal power and produce a health risk however there is a lack of knowledge on the compatibility of reclaimed water with biocides and on long term maintenance problems this paper validates the long term performance of an industrial cooling tower using reclaimed water obtained after the treatment of bottle washing water the compatibility study of the reused water with three non oxidant commercial products from the tp11 group quaternary ammonium tetrakis hydroxymethyl phosphonium sulphate and isothiazolone shows a reduction lower than 20 of the biocide efficiency between periodic additions isothiazolone based biocide was tested with reclaimed water during 1 year at industrial scale without detecting any problem results show that water quality was always within the values allowed by legislation and slightly better when using reclaimed water lower ecotoxicity of the purge and higher biocidal residual concentration with the reuse strategy water savings of 3750 m3 y were obtained furthermore to minimize the

wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction the increasing water concern is promoting the implementation of strategies to reclaim and reuse water in industrial processes besides environmental and corporative image advantages industries must also benefit from improved process efficiency and cost reductions to facilitate the implementation of water reuse concepts the reuse of industrial reclaimed water is limited by its quality and by the quality requirements of the different uses cooling circuits are high water intensive and present a high potential for water savings however the used of reclaimed water is limited due to the risk of the proliferation of legionella bacteria 1 in spain legislation regulates both the use of reclaimed water royal decree 1620 2007 2 and legionella prevention in cooling systems royal decree 865 2003 3 which is based on biocide treatments in general biocides need to be effective accomplish ecotoxicity limits and be compatible with the water quality and with the presence of other biocides 4 therefore for water reuse in cooling towers it is important to assess the compatibility and effectiveness of the used biocide with the reclaimed water biocides are classified into 22 types by the european chemical agency echa 5 tp11 type biocides are liquid preservatives used in refrigeration systems and industrial processes included in the main group 2 which refers to preservatives 6 7 the use of tp11 biocides with reclaimed water implies the compliance with european legislation for both biocide regulation eu no 528 2012 8 and water reuse regulation eu 2020 741 9 quaternary ammonium derivatives are tp11 biocides and include benzalkonium chloride benzethonium chloride methylbenzethonium chloride cetalconium chloride cetylpyridinium chloride cetrimonium cetrimide tetraethylammonium bromide didecyldimethylammonium chloride and domiphenium bromide 10 the preparation of quaternary ammonium halides is based on the exhaustive alkylation of the amines 11 in general they are effective as algaecides and bactericides at neutral or slightly alkaline ph however their effectiveness against fungi is very low 12 furthermore its effectiveness is reduced by the presence of organic matter surfactants and detergents and at high water hardness 13 tetrakis hydroxymethyl phosphoric sulphate thps is also a widely used active ingredient in biocides due to the presence of disulfide bridges 14 although it is expensive it is water soluble and provides very good bactericidal properties among its main advantages are the low toxicity of the decomposition products and the possibility of operating at a wide ph range however the use of thps can lead to biofilm formation depending on the water quality 15 16 more recent is the use of isothiazolones which are characterized by their high reactivity and biocidal potential due to the presence of 5 chloro 3 isothiazolone whose preferential decomposition is towards thioacillus chloride 17 18 its bactericidal power allows to work in a wide ph range 19 biocide are widely used in most industrial sectors and there are many studies assessing their performance however most studies do not provide an overall assessment for their performance when water circuits are closed the effluent is reused or reclaimed water from other sources is used 20 21 atei et al have reported the successful performance of 2 2 dibromo 3 nitrilopropionamide at a constant concentration with reclaimed water from the petrochemical industry after a membrane treatment 22 in the case of cooling towers table 1 summarizes the studies related to the use of biocides with different water qualities the studies cover a wide conductivity range 7 76 to 2200 μs cm being the lower values for fresh water or highly treated water a few cases consider pilot studies of 1 2 months 17 18 22 however longer times covering all seasons are necessary to assure the correct functionality of the tower operation under different conditions most studies are focused on the use of highly oxidizing substances mainly chlorine derivatives 17 18 22 however they require the use of anticorrosive and antifouling chemical products 17 18 27 which on the other hand should be minimized to reduce the toxicity of the cooling tower purge and to reduce the cost in the case of non oxidizing biocides isothiazolones were used in combination with an oxidizing biocide 27 these chemicals act slowly and they are usually added in large weekly doses in this case their compatibility with the water is critical since the effectiveness must be maintained between dosages from the safety point of view special attention must be given to the legionella control which can be transmitted by aerosols as a consequence of the tower operation itself this parameter can be used as an indicator to determine the compatibility of the reclaimed water with the used biocide unfortunately only two studies 18 19 table 1 evaluate this parameter which should be analyzed at long term with controls every 3 months to obtain more conclusive results according to the state of the art the critical consequences of a poor compatibility between biocides and reclaimed water from different sources have not been fully studied yet non oxidizing active substances should be further studied since they produce a lower degradation of the installation furthermore it is necessary to extend the research considering industrial plants and long term studies to assess the evolution of the residual biocide concentration as a function of water quality variations the microbiological quality of the cooling process the demand of scale and corrosion inhibitors and to identify deposits and corrosion problems on the other hand potential cost savings in cooling towers must be further highlighted as a driver for water saving and for the implementation of circular economy concepts 27 based on the identified research gaps this paper studies the compatibility of reclaimed water from bottle disinfection in a food factory with three types active substances of non oxidizing biocides thps isothiazolone and quaternary ammonium derivatives reclaimed water was obtained by treating the effluent from the industrial washing and disinfection of juice bottles 1 additionally the long term reuse of the reclaimed water as make up water of a cooling tower using isothiazolone biocide was assessed and compared with a similar tower using drinking water finally to facilitate the control of cooling towers and minimize the risks of legionella and corrosion correlations between different parameters water quality parameters and the performance of the tower have been studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and analytical methods the reclaimed water used in this study comes from a process of washing and disinfection of polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles in a spanish juice plant the bottles disinfection is carried out with osmotic water with peracetic acid as biocide after disinfection residual hydrogen peroxide was removed by a catalytic decomposition process with activated carbon to minimize the oxidation of the cooling circuit 1 the reclaimed water has the adequate physical chemical properties table 2 to comply with current legislation for water reuse in cooling systems biocides were supplied by fupinax spain and uses as received without dilution table 3 the concentration of biocides was determined by titration using the specific commercial kit for each of them supplied by the manufacturers the basis of the titration reaction is not provided since it belongs to the know how of the suppliers the ph the electrical conductivity and temperature were measured using a hanna hi98130 device spain precision 0 01 and 0 01 ms cm respectively turbidity was measured with a hanna hi93703c turbidimeter spain precision 5 following iso 7027 hydrogen peroxide was measured by a titration method with a hanna hi3844 equipment spain precision 0 25 mg l free chlorine was measured using the adaptation of epa s dpd 330 5 method with hanna hi83399 02 photometer spain precision 0 03 mg l and total iron ion content was measured using an adaptation of the epa 315b phenanthroline method with a checker hanna hi721 device spain precision 0 04 mg l ecotoxicity using luminescent microorganisms vibrio fischeri was evaluated this parameter has been used to assess the effect of pollutants such as triclosan 21 pesticides and herbicides 24 and biocides such as malathion and diazion 25 in wastewater and antifoulants in marine environments 28 the ecotoxicity was analyzed following the une en iso 11348 2 2009 standard determination of the inhibitory effect of water samples on the luminescence of vibrio fischeri luminescent bacteria test 2 2 experimental procedure the efficiency of the three biocides was assessed using the reclaimed water that was going to be reused as make up water in one of the cooling towers of the juice factory this recovered water coming from the washing and disinfection of pet bottles was treated with activated carbon to remove the residual hydrogen peroxide to avoid any damage in the cooling towers installations due to oxidation 1 although the characteristics of the regenerated water accomplish with the spanish legislation the performance of already used biocides with this reclaimed water must be evaluated fig 1 shows the procedure to test the biocides performance the different phases of the research are laboratory industrial implementation and industrial validation of the research the biocides were initially dosed at the concentration recommended by the manufacturers table 3 500 mg l for isothiazolone 50 mg l for thps and 100 mg l for quaternary ammonium salts the experiments were performed with 1 l of water split up into three aliquots one for each biocide the water was mixed with the biocide using a slow magnetic agitation 100 rpm along the experiment at 30 minute intervals the residual biocidal product was quantified to determine its persistence and compatibility with the treated effluent the experiments were performed during 5 h considering that if the residual concentration was kept at the recommended dose after 5 h the compatibility of the biocide with the effluent can be assured subsequently the effectiveness of the selected biocide was evaluated during 1 year in an industrial cooling tower through the determination of ph turbidity electrical conductivity and concentrations of hydrogen peroxide free chlorine iron ion concentration and residual biocide in this industrial phase the synergy between the selected biocide and the sodium hypochlorite was studied because both active substances are usually combined if the chemical analyses of the facility or the microbiological analyses failed finally samples were taken from the cooling tower purge while using the reclaimed water to measure the ecotoxicity the performance of the cooling tower using reclaimed water was compared with a similar one using drinking water with an average conductivity of 800 μs cm all experiments were replicated three times in the laboratory phase during the industrial phase official measurements were carried out in the cooling towers according to the legislation 3 daily measurement one replicate were taken 5 days per week always at the same time 14 00 h for 10 weeks the wide range of data was used to feed the corresponding regression models 2 3 experimental design correlations between the parameters were studied by performing the analysis of the multivariate correlation as well as the analysis of variance anova using the multiple correlation package excel microsoft the parameters considered to find the correlations were the residual concentration of biocide the iron ion concentration the residual concentration of free chlorine ph and electrical conductivity in the industrial phase the dosing pumps operated under a set point that provided a fixed initial concentration of free chlorine and isothiazolones of 2 20 mg l and 500 mg l respectively from the dosed time these concentrations started to decrease as a function of water chemistry operation regime of the cooling tower purging etc the residual concentrations of biocide and free chlorine were considered as the main parameters for the correlations the residual concentration of biocide provides critical information about the performance of the biocide in the cooling tower on the other hand the iron ion concentration is an indicative of the possible corrosion and depreciation phenomena in the installations first degree empirical polynomial equation eq 1 where y is the dependent variable xi represents the independent variables and b0 and bi are the corresponding regression coefficients were selected for the correlation because it provided the best fit after trying multiple adjustments to different functions 1 y b 0 σb i x i the correlations studied were effect of both ph 7 0 8 6 and electrical conductivity 1500 3000 μs cm on the residual biocide concentration as dependent variable effect of both ph 7 0 and 8 6 and residual free chlorine concentration 0 06 2 20 mg l on the residual biocide concentration as dependent variable effect of both residual biocide concentration 100 500 mg l and residual free chlorine concentration 0 06 2 20 mg l on the iron ion concentration as dependent variable these correlations were calculated based on the data from 70 days and 50 daily measurements in the installation the pareto s diagram was obtained with excel microsoft to determine the influence of the studied parameters on the process 3 results and discussion 3 1 preliminary laboratory trials of biocides compatibility with regenerated water although the regenerated water accomplishes the legislation limit to be reused before its use at industrial scale its compatibility with different biocides used at the plant need to be asses in order to assure a good performance in the cooling towers and to select the most adequate without corrosion issues fig 2 shows the evolution of the concentration of each studied biocide during 5 h initial doses are those recommended by the manufacturer based on table 3 isothiazolone biocide had the higher decrease in concentration 20 being only 10 for the other two biocides all biocides maintained an adequate residual concentration after a contact time with the reclaimed water of 5 h applying the manufacturer s recommended dose it is concluded that the regenerated water and the active ingredients of the tested biocides are compatible none of them has a reduction percentage higher than 50 of the initial concentration being the 20 reduction in the isothiazolones the highest one even the quaternary ammonium salts whose optimum working ph is neutral or slightly alkaline 23 has shown an adequate stable residual concentration the higher reduction of isothiazolones in the regenerated water could be related to their structure cyclic ketones which can be oxidized into an ester by peroxyacids or hydrogen peroxide according to the baeyer villiger reaction 26 the regenerated water was treated to remove the hydrogen peroxide with acid washed activated carbon however it can still have traces of peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide beside the acetic acid in the water that can promote the baeyer villiger reaction and therefore oxidized isothiazolone sayantan 2020 29 also observed this oxidation reaction working with porous materials in presence of hydrogen peroxide at trace level the possibility of oxidation of acetic acid to isothiazolone has also been considered however silva et al 2020 30 determined that isothiazolones in their biodegradable degradation processes one of their products is acetic acid so this oxidation and therefore degradation is not contemplated in turn the acidity of the medium produced by acetic acid favours the biocidal action of isothiazolones so acetic acid can be considered a promoter of their biocidal action 30 for the rest of the biocides the percentages of variation are practically minimal so it can be concluded that they are fully compatible with the regenerated effluent given the successful results achived by the three products for the industrial scale study isothiazolones biocide was selected despite its higher concentration reduction because it was the one being used in the cooling towers of the plant the use of this active substance is conditioned by the plant s own criteria because it has excellent functionality for legionella prevention and its cost is intermediate in the tp11 biocides market this aspect will make it possible to evaluate in the ecotoxicity analysis the response of the same with the regenerated effluent 3 2 industrial scale results the industrial reclaimed water was reused in one of the cooling circuit of the factory using the isothiazolones as biocide water parameters were monitored daily to determine the stability of the quality of the reclaimed water and of the cooling process water on one hand and to asses the potential chemical interactions on the other the study has been carried out during 70 calendar days of process operation table 4 shows the average value of the parameters per week including the maximum and minimum values of the weekly averages as well as the maximum and minimum values of the specific daily measurements according to the supplier isothiazolone residual biocide concentration should be maintained between 100 and 500 mg l in the cooling process water the values measured during the 10 weeks trial have always met that criterion as shown in table 4 moreover minimum residual concentration of 50 daily measurements was 100 mg l and the maximum value was 500 mg l strictly meeting the criteria minimum and maximum weekly average values also show a good biocide performance during the cooling tower operation the ph of the cooling water circuit is close to neutral due to the gradual water evaporation typical of this type of circuits this is a good indication of the recovered water performance and its chemical stability it should be considered that under normal cooling conditions the evaporation process in cooling circuits leads to a water ph as consequence of the evaporation of pure water that leaves the salts in the cooling water producing the alkalization of the medium it is usual depending on the supply water to use ph reducers however in this case it is not necessary due the quality of the reclaimed water ph values above 8 5 greatly increase the risk of calcification with the subsequent associated issues mainly reduction of heat transmission coefficients greater risk of legionella proliferation and a lower biocide efficiency however win this case ph was maintained neutral between 7 and 8 avoiding calcification and or corrosion phenomena thanks to a well balance process water as it has already been mentioned the reclaimed water contains acetic acid as the result of the peracetic acid decomposition which acts as a neutralization buffer avoiding an excessive increase of the ph in the cooling towers due to water evaporation therefore the presence of acetic acid has several advantages as the reduction of the calcification phenomena the improvement of energy yields the lower risk of a reservoir for legionella proliferation and the reduction of corrosion phenomena under calcification deposits the addition of sodium hypochlorite to improve the control of aerobic microorganisms that remained in non oxidizing values that were not aggressive for the installation the iron ion concentration values shown in table 4 are also within the established limit to avoid corrosion phenomena in the metallic components of the refrigeration circuits the official results corresponding to the preventive maintenance of the cooling towers installation corroborate the effectiveness of the use of reclaimed water with isothiazolones as biocide accomplishing with current legislation royal decree 865 2003 3 all the microbiological parameters shown in table 5 legionella spp and aerobes at two temperatures are completely satisfactory legionella spp was not detected in the measurements performed every three months and the aerobic counts were always well below 10 000 cfu that is the maximum level allowed to complete the investigation samples were taken from the cooling tower purge to evaluate the ecotoxicity of this effluent comparison was made with another tower of similar characteristics using fresh water average conductivity of 800 μs cm and the same isothiazolones biocide table 6 the ecotoxicity results provide an overview of the entire reuse concept it can be observed that the ecotoxicity values are higher in the tower using fresh water although both towers operate under similar residual biocide concentration and conductivity it is possible that the reclaimed water produces a reduction in the biocide concentration due to its interaction with other species present in the water therefore the reuse of reclaimed water provides an additional environmental advantage due to the lower toxicity of the purge 3 3 correlations between cooling towers variables the results obtained at the industrial scale were used to generate new knowledge on the main water variables that affect the biocide efficiency the proposed correlations are specific to the operating regime and the climatic conditions of the target cooling tower however they can serve as a reference in future studies although during the full trial all parameters were within the legislation limits several anomalous values were observed in the daily measurements therefore pareto s diagram was applied to all anomalous values to determine which of them were statistically significant parameters are those that sums up 80 of accumulated frequency fig 3 considering the total amount of values those anomalous are very few therefore none of them are significant the out of range values for the concentration of iron ion were those above 1 5 mg l because the limit is 2 0 mg l likewise the out of range values for free chlorine were those above 2 0 mg l because it would exceed the legal limit in the case of residual isothiazolone biocide values under 250 mg l were considered out of range because it s very low residual concentration the out of range values of electrical conductivity and ph were those above 2 5 ms cm and 8 5 respectively because the tendency of the water to fouling increases negatively affecting the level of maintenance and the energy efficiency the parameter that showed the most out of range values in the studied period was the residual isothiazolone concentration followed by the electrical conductivity and the iron ion concentration the least frequent were the ph and the concentration of residual free chlorine 80 of the accumulative frequency was only reached with the residual isothiazolone concentration and the electrical conductivity this aspect is highly relevant when possible deviations are studied since the less influential factors are those more regulated by the legislation being the most influential factors those that should be controlled when deviations are produced to assure the operability of the cooling process several correlations were proposed and studied it is important to consider that all the correlations were obtained for an initial concentration of isothiazolones of 500 mg l and an initial free chlorine concentration of 2 2 mg l supplied through the corresponding calibrated dosing pumps therefore the variables considered in the models were the residual concentrations of both free chlorine and isothiazolones initially the effect of ph and conductivity was studied on the residual biocide concentration however in this case no linear correlation was found table 7 because the statistical analysis that considers the multivariate regression resulted in inadequate values of both r2 and f value this last parameter is higher than the level α corresponding to the selected confidence subsequently the effect of ph and residual free chlorine was studied on the residual biocide concentration table 8 finding a good correlation the statistical analysis of the multivariate regression provides adequate values of both r2 and f value being the f value lower than the level α corresponding to the selected confidence interval according to the negative sign of the coefficients of the independent variables the concentration of the residual biocide increases when ph and or residual free chlorine decrease it is expected that the correlation of residual biocide concentration with acetic acid would be determined by the ph having a higher residual concentration of biocide when the concentration of acetic acid is higher and the ph is lower therefore as the reclaimed water used in the cooling tower has an acid ph that increases up to nearly neutral values it makes sense that there is a higher residual concentration of biocide while the ph is lower to decrease thereafter that explains the higher concentration of residual biocide obtained at laboratory scale fig 2 where there is no evaporation process and therefore neither the ph increase observed at industrial scale table 4 in the case of residual free chlorine concentration which is a biocide with greater oxidizing power it makes sense that as free chlorine is consumed in the system more isothiazolone remains without being degraded finally the effect of residual biocide concentration and residual free chlorine concentration on iron ion concentration was studied as in the previous case these variables showed proper correlation table 9 the statistical analysis that considers the multivariate regression gives adequate values of both r2 and f being the f value lower than α corresponding to the selected confidence interval so it is concluded that there is correlation between the three variables the positive sign of the coefficients implies an increase in the concentration of iron ion when residual biocide and or residual free chlorine concentrations increase leading to higher corrosion levels the chlorine coefficient is about 10 times higher corroborating the higher oxidizing power in order to provide greater detail for process optimization regression models were analyzed to ensure that the manufacturer s recommended dose of biocide is accomplished and the iron ion concentration is below the value specified by current legislation the intervals studied for the considered parameters in the simulation with the model that correlates the residual biocide concentration mg l with the ph and the residual free chlorine table 8 were biocide it is possible to operate at high concentrations to ensure maximum asepsis of the water however it is recommended to work between 100 and 500 mg l of residual concentration this would be more environmentally friendly and cheaper ph was studied in the interval allowed by the royal decree 865 2003 3 between 6 5 and 9 0 residual free chlorine was studied in the interval allowed by the royal decree 865 2003 3 between 0 0 and 2 00 mg l table 10 shows the predicted concentration of residual biocide as a function of the residual free chlorine concentration and the ph the process works under optimum residual biocide concentration 100 500 mg l by keeping the ph between 7 30 and 7 70 for any residual free chlorine value under study 0 2 00 mg l that is the 34 of the analyzed points green region however it is not possible to work at ph values higher than 8 1 and residual free chlorine concentration above 0 6 mg l because at these conditions the residual biocide concentration does not reach the minimum recommended value that is the 8 5 of the analyzed points yellow region in the ph interval between 6 5 and 6 7 for any studied value of residual free chlorine concentration high values of biocide are obtained which is technically effective but economically expensive that is the 23 8 of the analyzed points blue region the remaining points usually for ph above 8 5 and any studied residual free chlorine value make the algorithm invalid that is the 33 3 of the analyzed points red region white values provide 95 confidence because they are in the limits of the model which are the maximum and minimum daily measurement intervals table 11 shows the iron ion concentration corrosion level as a function of chlorine and biocide concentrations the permitted values for chlorine are 0 2 mg l and the biocide dosages are 100 500 mg l irrespective of the ratio of variables at different concentrations a corrosion level higher than that specified by current legislation 2 00 mg l is never reached this aspect indicates the compatibility of the reclaimed water with the approved biocides reaching 73 of the points depending on the resolution of the measuring equipment green zone there is an important tendency the higher the concentration of chlorine and biocide the higher the degree of corrosion in the installation red zone from industrial experience it is considered that an iron ion concentration above 0 95 mg l indicates an increase in corrosion phenomena red zone for the resolution of the measuring equipment a minimum percentage of situations under this effect when the biocide is higher than 650 mg l outside the manufacturer s recommendation and when iron and when iron is above 0 95 mg l is observed 27 of the points red zone white values provide 95 confidence because they are interpolated in the maximum and minimum daily measurement intervals 3 4 industrial validation of the models the validation of the correlation models has been carried out with the data obtained from the official maintenance program of cooling towers in subsequent months table 12 shows the obtained ranges of values the measured values and the predicted residual isothiazolone concentration and the iron ion concentration values obtained with the regression models shown in table 8 and table 9 are presented in figs 4 and 5 respectively the good agreement between real and predicted values allows the validation of the models in economic terms the replacement of drinking water by the reclaimed effluent in one cooling tower represents a 100 water savings 3740 m3 year with an economic saving of 9874 year the cost of fresh water is 2 64 m3 4 conclusions reclaimed water coming from activated carbon treatment of wastewater from bottle is compatible with various commercial biocides quaternary ammonium salts tetrakis hydroxymethyl phosphonium sulphate thps and isothiazolones and can be successfully used as make up water in cooling towers at the recommended biocide doses the tested products maintain the residual concentrations above the recommended ones with losses between 10 and 20 in 5 h the long term industrial reuse of the reclaimed water in a cooling tower using isothiazolones as main biocide was successfully carried out all microbiological analyses complied with the specifications and no negative effects were observed after one year the application of the reuse water concept obtained additional benefits when compared with a cooling tower using drinking water as make up water as for example a higher residual biocidal concentration and a lower ecotoxicity of the purge evaporation of the water during the cooling process leads to an increase in the ph however the chemical composition of the water remains stable without the need of ph control and with minimum calcification risks a successful correlation was obtained at industrial scale between the residual biocide concentration and the residual free chlorine concentration and the ph r2 0 9143 higher residual biocide concentrations are achieved at lower values of both ph and free residual chlorine to predict corrosion problems a successful correlation was obtained between the iron ion concentration and the residual free chlorine and the residual biocide concentrations in all cases iron ion concentration values were below the limit of current legislation even under high concentration of both residual biocide and residual free chlorine these models open new possibilities for a better control of cooling towers from the economic point of view the replacement of drinking water by reclaimed water in one cooling tower represents 3740 m3 of water saving per year with an economic saving of 9874 year therefore the plant will use reclaimed water in all the cooling towers in relation to future research this study can be extended to obtain an industrial response with the other two active substances not evaluated in the industrial phase thps quaternary ammonium salts and others for application in other sector the biocide compatibility with other reclaimed water sources should be further explored it is also proposed to carry out more frequent ecotoxicity analysis to assess the possibility of finding a correlation with other variables declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

13341,forward osmosis fo as one energy efficient desalination technology had been intensively studied in agricultural fertilization to meet the demand of the water resource and the fertilizer for plant growth showing good techno economic benefit as such the energy efficient temperature enhanced osmotic membrane distillation t omd heated by low grade thermal sources i e solar energy was firstly investigated in agricultural fertilization via techno economic comparison with fo the experimental investigation revealed that t omd in the agricultural fertigation can be endowed with quadruple advantages of high water flux at a high temperature difference 40 c low fertilizer loss good compatibility for different fertilizers and good feasibility to utilize some unconventional waters i e wastewater seawater and seawater ro brine furthermore a preliminary economic analysis showed that the membrane area and the price of the fo membrane module are two significant indicators to evaluate the economic feasibility of t omd in detail t omd must be more cost effective than fo if the total membrane area is larger than 10 000 m2 under the same operating temperature configuration or dilution factor lower than 0 25 and permeate flux higher than 10 000 m3 h are satisfied under different operating temperature configurations based on the experimental investigation and economic analysis t omd can provide an alternative pathway to achieve high efficient and cost effective agricultural fertigation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords temperature enhanced osmotic membrane distillation forward osmosis agricultural fertigation techno economic analysis 1 introduction water security for agricultural irrigation has become one of the grand challenges for the sustainable development of human society around 72 of the total global freshwater 3100 billion m3 had been used for agricultural irrigation and the gap between the supply and demand will become larger under unconfined control conditions 1 what s worse for the irrigation waters is that the freshwater scarcity has threatened agricultural sustainability 2 3 and is further aggravated by the water pollution resulting from the fast developing urbanization and industrialization 4 therefore it is of significance to high efficiently and cost effectively expand the water resources used for agricultural irrigation 5 7 desalination as one advanced technology to efficiently use seawater has been widely used for the freshwater supply 8 13 considering that the cost of desalted water is still 3 5 times higher than that of natural freshwater 14 some conventional energy intensive desalination technologies i e reverse osmosis are uneconomic for the low valued and large scale application of the fresh water in agricultural irrigation 15 16 in another word the high efficient and cost effective desalination technologies are urgent in the context of the global water energy crisis osmotic membrane distillation omd as one low energy membrane based technology has been developed as early as the 1960s 17 as one variant of membrane distillation md the driving force of omd is also the vapor pressure difference across the porous hydrophobic membrane whereas in the case of omd both temperature concentration differences induces a more significant difference in vapor pressure gradient compared to a single temperature difference in md 18 20 given that the utilization potential of low grade thermal power and the natural vapor transport driven by the concentration difference omd can be commonly labeled with the low energy consumption in the conventional omd process the temperature difference is not higher than 20 c thus omd has been proposed and intensively investigated in the concentration of fruit juices and other heat sensitive liquids 21 27 such a slight temperature difference determines the low flux performance that the water fluxes are usually lower than 7 2 lmh or 2 0 μm s in these applications 20 if the feed waters can be treated at a higher operation temperature the water flux will be enhanced because of the increased driving force from the higher temperature difference based on such consideration one temperature enhanced osmotic membrane distillation t omd was proposed to utilize the low grade thermal source and high tolerable temperature of the seawater highlighting the potential of t omd to high efficiently extract the freshwater from the seawater or other saline waters for low energy and high efficient agricultural irrigation however in omd and t omd processes the feed solution fs or low salinity feed stream needs to be concentrated and the osmotic agent or the draw solution ds needs to be diluted as a consequence the freshwater is obtained by regenerating the ds while consuming massive energy in the context of agricultural irrigation the concept of direct fertigation by using fertilizer as the ds has been proposed and intensively studied in the forward osmosis fo process 16 28 41 where the diluted fertilizer solution can be directly used for fertigation thereby eliminating the worry about additional energy consumption in the ds regeneration similar to omd fo is also a cost effective desalination technology in this scenario and is operated in the same operation mode where different salinity solutions across the membrane enter into membrane module and then diluted and concentrated solutions are directly utilized refer to fig 1 however experimental results in fo based systems revealed that the water quality of product water diluted ds could meet the fertigation standard while the reverse diffusion of fertilizer solutes failed the low salinity feed stream to meet the effluent discharge standard 40 based on such situation the omd packed with the non wetted porous hydrophobic membrane can reject 100 salt from the low salinity feed stream while ensuring high efficient utilization of fertilizer however to the best of our knowledge there is no comprehensive study to investigate the techno economic feasibility of omd in agricultural fertigation and compare its membrane performance and economic cost with fo herein for the first time we investigated the techno economic feasibility of the t omd process in agricultural fertigation in this study we selected two representative commercial t omd and fo membranes porous hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene t omd membrane and newly developed polyamide thin film composite fo membrane in the technical investigations the flux performances of the t omd membrane were intensively

membrane to illuminate the favorable conditions of t omd in superior membrane performance for agricultural fertigation furthermore based on experimental results a preliminary economic analysis was conducted to illuminate the favorable conditions and identify the key factors of t omd in reducing capital expenditure 2 materials and methods 2 1 membranes fo membrane commercial flat sheet tfc fo

measurement range of 0 3000 mosmoles kg and the measurement resolution of 1 mosmoles kg limited by the measurement range of the osmometer the osmolality of 1 0 m solution was measured in our work 2 3

temperature difference on membrane performance in fo and t omd the temperature difference is the direct driving force in t omd and is responsible for the evolution of the membrane performance in fo moreover the key to membrane based technologies in agricultural fertigation is to ensure high permeate flux and low fertilizer loss based on such fig 3 illustrates the effect of the temperature difference on the water flux reverse water flux and specific reverse solute flux in t omd and fo for water flux in fig 3 a both water fluxes in t omd and fo increase with the increase of the temperature difference while the temperature induced water flux increments are different in these two processes in detail when the temperature difference is lower than 40 c fo is superior to t omd and the surplus is largest at the isothermal condition however when the temperature difference is larger than 40 c the water flux in t omd becomes larger than the one in fo and approaches three times at the temperature difference of 60 c at this point t omd is superior to fo in terms of high efficient utilization of thermal energy considering that the hot regions are commonly short of freshwater resources used for agricultural irrigation and abundant low grade thermal sources i e solar energy t omd can be potentially applied in these regions and fo is more suitable for those regions where the low grade thermal power is not facilely available the difference between t omd and fo in water flux lies in the driving force type the driving force in t omd is the vapor pressure which is governed by the antoine equation meanwhile the driving force in fo is the osmotic pressure across the fo membranes which is governed by van t hoff equation because the maximum operating temperature in the aqueous solution is not higher than 100 c the temperature induced osmotic pressure increment rate is not higher than 36 63 when the operation temperature ranged from 0 c to 100 c however the theoretical driving force in t omd increased by 936 when the temperature of pure water just increased from 20 c to 50 c detailed calculation can refer to appendix a low reverse solute flux is of significance to reduce the loss from the leakage of fertilizer contained ds solution thus reducing the operating cost even though omd can theoretically reject 100 salt from the low salinity feed stream the partial or extremely slight wetting of porous hydrophobic membranes is still inevitable which can be validated for the desalination rate not 100 in md and omd experiments due to the infinitely low solute leakage the concentration of k in the feed side was measured not by the traditional detecting instrument but by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes icap7200 thermo fisher usa as illustrated in fig 3 b reverse solute fluxes in t omd and fo increase with increased temperature differences for fo higher operating temperature resulted in a higher solute permeability coefficient thereby rendering higher reverse solute flux 43 for t omd and non volatile kcl fertilizer reverse k flux resulted from the partial wetting related to a higher tendency of salt crystallization at a higher operating temperature 44 unlike the evolution of water flux the increment of the reverse solute flux in fo is far larger than the one in t omd for instance when the temperature difference varies from 20 c to 60 c the reverse solute flux in fo increases from 22 67 gmh to 55 00 gmh while the reverse solute flux in t omd increases from 0 43 gmh to 4 62 gmh it should be noted that the presence of the reverse solute flux in t omd does not mean to the membrane wetting according to eq 3 4 62 gmh of maximum reverse solute flux in t omd is equivalent to 99 9957 99 9 of salt rejection showing superior salt rejection as reported in previous studies 45 46 the reverse solute flux in t omd at the highest temperature difference is far less than the ones in fo such result suggests that less leakage of fertilizer is achieved in t omd confirming the advantage of t omd in rejecting the salt importantly the specific reverse solute flux abbreviated as srsf is a key parameter to evaluate the membrane perm selectivity as illustrated in fig 3 c we can find that all srsfs in t omd are less than the ones in fo for instance the srsf in t omd is not larger than 0 04 g l however the srsf in fo is not lower than 0 69 g l in this case the membrane perm selectivity in t omd is superior to the one in fo taken together the high temperature difference 40 c ensures high water flux and high perm selectivity in t omd thereby rendering the marked advantage of t omd in agricultural fertigation based on such consideration the temperature difference is maintained at 40 c in the following sections 3 1 2 effect of solution concentration on membrane performance in fo and t omd the driving force in both t omd and fo processes can be enhanced by the solution concentration difference across the membrane thus the solution concentration at the high salinity side can affect the water flux in t omd and fo fig 4 illustrates the evolution of water fluxes in t omd and fo at different high salinity solution concentrations with the decrease of high salinity solution concentration the water flux in fo decreased significantly but the water flux in t omd decreased slightly for example when the ds concentration decreased from 4 m to 1 m the water flux in fo decreased from 9 58 μm s to 4 03 μm s by 57 93 and the water flux in omd decreased from 17 72 μm s to 17 60 μm s by 0 68 this is because that the driving force in fo is directly and strongly related to the solution concentration jw airt c but the one in t omd is weakly affected by the solution concentration appendix a such results confirmed the advantage of t omd in the water flux at a high temperature difference 40 c and a wide range of high salinity solution concentrations 1 4 m kcl solution also the low salinity solution concentration affects the membrane flux in t omd because of the close interrelation between the vapor pressure and the solution concentration or the molar fraction of pure solvent on the hot side as illustrated in fig 5 when the low salinity solution was replaced by higher concentrations of nacl solution the water flux in t omd slightly decreased from 17 68 μm s to 16 07 μm s by 9 11 at this point the water flux in t omd is less susceptible to the low salinity solution concentration than the high salinity solution concentration besides once the ultrapure water was replaced by a higher concentration of nacl solution in fo the water fluxes in these cases must be far lower than the one in the case where the ultrapure water was used as the low salinity solution thus the maximum water flux of the applied tfc membrane in fo is 9 67 μm s under current conditions compare with the water fluxes of applied ptfe membrane in t omd we can find that the minimum water flux in t omd is still higher than the maximum one in fo which suggests that these low salinity solutions i e wastewater seawater and seawater ro brine are more suitable to be treated or recovered by t omd than by fo therefore t omd has a great potential to utilize some conventional waters to supplement the supply of agriculture irrigation 3 1 3 effect of fertilizer type on membrane performance in fo and t omd the fertilizers used in agricultural fertigation need various types to meet the requirement of the crop growth for nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k therefore the effect of three common inorganic fertilizers kcl nh4cl and kh2po4 and one common organic fertilizer urea on the water flux in t omd is illustrated in fig 6 the water fluxes for these four fertilizers are approximately equal to 18 μm s which suggests that t omd is less susceptible to the type of fertilizers this is not inconsistent with the conclusion in fo that kcl is reported to produce higher flux than other inorganic draw solutions and urea is found to have low water flux and high reverse solute flux 47 in fo the same molar concentration for inorganic fertilizers does not mean the same osmotic pressure and the urea does not form charged species in water for example the osmolalities of 1 0 m kcl solution 1 0 m nh4cl solution and 1 0 m kh2po4 solution are 1986 mosmoles kg 1978 mosmoles kg and 1704 mosmoles kg a close observation shows that the osmolalities of nh4cl and kh2po4 solutions deviate from the one of kcl by 0 40 and 14 20 moreover the presence of internal concentration polarization icp in fo enables the fertilizer type to play a significant role in determining the water flux 16 in other words the fertilizer with a large molecular weight is inclined to suffer from more severe icp due to the inverse proportion between the solute diffusion and molecular weight 48 taken together the water flux in fo is strongly related to the type of fertilizer conversely in t omd the same molar concentration cannot induce a significant difference in the molar fraction of pure solvent for example the molar fractions of pure water in 3 m kcl 3 m nh4cl 3 m kh2po4 and 3 m urea are 94 53 93 98 91 64 and 93 81 respectively accordingly the vapor pressures for these four fertilizer contained solutions are approximately equal such a slight difference between the vapor pressures is corresponding to the evolution of water fluxes with the fertilizer type in t omd therefore the water flux in t omd is not sensitive to the fertilizer type but the reverse solute flux in t omd is more sensitive to the fertilizer type as illustrated in table 1 it can be found that reverse nh4cl and urea fluxes and corresponding srsfs are larger than the other two fertilizers which can be attributed to the volatile feature of nh4cl and urea such result implies that the volatile fertilizer is easy to leak compared to other temperature insensitive fertilizers even though higher solute loss operated in t omd can be found for these temperature sensitive fertilizers their leakage is far lower than the one in fo for instance when kcl was used as the fertilizer the ratio of the srsf in omd to the one in fo denoted as rsrsf is 0 87 for the urea and nh4cl both rsrsf are still lower than 2 92 resulting from lower perm selectivity performance for urea and nh4cl in fo however one relatively high rsrsf value 8 37 for kh2po4 was observed but it is still lower and lower than 100 therefore omd can reduce fertilizer loss compared to fo besides increasing the salinity of the low salinity solution has been demonstrated to be responsible for the reduced water flux when the kcl solution is used as the high salinity solution fig 7 the same situation can be found in the other three fertilizer contained solutions such result suggests that t omd can be used to dilute different fertilizer contained solutions to the agriculture fertigation and simultaneous water recycling all in all experimental results showed that t omd applied in the agricultural fertigation can be endowed with quadruple advantages 1 high water flux at a high temperature difference 40 c 2 low fertilizer loss 3 good compatibility for different fertilizers and 4 good feasibility to utilize some unconventional waters i e wastewater seawater and seawater ro brine but t omd as a variant of md also suffers from membrane wetting thus mitigating the membrane wetting is critical to ensure high perm selectivity performance and long term operation stability in t omd 3 2 economic comparison between t omd and fo in agricultural fertigation 3 2 1 thermal source is easily accessible when the thermal source or the heated fs source is easily accessible or has become one prerequisite condition the same thermal energy input can be used to enhance the membrane performances in t omd and fo processes without economic consideration under these limited conditions the economic comparison between these two processes can be simplified to compare their capital expenditure in the membrane area to achieve the same objective specific dilution factor for the fertilizer containing ds in this case the membrane area to obtain one specific dilution factor df in both fo and t omd membrane modules can be calculated by 4 a q d 0 df j w where q d 0 is the inlet ds flowrate of t omd or fo membrane module and j w is the average water flux in addition df can be defined as the ratio of the outlet ds flowrate to the inlet ds flowrate when q d 0 and df in fo are the same as those in t omd the ratio of the total area for t omd membrane modules to that for fo membrane modules can be expressed by 5 β a t omd a fo j w fo j w t omd where c d 0 and c d t are the molar concentrations of ds solutions in inlet and outlet membrane modules accordingly the comparison between t omd and fo capital expenditure capex for membrane modules is expressed as the ratio t omd fo capex investment for membrane modules 6 capex t omd m capex fo m p t omd p fo β where p t omd and p fo are the prices of t omd and fo membrane modules the benefit cost ratio analyses for fo based systems in previous literature showed that the fo membrane module cost must be lower than 100 m2 49 meanwhile the target price should approve to 31 m2 50 thus the range for the cost of fo modules is 31 to 100 m2 in this work besides because t omd is a variant of md the prospective module capex of t omd can be estimated by following the cost protocol of the md membrane module 51 7 p omd p omd ref a omd a omd ref m 1 where p omd ref is the reference cost of the ptfe membrane module 175 m2 a omd ref is the reference membrane area 300 m2 and m is the degression coefficient 0 74 referring to eq 4 we can find that p t omd are 128 70 and 39 m2 corresponding to the membrane area multiplied by 10 times from 1000 to 10 000 m2 therefore eq 6 can be rewritten by introducing the prices of membrane modules 8 capex t omd m capex fo m α β taking one case for an example α ranged from 0 39 to 1 28 when the membrane area is 100 00 m2 if less capex t omd m is expected β must be less than 0 78 if less capex fo m is expected β must be larger than 1 28 considering that t omd and fo are similar in the operation mode and the technological process the difference between t omd and fo can be mainly attributed to the capex of the membrane modules therefore once the fo membrane performance is up to 1 28 times higher than t omd lower capex is required in fo meanwhile if the fo membrane performance is less than 0 78 times of t omd membrane performance lower capex is required in t omd a detailed illustration can be found in table 2 based on the obtained data in fig 4 we assume that the low salinity solution concentration is always maintained at a low level with the continuous dilution of the high salinity solution thus the average water fluxes in fo and t omd can be calculated to 6 81 μm s and 17 66 μm s when the high salinity solution concentration ranges from 4 0 m to 1 0 m accordingly the calculated β value is 0 39 compared with limiting β value for less t omd capex it can be found that t omd is less competitive with fo when the membrane area is less than 1000 m2 but t omd can be viewed as an alternative method for agricultural fertigation when the membrane area is larger than 10 000 m2 under this condition the economic advantage of omd to fo is less sensitive to the membrane price 3 2 2 thermal source is not easily accessible as illustrated in fig 3 both fo and t omd processes are sensitive to the operating temperature but the latter is more sensitive thus when the heated fs source was not easily accessible it is unfair to set the same operating temperature configuration for these two processes in this case the solar energy was used as the thermal source due to its widespread and renewable feature and one economic model related to the solar linear fresnel collectors lfc was applied to evaluate the cost to heat the fs which had been intensively discussed in our previous study 52 and not be shown in this work in addition the difference of economic benefit between t omd and fo should lie in the membrane consumption under the same ds dilution factor which can also refer to our previous work 53 taken together the difference in the leveraged cost of water production lcow m3 between t omd and fo can be expressed by the sum of changes in the thermal cost and the membrane cost it should be noted that lcow 0 means that t omd is more cost effective than fo 9 lcow lcow therm lcow mem in this equation the change in the thermal cost lcow therm m3 and the membrane cost lcow mem m3 can be expressed by the following equations respectively 10 lcow therm capex therm opex therm wt q p 11 lcow mem capex mem opex mem wt q p where the extended equations and corresponding excel spreadsheets for capex therm capex mem and opex therm opex mem can be found in our previous studies 53 54 and wt and q p represent the work time 8400 h yr and the permeate flux m3 h respectively according to eqs 9 to 11 and obtained data in fig 4 the dependence of lcow on the dilution factor and the permeate flux is illustrated in table 3 it can be found that the lower dilution factor and higher permeate flux are conducive to achieving lower lcow therm and lcow mem thereby rendering negative lcow and validating that t omd heated by solar energy is an alternative method for fo in agricultural fertigation it should be noted that if the price of fo membranes becomes lower than 100 m2 the lower dilution factor and the higher permeate flux are required to achieve the economic advantage of t omd compared to fo under the current situation limited by the membrane performance 4 conclusions in this study we first applied t omd in agricultural fertigation and compare its techno economic benefit with fo the main conclusions can be drawn as the followings 1 experimental investigations revealed that compared with fo t omd applied in the agricultural fertigation can be endowed with quadruple advantages 1 high water flux at one high temperature difference 40 c 2 low fertilizer loss 3 good compatibility for different fertilizers and 4 good feasibility to utilize some unconventional waters i e wastewater seawater and seawater ro brine 2 a preliminary economic analysis showed that the economic feasibility of t omd was strongly dependent on the membrane area and the price of the fo membrane module for the same operating temperature configuration when the membrane area is larger than 10 000 m2 t omd must be economic than fo for the different operating temperature configurations lower dilution factor 0 25 and higher permeate flux 10 000 m3 h are preferable to apply t omd in agricultural fertigation 3 based on the experimental investigation and economic analysis t omd can provide an alternative pathway to achieve high efficient and cost effective agricultural fertigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare

13341,forward osmosis fo as one energy efficient desalination technology had been intensively studied in agricultural fertilization to meet the demand of the water resource and the fertilizer for plant growth showing good techno economic benefit as such the energy efficient temperature enhanced osmotic membrane distillation t omd heated by low grade thermal sources i e solar energy was firstly investigated in agricultural fertilization via techno economic comparison with fo the experimental investigation revealed that t omd in the agricultural fertigation can be endowed with quadruple advantages of high water flux at a high temperature difference 40 c low fertilizer loss good compatibility for different fertilizers and good feasibility to utilize some unconventional waters i e wastewater seawater and seawater ro brine furthermore a preliminary economic analysis showed that the membrane area and the price of the fo membrane module are two significant indicators to evaluate the economic feasibility of t omd in detail t omd must be more cost effective than fo if the total membrane area is larger than 10 000 m2 under the same operating temperature configuration or dilution factor lower than 0 25 and permeate flux higher than 10 000 m3 h are satisfied under different operating temperature configurations based on the experimental investigation and economic analysis t omd can provide an alternative pathway to achieve high efficient and cost effective agricultural fertigation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords temperature enhanced osmotic membrane distillation forward osmosis agricultural fertigation techno economic analysis 1 introduction water security for agricultural irrigation has become one of the grand challenges for the sustainable development of human society around 72 of the total global freshwater 3100 billion m3 had been used for agricultural irrigation and the gap between the supply and demand will become larger under unconfined control conditions 1 what s worse for the irrigation waters is that the freshwater scarcity has threatened agricultural sustainability 2 3 and is further aggravated by the water pollution resulting from the fast developing urbanization and industrialization 4 therefore it is of significance to high efficiently and cost effectively expand the water resources used for agricultural irrigation 5 7 desalination as one advanced technology to efficiently use seawater has been widely used for the freshwater supply 8 13 considering that the cost of desalted water is still 3 5 times higher than that of natural freshwater 14 some conventional energy intensive desalination technologies i e reverse osmosis are uneconomic for the low valued and large scale application of the fresh water in agricultural irrigation 15 16 in another word the high efficient and cost effective desalination technologies are urgent in the context of the global water energy crisis osmotic membrane distillation omd as one low energy membrane based technology has been developed as early as the 1960s 17 as one variant of membrane distillation md the driving force of omd is also the vapor pressure difference across the porous hydrophobic membrane whereas in the case of omd both temperature concentration differences induces a more significant difference in vapor pressure gradient compared to a single temperature difference in md 18 20 given that the utilization potential of low grade thermal power and the natural vapor transport driven by the concentration difference omd can be commonly labeled with the low energy consumption in the conventional omd process the temperature difference is not higher than 20 c thus omd has been proposed and intensively investigated in the concentration of fruit juices and other heat sensitive liquids 21 27 such a slight temperature difference determines the low flux performance that the water fluxes are usually lower than 7 2 lmh or 2 0 μm s in these applications 20 if the feed waters can be treated at a higher operation temperature the water flux will be enhanced because of the increased driving force from the higher temperature difference based on such consideration one temperature enhanced osmotic membrane distillation t omd was proposed to utilize the low grade thermal source and high tolerable temperature of the seawater highlighting the potential of t omd to high efficiently extract the freshwater from the seawater or other saline waters for low energy and high efficient agricultural irrigation however in omd and t omd processes the feed solution fs or low salinity feed stream needs to be concentrated and the osmotic agent or the draw solution ds needs to be diluted as a consequence the freshwater is obtained by regenerating the ds while consuming massive energy in the context of agricultural irrigation the concept of direct fertigation by using fertilizer as the ds has been proposed and intensively studied in the forward osmosis fo process 16 28 41 where the diluted fertilizer solution can be directly used for fertigation thereby eliminating the worry about additional energy consumption in the ds regeneration similar to omd fo is also a cost effective desalination technology in this scenario and is operated in the same operation mode where different salinity solutions across the membrane enter into membrane module and then diluted and concentrated solutions are directly utilized refer to fig 1 however experimental results in fo based systems revealed that the water quality of product water diluted ds could meet the fertigation standard while the reverse diffusion of fertilizer solutes failed the low salinity feed stream to meet the effluent discharge standard 40 based on such situation the omd packed with the non wetted porous hydrophobic membrane can reject 100 salt from the low salinity feed stream while ensuring high efficient utilization of fertilizer however to the best of our knowledge there is no comprehensive study to investigate the techno economic feasibility of omd in agricultural fertigation and compare its membrane performance and economic cost with fo herein for the first time we investigated the techno economic feasibility of the t omd process in agricultural fertigation in this study we selected two representative commercial t omd and fo membranes porous hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene t omd membrane and newly developed polyamide thin film composite fo membrane in the technical investigations the flux performances of the t omd membrane were intensively

0 01 m nacl solution 0 60 m nacl solution and 1 20 m nacl solution and four different fertilizer contained solutions kcl nh4cl kh2po4 and urea these fluxes were partly compared with the ones of the fo membrane to illuminate the favorable conditions of t omd in superior membrane performance for agricultural fertigation furthermore based on experimental results a preliminary economic analysis was conducted to illuminate the favorable conditions and identify the key factors of t omd in reducing capital expenditure 2 materials and methods 2 1 membranes fo membrane commercial flat sheet tfc fo

hydrophobic ptfe membranes were supplied by shengju environmental science and technology company limited hangzhou zhejiang china the nominal pore size and thickness of the ptfe membrane are 1 and 40 μm all membrane samples were stored at 4 c before any experiments 2 2 feed and draw solutions low salinity solutions in the feed or hot side ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm resistance was obtained from a millipore water purification system 0 01 m 0 60 m and 1 20 m nacl solutions represent osmotic pressures comparable to those of the municipal wastewater the seawater and the seawater reverse osmosis brine respectively high salinity solutions in the permeate or cold side 1 0 4 0 m kcl solution 3 0 m nh4cl solution 3 0 m kh2po4 solution and 3 0 m urea solution were prepared for different fertilizer solutions in the agricultural fertigation it is noted that the osmolalities of different fertilizer contained solutions were measured using a cryoscopic osmometer fposm v2 0 neuronbc with a measurement range of 0 3000 mosmoles kg and the measurement resolution of 1 mosmoles kg limited by the measurement range of the osmometer the osmolality of 1 0 m solution was measured in our work 2 3 experimental omd and fo setup performances of tfc fo membranes and t omd ptfe membranes were measured in a lab scale fo or t omd experimental system as shown schematically in fig 2 the cross flow

temperature difference on membrane performance in fo and t omd the temperature difference is the direct driving force in t omd and is responsible for the evolution of the membrane performance in fo moreover the key to membrane based technologies in agricultural fertigation is to ensure high permeate flux and low fertilizer loss based on such fig 3 illustrates the effect of the temperature difference on the water flux reverse water flux and specific reverse solute flux in t omd and fo for water flux in fig 3 a both water fluxes in t omd and fo increase with the increase of the temperature difference while the temperature induced water flux increments are different in these two processes in detail when the temperature difference is lower than 40 c fo is superior to t omd and the surplus is largest at the isothermal condition however when the temperature difference is larger than 40 c the water flux in t omd becomes larger than the one in fo and approaches three times at

driving force in t omd increased by 936 when the temperature of pure water just increased from 20 c to 50 c detailed calculation can refer to appendix a low reverse solute flux is of significance to reduce the loss from the leakage of fertilizer contained ds solution thus reducing the operating cost even though omd can theoretically reject 100 salt from the low salinity feed stream the partial or extremely slight wetting of porous hydrophobic membranes is still inevitable which can be validated for the desalination rate not 100 in md and omd experiments due to the infinitely low solute leakage the concentration of k in the feed side was measured not by the traditional detecting instrument but by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes icap7200 thermo fisher usa as illustrated in fig 3 b reverse solute fluxes in t omd and fo increase with increased temperature differences for fo higher operating temperature resulted in a higher solute permeability coefficient thereby rendering higher reverse solute flux 43 for t omd and non volatile kcl fertilizer reverse k flux resulted from the partial wetting related to a higher tendency of salt crystallization at a higher operating temperature 44 unlike the evolution of water flux the increment of the reverse solute flux in fo is far larger than the one in t omd for instance when the temperature difference varies from 20 c to 60 c the reverse solute flux in fo increases from 22 67 gmh to 55 00 gmh while the reverse solute flux in t omd increases from 0 43 gmh to 4 62 gmh it should be noted that the presence of the reverse solute flux in t omd does not mean to the membrane wetting according to eq 3 4 62 gmh of maximum reverse solute flux in t omd is equivalent to 99 9957 99 9 of salt rejection showing superior salt rejection as reported in previous studies 45 46 the reverse solute flux in t omd at the highest temperature difference is far less than the ones in fo such result suggests that less leakage of fertilizer is achieved in t omd confirming the advantage of t omd in rejecting the salt importantly the specific reverse solute flux abbreviated as srsf is a key parameter to evaluate the membrane perm selectivity as illustrated in fig 3 c we can find that all srsfs in t omd are less than the ones in fo for instance the srsf in t omd is not larger than 0 04 g l however the srsf in fo is not lower than 0 69 g l in this case the membrane perm selectivity in t omd is superior to the one in fo taken together the high temperature difference 40 c ensures high water flux and high perm selectivity in t omd thereby rendering the marked advantage of t omd in agricultural fertigation based on such consideration the temperature difference is maintained at 40 c in the following sections 3 1 2 effect of solution concentration on membrane performance in fo and t omd the driving force in both t omd and fo processes can be enhanced by the solution concentration difference across the membrane thus the solution concentration at the high salinity side can affect the water flux in t omd and fo fig 4 illustrates the evolution of water fluxes in t omd and fo at different high salinity solution concentrations with the decrease of high salinity solution concentration the water flux in fo decreased significantly but the water flux in t omd decreased slightly for example when the ds concentration decreased from 4 m to 1 m the water flux in fo decreased from 9 58 μm s to 4 03 μm s by 57 93 and the water flux in omd decreased from 17 72 μm s to 17 60 μm s by 0 68 this is because that the driving force in fo is directly and strongly related to the solution concentration jw airt c but the one in t omd is weakly affected by the solution concentration appendix a such results confirmed the advantage of t omd in the water flux at a high temperature difference 40 c and a wide range of high salinity solution concentrations 1 4 m kcl solution also the low salinity solution concentration affects the membrane flux in t omd because of the close interrelation between the vapor pressure and the solution concentration or the molar fraction of pure solvent on the hot side as illustrated in fig 5 when the low salinity solution was replaced by higher concentrations of nacl solution the water flux in t omd slightly decreased from 17 68 μm s to 16 07 μm s by 9 11 at this point the water flux in t omd is less susceptible to the low salinity solution concentration than the high salinity solution concentration besides once the ultrapure water was replaced by a higher concentration of nacl solution in fo the water fluxes in these cases must be far lower than the one in the case where the ultrapure water was used as the low salinity solution thus the maximum water flux of the applied tfc membrane in fo is 9 67 μm s under current conditions compare with the water fluxes of applied ptfe membrane in t omd we can find that the minimum water flux in t omd is still higher than the maximum one in fo which suggests that these low salinity solutions i e wastewater seawater and seawater ro brine are more suitable to be treated or recovered by t omd than by fo therefore t omd has a great potential to utilize some conventional waters to supplement the supply of agriculture irrigation 3 1 3 effect of fertilizer type on membrane performance in fo and t omd the fertilizers used in agricultural fertigation need various types to meet the requirement of the crop growth for nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k therefore the effect of three common inorganic fertilizers kcl nh4cl and kh2po4 and one common organic fertilizer urea on the water flux in t omd is illustrated in fig 6 the water fluxes for these four fertilizers are approximately equal to 18 μm s which suggests that t omd is less susceptible to the type of fertilizers this is not inconsistent with the conclusion in fo that kcl is reported to produce higher flux than other inorganic draw solutions and urea is found to have low water flux and high reverse solute flux 47 in fo the same molar concentration for inorganic fertilizers does not mean the same osmotic pressure and the urea does not form charged species in water for example the osmolalities of 1 0 m kcl solution 1 0 m nh4cl solution and 1 0 m kh2po4 solution are 1986 mosmoles kg 1978 mosmoles kg and 1704 mosmoles kg a close observation shows that the osmolalities of nh4cl and kh2po4 solutions deviate from the one of kcl by 0 40 and 14 20 moreover the presence of internal concentration polarization icp in fo enables the fertilizer type to play a significant role in determining the water flux 16 in other words the fertilizer with a large molecular weight is inclined to suffer from more severe icp due to the inverse proportion between the solute diffusion and molecular weight 48 taken together the water flux in fo is strongly related to the type of fertilizer conversely in t omd the same molar concentration cannot induce a significant difference in the molar fraction of pure solvent for example the molar fractions of pure water in 3 m kcl 3 m nh4cl 3 m kh2po4 and 3 m urea are 94 53 93 98 91 64 and 93 81 respectively accordingly the vapor pressures for these four fertilizer contained solutions are approximately equal such a slight difference between the vapor pressures is corresponding to the evolution of water fluxes with the fertilizer type in t omd therefore the water flux in t omd is not sensitive to the fertilizer type but the reverse solute flux in t omd is more sensitive to the fertilizer type as illustrated in table 1 it can be found that reverse nh4cl and urea fluxes and corresponding srsfs are larger than the other two fertilizers which can be attributed to the volatile feature of nh4cl and urea such result implies that the volatile fertilizer is easy to leak compared to other temperature insensitive fertilizers even though higher solute loss operated in t omd can be found for these temperature sensitive fertilizers their leakage is far lower than the one in fo for instance when kcl was used as the fertilizer the ratio of the srsf in omd to the one in fo denoted as rsrsf is 0 87 for the urea and nh4cl both rsrsf are still lower than 2 92 resulting from lower perm selectivity performance for urea and nh4cl in fo however one relatively high rsrsf value 8 37 for kh2po4 was observed but it is still lower and lower than 100 therefore omd can reduce fertilizer loss compared to fo besides increasing the salinity of the low salinity solution has been demonstrated to be responsible for the reduced water flux when the kcl solution is used as the high salinity solution fig 7 the same situation can be found in the other three fertilizer contained solutions such result suggests that t omd can be used to dilute different fertilizer contained solutions to the agriculture fertigation and simultaneous water recycling all in all experimental results showed that t omd applied in the agricultural fertigation can be endowed with quadruple advantages 1 high water flux at a high temperature difference 40 c 2 low fertilizer loss 3 good compatibility for different fertilizers and 4 good feasibility to utilize some unconventional waters i e wastewater seawater and seawater ro brine but t omd as a variant of md also suffers from membrane wetting thus mitigating the membrane wetting is critical to ensure high perm selectivity performance and long term operation stability in t omd 3 2 economic comparison between t omd and fo in agricultural fertigation 3 2 1 thermal source is easily accessible when the thermal source or the heated fs source is easily accessible or has become one prerequisite condition the same thermal energy input can be used to enhance the membrane performances in t omd and fo processes without economic consideration under these limited conditions the economic comparison between these two processes can be simplified to compare their capital expenditure in the membrane area to achieve the same objective specific dilution factor for the fertilizer containing ds in this case the membrane area to obtain one specific dilution factor df in both fo and t omd membrane modules can be calculated by 4 a q d 0 df j w where q d 0 is the inlet ds flowrate of t omd or fo membrane module and j w is the average water flux in addition df can be defined as the ratio of the outlet ds flowrate to the inlet ds flowrate when q d 0 and df in fo are the same as those in t omd the ratio of the total area for t omd membrane modules to that for fo membrane modules can be expressed by 5 β a t omd a fo j w fo j w t omd where c d 0 and c d t are the molar concentrations of ds solutions in inlet and outlet membrane modules accordingly the comparison between t omd and fo capital expenditure capex for membrane modules is expressed as the ratio t omd fo capex investment for membrane modules 6 capex t omd m capex fo m p t omd p fo β where p t omd and p fo are the prices of t omd and fo membrane modules the benefit cost ratio analyses for fo based systems in previous literature showed that the fo membrane module cost must be lower than 100 m2 49 meanwhile the target price should approve to 31 m2 50 thus the range for the cost of fo modules is 31 to 100 m2 in this work besides because t omd is a variant of md the prospective module capex of t omd can be estimated by following the cost protocol of the md membrane module 51 7 p omd p omd ref a omd a omd ref m 1 where p omd ref is the reference cost of the ptfe membrane module 175 m2 a omd ref is the reference membrane area 300 m2 and m is the degression coefficient 0 74 referring to eq 4 we can find that p t omd are 128 70 and 39 m2 corresponding to the membrane area multiplied by 10 times from 1000 to 10 000 m2 therefore eq 6 can be rewritten by introducing the prices of membrane modules 8 capex t omd m capex fo m α β taking one case for an example α ranged from 0 39 to 1 28 when the membrane area is 100 00 m2 if less capex t omd m is expected β must be less than 0 78 if less capex fo m is expected β must be larger than 1 28 considering that t omd and fo are similar in the operation mode and the technological process the difference between t omd and fo can be mainly attributed to the capex of the membrane modules therefore once the fo membrane performance is up to 1 28 times higher than t omd lower capex is required in fo meanwhile if the fo membrane performance is less than 0 78 times of t omd membrane performance lower capex is required in t omd a detailed illustration can be found in table 2 based on the obtained data in fig 4 we assume that the low salinity solution concentration is always maintained at a low level with the continuous dilution of the high salinity solution thus the average water fluxes in fo and t omd can be calculated to 6 81 μm s and 17 66 μm s when the high salinity solution concentration ranges from 4 0 m to 1 0 m accordingly the calculated β value is 0 39 compared with limiting β value for less t omd capex it can be found that t omd is less competitive with fo when the membrane area is less than 1000 m2 but t omd can be viewed as an alternative method for agricultural fertigation when the membrane area is larger than 10 000 m2 under this condition the economic advantage of omd to fo is less sensitive to the membrane price 3 2 2 thermal source is not easily accessible as illustrated in fig 3 both fo and t omd processes are sensitive to the operating temperature but the latter is more sensitive thus when the heated fs source was not easily accessible it is unfair to set the same operating temperature configuration for these two processes in this case the solar energy was used as the thermal source due to its widespread and renewable feature and one economic model related to the solar linear fresnel collectors lfc was applied to evaluate the cost to heat the fs which had been intensively discussed in our previous study 52 and not be shown in this work in addition the difference of economic benefit between t omd and fo should lie in the membrane consumption under the same ds dilution factor which can also refer to our previous work 53 taken together the difference in the leveraged cost of water production lcow m3 between t omd and fo can be expressed by the sum of changes in the thermal cost and the membrane cost it should be noted that lcow 0 means that t omd is more cost effective than fo 9 lcow lcow therm lcow mem in this equation the change in the thermal cost lcow therm m3 and the membrane cost lcow mem m3 can be expressed by the following equations respectively 10 lcow therm capex therm opex therm wt q p 11 lcow mem capex mem opex mem wt q p where the extended equations and corresponding excel spreadsheets for capex therm capex mem and opex therm opex mem can be found in our previous studies 53 54 and wt and q p represent the work time 8400 h yr and the permeate flux m3 h respectively according to eqs 9 to 11 and obtained data in fig 4 the dependence of lcow on the dilution factor and the permeate flux is illustrated in table 3 it can be found that the lower dilution factor and higher permeate flux are conducive to achieving lower lcow therm and lcow mem thereby rendering negative lcow and validating that t omd heated by solar energy is an alternative method for fo in agricultural fertigation it should be noted that if the price of fo membranes becomes lower than 100 m2 the lower dilution factor and the higher permeate flux are required to achieve the economic advantage of t omd compared to fo under the current situation limited by the membrane performance 4 conclusions in this study we first applied t omd in agricultural fertigation and compare its techno economic benefit with fo the main conclusions can be drawn as the followings 1 experimental investigations revealed that compared with fo t omd applied in the agricultural fertigation can be endowed with quadruple advantages 1 high water flux at one high temperature difference 40 c 2 low fertilizer loss 3 good compatibility for different fertilizers and 4 good feasibility to utilize some unconventional waters i e wastewater seawater and seawater ro brine 2 a preliminary economic analysis showed that the economic feasibility of t omd was strongly dependent on the membrane area and the price of the fo membrane module for the same operating temperature configuration when the membrane area is larger than 10 000 m2 t omd must be economic than fo for the different operating temperature configurations lower dilution factor 0 25 and higher permeate flux 10 000 m3 h are preferable to apply t omd in agricultural fertigation 3 based on the experimental investigation and economic analysis t omd can provide an alternative pathway to achieve high efficient and cost effective agricultural fertigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare

13342,the major problems encountered in conventional biological treatment are the microbial cultures were insensitive to degrade the refractory organics in wastewater the biological treatment system must contain robust microbial consortia to adapt the environment and to treat the refractory organics in wastewater in the present investigation the efficient microbial consortium was isolated and immobilized onto carbon silica matrix csm at the density of 3 31 0 2 107 cells gm 1 of csm and the same was used in the fluidized reactor to remove the refractory organics in wastewater the bacterial cell immobilized fluidized reactor cifr exhibited the performance that codtot and coddis were removed by 43 2 8 and 42 3 3 respectively in 24 h under batch mode of operation the mineralization of refractory organics from wastewater under batch study was confirmed using uv visible and ft ir spectroscopic studies the codtot and coddis were removed by 43 8 4 and 50 8 4 respectively with remaining

contains a significant concentration of refractory organic compounds and hazardous pollutants 1 rechroming neutralization retanning fat liquoring and dying are the major unit operations followed in post tanning operations 2 during retanning fat liquoring and dying process the application of syntan synthetic phenolic poly phenolic compounds sulphated sulphited phosphated oils and amino phenol formaldehyde resins acrylic resins vegetable tannins black acid dyes and fixing agents are in practice to impart softness to the finished leather 3 4 the fine chemicals used in the post tanning operations are not completely exhausted by the raw materials skins hides and remain as unspent chemical compounds in the discharged effluent the rechroming unit operation results with trivalent chromium uptake by 50 70 from the input chemicals and the rest of trivalent chromium coordinated with the unspent chelating chemicals to form complex compounds in the discharged effluent 5 the bio refractory group of chemicals in the post tanning wastewater are derived mainly from sulphonated phenolic compounds acrylic resins long chain aliphatic compounds and condensed syntans of phenol naphthalene formaldehyde melamine sulphonated mono di tri cyclic aromatic compounds aliphatic alicyclic compounds and di azo compounds 6 9 the treatment configuration followed in conventional effluent treatment plant common effluent treatment plant etp cetp consists of primary treatment physic chemical secondary biological treatment and tertiary treatment membrane separation process including nano filtration and reverse osmosis ro for the removal of multivalent divalent mono valent salts the conventional secondary biological treatment doesn t remove the refractory organics and most of the refractory organic compounds remain in the wastewater without removal however the chemical structure geometry of them are altered 1 the pilot scale studies carried out by suthanthararajan et al 10 reported that membrane fouling or failure of ro system as major drawbacks encountered with the treated post tanning wastewater attributed to the presence of residual bio refractory organics such as unspent chromophoretic compounds long chain chemical surfactants high molecular weight condensed resins transition metal ion complexed aromatic aliphatic organic compounds in the treated tannery effluent 10 11 bharagava et al 12 identified the refractory organics such as benzyl chloride butyl octyl phthalate 2 6 dihydroxybenzoic acid 3tms dibutyl phthalate benzyl alcohol benzyl butyl phthalate 4 chloro 3 methyl phenol phthalic acid 2 6 dihydroxyacetophenone diisobutyl phthalate 4 biphenyltrimethylsiloxane di 2ethy hexyl phthalate 1 2 benzenedicarboxylic acid dibenzyl phthalate and nonylphenol in the secondary treated tannery wastewater using gc ms analysis the high concentration of refractory organic compounds with low biodegradability is highly toxic and inhibitory to microbial activity and led to fluctuating performance of etp cetp 13 the removal of refractory organic compounds present in the secondary biological treated tannery wastewater was attempted by many researchers using wet air oxidation adsorption ozonation fenton oxidation process electrochemical oxidation photo catalytic oxidation ultra sonication and heterogeneous fenton oxidation processes 1 8 14 17 researchers attempted the advanced oxidation process aops coupled with biological treatment to induce the complete mineralization or to improve the elimination of refractory organic compounds in the treated wastewater 11 18 19 despite aops have been reported with various advantages over conventional treatment processes the high chemical usage and operational cost limited industries to implement the process 13 hence the cost effective method for the removal of refractory organics in secondary biological treated post tanning wastewater was envisaged the major problems encountered in conventional biological methods to remove refractory organics in wastewater were the ineffective degradation of refractory organic compounds in wastewater by the conventional microbial cultures 20 21 hence the biological treatment system must contain effective microbial consortium to adapt to the environment and moreover appropriate operating conditions are required to degrade the refractory organics the removal of refractory organic compounds from the primary treated post tanning wastewater was associated with the disadvantages such as excess biomass production loss of biomass and shock to high organic loads 18 saxena et al 22 developed a new bacterial consortium for the treatment of tannery wastewater and revealed that the toxicity of treated water was significantly reduced allowing the 70 germination of seeds researchers also developed attached growth reactors to increase the treatment efficiency by overcoming the problems encountered in suspended growth system 5 23 24 furthermore there has been a growing environmental concern regarding the release of various refractory organics in treated wastewater which do not degrade during secondary biological treatment at etp cetp it was suggested that the conventional etp cetp requires to be modified with additional unit operations to eliminate refractory organics before entering the membrane separation process to refine the feed quality in order to increase the life of the membrane system to decrease the organic load in ro reject stream and thereof for the reduction in cost of treatment in evaporator system 11 the development of efficient biological treatment process with bacterial cell immobilized reactors for the refractory wastewater treatment advances the achieving zld with minimum cost to date there are very limited details available showcasing the use of bacterial consortium to remove refractory organics in tannery wastewater therefore the present investigation was focused on the development of new effective microbial consortia for the removal of refractory organics in biologically treated post tanning wastewater preparation of suitable carrier matrix for the immobilization of microbial consortium optimization of operating conditions for the bacterial cell immobilized fluidized reactor cifr under batch mode and continuous mode for the treatment of refractory organics evaluation of microbial community structures responsible for the mineralization of refractory organics in biologically treated post tanning wastewater are the important aspects of this investigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection the secondary biological treated post tanning wastewater was collected from a cetp chennai the wastewater was characterized for ph orp and total chemical oxygen demand codtot in accordance with the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 25 the wastewater was filtered using whatman filter paper 0 45 μ and the filtrate was analysed for dissolved cod coddis 2 2 mother culture preparation the bacterial mother culture used in the present investigation was isolated from soil sites contaminated with post tanning wastewater the isolated mother culture was cultivated using refractory organics containing secondary biological treated post tanning wastewater rocptww diluted with the minimal media composition of the minimal media is presented in section s1 in supplementary files the proportion of rocptww in the diluted mixture was increased once in every two days to facilitate the acclimatization of culture with the refractory organics 2 3 preparation of carbon silica matrix the carbon silica matrix csm was prepared from the agriculture solid waste rice husk in two stages such as carbonization at 400 c and followed by chemical activation at 800 c using phosphoric acid merck methods as explained by swarnalatha et al 26 2 4 immobilization of bacterial strains onto csm the active mother culture in the logarithmic phase with pre determined concentration was developed in a conical flask the batch immobilization studies were carried out with csm at a constant temperature maintained with a thermostat in a shaking incubator at 180 rpm the samples were collected at regular interval of time and the csm was separated from the cell suspension by filtration using stainless wire mesh the optical density of the filtrate was measured at λmax 600 nm using uv visible spectrophotometer the microbial cell density was calculated from the calibration graph relating cell density and optical density the number of cells immobilized per gram of csm was calculated from the concentration of cells before and after immobilization in csm 23 1 x m q cells g 1 c 0 c t v m where c0 initial microbial cell concentration cells

microbial cells onto csm at different time interval was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy sem 2 5 reactor design and operation the schematic view of cifr is presented in fig 1 the reactor was designed and fabricated using transparent acrylic sheet with dimensions length 11 5 cm width 11 5 cm and height 30 cm the treated wastewater was collected from the reactor using a perforated tube placed at 26 cm from the bottom of the reactor the gas liquid solid separator was provided in the reactor at 18 cm from the bottom of the reactor to separate the gas liquid and carrier matrix the reactor was fabricated with the v shaped hopper at the bottom of the reactor to facilitate the settling of carrier matrix and to ease the fluidization of it the cifr was operated continuously with efficient working volume of 2 5 l 2 6 microbial community analysis the total microbial community in the cifr was analysed to find the type of organism and distribution of organisms for the degradation of refractory organics in rocptww the total genomic dna of the microbial colonies in csm were collected from cifr at the end of the experiment and extracted by using ultra clean soil dna isolation kit mol bio the 16s ribosomal rna gene targeted amplification was carried out using pcr forward primer 27f 5 agagtttgatcmtggctcag 3 and the reverse primer 1492r 5 tacggytaccttgttacgactt 3 approximately5 μl of template dna was used in the pcr amplification in a reaction mixture 25 μl the amplicons obtained from the pcr were purified using montage pcr clean up kit to remove unincorporated pcr primers and dntps the quality and quantity of pcr product was analysed using qubit fluorometer 3 0 the aligned sequences were checked and classified into operational taxonomic units otus with in a 0 03 difference 97 similarity 2 7 instrumental analysis the sem investigation for csm and microbial consortium immobilized csm were analysed using leo jeo with magnification of 2500 10 000 the uv visible spectroscopic studies were carried out for the initial and treated rocptww at different time interval at λ200 800 nm using uv visible spectrophotometer cary varion agilent technologies the functional groups of refractory organics in ptww before and after the treatment was studied using znse cell for liquid sample ft ir analyser perkin elmer in the spectral range of 4000 545 cm 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 immobilization of microbial consortium onto csm the effect of contact time on immobilization of bacterial consortium onto csm was determined and is shown in fig s1 the figure illustrates that the immobilization of bacterial consortium onto csm attained equilibrium after the contact time of 7 h and it was found to be 3 31 0 2 107 cells gm 1 of csm the initial linear portion of the curve increased up to a certain qmax value and then it reached the plateau value after the lapse of contact time 7 h the linear portion of the curve could be attributed to the migration of bacterial cells from the bulk cell suspension to the pores and surface of the csm the nonlinear portion of the curve corresponds to diffusion of cells in the pores the plateau portion of the curve corresponds to anchoring or condensation of microbial cells onto active sites in the walls of the pores and onto the surface of csm 23 24 3 2 sem edx studies the fig 2a shows the sem micrograph of csm the presence of volume of pore structures in the csm shows the suitability of csm as a carrier matrix for the immobilization of microorganisms fig 2b f show the sem micrograph of bacterial cells immobilized onto csm at different contact time the prepare csm was characterized for both macro and micro pores the bacteria penetrates inside the tubular structure of pores of the csm and occupies the mouth of pores the csm surface shows the enhanced texture and little rougher so the bacterial attachment efficacy increased and consortia adhered for a longer time the fig 2b f clearly illustrates the immobilization and proliferation of bacterial cells bacilli and cocci in the pores of csm the energy dispersive x ray edx spectrum of csm is shown in table s1 supplementary materials and it confirms that carbon and silicon are the major constituent elements of the matrix 3 3 bet analysis the porous frame works such as surface area pore diameter and pore volume of csm are established from surface area measurements using the bet surface area analyzer and shown in table s2 supplementary materials the surface area of csm was calculated from nitrogen adsorption isotherms by assuming the area of nitrogen molecule 0 162 nm2 the surface area pore volume and pore diameter of csm are found to be 280 21 m2 g 1 0 142450 cm3 g 1g and 33 457 å respectively 3 4 treatment of wastewater 3 4 1 effect of mass of csm the codtot removal efficiency of cifr at different mass of csm 5 g l 10 g l 20 g l 30 g l 40 g l and 50 g l is illustrated in fig 3 and control refers to the experiment without csm but only with wastewater the results indicate that operation at hrt 24 h was optimum for the removal of codtot for all the matrix quantities studied the codtot was removed by 20 1 6 with residual codtot of 1000 26 mg l for 5 g l of csm by 26 2 2 with residual codtot of 930 26 mg l for 10 g l of csm by 32 2 with residual codtot of 850 24 mg l for 20 g l of csm by 41 2 2 with residual codtot of 740 20 mg l for 30 g l of csm by 45 2 2 with residual codtot of 690 24 mg l for 40 g l of csm and by 48 2 with residual codtot of 648 24 mg l for 50 g l of csm the results suggests that that the codtot removal efficiency of reactor increased with the mass of csm up to 30 g l and thereafter codtot removal efficiency was not increased significantly with the increase in mass of csm up to 50 g l 3 4 2 performance of cifr under batch mode operation the cifr was operated at different hrts 3 h 6 h 9 h 12 h 24 h 36 h and 48 h under batch mode with 30 g l of csm the results obtained in the batch experiments are presented in table 1 the codtot and coddis removal were found to be optimum at 24 h hrt and after it attained the saturation fig 4 the codtot removal was 43 2 8 with residual codtot of 666 75 mg l from the influent codtot of 1181 98 mg l the coddis removal was 42 3 3 with residual coddis of 600 62 mg l from the influent coddis of 1044 79 mg l the ph of the wastewater gradually increased from 7 23 0 05 to 7 57 0 07 at hrt 24 h the increase in ph indicates the utilization of protons from the aqueous medium the sequential steps involved are the formation of hydrogen peroxide from molecular oxygen and proton which again converted into hydroxide ion and hydroxyl radical the refractory organic compounds in wastewater develop hydrophobicity due to bulky groups and also due to aromatic and aliphatic groups the electronic structure of the hydroxide is characterized by a cloud of electron density around the oh axis on the oxygen side to which different numbers of water molecules trimer tetramer pentamer are bonded this increase in hydration density solubilises the refractory organic compounds into the cluster the hydrated refractory organics may be oriented towards the extracellular polymer of the bacteria enabling it to undergo enzymatic hydrolysis the removal of organics by biological oxidation was further confirmed by increase in orp of the wastewater from 143 21 mv to 70 17 mv 3 4 3 kinetic study the kinetic studies on the removal of pollutants in terms of codtot were performed for the treatment of rocptww using pseudo first and second order kinetic equations eqs 2 3 2 ln c t c 0 k 1 t 3 1 c t 1 c 0 k 2 t where c 0 is the initial concentration of cod in the rocptww c t is the concentration cod in the rocptww at time t time in hours k1 1 h and k2 l mg h are the pseudo first order and second order rate constants respectively table 2 presents the pseudo first and second order constants k1 k2 and r2 values at different mass of csm for the removal of cod the effect of mass of bacterial cell immobilized matrix from 5 g l to 50 g l was studied the best obeying order of reaction was identified based on the regression coefficient and it was found to be high for the pseudo second order model the optimum regression coefficient value 0 9911 was found at 30 g l bacterial cell immobilized matrix mass hence the degradation of refractory organics in post tanning wastewater followed pseudo second order kinetic model 3 4 4 instrumental confirmation for the removal of refractory organics from wastewater under batch study the uv visible spectra of wastewater before and after treatment using cifr at different time intervals are shown in fig 5 the spectrum of initial wastewater contains the strong absorption peaks in the range from λ200nm to λ240nm and λ270nm to λ300nm the peaks observed in the range from λ200nmto λ240nm may be attributed to the π π transition in chromophoretic compounds and the peaks observed in the range from λ270nm to λ300nm corresponds to π π transition in phenolic syntan compounds 9 27 in leather processing phenolic syntans are added to fix the chromium iii with collagen fibres without any dislodgement and diazo dyes are added to impart the desired tone to the finished leather fig 6 shows the ft ir spectra of the wastewater before and after the treatment in cifr at different time intervals the ft ir spectrum of initial wastewater shows strong peaks at 1634 cm 1 and 1537 cm 1 and they confirmed the presence of azo n n group 28 the presence of strong intense peak at 3349 cm 1 may be attributed to the oh group in the phenolic syntan the peaks found at 613 cm 1 and 870 cm 1 may be attributed to c s stretching of benzene ring in syntans sulphonated phenolic ring the low intense peaks at 2895 cm 1 and 2821 cm 1 are due to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching of methylene group in phenolic syntan the peaks observed at 1423 cm 1 and 1634 cm 1 confirm the aromatic skeleton present in azo dyes and syntans the c o stretching frequency of para substituted phenolic compounds are observed at 764 cm 1 and 1220 cm 1 29 fig 5b shows the decrease in intensity of peaks at λ200nm to λ240nm was observed for the increase in hydraulic retention time from 3 h to 48 h this may be due to degradation of diazo dye compounds in the rocptww 1 27 the ft ir spectra of treated wastewater at hrt 3 h and 6 h show the absence of peak at 1506 cm 1 this may be due to degradation of dye compound the formation of low intensity peak at 2325 cm 1 in the wastewater sample resulted for hrt of 3 h and 6 h reaction time

slight increase in the ts from 5147 151 mg l to 5200 163 mg l and tds from 5105 153 mg l to 5171 160 might correspond to increase in the mineralized organic compounds in the wastewater this is in agreement with the earlier reports of aops for the removal of refractory organics in wastewater also recorded very less cod removal 13 30 karthikeyan et al 1 reported the maximum cod removal by 77

13342,the major problems encountered in conventional biological treatment are the microbial cultures were insensitive to degrade the refractory organics in wastewater the biological treatment system must contain robust microbial consortia to adapt the environment and to treat the refractory organics in wastewater in the present investigation the efficient microbial consortium was isolated and immobilized onto carbon silica matrix csm at the density of 3 31 0 2 107 cells gm 1 of csm and the same was used in the fluidized reactor to remove the refractory organics in wastewater the bacterial

wastewater keywords bacterial cell immobilized bioreactor post tanning wastewater refractory organics microbial consortium proteobacteria 1 introduction the wastewater generated from leather industry contains a significant concentration of refractory organic compounds and hazardous pollutants 1 rechroming neutralization retanning fat liquoring and dying are the major unit operations followed in post tanning operations 2 during retanning fat liquoring and dying process the application of syntan synthetic phenolic poly phenolic compounds sulphated sulphited phosphated oils and amino phenol formaldehyde resins acrylic resins vegetable tannins black acid dyes and fixing agents are in practice to impart softness to the finished leather 3 4 the fine chemicals used in the post tanning operations are not completely exhausted by the raw materials skins hides and remain as unspent chemical compounds in the discharged effluent the rechroming unit operation results with trivalent chromium uptake by 50 70 from the input chemicals and the rest of trivalent chromium coordinated with the unspent chelating chemicals to form complex compounds in the discharged effluent 5 the bio refractory group of chemicals in the post tanning wastewater are derived mainly from sulphonated phenolic compounds acrylic resins long chain aliphatic compounds and condensed syntans of phenol naphthalene formaldehyde melamine sulphonated mono di tri cyclic aromatic compounds aliphatic alicyclic compounds and di azo compounds 6 9 the treatment configuration followed in conventional effluent treatment plant common effluent treatment plant etp cetp consists of primary treatment physic chemical secondary biological treatment and tertiary treatment membrane separation process including nano filtration and reverse osmosis ro for the removal of multivalent divalent mono valent salts the conventional secondary biological treatment doesn t remove the refractory organics and most of the refractory organic compounds remain in the wastewater without removal however the chemical structure geometry of them are altered 1 the pilot scale studies carried out by suthanthararajan et al 10 reported that membrane fouling or failure of ro system as major drawbacks encountered with the treated post tanning wastewater attributed to the presence of residual bio refractory organics such as unspent chromophoretic compounds long chain chemical surfactants high molecular weight condensed resins transition metal ion complexed aromatic aliphatic organic compounds in the treated tannery effluent 10 11 bharagava et al 12 identified the refractory organics such as benzyl chloride butyl octyl phthalate 2 6 dihydroxybenzoic acid 3tms dibutyl phthalate benzyl alcohol benzyl butyl phthalate 4 chloro 3 methyl phenol phthalic acid 2 6 dihydroxyacetophenone diisobutyl phthalate 4 biphenyltrimethylsiloxane di 2ethy hexyl phthalate 1 2 benzenedicarboxylic acid dibenzyl phthalate and nonylphenol in the secondary treated tannery wastewater using gc ms analysis the high concentration of refractory organic compounds with low biodegradability is highly toxic and inhibitory to microbial activity and led to fluctuating performance of etp cetp 13 the removal of refractory organic compounds present in the secondary biological treated tannery wastewater was attempted by many researchers using wet air oxidation adsorption ozonation fenton oxidation process electrochemical oxidation photo catalytic oxidation ultra sonication and heterogeneous fenton oxidation processes 1 8 14 17 researchers attempted the advanced oxidation process aops coupled with biological treatment to induce the complete mineralization or to improve the elimination of refractory organic compounds in the treated wastewater 11 18 19 despite aops have been reported with various advantages over conventional treatment processes the high chemical usage and operational cost limited industries to implement the process 13 hence the cost effective method for the removal of refractory organics in secondary biological treated post tanning wastewater was envisaged the major problems encountered in conventional biological methods to remove refractory organics in wastewater were the ineffective degradation of refractory organic compounds in wastewater by the conventional microbial cultures 20 21 hence the biological treatment system must contain effective microbial consortium to adapt to the environment and moreover appropriate operating conditions are required to degrade the refractory organics the removal of refractory organic compounds from the primary treated post tanning wastewater was associated with the disadvantages such as excess biomass production loss of biomass and shock to high organic loads 18 saxena et al 22 developed a new bacterial consortium for the treatment of tannery wastewater and revealed that the toxicity of treated water was significantly reduced allowing the 70 germination of seeds researchers also developed attached growth reactors to increase the treatment efficiency by overcoming the problems encountered in suspended growth system 5 23 24 furthermore there has been a growing environmental concern regarding the release of various refractory organics in treated wastewater which do not degrade during secondary biological treatment at etp cetp it was suggested that the conventional etp cetp requires to be modified with additional unit operations to eliminate refractory organics before entering the membrane separation process to refine the feed quality in order to increase the life of the membrane system to decrease the organic load in ro reject stream and thereof for the reduction in cost of treatment in evaporator system 11 the development of efficient biological treatment process with bacterial cell immobilized reactors for the refractory wastewater treatment advances the achieving zld with minimum cost to date there are very limited details available showcasing the use of bacterial consortium to remove refractory organics in tannery wastewater therefore the present investigation was focused on the development of new effective microbial consortia for the removal of refractory organics in biologically treated post tanning wastewater preparation of suitable carrier matrix for the immobilization of microbial consortium optimization of operating conditions for the bacterial cell immobilized fluidized reactor cifr under batch mode and continuous mode for the treatment of refractory organics evaluation of microbial community structures responsible for the mineralization of refractory organics in biologically treated post tanning wastewater are the important aspects of this investigation 2 materials and

cod coddis 2 2 mother culture preparation the bacterial mother culture used in the present investigation was isolated from soil sites contaminated with post tanning wastewater the isolated mother culture was cultivated using refractory organics containing secondary biological treated post tanning wastewater rocptww diluted with the minimal media composition of the minimal media is presented in section s1 in supplementary files the proportion of rocptww in the diluted mixture was increased once in every two days to facilitate the acclimatization of culture with the refractory organics 2 3 preparation of carbon silica matrix the carbon silica matrix csm was prepared from the agriculture solid waste rice husk in two stages such as carbonization at 400 c and followed by chemical activation at 800 c using phosphoric acid merck methods as explained by swarnalatha et al 26 2 4 immobilization of bacterial strains onto csm the active mother culture in the logarithmic phase with pre determined concentration was developed in a conical flask the batch immobilization studies were carried out with csm at a constant temperature maintained with a thermostat in a shaking incubator at 180 rpm the samples were collected at regular interval of time and the csm was separated from the cell suspension by filtration using stainless wire mesh the optical density of the filtrate was measured at λmax 600 nm using uv visible spectrophotometer the microbial cell density was calculated from the calibration graph relating cell density and optical density the number of cells

was designed and fabricated using transparent acrylic sheet with dimensions length 11 5 cm width 11 5 cm and height 30 cm the treated wastewater was collected from the reactor using a perforated tube placed at 26 cm from the bottom of the reactor the gas liquid solid separator was provided in the reactor at 18 cm from the bottom of the reactor to separate the gas liquid and carrier matrix the reactor was fabricated with the v shaped hopper at the bottom of the reactor to facilitate the settling of carrier matrix and to ease the fluidization of it the cifr was operated continuously with efficient working volume of 2 5 l 2 6 microbial community analysis the total microbial community in the cifr was analysed to find the type of organism and distribution of organisms for the degradation of refractory organics in rocptww the total genomic dna of the microbial colonies in csm were collected from cifr at the end of the experiment and extracted by using ultra clean soil dna isolation kit mol bio the 16s ribosomal rna gene targeted amplification was carried out using pcr forward primer 27f 5 agagtttgatcmtggctcag 3 and the reverse primer 1492r 5 tacggytaccttgttacgactt 3 approximately5

and dntps the quality and quantity of pcr product was analysed using qubit fluorometer 3 0 the aligned sequences were checked and classified into operational taxonomic units otus with in a 0 03 difference 97 similarity 2 7 instrumental analysis the sem investigation for csm and microbial consortium immobilized csm were analysed using leo jeo with magnification of 2500 10 000 the uv visible spectroscopic studies were carried out for the initial and treated rocptww at different time interval at λ200 800 nm using uv visible spectrophotometer cary varion agilent technologies the functional groups of refractory organics in ptww before and after the treatment was studied using znse cell for liquid sample ft ir analyser perkin elmer in the spectral range of 4000 545 cm 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 immobilization of microbial consortium onto csm the effect of contact time on immobilization of bacterial consortium onto csm was determined and is shown in fig s1 the figure illustrates that the immobilization of bacterial consortium onto csm attained equilibrium after the contact time of 7 h and it was found to be 3 31 0 2 107 cells gm 1 of csm the initial linear portion of the curve increased up to a certain qmax value and then it reached the plateau value after the lapse of contact time 7 h the linear portion of the curve could be attributed to the migration of bacterial cells from the bulk cell suspension to the pores and surface of the csm the nonlinear portion of the curve corresponds to diffusion of cells in the pores the plateau portion of the curve corresponds to anchoring or condensation of microbial cells onto active sites in the walls of the pores and onto the surface of csm 23 24 3 2 sem edx studies the fig 2a shows the sem micrograph of csm the presence of volume of pore structures in the csm shows the suitability of csm as a carrier matrix for the immobilization of microorganisms fig 2b f show the sem micrograph of bacterial cells immobilized onto csm at different contact time the prepare csm was characterized for both macro and micro pores the bacteria penetrates inside the tubular structure of pores of the csm and occupies the mouth of pores the csm surface shows the enhanced texture and little rougher so the bacterial attachment efficacy increased and consortia adhered for a longer time the fig 2b f clearly illustrates the immobilization and proliferation of bacterial cells bacilli and cocci in the pores of csm the energy dispersive x ray edx spectrum of csm is shown in table s1 supplementary materials and it confirms that carbon and silicon are the major constituent elements of the matrix 3 3 bet analysis the porous frame works such as surface area pore diameter and pore volume of csm are established from surface area measurements using the bet surface area analyzer and shown in table s2 supplementary materials the surface area of csm was calculated from nitrogen adsorption isotherms by assuming the area of nitrogen molecule 0 162 nm2 the surface area pore volume and pore diameter of csm are found to be 280 21 m2 g 1 0 142450 cm3 g 1g and 33 457 å respectively 3 4 treatment of wastewater 3 4 1 effect of mass of csm the codtot removal efficiency of cifr at different mass of csm 5 g l 10 g l 20 g l 30 g l 40 g l and 50 g l is illustrated in fig 3 and control refers to the experiment without csm but only with wastewater the results indicate that operation at hrt 24 h was optimum for the removal of codtot for all the matrix quantities studied the codtot was removed by 20 1 6 with residual codtot of 1000 26 mg l for 5 g l of csm by 26 2 2 with residual codtot of 930 26 mg l for 10 g l of csm by 32 2 with residual codtot of 850 24 mg l for 20 g l of csm by 41 2 2 with residual codtot of 740 20 mg l for 30 g l of csm by 45 2 2 with residual codtot of 690 24 mg l for 40 g l of csm and by 48 2 with residual codtot of 648 24 mg l for 50 g l of csm the results suggests that that the codtot removal efficiency of reactor increased with the mass of csm up to 30 g l and thereafter codtot removal efficiency was not increased significantly with the increase in mass of csm up to 50 g l 3 4 2 performance of cifr under batch mode operation the cifr was operated at different hrts 3 h 6 h 9 h 12 h 24 h 36 h and 48 h under batch mode with 30 g l of csm the results obtained in the batch experiments are presented in table 1 the codtot and coddis removal were found to be optimum at 24 h hrt and after it attained the saturation fig 4 the codtot removal was 43 2 8 with residual codtot of 666 75 mg l from the influent codtot of 1181 98 mg l the coddis removal was 42 3 3 with residual coddis of 600 62 mg l from the influent coddis of 1044 79 mg l the ph of the wastewater gradually increased from 7 23 0 05 to 7 57 0 07 at hrt 24 h the increase in ph indicates the utilization of protons from the aqueous medium the sequential steps involved are the formation of hydrogen peroxide from molecular oxygen and proton which again converted into hydroxide ion and hydroxyl radical the refractory organic compounds in wastewater develop hydrophobicity due to bulky groups and also due to aromatic and aliphatic groups the electronic structure of the hydroxide is characterized by a cloud of electron density around the oh axis on the oxygen side to which different numbers of water molecules trimer tetramer pentamer are bonded this increase in hydration density solubilises the refractory organic compounds into the cluster the hydrated refractory organics may be oriented towards the extracellular polymer of the bacteria enabling it to undergo enzymatic hydrolysis the removal of organics by biological oxidation was further confirmed by increase in orp of the wastewater from 143 21 mv to 70 17 mv 3 4 3 kinetic study the kinetic studies on the removal of pollutants in terms of codtot were performed for the treatment of rocptww using pseudo first and second order kinetic equations eqs 2 3 2 ln c t c 0 k 1 t 3 1 c t 1 c 0 k 2 t where c 0 is the initial concentration of cod in the rocptww c t is the concentration cod in the rocptww at time t time in hours k1 1 h and k2 l mg h are the pseudo first order and second order rate constants respectively table 2 presents the pseudo first and second order constants k1 k2 and r2 values at different mass of csm for the removal of cod the effect of mass of bacterial cell immobilized matrix from 5 g l to 50 g l was studied the best obeying order of reaction was identified based on the regression coefficient and it was found to be high for the pseudo second order model the optimum regression coefficient value 0 9911 was found at 30 g l bacterial cell immobilized matrix mass hence the degradation of refractory organics in post tanning wastewater followed pseudo second order kinetic model 3 4 4 instrumental confirmation for the removal of refractory organics from wastewater under batch study the uv visible spectra of wastewater before and after treatment using cifr at different time intervals are shown in fig 5 the spectrum of initial wastewater contains the strong absorption peaks in the range from λ200nm to λ240nm and λ270nm to λ300nm the peaks observed in the range from λ200nmto λ240nm may be attributed to the π π transition in chromophoretic compounds and the peaks observed in the range from λ270nm to λ300nm corresponds to π π transition in phenolic syntan compounds 9 27 in leather processing phenolic syntans are added to fix the chromium iii with collagen fibres without any dislodgement and diazo dyes are added to impart the desired tone to the finished leather fig 6 shows the ft ir spectra of the wastewater before and after the treatment in cifr at different time intervals the ft ir spectrum of initial wastewater shows strong peaks at 1634 cm 1 and 1537 cm 1 and they confirmed the presence of azo n n group 28 the presence of strong intense peak at 3349 cm 1 may be attributed to the oh group in the phenolic syntan the peaks found at 613 cm 1 and 870 cm 1 may be attributed to c s stretching of benzene ring in syntans sulphonated phenolic ring the low intense peaks at 2895 cm 1 and 2821 cm 1 are due to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching of methylene group in phenolic syntan the peaks observed at 1423 cm 1 and 1634 cm 1 confirm the aromatic skeleton present in azo dyes and syntans the c o stretching frequency of para substituted phenolic compounds are observed at 764 cm 1 and 1220 cm 1 29 fig 5b shows the decrease in intensity of peaks at λ200nm to λ240nm was observed for the increase in hydraulic retention time from 3 h to 48 h this may be due to degradation of diazo dye compounds in the rocptww 1 27 the ft ir spectra of treated wastewater at hrt 3 h and 6 h show the absence of peak at 1506 cm 1 this may be due to degradation of dye compound the formation of low intensity peak at 2325 cm 1 in the wastewater sample resulted for hrt of 3 h and 6 h reaction time also confirms the degradation of diazo dye compounds 29 the ft ir spectra of wastewater recorded at hrt 9 h and 12 h show the peak for derivatives of phenolic syntans the peaks in ft ir spectra observed for the samples collected at hrt of 24 h 36 h and 48 h were due to the presence of dissolved organics in the treated effluent the phenolic syntan in wastewater was cleaved into monomeric form and was present in the treated effluent 29 3 5 treatment of rocptww in cifr under continuous mode the cifr was operated under continuous mode at hrt of 24 h with organic loading rate of 1 0 0 1 kg cod m3 d and results are presented in table 3 fig s2c and d present the codtot and coddis removal from cifr under continuous mode of operation the codtot and coddis removal efficiency was found to be 43 8 4 and 50 8 4 respectively with remaining codtot 625 86 mg l and coddis 502 91 mg l in the treated water the bod5 removal was found to be 73 6 with residual bod5 of 95 16 mg l in the treated water a slight increase in the ts from 5147 151 mg l to 5200 163 mg l and tds from 5105 153 mg l to 5171 160 might correspond to increase in the mineralized organic compounds in the wastewater this is in agreement with the earlier reports of aops for the removal of refractory organics in wastewater also recorded very less cod removal 13 30 karthikeyan et al 1 reported the maximum cod removal by 77 from post tanning wastewater containing refractory organics at the optimum conditions such as co npac 1 0 w w h2o2 10 mm ph 3 5 and temperature 25 c in heterogeneous fenton oxidation the change in ph

13343,the activation of peroxymonosulfate pms has been developed as an efficient method for the degradation of antibiotics by generating reactive oxygen species ros where perovskite oxides have been found as effective catalysts however the reaction mechanism degradation pathways as well as the effects of co existing inorganic anions and natural organic matter are largely unknown therefore the degradation efficiency and mechanism of tetracycline tc through the activation of pms by lacoo3 were investigated moreover the effects of common inorganic anions and natural organic matter e g humic acid ha on degradation efficiency were also compared without the presence of coexisting substance tc removal exceeded 90 within 30 min while 72 mineralization was achieved in 6 h under optimal reaction conditions at neutral ph in addition to the traditional free radicals of oh and so4 1o2 and o2 also contributed the degradation process where the lattice oxygen of lacoo3 played a significant role in 1o2 production the degradation of tc followed the pathways including demethylation hydroxylation and ring opening reactions the presence of inorganic anions i e h2po4 cl and so4 2 and low concentration of ha promoted the degradation among them h2po4 and lower concentration of ha showed the most obvious outcome while the so4 2 can regulate the radical formation minimize the peak radical level and therefore promote the overall performance of the process lacoo3 exhibited stable reusability with minor decrease in tc removal likely due to the adsorption of intermediate products from previous stages these obtained results shed light on the application of perovskite oxides for pms activation on removing antibiotics keywords tetracycline peroxymonosulfate perovskite lacoo3 inorganic anions humic acid 1 introduction the increasing discharge of antibiotics into water bodies has brought great harm to ecosystem tetracycline tc is widely used as an efficient antibiotic not only in human medicine but also for livestock and agriculture 1 tc contaminants can cause various side effects in humans animals and plants and can even enter the food chain because of the possible formation of antibiotic resistant genes and lead to ecotoxicity 2 3 relevant research has indicated that tc compounds have been detected in water soil sewage and activated sludge with the residue concentration ranging from 2 ng l 1 up to 50 μg l 1 4 thus it is urgent to develop effective methods materials with high performances and low environmental impacts to minimize the residues from antibiotics such as tc or transform them into harmless compounds before they enter the aqueous environment owing to the specialty of ph flexibility redox potential and superior oxidation ability the activation of peroxymonosulfate pms has been found efficient for the removal of antibiotics through uv irradiation base heat transition metal ions or transition metal oxides pms can be activated to generate reactive oxygen species ros including so4 2 5 3 1 v and oh 1 9 2 7 v 5 these ros can oxidize antibiotics based on the mechanisms like electron transfer hydrogen abstraction and electron abstraction up to now compared to the energy based activation of pms the activation by transition metal oxides is less complex and more economical common transition metals used in the fabrication of oxides include co cu fe and mn etc with multivalences of 2 and 3 co contained catalyst exhibits higher catalytic activity in pms activation 6 among metal oxides perovskite type composite oxides have recently drawn great attention as promising catalysts for pms activation in perovskite structure with a formula of abo3 a site can be rare earth alkaline alkaline earth ions or other larger ions while b site can be metallic cations with 3d 4d or 5d configuration the ions at the a site coordinate with oxygen to form the densest cubic accumulation playing a main role in stabilizing the perovskite structure while the ions at the b site generally occupy the center of octahedron contributing to catalytic activity 7 8 the oxidation state of b site cation affects not only the electron transfer capability during redox reactions but also the ability to accommodate various metal ions without destroying the structure 9 this increases the oxygen mobility to produce more ros 10 moreover the variability in valence state of transition metals leads to the diversity of perovskite properties these characteristics make perovskites promising catalysts for pms activation for example lanthanum based perovskites lamo3 a common type of perovskite have been reported efficient in activating pms to degrade common water contaminants e g phenol rhodamine b 2 phenyl 5 sulfobenzimidazole and several herbicides 5 11 13 in lamo3 co has been identified as most reactive cation for pms activation since the redox active couple of co ii co iii makes the whole process thermodynamically feasible 14 15 however to the best of our knowledge the synergism between pms and lacoo3 catalysis for the oxidation of antibiotics has not been systematically investigated in wastewater and natural waters antibiotics usually coexist with inorganic anions and natural organic matter nom which poses various effects on the removal processes for instance cl is identified as a strong scavenger for so4 in the degradation of methylene blue and levofloxacin 16 but it is also reported as a promoter due to the higher reaction rate of cl generated from cl than so4 17 as to so4 2 the suppressing effect is considered stronger than cl and no3 in the degradation of sulfamethoxazole by pms whereas no significant effect was reported in the pms activation by fe and s co doped graphite 18 as a typical natural organic matter nom in water ha has been found to display synergistic or inhibitory effects as reported in the decomposition of sulfamethoxazole smx via pms activation the degradation is promoted by ha with low concentration while an inhabitation effect appears with the further increase of ha concentration 19 on the contrary ha greatly declines the degradation of sulfachloropyridazine by pms where the degradation efficiency decreases dramatically from 98 9 to 75 8 with the addition of 0 10 mg l 1 of ha 20 considering the widespread distribution of inorganic anions and nom as well as their intriguing performance in the reaction their effects should be considered in the test of the activity of catalysts in activating pms herein the degradation of tc in the activation of pms by lacoo3 was investigated in the following aspects i catalytic performance and stability ii free radical species and degradation pathways and iii effects of ha and several common inorganic anions i e cl so4 2 no3 and h2po4 the obtained results should be benefit for the environmental application of lacoo3 pms system in the removal of antibiotics 2 materials and method 2 1 lacoo3 synthesis and characterization the lacoo3 perovskite was prepared through sol gel method see supplementary text 1 for the details of synthesis procedure the obtained lacoo3 was characterized by x ray diffraction xrd x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps transmission electron microscope tem and bet n2 adsorption for crystal structure surface composition morphology and specific surface area respectively see supplementary text 2 for the details of characterization procedure 2 2 batch experiments due to the solubility and special characterization of tc the stock solution was freshly prepared by dissolving 0 02 g tc into 1 l of milliq water and stirring at 25 c in dark condition overnight all the tc degradation experiments were carried out in the beakers 250 ml in volume with magnetic stirrer under 25 c then 20 mg of lacoo3 was added into the tc solution 100 ml with magnetic stirring in dark for 15 min to achieve the adsorption desorption equilibrium afterward the pre determined amount of pms was added into above suspension to initiate the reaction under continuous stirring in order to figure out the optimal reaction parameters the dosages of tc and pms and the initial ph of suspension were varied the ph was adjusted by using hcl 0 1 mol l 1 and naoh 0 1 mol l 1 at given time intervals of reaction 1 5 ml of the suspension was withdrawn by a syringe and filtered with 0 45 μm membrane plate the filtrate was quickly mixed with excessive methanol to quench the ros and terminate the reaction waiting for the analysis for the concentration of tc degradation products and leaching metals to verify the superiority of lacoo3 pms system in tc degradation control tests with sole lacoo3 or pms were also performed the stability and reusability of lacoo3 catalyst was also tested by carrying out three consecutive degradation of tc under same conditions the catalysts were separated and collected after each reaction cycle by vacuum filtration with a buchner funnel suction flask and 0 2 μm pes membrane ф 50 mm the catalysts were washed by milliq water for three times during the filtration process before drying at 80 c for 12 h after drying these recycled catalysts were ground again for later use various ros quenchers namely tba etoh 1 4 benzoquinone bzq and sodium azide nan3 were used in the trapping experiments to investigate the generation of free radicals or other functional groups besides electron paramagnetic resonance epr were also used to further determine the ros generated during the catalytic process epr was performed by jeol jes fa 300 spectrometer using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetra methylpiperidine temp as the spin trapping reagents the remaining concentration of tc in the solution was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatograph hplc system see supplementary text 3 for the details of analysis procedure the total organic carbon toc were tested by a shimadzu toc 5000a analyzer 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of lacoo3 catalyst based on the xrd pattern of prepared lacoo3 fig 1a all the characteristic peaks correspond to the cubic lacoo3 perovskite for example the characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ 23 2 32 9 33 3 and 47 5 are well matched with the hexagonal lacoo3 jcpds26 1060 except for the lanthanum cobaltite perovskite phase the common oxide impurities including co3o4 and la2o3 are not formed the sharp diffraction peak can be interpreted as good crystallinity of lacoo3 the mean crystal size calculated by the scherrer equation is 21 nm table s1 the particle size distribution and phase of lacoo3 were further studied by tem fig 1b the larger particle size 27 nm by tem image than crystal size 21 nm suggests the possible agglomeration the hrtem image shows the single crystal nature of lacoo3 perovskite the interplanar spacing is about 2 73 å corresponding to the hexagonal lacoo3 110 crystal plane through the eds analysis fig 1 d g the main components only consist of la co and o with even dispersion the molar ratio of la and co is 1 the surface chemistry of lacoo3 was verified by xps fig s1 as for co the binding energies of lacoo3 are 779 8 and 795 0 ev corresponding to the 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 orbits of co3 respectively with difference of orbital binding energy at 15 2 ev as the satellite peak appears at 790 ev co exists in the form of 3 valence since the surface oxygen species have an important effect on the catalytic performance it is necessary to analyze the o 1s spectrum the binding energies at 528 6 531 1 and 533 1 ev correspond to lattice oxygen surface adsorbed oxygen oads o or o2 and the molecular water adsorbed on the lacoo3 surface respectively 21 both o and o2 species are strongly electrophilic species which can attack tc especially the parts with the higher electron density in the molecule 3 2 catalytic performance to evaluate the catalytic activity of as prepared lacoo3 in pms activation and tc degradation the reaction conditions e g initial concentrations of tc 5 10 20 40 and 60 mg l 1 pms 25 50 75 and 100 mg l 1 and the solution ph of suspension 3 3 5 7 9 and 11 were optimized see supplementary text 4 for the details of results and discussion tc at all the selected concentrations was efficiently degraded in 30 min where a fast initial decay was observed in the first 5 min fig s2 for better comparison at reasonable degradation rate a moderate concentration of tc 20 mg l 1 was selected as to pms concentration the more pms added the more free radicals were generated fig s3 this is likely due to the elevated mass transfer and or supply of pms from the bulk solution to lacoo3 surface resulting in the higher generation of free radicals and faster degradation of tc for a better observation of decay pattern a moderate pms concentration at 50 mg l 1 was chosen the ph of lacoo3 pms suspension also played an important role in the degradation of organic pollutants with the increase of ph from 3 3 to 11 the removal rate of tc generally increased among which the remaining tc dropped from about 35 to 10 and 1 in acidic neutral and basic conditions respectively fig s4 a besides the final ph of most working solutions was identical to the initial ph fig s4 b but for the systems with initial ph of 7 and 9 the final ph dropped approximately to 5 and 7 respectively this indicates the high activity of lacoo3 under neutral to basic conditions on one hand higher ph would accelerate the conversion from so4 to oh offering an additional active species for tc degradation 22 under neutral ph pms was more prone to ionization which helped to generate more free active radicals on the other hand pms is more stable under acidic conditions than neutral or alkaline conditions pka1 0 pka2 9 4 resulting in a relative slower activation 23 under acidic condition more h was produced to capture so4 and oh leading to the unnecessary consumption of both free radicals for the sake of practical use the reaction ph for most the degradation processes was chosen at neutral condition under the optimized reaction conditions more than 90 of tc was degraded in 30 min with the mineralization rate higher than 70 in 6 h fig s5 compared to the reported organic pollutants used to test the activity of lacoo3 pms e g bisphenol a m z 228 29 g mol atrazine m z 215 68 g mol 2 4 d m z 221 03 g mol or acid orange 7 m z 350 3 g mol table s2 tc is far more complicated in structure with a larger molar weight m z 444 4 g mol with four stable benzene rings but the fast degradation of tc through pms activation by lacoo3 verifies its feasibility in the degradation of antibiotics the stability and reusability of lacoo3 catalyst was also tested by carrying out three consecutive degradation of tc under same conditions the removal performance of tc did not change obviously in the first two runs with the final removal rate at around 90 and 81 respectively but the performance was obviously reduced after the third run fig 2 likely due to the accumulation of intermediate products on the surface of reused lacoo3 these accumulated residues not only occupy the active sites of reused catalyst but also compete for the radicals in the following run lowering the overall performance 24 the icp oes test was conducted to investigate the leaching of co from lco table s3 the leaching ratio of co was generally low 0 22 0 26 and there is no significant increase of co dissolution after recycles the phase stability of lacoo3 was also investigated through the xrd analysis of reacted lacoo3 fig 1a there was no obvious difference between the fresh and reacted lacoo3 except for a little diffraction intensity decrease of the recycled ones this indicates the satisfied structure stability of lacoo3 catalyst 3 3 free radical species and degradation pathways the generated or existing free radicals in lacoo3 pms suspension was determined through the trapping experiments by the addition of several scavengers etoh was an effective quenching agent for both so4 and oh koh 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 kso4 1 6 7 7 107 m 1 s 1 while tba was an effective quenching agent mainly for oh koh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 with much lower reaction rate with so4 kso4 4 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 25 given that superoxide o2 2 2 v and singlet oxygen 1o2 0 15 v were also be involved in the pms activation process trapping tests for these two radicals were also conducted by using 1 4 benzoquinone bzq and nan3 for o2 2 9 109 m 1 s 1 26 and 1o2 2 2 109 m 1 s 1 27 respectively they displayed obvious negative effects on tc degradation whereas the concentration variation posed insignificant influence on the degradation figs 3 and s6 the inhibitions by bzq and nan3 was even more obvious than those of tba and etoh this is ascribed to their scavenging capability to oh with the rate constant of bzq and nan3 toward oh of 1 2 109 and 1 1 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively at neutral ph 27 28 judging from the small increment for additional retardation resulted from bzq nan3 than those of tba etoh both 1o2 and o2 did participate in the degradation of tc the half life of o2 was less than 1 ns much shorter than so4 30 40 μs 1o2 3 5 μs and oh 20 ns 29 30 in light of the differences in the half life times and oxidation ability of radicals so4 and oh would have the priority to react with tc than o2 and 1o2 31 32 to further confirm the existence of the four ross mentioned above electron paramagnetic resonance epr was employed using dmpo and temp as typical spin trapping reagents dmpo and temp as the probe compound were used to identify the generation of so4 oh o2 and 1o2 through the formation of spin adducts including dmpo so4 dmpo oh dmpo ooh and tempo respectively a strong signal of four consecutive peaks with relative intensities of 1 2 2 1 was detected after the addition of pms matching well with the dmpo oh spectra fig 4a 3 the signal for dmpo so4 was detected spontaneously with the relative intensities of 1 2 1 2 18 this phenomenon confirmed the successful activation of pms by lco to produce so4 and oh which was well consistent with the traditional trapping tests besides the appearance of 1 1 1 1 dmpo ooh and 1 1 1 tempo signals provided solid evidences for the presence of o2 and 1o2 fig 4b and c 33 the intermediate products generated in tc degradation over lacoo3 pms system were identified by uplc ms fig s8 based on the generation of degradation products with lower molecular weight m z 220 three degradation pathways could be proposed fig 5 initially the ring structure of tc was attacked by ross i e so4 oh 1o2 and o2 and further transformed into smaller molecules with progressive ring opening then hydroxylation occurred due to the generation of intermediates with m z of 460 and 461 afterwards the intermediates with m z of 414 were obtained by demethylation under the attack of ross compared to the relevant studies on the degradation of tc by activated pms several degradation intermediates i e p3 m z 415 p7 m z 274 and p8 m z 258 were frequently detected whereas those with much lower m z i e p9 p10 p11 and p12 m z 190 varied with the catalysts 34 36 this can be justified by the intermediates with much lower m z resulted from the loss of some functional groups from the higher ones but in light of the toc removal 70 in 6 h fig s6 tc and its associated intermediates could be mineralized into co2 and h2o based on the above analysis the preliminary degradation mechanism could be proposed in control experiments the sole lacoo3 could remove tc to a certain extent 10 which is attributed to the adsorption on catalyst solely pms addition could degrade partial tc ca 50 as pms contained hso5 anion with strong oxidation ability which could self decompose into so4 radical 37 however the reaction between tc and inactivated pms just transformed tc into other 4 ring molecules rather than smaller molecules with less ring structure 38 with the co existence of pms and lacoo3 most tc was degraded and then mineralized based on the quenching tests except for the dominant so4 and oh oxidation 1o2 and o2 also took part in the removal of tc so4 and oh were originated from pms decomposition by self decomposition or by lacoo3 catalysis eqs 1 4 based on some previous researches the generation of 1o2 mainly followed the self decomposition of pms at the rate constant of 0 2 m 1 s 1 eq 5 39 40 the generated 1o2 could adhere to tc directly to induce oxidative reactions due to its high redox potential 39 40 additionally 1o2 could be also generated through the recombination of o2 eq 6 41 but this reaction would consume a great amount of h since the tc degradation was mainly carried out under neutral ph the above reaction could be constrained thus o2 should exist in the reaction system and act as an effective radical the formation of o2 was far more complicated 42 based on eqs 7 12 o2 was generated through a series of processes including decomposition and composition of hso5 and oh 1 c o 3 hs o 5 c o 2 s o 5 h 2 c o 2 hs o 5 c o 3 s o 4 oh 3 c o 2 hs o 5 c o 3 s o 4 2 oh 4 hs o 5 oh s o 4 5 so 5 2 hso 5 o 2 1 hso 4 so 4 2 6 2 o 2 2 h h 2 o 2 o 2 1 7 oh hso 5 h so 5 oh 8 oh h e h 2 o 9 s o 4 h e hs o 4 10 hso 5 h 2 o h 2 o 2 hso 4 11 oh h 2 o 2 ho 2 h 2 o 12 ho 2 h o 2 3 4 effect of co existing inorganic anions on degradation efficiency several kinds of inorganic anions including cl h2po4 no3 and so4 2 which were widely detected in real wastewaters or natural waters were chosen to test their influence on the degradation efficiency of tc at neutral ph generally most of the selected inorganic anions posed positive effects on the degradation of tc at different extent fig 6 among all the tested anions h2po4 showed the best outcome the remaining concentration of tc went down to zero in 30 min after the addition of h2po4 far more effective than the control system without inorganic anions this observation contradicts to the results of some aops where h2po4 showed inhibitory effect on pms activation 43 however as a nucleophile h2po4 was easy to attack pms due to its asymmetric structure this induced a quick decay of pms 44 and rapid generation of active species such as so4 and oh leading to the effective degradation of tc this was reported feasible in an analogous study carried out by li et al in 2019 45 because h2po4 itself seldom consumes or reacts with free radicals the addition of h2po4 therefore likely increases the steady state concentrations of oh and so4 in the solution and then accelerates tc removal this can be shown in fig s7 where the increase of h2po4 resulted in the less residual of tc similar effect was also observed on reaction systems e g cofe2o4 oxone and femn bimetallic catalysts with nitrogen doped graphene pms 26 46 the addition of cl in the lacoo3 pms also strongly accelerated the tc degradation which diverged from the frequently reported character of cl as a free radical scavenger the positive effect of cl could be explained by eqs 13 15 47 cl could be oxidized by both pms and so4 to active chlorine species for example hocl was the dominant chlorine species in acidic solution while clo3 with less strong oxidizing ability was the main species at higher ph eq 16 moreover cl2 and cl might also be generated through nonradical pathways 48 therefore active chlorine contributed to the degradation of tc in the lacoo3 pms system because there is no trace of chlorinated intermediates in the lc ms analysis the role of active chlorine species should be simply oxidants rather than sources of substitution reactions 13 2 cl h hso 5 so 4 2 cl 2 h 2 o 14 cl s o 4 so 4 2 cl 15 cl cl cl 2 16 ocl 2 hclo clo 3 2 hcl different from previous studies the addition of so4 2 surprisingly promoted the reaction as the residue tc was further reduced to less than 5 fig 6 comparing to that of anion free reaction theoretically so4 2 is at a fully oxidized state and generally considered as an inert ion in the solution owing to its much slower reactivity toward oh and so4 so4 2 was not a scavenger and did not react with the free radicals in the process 49 50 the possible reason for the so4 2 in promoting the reaction is likely through a proper kinetics control of generating radicals in the solution by minimizing the sharp peak of radical which is known to induce unwanted futile side reactions and minimize the waste of the precious radicals so that the overall removal tc is increased in the long run as show by eqs 17 18 so4 can react with h2o and oh to form oh while the presence of high so4 2 i e the end product of so4 after its usage at the beginning of the reaction can effectively slow down but not consume the formation of both so4 and oh this mechanism maintains a healthy concentration of radicals in the solution and minimize the chance of boosting a peak radical in the solution the risk of futile consumption of free radicals in the solution is therefore reduced and the overall performance in removal of tc in the lacoo3 pms process promoted 17 all phs s o 4 h 2 o so 4 2 oh h 18 alkaline phs s o 4 oh so 4 2 oh for no3 the influence on degradation was insignificant as the residue tc was about 7 after 30 min degradation close to the control group at 10 comparing to the other anions the interference caused by no3 on the pms based aops was commonly lower most of the relative researches indicated that obvious retardation usually become appreciable when no3 is higher than 50 mm 51 52 in this work the studied of the effect of no3 on the degradation of tc by lco pms was less than 10 mm as nitrate concentration within pharmaceutical wastewater commonly ranged between 50 and 800 ppm 53 54 the major reason for the weak influence from no3 on tc degradation was the relatively slow reaction rate between so4 and no3 k 2 1 102 m 1 s 1 ph 7 as indicated in eq 19 55 57 comparing to those of other anions such as h2po4 k 7 106 m 1 s 1 and cl k 2 5 108 m 1 s 1 the rate of no3 was 104 to 106 order lower thus it showed neglectable scavenging effect and posed almost no interference on the degradation of tc 56 58 19 n o 3 s o 4 so 4 2 n o 3 besides another research indicated that the existence of no3 was beneficial to the generation of active oxygen 59 the traditional trapping experiments and epr tests both confirmed the positive roles of 1o2 and o2 in the removal of tc which helped to demonstrate to the promotion of tc oxidation similar conclusions were widely reported by other researches using sulfate radical aops 43 55 the tests with additional lower concentration of inorganic anions i e 5 mmol l 1 were carried out the promotion effect was also observed and generally slower than those at 10 mmol l 1 fig s7 3 5 effect of co existing organic matters on degradation efficiency previous research suggests that co existing organic matter might suppress the so4 based processes 57 to evaluate this hypothesis in the degradation of tc under the lacoo3 pms system humic acid ha was chosen for investigation ha is normally detected in the range 5 20 mg l 1 which might greatly affect the water quality 21 60 thus the amount of ha in the reaction system was set between 5 and 20 mg l 1 when the dosage was 5 mg l 1 or lower ha was slightly favourable to the degradation fig 7 this might be caused by the formation of semiquinone radicals which could be generated from the oxygen containing functional groups in ha and subsequently effectively stimulate pms to form oh and so4 60 the semiquinone radicals from ha have been reported capable to activate pms via a self redox cycle promoting the formation of oh and so4 and accordingly tc degradation 61 furthermore the coordination between ha and some metal ions within lacoo3 might also have generated some oxidative intermediate products leading to the formation of oh and o2 these radicals may help to promote the degradation given that o2 was later proved to be one of the working free radicles under the lacoo3 pms system 62 however some inhibition effect was observed at higher concentrations this was mainly due to the quenching effect of ha on sulfate radicals with the increasing concentration of ha to even higher than 10 mg l 1 the degradation of tc by lco pms system was gradually retarded similar inhibition caused by higher dosage of ha was also observed in some other sulfate based aops this was attributed largely to the competition of so4 radicals between ha and tc 19 another possibility was the deeper blockage of active sites on the surface of lco caused by the functional groups including phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl of excessive ha 63 this situation would lower the chances for pms or tc adhering on the surface of lco therefore the lower ha concentration i e 5 mg l 1 could improve the process but higher ha concentration 10 mg l 1 would induce a retardation 4 conclusions in this study the lacoo3 pms system exhibited excellent tc degradation along with a satisfied mineralization ability and stable reusability under the optimal degradation condition at neutral ph 90 of tc were removed in 30 min based on the traditional trapping experiments and epr spectra free radicals including so4 oh 1o2 and o2 were involved the main degradation pathways of tc mainly include demethylation hydroxylation and ring opening reactions the degradation performance was accelerated in the presence of common inorganic anions e g cl h2po4 and so4 2 as well as humid acid at low concentration this indicates the strong environmental adaptability of the lacoo3 pms system generally the lacoo3 pms system was proved to be a rapid economical and stable approach for the degradation of tc which provided a novel strategy for pms activation aiming at antibiotic removal

13343,the activation of peroxymonosulfate pms has been developed as an efficient method for the degradation of antibiotics by generating reactive oxygen species ros where perovskite oxides have been found as effective catalysts however the reaction mechanism degradation pathways as well as the effects of co existing inorganic anions and natural organic matter are largely unknown therefore the degradation efficiency and mechanism of tetracycline tc through the activation of pms by lacoo3 were investigated moreover the effects of common inorganic anions and natural organic matter e g humic acid ha on degradation efficiency were also compared without the presence of coexisting substance tc removal exceeded 90 within 30 min while 72 mineralization was achieved in 6 h under optimal reaction conditions at neutral ph in addition to the traditional free radicals of oh and so4 1o2 and o2 also contributed the degradation process where the lattice oxygen of lacoo3 played a significant role in 1o2 production the degradation of tc followed the pathways including demethylation hydroxylation and ring opening reactions the presence of inorganic anions i e h2po4 cl and so4 2 and low concentration of ha promoted the degradation among them h2po4 and lower concentration of ha showed the most obvious outcome while the so4 2 can regulate the radical formation minimize the peak radical level and therefore promote the overall performance of the process lacoo3 exhibited stable reusability with minor decrease in tc removal likely due to the adsorption of intermediate products from previous stages these obtained results shed light on the application of perovskite oxides for pms activation on removing antibiotics keywords tetracycline peroxymonosulfate perovskite lacoo3 inorganic anions humic acid 1 introduction the increasing discharge of antibiotics into water bodies has brought great harm to ecosystem tetracycline tc is widely used as an efficient antibiotic not only in human medicine but also for livestock and agriculture 1 tc contaminants can cause various side effects in humans animals and plants and can even enter the food chain because of the possible formation of antibiotic resistant genes and lead to ecotoxicity 2 3 relevant research has indicated that tc compounds have been detected in water soil sewage and activated sludge with the residue concentration ranging from 2 ng l 1 up to 50 μg l 1 4 thus it is urgent to develop effective methods materials with high performances and low environmental impacts to minimize the residues from antibiotics such as tc or transform them into harmless compounds before they enter the aqueous environment owing to the specialty of ph flexibility redox potential and superior oxidation ability the activation of peroxymonosulfate pms has been found efficient for the removal of antibiotics through uv irradiation base heat transition metal ions or transition metal oxides pms can be activated to generate reactive oxygen species ros including so4 2 5 3 1 v and oh 1 9 2 7 v 5 these ros can oxidize antibiotics based on the mechanisms like electron transfer hydrogen abstraction and electron abstraction up to now compared to the energy based activation of pms the activation by transition metal oxides is less complex and more economical common transition metals used in the fabrication of oxides include co cu fe and mn etc with multivalences of 2 and 3 co contained catalyst exhibits higher catalytic activity in pms activation 6 among metal oxides perovskite type composite oxides have recently drawn great attention as promising catalysts for pms activation in perovskite structure with a formula of abo3 a site can be rare earth alkaline alkaline earth ions or other larger ions while b site can be metallic cations with 3d 4d or 5d configuration the ions at the a site coordinate with oxygen to form the densest cubic accumulation playing a main role in stabilizing the perovskite structure while the ions at the b site generally occupy the center of octahedron contributing to catalytic activity 7 8 the oxidation state of b site cation affects not only the electron transfer capability during redox reactions but also the ability to accommodate various metal ions without destroying the structure 9 this increases the oxygen mobility to produce more ros 10 moreover the variability in valence state of transition metals leads to the diversity of perovskite properties these characteristics make perovskites promising catalysts for pms activation for example lanthanum based perovskites lamo3 a common type of perovskite have been reported efficient in activating pms to degrade common water contaminants e g phenol rhodamine b 2 phenyl 5 sulfobenzimidazole and several herbicides 5 11 13 in lamo3 co has been identified as most reactive cation for pms activation since the redox active couple of co ii co iii makes the whole process thermodynamically feasible 14 15 however to the best of our knowledge the synergism between pms and lacoo3 catalysis for the oxidation of antibiotics has not been systematically investigated in wastewater and natural waters antibiotics usually coexist with inorganic anions and natural organic matter nom which poses various effects on the removal processes for instance cl is identified as a strong scavenger for so4 in the degradation of methylene blue and levofloxacin 16 but it is also reported as a promoter due to the higher reaction rate of cl generated from cl than so4 17 as to so4 2 the suppressing effect is considered stronger than cl and no3 in the degradation of sulfamethoxazole by pms whereas no significant effect was reported in the pms activation by fe and s co doped graphite 18 as a typical natural organic matter nom in water ha has been found to display synergistic or inhibitory effects as reported in the decomposition of sulfamethoxazole smx via pms activation the degradation is promoted by ha with low concentration while an inhabitation effect appears with the further increase of ha concentration 19 on the contrary ha greatly declines the degradation of sulfachloropyridazine by pms where the degradation efficiency decreases dramatically from 98 9 to 75 8 with the addition of 0 10 mg l 1 of ha 20 considering the widespread distribution of inorganic anions and nom as well as their intriguing performance in the reaction their effects should be considered in the test of the activity of catalysts in activating pms herein the degradation of tc in the activation of pms by lacoo3 was investigated in the following aspects i catalytic performance and stability ii free radical species and degradation pathways and iii effects of ha and several common inorganic anions i e cl so4 2 no3 and h2po4 the obtained results should be benefit for the environmental application of lacoo3 pms system in the removal of antibiotics 2 materials and method 2 1 lacoo3 synthesis and characterization the lacoo3 perovskite was prepared through sol gel method see supplementary text 1 for the details of synthesis procedure the obtained lacoo3 was characterized by x ray diffraction xrd x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps transmission electron microscope tem and bet n2 adsorption for crystal structure surface composition morphology and specific surface area respectively see supplementary text 2 for the details of characterization procedure 2 2 batch experiments due to the solubility and special characterization of tc the stock solution was freshly prepared by dissolving 0 02 g tc into 1 l of milliq water and stirring at 25 c in dark condition overnight all the tc degradation experiments were carried out in the beakers 250 ml in volume with magnetic stirrer under 25 c then 20 mg of lacoo3 was added into the tc solution 100 ml with magnetic stirring in dark for 15 min to achieve the adsorption desorption equilibrium afterward the pre determined amount of pms was added into above suspension to initiate the reaction under continuous stirring in order to figure out the optimal reaction parameters the dosages of tc and pms and the initial ph of suspension were varied the ph was adjusted by using hcl 0 1 mol l 1 and naoh 0 1 mol l 1 at given time intervals of reaction 1 5 ml of the suspension was withdrawn by a syringe and filtered with 0 45 μm membrane plate the filtrate was quickly mixed with excessive methanol to quench the ros and terminate the reaction waiting for the analysis for the concentration of tc degradation products and leaching metals to verify the superiority of lacoo3 pms system in tc degradation control tests with sole lacoo3 or pms were also performed the stability and reusability of lacoo3 catalyst was also tested by carrying out three consecutive degradation of tc under same conditions the catalysts were separated and collected after each reaction cycle by vacuum filtration with a buchner funnel suction flask and 0 2 μm pes membrane ф 50 mm the catalysts were washed by milliq water for three times during the filtration process before drying at 80 c for 12 h after drying these recycled catalysts were ground again for later use various ros quenchers namely tba etoh 1 4 benzoquinone bzq and sodium azide nan3 were used in the trapping experiments to investigate the generation of free radicals or other functional groups besides electron paramagnetic resonance epr were also used to further determine the ros generated during the catalytic process epr was performed by jeol jes fa 300 spectrometer using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetra methylpiperidine temp as the spin trapping reagents the remaining concentration of tc in the solution was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatograph hplc system see supplementary text 3 for the details of analysis procedure the total organic carbon toc were tested by a shimadzu toc 5000a analyzer 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of lacoo3 catalyst based on the xrd pattern of prepared lacoo3 fig 1a all the characteristic peaks correspond to the cubic lacoo3 perovskite for example the characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ 23 2 32 9 33 3 and 47 5 are well matched with the hexagonal lacoo3 jcpds26 1060 except for the lanthanum cobaltite perovskite phase the common oxide impurities including co3o4 and la2o3 are not formed the sharp diffraction peak can be interpreted as good crystallinity of lacoo3 the mean crystal size calculated by the scherrer equation is 21 nm table s1 the particle size distribution and phase of lacoo3 were further studied by tem fig 1b the larger particle size 27 nm by tem image than crystal size 21 nm suggests the possible agglomeration the hrtem image shows the single crystal nature of lacoo3 perovskite the interplanar spacing is about 2 73 å corresponding to the hexagonal lacoo3 110 crystal plane through the eds analysis fig 1 d g the main components only consist of la co and o with even dispersion the molar ratio of la and co is 1 the surface chemistry of lacoo3 was verified by xps fig s1 as for co the binding energies of lacoo3 are 779 8 and 795 0 ev corresponding to the 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 orbits of co3 respectively with difference of orbital binding energy at 15 2 ev as the satellite peak appears at 790 ev co exists in the form of 3 valence since the surface oxygen species have an important effect on the catalytic performance it is necessary to analyze the o 1s spectrum the binding energies at 528 6 531 1 and 533 1 ev correspond to lattice oxygen surface adsorbed oxygen oads o or o2 and the molecular water adsorbed on the lacoo3 surface respectively 21 both o and o2 species are strongly electrophilic species which can attack tc especially the parts with the higher electron density in the molecule 3 2 catalytic performance to evaluate the catalytic activity of as prepared lacoo3 in pms activation and tc degradation the reaction conditions e g initial concentrations of tc 5 10 20 40 and 60 mg l 1 pms 25 50 75 and 100 mg l 1 and the solution ph of suspension 3 3 5 7 9 and 11 were optimized see supplementary text 4 for the details of results and discussion tc at all the selected concentrations was efficiently degraded in 30 min where a fast initial decay was observed in the first 5 min fig s2 for better comparison at reasonable degradation rate a moderate concentration of tc 20 mg l 1 was selected as to pms concentration the more pms added the more free radicals were generated fig s3 this is likely due to the elevated mass transfer and or supply of pms from the bulk solution to lacoo3 surface resulting in the higher generation of free radicals and faster degradation of tc for a better observation of decay pattern a moderate pms concentration at 50 mg l 1 was chosen the ph of lacoo3 pms suspension also played an important role in the degradation of organic pollutants with the increase of ph from 3 3 to 11 the removal rate of tc generally increased among which the remaining tc dropped from about 35 to 10 and 1 in acidic neutral and basic conditions respectively fig s4 a besides the final ph of most working solutions was identical to the initial ph fig s4 b but for the systems with initial ph of 7 and 9 the final ph dropped approximately to 5 and 7 respectively this indicates the high activity of lacoo3 under neutral to basic conditions on one hand higher ph would accelerate the conversion from so4 to oh offering an additional active species for tc degradation 22 under neutral ph pms was more prone to ionization which helped to generate more free active radicals on the other hand pms is more stable under acidic conditions than neutral or alkaline conditions pka1 0 pka2 9 4 resulting in a relative slower activation 23 under acidic condition more h was produced to capture so4 and oh leading to the unnecessary consumption of both free radicals for the sake of practical use the reaction ph for most the degradation processes was chosen at neutral condition under the optimized reaction conditions more than 90 of tc was degraded in 30 min with the mineralization rate higher than 70 in 6 h fig s5 compared to the reported organic pollutants used to test the activity of lacoo3 pms e g bisphenol a m z 228 29 g mol atrazine m z 215 68 g mol 2 4 d m z 221 03 g mol or acid orange 7 m z 350 3 g mol table s2 tc is far more complicated in structure with a larger molar weight m z 444 4 g mol with four stable benzene rings but the fast degradation of tc through pms activation by lacoo3 verifies its feasibility in the degradation of antibiotics the stability and reusability of lacoo3 catalyst was also tested by carrying out three consecutive degradation of tc under same conditions the removal performance of tc did not change obviously in the first two runs with the final removal rate at around 90 and 81 respectively but the performance was obviously reduced after the third run fig 2 likely due to the accumulation of intermediate products on the surface of reused lacoo3 these accumulated residues not only occupy the active sites of reused catalyst but also compete for the radicals in the following run lowering the overall performance 24 the icp oes test was conducted to investigate the leaching of co from lco table s3 the leaching ratio of co was generally low 0 22 0 26 and there is no significant increase of co dissolution after recycles the phase stability of lacoo3 was also investigated through the xrd analysis of reacted lacoo3 fig 1a there was no obvious difference between the fresh and reacted lacoo3 except for a little diffraction intensity decrease of the recycled ones this indicates the satisfied structure stability of lacoo3 catalyst 3 3 free radical species and degradation pathways the generated or existing free radicals in lacoo3 pms suspension was determined through the trapping experiments by the addition of several scavengers etoh was an effective quenching agent for both so4 and oh koh 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 kso4 1 6 7 7 107 m 1 s 1 while tba was an effective quenching agent mainly for oh koh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 with much lower reaction rate with so4 kso4 4 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 25 given that superoxide o2 2 2 v and singlet oxygen 1o2 0 15 v were also be involved in the pms activation process trapping tests for these two radicals were also conducted by using 1 4 benzoquinone bzq and nan3 for o2 2 9 109 m 1 s 1 26 and 1o2 2 2 109 m 1 s 1 27 respectively they displayed obvious negative effects on tc degradation whereas the concentration variation posed insignificant influence on the degradation figs 3 and s6 the inhibitions by bzq and nan3 was even more obvious than those of tba and etoh this is ascribed to their scavenging capability to oh with the rate constant of bzq and nan3 toward oh of 1 2 109 and 1 1 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively at neutral ph 27 28 judging from the small increment for additional retardation resulted from bzq nan3 than those of tba etoh both 1o2 and o2 did participate in the degradation of tc the half life of o2 was less than 1 ns much shorter than so4 30 40 μs 1o2 3 5 μs and oh 20 ns 29 30 in light of the differences in the half life times and oxidation ability of radicals so4 and oh would have the priority to react with tc than o2 and 1o2 31 32 to further confirm the existence of the four ross mentioned above electron paramagnetic resonance epr was employed using dmpo and temp as typical spin trapping reagents dmpo and temp as the probe compound were used to identify the generation of so4 oh o2 and 1o2 through the formation of spin adducts including dmpo so4 dmpo oh dmpo ooh and tempo respectively a strong signal of four consecutive peaks with relative intensities of 1 2 2 1 was detected after the addition of pms matching well with the dmpo oh spectra fig 4a 3 the signal for dmpo so4 was detected spontaneously with the relative intensities of 1 2 1 2 18 this phenomenon confirmed the successful activation of pms by lco to produce so4 and oh which was well consistent with the traditional trapping tests besides the appearance of 1 1 1 1 dmpo ooh and 1 1 1 tempo signals provided solid evidences for the presence of o2 and 1o2 fig 4b and c 33 the intermediate products generated in tc degradation over lacoo3 pms system were identified by uplc ms fig s8 based on the generation of degradation products with lower molecular weight m z 220 three degradation pathways could be proposed fig 5 initially the ring structure of tc was attacked by ross i e so4 oh 1o2 and o2 and further transformed into smaller molecules with progressive ring opening then hydroxylation occurred due to the generation of intermediates with m z of 460 and 461 afterwards the intermediates with m z of 414 were obtained by demethylation under the attack of ross compared to the relevant studies on the degradation of tc by activated pms several degradation intermediates i e p3 m z 415 p7 m z 274 and p8 m z 258 were frequently detected whereas those with much lower m z i e p9 p10 p11 and p12 m z 190 varied with the catalysts 34 36 this can be justified by the intermediates with much lower m z resulted from the loss of some functional groups from the higher ones but in light of the toc removal 70 in 6 h fig s6 tc and its associated intermediates could be mineralized into co2 and h2o based on the above analysis the preliminary degradation mechanism could be proposed in control experiments the sole lacoo3 could remove tc to a certain extent 10 which is attributed to the adsorption on catalyst solely pms addition could degrade partial tc ca 50 as pms contained hso5 anion with strong oxidation ability which could self decompose into so4 radical 37 however the reaction between tc and inactivated pms just transformed tc into other 4 ring molecules rather than smaller molecules with less ring structure 38 with the co existence of pms and lacoo3 most tc was degraded and then mineralized based on the quenching tests except for the dominant so4 and oh oxidation 1o2 and o2 also took part in the removal of tc so4 and oh were originated from pms decomposition by self decomposition or by lacoo3 catalysis eqs 1 4 based on some previous researches the generation of 1o2 mainly followed the self decomposition of pms at the rate constant of 0 2 m 1 s 1 eq 5 39 40 the generated 1o2 could adhere to tc directly to induce oxidative reactions due to its high redox potential 39 40 additionally 1o2 could be also generated through the recombination of o2 eq 6 41 but this reaction would consume a great amount of h since the tc degradation was mainly carried out under neutral ph the above reaction could be constrained thus o2 should exist in the reaction system and act as an effective radical the formation of o2 was far more complicated 42 based on eqs 7 12 o2 was generated through a series of processes including decomposition and composition of hso5 and oh 1 c o 3 hs o 5 c o 2 s o 5 h 2 c o 2 hs o 5 c o 3 s o 4 oh 3 c o 2 hs o 5 c o 3 s o 4 2 oh 4 hs o 5 oh s o 4 5 so 5 2 hso 5 o 2 1 hso 4 so 4 2 6 2 o 2 2 h h 2 o 2 o 2 1 7 oh hso 5 h so 5 oh 8 oh h e h 2 o 9 s o 4 h e hs o 4 10 hso 5 h 2 o h 2 o 2 hso 4 11 oh h 2 o 2 ho 2 h 2 o 12 ho 2 h o 2 3 4 effect of co existing inorganic anions on degradation efficiency several kinds of inorganic anions including cl h2po4 no3 and so4 2 which were widely detected in real wastewaters or natural waters were chosen to test their influence on the degradation efficiency of tc at neutral ph generally most of the selected inorganic anions posed positive effects on the degradation of tc at different extent fig 6 among all the tested anions h2po4 showed the best outcome the remaining concentration of tc went down to zero in 30 min after the addition of h2po4 far more effective than the control system without inorganic anions this observation contradicts to the results of some aops where h2po4 showed inhibitory effect on pms activation 43 however as a nucleophile h2po4 was easy to attack pms due to its asymmetric structure this induced a quick decay of pms 44 and rapid generation of active species such as so4 and oh leading to the effective degradation of tc this was reported feasible in an analogous study carried out by li et al in 2019 45 because h2po4 itself seldom consumes or reacts with free radicals the addition of h2po4 therefore likely increases the steady state concentrations of oh and so4 in the solution and then accelerates tc removal this can be shown in fig s7 where the increase of h2po4 resulted in the less residual of tc similar effect was also observed on reaction systems e g cofe2o4 oxone and femn bimetallic catalysts with nitrogen doped graphene pms 26 46 the addition of cl in the lacoo3 pms also strongly accelerated the tc degradation which diverged from the frequently reported character of cl as a free radical scavenger the positive effect of cl could be explained by eqs 13 15 47 cl could be oxidized by both pms and so4 to active chlorine species for example hocl was the dominant chlorine species in acidic solution while clo3 with less strong oxidizing ability was the main species at higher ph eq 16 moreover cl2 and cl might also be generated through nonradical pathways 48 therefore active chlorine contributed to the degradation of tc in the lacoo3 pms system because there is no trace of chlorinated intermediates in the lc ms analysis the role of active chlorine species should be simply oxidants rather than sources of substitution reactions 13 2 cl h hso 5 so 4 2 cl 2 h 2 o 14 cl s o 4 so 4 2 cl 15 cl cl cl 2 16 ocl 2 hclo clo 3 2 hcl different from previous studies the addition of so4 2 surprisingly promoted the reaction as the residue tc was further reduced to less than 5 fig 6 comparing to that of anion free reaction theoretically so4 2 is at a fully oxidized state and generally considered as an inert ion in the solution owing to its much slower reactivity toward oh and so4 so4 2 was not a scavenger and did not react with the free radicals in the process 49 50 the possible reason for the so4 2 in promoting the reaction is likely through a proper kinetics control of generating radicals in the solution by minimizing the sharp peak of radical which is known to induce unwanted futile side reactions and minimize the waste of the precious radicals so that the overall removal tc is increased in the long run as show by eqs 17 18 so4 can react with h2o and oh to form oh while the presence of high so4 2 i e the end product of so4 after its usage at the beginning of the reaction can effectively slow down but not consume the formation of both so4 and oh this mechanism maintains a healthy concentration of radicals in the solution and minimize the chance of boosting a peak radical in the solution the risk of futile consumption of free radicals in the solution is therefore reduced and the overall performance in removal of tc in the lacoo3 pms process promoted 17 all phs s o 4 h 2 o so 4 2 oh h 18 alkaline phs s o 4 oh so 4 2 oh for no3 the influence on degradation was insignificant as the residue tc was about 7 after 30 min degradation close to the control group at 10 comparing to the other anions the interference caused by no3 on the pms based aops was commonly lower most of the relative researches indicated that obvious retardation usually become appreciable when no3 is higher than 50 mm 51 52 in this work the studied of the effect of no3 on the degradation of tc by lco pms was less than 10 mm as nitrate concentration within pharmaceutical wastewater commonly ranged between 50 and 800 ppm 53 54 the major reason for the weak influence from no3 on tc degradation was the relatively slow reaction rate between so4 and no3 k 2 1 102 m 1 s 1 ph 7 as indicated in eq 19 55 57 comparing to those of other anions such as h2po4 k 7 106 m 1 s 1 and cl k 2 5 108 m 1 s 1 the rate of no3 was 104 to 106 order lower thus it showed neglectable scavenging effect and posed almost no interference on the degradation of tc 56 58 19 n o 3 s o 4 so 4 2 n o 3 besides another research indicated that the existence of no3 was beneficial to the generation of active oxygen 59 the traditional trapping experiments and epr tests both confirmed the positive roles of 1o2 and o2 in the removal of tc which helped to demonstrate to the promotion of tc oxidation similar conclusions were widely reported by other researches using sulfate radical aops 43 55 the tests with additional lower concentration of inorganic anions i e 5 mmol l 1 were carried out the promotion effect was also observed and generally slower than those at 10 mmol l 1 fig s7 3 5 effect of co existing organic matters on degradation efficiency previous research suggests that co existing organic matter might suppress the so4 based processes 57 to evaluate this hypothesis in the degradation of tc under the lacoo3 pms system humic acid ha was chosen for investigation ha is normally detected in the range 5 20 mg l 1 which might greatly affect the water quality 21 60 thus the amount of ha in the reaction system was set between 5 and 20 mg l 1 when the dosage was 5 mg l 1 or lower ha was slightly favourable to the degradation fig 7 this might be caused by the formation of semiquinone radicals which could be generated from the oxygen containing functional groups in ha and subsequently effectively stimulate pms to form oh and so4 60 the semiquinone radicals from ha have been reported capable to activate pms via a self redox cycle promoting the formation of oh and so4 and accordingly tc degradation 61 furthermore the coordination between ha and some metal ions within lacoo3 might also have generated some oxidative intermediate products leading to the formation of oh and o2 these radicals may help to promote the degradation given that o2 was later proved to be one of the working free radicles under the lacoo3 pms system 62 however some inhibition effect was observed at higher concentrations this was mainly due to the quenching effect of ha on sulfate radicals with the increasing concentration of ha to even higher than 10 mg l 1 the degradation of tc by lco pms system was gradually retarded similar inhibition caused by higher dosage of ha was also observed in some other sulfate based aops this was attributed largely to the competition of so4 radicals between ha and tc 19 another possibility was the deeper blockage of active sites on the surface of lco caused by the functional groups including phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl of excessive ha 63 this situation would lower the chances for pms or tc adhering on the surface of lco therefore the lower ha concentration i e 5 mg l 1 could improve the process but higher ha concentration 10 mg l 1 would induce a retardation 4 conclusions in this study the lacoo3 pms system exhibited excellent tc degradation along with a satisfied mineralization ability and stable reusability under the optimal degradation condition at neutral ph 90 of tc were removed in 30 min based on the traditional trapping experiments and epr spectra free radicals including so4 oh 1o2 and o2 were involved the main degradation pathways of tc mainly include demethylation hydroxylation and ring opening reactions the degradation performance was accelerated in the presence of common inorganic anions e g cl h2po4 and so4 2 as well as humid acid at low concentration this indicates the strong environmental adaptability of the lacoo3 pms system generally the lacoo3 pms system was proved to be a rapid economical and stable approach for the degradation of tc which provided a novel strategy for pms activation aiming at antibiotic removal

13344,in this research novel chemically expanded graphite eg modified by magnesium oxide mgo nanoparticles were synthesized and applied to remove phosphate from aqueous solutions the seawater was also used instead of magnesium chloride mgcl2 as a source of magnesium ions which indicated similar promising results different analyses investigated the characteristics of the adsorbent the field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem images energy dispersive spectroscopy eds and the x ray diffraction xrd analysis indicated that mgo nanoparticles were immobilized on eg surface crystalline structures furthermore raman and fourier transform infrared ftir spectra displayed the surface functional groups of the adsorbent the brunauer emmett teller bet analysis indicated the surface areas of 10 99 to 26 92 m2 g for eg and composite respectively the maximum adsorption capacity of the composite was observed at the mgo eg mass ratio of 0 52 the interfering effects of co existing so4 2 cl no3 ions were also studied and the results showed that commonly co existing ions have no significant impact on the adsorption process kinetics experiments were conducted to understand the adsorption mechanism of the study the experimental data were well fitted with pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models the experimental equilibrium data were fitted into the langmuir model demonstrating a remarkable adsorption capacity of 491 6 mg g for the phosphate at the initial ph of 7 the adsorbent dosage of 1 g l and contact time of 90 min the feasibility of the eg mgo application for the post treatment of real municipal effluent was also examined confirming excellent phosphate removal keywords phosphate removal adsorption expanded graphite municipal effluent magnesium oxide 1 introduction one of the essential nutrients for the growth of living organisms in aquatic ecosystems is phosphate however the excessive presence of phosphate in urban effluents can accelerate eutrophication 1 leading to a decrease in dissolved oxygen content and a decline in water quality 2 discharging municipal effluents containing a high concentration of phosphate into the aquatic environments seems to be ongoing due to inefficient conventional wastewater treatment systems 3 hence developing efficient strategies for phosphate removal is crucial 4 to date several methods have been used for phosphate removal including chemical precipitation biological removal adsorption reverse osmosis ion exchange membrane and constructed wetland 5 10 chemical precipitation is known for its great potential toward phosphate removal although it is considered an inefficient treatment system due to exorbitance sludge production and expensive disposal system 11 biological activated sludge treatment systems are also proved to be a good and efficient technique for municipal wastewater treatment however it is limited for phosphate elimination because of variable operational conditions if phosphate concentrations in wastewater influent overpass designed margin the excessive phosphate would discharge to the aquatic environment from municipal wastewater treatment plants 12 therefore there is an urgent need to apply new treatment techniques as post treatment for phosphate removal using resins in the ion exchange process 12 and reverse osmosis 13 are examples of new phosphate removal approaches that also face problems like rather a low removal efficiency and fouling respectively among advanced treatment methods adsorption is recognized as one of the most effective approaches due to its low cost operation high selectivity and easy operation compared to the widely used techniques in wastewater treatment such as biological treatment systems 14 15 common adsorbents such as bentonite 16 activated carbon 17 zeolites and metal hydroxide 18 were extensively used for phosphate removal in previous studies 19 which indicated restricted adsorption capacity and other limitations such as required precise ph or other operational conditions the nano materials specially carbonaceous nano materials are substantially have been used in different water and wastewater treatment systems in recent years thanks to their outstanding characteristic such as higher surface areas and reactivity 20 among the carbon based materials expanded graphite eg is flexible porous durable at high temperatures and chemically inert there are many reports for using eg in various fields such as electrochemical thermal insulation adsorption process and catalytic ozonation 21 23 eg has a high possibility of mass production cost performance 24 low density large specific surface area high loading capacity and uniform dispersion in water moreover eg has been extensively applied to eliminate organic pollutants such as xylenol orange oil organic dyes toluene and sulfadiazine 25 meanwhile metal oxides have attracted attention for their industrial usage as adsorbents catalysts and catalyst supports 26 in particular magnesium oxide mgo is noted for removing the pollutants such as phosphate owing to its high abundance cost effectiveness easy preparation 27 furthermore it is a nontoxic and eco friendly substance 28 in previous studies mgo exhibited high efficiency for phosphate adsorption from water and wastewater jing indicated that mgo modified diatomite is a promising adsorbent for phosphate recovery in a wide ph range of 3 9 29 several researches have been performed on phosphate removal from aqueous solutions using different nanocomposites yang et al reported that polymer based cerium hydroxide is a stable nanocomposite for phosphate removal 30 zhao et al have reported enhanced phosphate removal by metal oxides such as zro2 31 haddad reported biochar derived from pretreated cypress sawdust with mgcl2 as an effective material for phosphorus recovery from aqueous solutions 32 also li has reported extraordinary adsorption capacity for mgo decorated on biochar for phosphate removal as another example of promising magnesium oxide coated on bio based materials 33 the relatively low surface area of expanded graphite 34 and agglomeration of mgo nanoparticle when used as sole adsorbent 35 are the main drawbacks of mentioned materials despite high selectivity for phosphate removal some research has been conducted using porous material like biochar as bedding for mgo nanoparticles support 36 in recent years using a natural source of obtaining materials to apply in scientific lab works and consequently in practical works gained lots of attention for example hydroxyapatite was mentioned as a natural material with various applications in different fields 37 38 some other studies also reported the feasibility of seawater as a cheap source of some valuable materials 39 therefore in this study eg was generated as a porous material coated by mgo to prevent mgo nanoparticles accumulation and provide a single layer of adsorbent attached on porous media to enhance its adsorption capacity the main aim of the present work is synthesizing eg loaded with mgo eg mgo as a novel composite for phosphate removal from synthetic solutions and real municipal effluent a series of batch adsorption desorption experiments were conducted and the effect of some parameters including ph contact time initial phosphate concentrations adsorbent dosage temperature and co existing ions on phosphate adsorption were investigated also the adsorption of phosphate from municipal effluent using eg mgo was examined the natural saline seawater was also applied as a replacement for mgcl2 to consider environment friendly aspects for synthesizing eg mgo in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials chemicals used in this study

phosphate stock solution all the standard solutions were prepared with distilled water sodium hydroxide naoh 1 mol l and hydrochloric acid hcl 1 mol l were used to adjust ph 2 2 preparation of eg mgo nanocomposite 2 2 1 synthesizing chemically expanded graphite the expanded graphite eg was prepared using the typically reported method by lin 40 41 briefly 1 g of graphite flakes mesh 100 and 8 5 g of cro3 were mixed with 7 ml of hcl solution 37 wt then the mixture was stirred for 2 h at 25 c the obtained particles were washed with deionized water three times to remove the excess of cro3 the washed particles were immersed in 40 ml h2o2 30 wt for 20 h finally eg particles were washed several times with deionized water to remove residual cro3 and h2o2 2 2 2 mgo nanoparticles immobilization on the eg surface the method used in this section was inspired by studies that used mgo for the impregnation of similar material to eg with minor modification 42 briefly 2 66 g of mgcl2 6h2o was dissolved in 20 ml of deionized water and then 1 g of expanded graphite was added into the solution the mixture was stirred for 5 min at 25 c afterward the ph solution was adjusted to 11 5 by adding a naoh solution 0 1 mol l resulting in the formation of mg oh 2 into the eg porous structure after stirring for 1 h the gel like composite was stirred and dried on a heater stirrer then it was placed in an oven at 80 c overnight the resultant solid was put into a reactor tube purged with n2 then it was calcinated in a hot furnace at 600 c with a heating rate of 10 c min for one hour this procedure was also conducted at temperatures of 100 200 400 and 700 c to obtain the nanocomposite with the highest adsorption capacity for phosphate removal the schematic presentation of nanocomposite preparation is demonstrated in fig s1 2 3 characterization analysis of eg mgo the field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem mira3 tescan france was applied to display the surface morphology of eg mgo also the energy dispersive spectroscopy eds was employed to indicate the elemental composition of adsorbents the x ray diffraction xrd of eg mgo was obtained by an x ray diffractometer philips england operated at 40 kv and 30 ma in the range of 1 2θ 90 raman spectra were recorded techsan n541 iran in a range of 200 to 4400 cm 1 at room temperature the fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy ray leigh 510a china was conducted in the range of 400 to 4000 cm 1 to acquire ftir spectra of eg and eg mgo to demonstrate surface functional groups specific surface areas pore volumes and average pore diameter were examined using the brunauer emmett teller bet analyzer tristar ii plus micromeritics usa 2 4 effect of experimental parameters and optimization numerous experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of different experimental variables on phosphate adsorption by eg mgo the influence of different initial ph values 2 to 11 mgo eg mass ratios 0 1 to 2 and phosphate concentrations 10 to 2000 mg l and contact times 1 to 120 min were evaluated to find optimum conditions furthermore some experiments with different adsorbent dosages were carried out to find the most cost effective amount the range of mentioned parameters was chosen according to similar papers cited in this study and the pre tests carried out for the research 2 5 batch adsorption experiments phosphate stock solution 1000 mg l was prepared by dissolving a 0 4 g of tri sodium phosphate dodecahydrate na3po4 12h2o into 99 6 ml deionized water all adsorption experiments were performed by adding a 0 05 g of adsorbent in 50 ml of the sample after being stirred for 3 h at 25 c sample solutions were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min to separate residual particles of the adsorbent the initial phosphate concentration and the final phosphate concentration in the samples were determined with a uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr5000 usa according to standard methods 43 all experiments were conducted three times and the average values were reported with an error bar demonstrating a variation range of experimental results eg mgo adsorption capacity and total phosphate removal were calculated by the following equations 44 1 q t c 0 c t volume of the solution mass of the adsorbent 2 q e c 0 c e volume of the solution mass of the adsorbent 3 removal efficiency c 0 c e c 0 100 where qt represents phosphate adsorbed by the adsorbent at time t mg g c0 and ce are phosphate concentrations in sample solutions before and after the adsorption process and qe indicates phosphate adsorbed at the equilibrium state the kinetics data were simulated on three common models for phosphate concentration of 100 and 10 mg l in the optimum experimental conditions to gain more insights

each cycle the adsorbent was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min then stirred for 2 h in 0 25 mol l naoh solution and washed with deionized water three times afterward it was dried at 80 c for 2 h after that the adsorbent was used in another cycle according to the mentioned method two sets of experiments were carried out on real wastewater instead of synthetic phosphate solution to evaluate eg mgo adsorption efficiency in real samples the sample was taken from shoosh wastewater treatment plant effluent in tehran iran to evaluate the seawater as a natural source of mgo 1 g of prepared expanded graphite was added to 318 ml of seawater then its ph was adjusted to 11 5 so the mg oh 2 was precipitated on the eg surface the next steps were followed according to the method presented in section 2 2 2 to obtain the final eg mgo adsorbent the water used for this work was provided from the caspian sea iran in this section a set of experiments was carried out on 10 mg l phosphate samples to investigate the effect of adsorbent synthesized using seawater for phosphate removal compared to the adsorbent synthesized using mgcl2 2 6 determination of phzpc 250 ml of 0 1 mol l kcl solution was prepared and added to 8 flasks of 25 ml to investigate phzpc 0 1 mol l naoh or hcl solutions were used to adjust the ph in the range of 2 12 and 0 25 g adsorbent was introduced to each flask the suspension was shaken for 24 h and the final ph was recorded after centrifuging the adsorbent from the solution to investigate phzpc 2 7 effect of co existing ions to consider the negative effects of co existing ions on the phosphate adsorption different solutions containing 100 mg l phosphates were spiked with 200 mg l l so4 2 cl no3 k and na the stock solutions of related ions 1000 mg l and phosphate ions 1000 mg l were prepared then the appropriate amount of phosphate ion and each interfering ion were transferred to a volumetric flask and diluted with deionized water this procedure was repeated to prepare all solutions containing phosphate ions and one interfering ion the phosphate adsorption of the prepared samples was investigated under the optimum conditions 2 8 error analysis the root mean square error rmse and chi square test χ2 were implicated on the base of the eqs 10 and 11 to compromise between experimental data and their conformity to practiced models 10 rmse 1 n p i

thermodynamic studies 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization all the characterization analyses were conducted on mgo eg with an optimum mass ratio of 0 50 the surface morphology of the eg and eg mgo was investigated by fesem as it is displayed in fig 1 a clear morphological distinction between eg and eg mgo can be observed it has been illustrated in images that mgo nanoparticles 20 to 40 nm are distributed effectively on and into eg hive like structures 48 providing a large number of active sites for adsorbing po4 3 ions according to eds analysis fig 2a and b mg and o on the surface of eg mgo were 12 55 and 25 96 respectively showing the immobilization of mgo nanoparticles on the eg surface structures the mg distribution was further confirmed by electron mapping fig 2f as expected eds spectrum mapping displayed that c was distributed uniformly and mg had an integrated proportion with o distribution in the eg mgo sample fig 2d f xrd patterns of eg and eg mgo can be seen in fig 3a in eg the diffraction peaks at 2θ of 26 8 and 54 8 are responsible for typical carbon diffraction and can be designated to 002 and 211 planes which are conformed to standard expanded graphite xrd patterns as illustrated in the eg mgo spectrum these two peaks have widened after immobilization of mgo nanoparticles covering the eg surface which is an indication of maintaining its crystalline structure 49 for mgo three new peaks in 36 9 42 9 and 62 2 which are corresponding to 111 200 and 220 respectively are detected as another sign of mgo nanoparticles distribution in the eg structure 2 50 fig 3b displays raman spectra of eg and eg mgo two distinguished bands in the eg spectrum at 1349 cm 1 and 1590 cm 1 are known as d and g bands the intensity of the d band is related to carbon structure defects 51 and the intensity of the g band is related to the vibration mode of graphite 52 which was decreased after surface modification by mgo resulting in wider peaks in the eg mgo spectrum this finding is also confirmed by the intensity ratio of bands id ig the id ig ratio increased from 0 34 in the eg sample to 0 89 in the eg mgo resulting in the disorder of hybridized and crystalline graphitic carbon 53 54 ftir spectroscopy was employed to indicate surface functional groups of the eg before and after mgo nanoparticles immobilization as fig 3c exhibits the eg spectrum before deposition of mgo has certain characteristic peaks the major peaks at 3434 and 1636 cm 1 are assigned to the vibration of oh bands because of the adsorption of the water molecules on the surface of the nanocomposite another major peak is attributed to the no group which is shown at 1385 cm 1 the minor peaks at 2927 and 2855 cm 1 correspond to the stretching vibration of ch bonds the other little peaks at 2341 and 1050 cm 1 can be related to coc vibration bands 55 56 in the eg mgo spectrum most of the major and minor peaks remained with less intensity witnessing water elimination in the interlayer areas 57 however some new peaks were found after adding the mgo onto the eg surface the most distinguished newly formed peak after mgo immobilization is at 1432 cm 1 which defines a hydroxyl group and two wide peaks at 609 and 431 cm 1 which is related to the mgo o bands 58 the bet analysis by n2 adsorption desorption is presented in fig s2a and b for eg and eg mgo respectively in addition the surface and textural properties of the eg and eg mgo were also investigated and results are displayed in table 1 as it can be found from the table the specific surface area and total pore volumes increased significantly due to the successful deposition of the mgo particles providing a more efficient adsorbent with a higher adsorption capacity for adsorbing phosphate ions furthermore the increase in surface area results from spherical mgo nanoparticles deposited on eg and resulting in rougher surface also another reason for the increase in surface area can be attributed to the calcination of eg mgo at a temperature of 600 c which results in the exfoliation of graphite layers and larger surface area meanwhile as anticipated the average pore diameters decreased because of the distribution of mgo nano size particles over the eg network that created smaller pore diameters the average pore volume also increased from 0 051 to 0 158 cm3 g for eg and eg mgo respectively indicating that mgo nanoparticle immobilization created more hollows and pores in the adsorbent structure 3 2 optimization of eg mgo adsorbent and adsorption process 3 2 1 effect of mgo eg mass ratio the mass ratio has a considerable influence on the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of phosphate as fig 4a depicts it can be concluded that the mass ratio has a significant role in the performance of the composite for the removal of phosphate as the textural properties of adsorbent would vary as the amount of mgo loaded on expanded graphite increases the maximum adsorption capacity 515 mg g and removal efficiency 61 took place at the mass ratio of 0 5 mgo eg this behavior can be explained in the concept of providing the higher mgo nanoparticles per total mass of the composite but after the mass ratio of 0 52 available mgo nanoparticles is constant whereas the total mass of the composite increases thereby decreasing the available mgo nanoparticles per total mass of the composite the eg with no mgo immobilization was also examined for phosphate adsorption which showed negligible adsorption capacity less than 0 75 mg g toward phosphate ions these results were consistent with the reported literature for the application of exfoliated graphite oxide for phosphate adsorption 59 3 2 2 effect of solution ph the solution ph plays a critical role in the adsorption process the adsorbate and adsorbent existing forms and their surface charges are corresponding to solution ph 30 60 the effect of initial ph varying from 2 to 11 is presented in fig 4b the results indicated in fig s3 show the zero point of charge phzpc of 11 2 for eg mgo therefore it can be concluded that as ph decreases from 11 2 ph phzpc the positive charge of the adsorbent increases as can be seen in fig 4b adsorption of phosphate gradually increased from 150 to 415 mg g as the initial ph changed from 11 to 7 reaching the highest adsorption capacity this is due to the stronger electrostatic interaction between negatively charged phosphate ions and the positively charged surface of the adsorbent leading to elevated phosphate removal 61 when the ph decreased from 7 to 2 the adsorption capacity declined from 415 to 65 mg g one explanation for this behavior is due to a decrease in the surface charge of phosphate in the strongly acidic environment thereby decreasing the electrostatic interaction between adsorbates and adsorbents another reason for the decrease in phosphate removal is attributed to the dissolution of mgo and mg oh 2 in acidic conditions 60 these results are consistent with the effect of ph on the different forms of phosphate ions which are shown in fig s4 a decrease in phosphate removal when the ph values decrease to 6 and lower is due to h₂po₄ and h₃po₄ formation which have lower negative charges thereby causing less interaction between adsorbents and phosphate ions and reducing the effect of the increase in the adsorbent positive charge surface it is noteworthy that optimum ph occurred at ph 7 which is at the neutral zone leading to convenience operation under practical conditions 3 2 3 effect of sample concentration and contact time fig 4c shows the effect of phosphate concentrations in the range of 10 to 2000 mg l on the adsorption capacity and the removal efficiency the adsorption capacity soared significantly as the phosphate concentration reached 2000 mg l however removal efficiency declined because of low active sites for adsorbing phosphate ions the number of phosphate ions in lower concentrations was less than active sites provided from eg mgo resulting in higher phosphate removal still in higher phosphate concentrations the situation was reversed due to excessive phosphate ions and lack of sufficient active sites some phosphate ions remained in the solution causing lower total phosphate removal 62 additional information about time and concentration dependant factors will be discussed in the kinetics and isotherm section fig 4d demonstrates the experimental results of the impact of contact time on the removal efficiency of phosphate at different concentrations of phosphate 10 and 100 mg l it is conspicuous that the removal efficiency of phosphate reached equilibrium around 90 min and further time was not effective on the removal efficiency comparing the two curves it can be concluded that phosphate concentration also plays a vital role in removal efficiency by decreasing the phosphate concentration the removal efficiency increased as a consequence of enough adsorption sites for adsorbing the phosphate ions 3 2 4 effect of adsorbent dosage adsorbent dosage is one of the fundamental parameters of the adsorption study as it is illuminated in fig 4e and f the impact of adsorbent dosage was explored on different concentrations of phosphate 100 and 10 mg l it can be implied that the removal efficiency increased dramatically by increasing the adsorbent dosage from 0 2 to 1 g l this could be ascribed as the extra adsorption sites provided by eg mgo nanocomposite which leads to enhancement in phosphate removal efficiency by the further increment of adsorbent dosage phosphate removal soared slightly the curves have flattened in the adsorbent dosage over 1 to 2 g l taking the cost effective aspect of the experiment into consideration the optimal adsorbent dosage for eg mgo adsorbent would seem to be around 1 g l 3 2 5 effect of co existing ions to have practical implications of phosphate removal from aqueous solutions it is essential to evaluate the impact of co existing ions on the adsorption process a variety of anions so4 2 cl no3 and cations k and na are always found in natural water and wastewater which can interfere with phosphate adsorption 63 to analyze the effect of each ion on adsorption capacity numerous similar experiments were carried out on the samples containing 100 mg l of phosphate spiked with 200 mg l of each ion the adsorbent dosage of 2 g l was used in these conducted tests the effect of the mentioned co existing ions on phosphate adsorption is presented in fig 5 the results revealed that interfering ions had little chance to compete with phosphate for binding on the active sites due to the high selectivity of eg mgo for adsorbing the phosphate ion 25 the three common anions such as cl so4 2 and no3 had a greater adverse impact on the adsorption process respectively 3 3 adsorption kinetics the adsorption capacity of adsorbent versus time was investigated for the determination of the experimental kinetic parameters it was observed that the sorption of phosphate into eg mgo active sites happened at high velocity in the first 5 min after that the sorption of adsorbate occurred at a slower rate and reached equilibrium around 90 min of reaction time the kinetics model parameters and the related plots are presented in table 2 and fig 6 respectively it can be seen that the second pseudo order model is in better agreement with experimental data with the highest correlation coefficient r2 of 0 9980 in comparison with other models showing adsorption rate is strongly related to the numbers of free active sites 64 65 furthermore the experimental value of q e which is 8 9 and 57 5 mg g for 10 and 100 mg l of phosphate respectively is almost in close accordance with the calculated q e values 9 045 and 58 65 in contrast to calculated ones by the first pseudo order model the intraparticle diffusion model also had the lowest error function value and it was divided into two separately linear parts it is clear in fig 6c that at the beginning of the experiment the dominant adsorption mechanism is intraparticle diffusion showing diffusion of phosphate onto adsorbent pores is the controlling step of the adsorption rate as the reaction moves forward the value of k dif would decline due to gradual adsorption of phosphate indicating low phosphate concentration for the external mass transfer as a consequence the intraparticle diffusion is not the only step in the adsorption process which is proved by the non zero intercept of the second part of the plot 3 4 adsorption isotherms the equilibrium of phosphate adsorption onto eg mgo was investigated at a broad initial concentration ranging from 10 to 2000 mg l the adsorption capacity increased as it was mentioned in section 2 2 2 reaching the highest adsorption capacity of 460 mg g at the initial concentration of 2000 mg l the isotherm of phosphate onto eg mgo is shown in fig 7a and the values of the different isotherm model parameters can be found in table 3 the reproduced data for the langmuir and freundlich models are indicated in fig 7b and c comparing three critical factors of r2 rmse and χ2 it is conspicuous that the langmuir model is the better and more reasonable model to describe the experimental data the rl which is denoted as a separation factor for adsorption process favourability was between 0 and 1 0 rl 1 for all the conducted experiments at different phosphate concentrations implying that the adsorption process was favorable 66 the maximum adsorption capacity of 491 6 mg g expressed by the langmuir model is remarkably higher than that of other adsorbents applied for phosphate adsorption from aqueous solutions indicating that the prepared adsorbent can be used for the removal of high concentrations of phosphate table 4 presents the comparison between sorption capacities of different adsorbents reported for phosphate removal this table firmly confirms the excellent potential of eg mgo adsorbent over other adsorbents reported in the literature 3 5 thermodynamic analysis one of the factors affecting the adsorption process is temperature the impact of temperature on the adsorption capacity of phosphate is presented in fig s5a the increase of adsorption capacity of eg mgo due to the increase in temperature can be understood that phosphate adsorption is an endothermic process which was also proved by thermodynamic parameters analysis the three important parameters of free energy change δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs are displayed in table 5 they are calculated by the following equations 72 using van t hoff s law plot presented in fig s5b 12 δg rt ln k d 13 k d q e c e 14 ln k d δ s r δ h rt according to table 5 δg values for all observed temperatures are negative indicating that the adsorption of phosphate onto the eg mgo surface was spontaneous and feasible 62 the decrease of δg values by increasing temperature from 283 k to 333 k indicates that the process would be more spontaneous at higher temperatures the δh value of 14 77 kj mol reveals that the adsorption process is endothermic and because it is 40 kj mol it can be implied that physical adsorption might be the dominant interaction the positive value of δs also demonstrates phosphate ions have an excellent affinity toward eg mgo adsorbents 73 3 6 regeneration and reusability of eg mgo regeneration and reusability are the factors of great influence in adsorption studies the application of the adsorbent in several cycles leads to significant cost reduction series of regeneration experiments 5 cycles were conducted to evaluate the reusability of eg mgo 57 the results in fig 8 show the remarkable reusability of eg mgo it is pointed out that the removal efficiency decreased from 93 to 81 after five consecutive cycles establishing eg mgo is a promising adsorbent for several times uses in the adsorption processes 3 7 phosphate removal by eg mgo from the real municipal effluent actual phosphate concentrations in municipal wastewater are generally lower than concentrations studied in this work effluent characteristics used in this study to conduct experiments on the real samples are shown in table 6 according to epa discharge standards for municipal effluent the reported phosphate exceeded the environmental limits establishing the essential need for advanced post treatment to phosphate removal before releasing it to the environment the phosphate concentration of 7 8 mg l in the effluent decreased to 1 8 and 1 5 mg l using the adsorbent dosage of 1 and 1 5 g l respectively the phosphate removal efficiency of 77 and 80 within the contact time of 90 min are extremely similar to the obtained results confirming that the adsorbent is capable of being used for removing low concentrations of phosphate in real municipal effluent phosphate concentration after the adsorption process meets environmental discharge standards of epa po4 3 6 mg l 74 75 3 8 application of seawater as the source of mg2 for adsorbent preparation the real seawater contains a high concentration of mg2 in the form of mgcl2 to consider the environment friendly aspects of using existing natural materials instead of industrialized chemicals seawater can be utilized as a source of natural mgcl2 to synthesize magnesium oxide nanoparticles 76 77 in this study seawater from the caspian sea iran was supplied as the natural source of mg2 analyzing by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes indicated a concentration of 992 mg l for the mg2 ion in seawater the results indicated 91 and 89 phosphate removal for the adsorbent synthesized using seawater and mgcl2 respectively the adsorbent prepared using seawater showed the same performance as that prepared

13344,in this research novel chemically expanded graphite eg modified by magnesium oxide mgo nanoparticles were synthesized and applied to remove phosphate from aqueous solutions the seawater was also used instead of magnesium chloride mgcl2 as a source of magnesium ions which indicated similar promising results different analyses investigated the characteristics of the adsorbent the field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem images energy dispersive spectroscopy eds and the x ray diffraction xrd analysis indicated that mgo nanoparticles were immobilized on eg surface crystalline structures furthermore raman and fourier transform infrared ftir spectra displayed the surface functional groups of the adsorbent the brunauer emmett teller bet analysis indicated the surface areas of 10 99 to 26 92 m2 g for eg and composite respectively the maximum adsorption capacity of the composite was observed at the mgo eg mass ratio of 0 52 the interfering effects of co existing so4 2 cl no3

for the post treatment of real municipal effluent was also examined confirming excellent phosphate removal keywords phosphate removal adsorption expanded graphite municipal effluent magnesium oxide 1 introduction one of the essential nutrients for the growth of living organisms in aquatic ecosystems is phosphate however the excessive presence of phosphate in urban effluents can accelerate eutrophication 1 leading to a decrease in dissolved oxygen content and a decline in water quality 2 discharging municipal effluents containing a high concentration of phosphate into the aquatic environments seems to be ongoing due to inefficient conventional wastewater treatment systems 3 hence developing efficient strategies for phosphate removal is crucial 4 to date several methods have been used for phosphate removal including chemical precipitation biological removal adsorption reverse osmosis ion exchange membrane and constructed wetland 5 10 chemical precipitation is known for its great potential toward phosphate removal although it is considered an inefficient treatment system due to exorbitance sludge production and expensive disposal system 11 biological activated sludge treatment systems are also proved to be a good and efficient technique for municipal wastewater treatment however it is limited for phosphate elimination because of variable operational conditions if phosphate concentrations in wastewater influent overpass designed margin the excessive phosphate would discharge to the aquatic environment from municipal wastewater treatment plants 12 therefore there is an urgent need to apply new treatment techniques as post treatment for phosphate removal using resins in the ion exchange process 12 and reverse osmosis 13 are examples of new phosphate removal approaches that also face problems like rather a low removal efficiency and fouling respectively among advanced treatment methods adsorption is recognized as one of the most effective approaches due to its low cost operation high selectivity and easy operation compared to the widely used techniques in wastewater treatment such as biological treatment systems 14 15 common adsorbents such as bentonite 16 activated carbon 17 zeolites and metal hydroxide 18 were extensively used for phosphate removal in previous studies 19 which indicated restricted adsorption capacity and other limitations such as required precise ph or other operational conditions the nano materials specially carbonaceous nano materials are substantially have been used in different water and wastewater treatment systems in recent years thanks to their outstanding characteristic such as higher surface areas and reactivity 20 among the carbon based materials expanded graphite eg is flexible porous durable at high temperatures and chemically inert there are many reports for using eg in various fields such as electrochemical thermal insulation adsorption process and catalytic ozonation 21 23 eg has a high possibility of mass production cost performance 24 low density large specific surface area high loading capacity and uniform dispersion in water moreover eg has been extensively applied to eliminate organic pollutants such as xylenol orange oil organic dyes toluene and sulfadiazine 25 meanwhile metal oxides have attracted attention for their industrial usage as adsorbents catalysts and catalyst supports 26 in particular magnesium oxide mgo is noted for removing the pollutants such as phosphate owing to its high abundance cost effectiveness easy preparation 27 furthermore it is a nontoxic and eco friendly substance 28 in previous studies mgo exhibited high efficiency for phosphate adsorption from water and wastewater jing indicated that mgo modified diatomite is a promising adsorbent for phosphate recovery in a wide ph range of 3 9 29 several researches have been performed on phosphate removal from aqueous solutions using different nanocomposites yang et al reported that polymer based cerium hydroxide is a stable nanocomposite for phosphate removal 30 zhao et al have reported enhanced phosphate removal by metal oxides such as zro2 31 haddad reported biochar derived from pretreated cypress sawdust with mgcl2 as an effective material for phosphorus recovery from aqueous solutions 32 also li has reported extraordinary adsorption capacity for mgo decorated on biochar for phosphate removal as another example of promising magnesium oxide coated on bio based materials 33 the relatively low surface area of expanded graphite 34 and agglomeration of mgo nanoparticle when used as sole adsorbent 35 are the main drawbacks of mentioned materials despite high selectivity for phosphate removal some research has been conducted using porous material like biochar as bedding for mgo nanoparticles support 36 in recent years using a natural source of obtaining materials to apply in scientific lab works and consequently in practical works gained lots of attention for example hydroxyapatite was mentioned as a natural material with various applications in different fields 37 38 some other studies also reported the feasibility of seawater as a cheap source of some valuable materials 39 therefore in this study eg was generated as a porous material coated by mgo to prevent mgo nanoparticles accumulation and provide a single layer of adsorbent attached on porous media to enhance its adsorption capacity the main aim of the present work is synthesizing eg loaded with mgo eg mgo as a novel composite for phosphate removal from synthetic solutions and real municipal effluent a series of batch adsorption desorption experiments were conducted and the effect of some parameters including ph contact time initial phosphate concentrations adsorbent dosage temperature and co existing ions on phosphate adsorption were investigated also the adsorption of phosphate from municipal effluent using eg mgo was examined the natural saline seawater was also applied as a replacement for mgcl2 to consider environment friendly aspects for synthesizing eg mgo in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials chemicals used in this study

phosphate stock solution all the standard solutions were prepared with distilled water sodium hydroxide naoh 1 mol l and hydrochloric acid hcl 1 mol l were used to adjust ph 2 2 preparation of eg mgo nanocomposite 2 2 1 synthesizing chemically expanded graphite the expanded graphite eg was prepared using the typically reported method by lin 40 41 briefly 1 g of graphite flakes mesh 100 and 8 5 g of cro3 were mixed with 7 ml of hcl solution 37 wt then the mixture was stirred for 2 h at 25 c the obtained particles were washed with deionized water three times to remove the excess of cro3 the washed particles were immersed in 40 ml h2o2 30 wt for 20 h finally eg particles were washed several times with deionized water to remove residual cro3 and h2o2 2 2 2 mgo nanoparticles immobilization on the eg surface the method used in this section was inspired by studies that used mgo for the impregnation of similar material to eg with minor modification 42 briefly 2 66 g of mgcl2 6h2o was dissolved in 20 ml of deionized water and then 1 g of expanded graphite was added into the solution the mixture was stirred for 5 min at 25 c afterward the ph solution was adjusted to 11 5 by adding a naoh solution 0 1 mol l resulting in the formation of mg oh 2 into the eg porous structure after stirring for 1 h the gel like composite was stirred and dried on a heater stirrer then it was placed in an oven at 80 c overnight the resultant solid was put into a reactor tube purged with n2 then it was calcinated in a hot furnace at 600 c with a heating rate of 10 c min for one hour this procedure was also conducted at temperatures of 100 200 400 and 700 c to obtain the nanocomposite with the highest adsorption capacity for phosphate removal the schematic presentation of nanocomposite preparation is demonstrated in fig s1 2 3 characterization analysis of eg mgo the field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem mira3 tescan france was applied to display the surface morphology of eg mgo also the energy dispersive spectroscopy eds was employed to indicate the elemental composition of adsorbents the x ray diffraction xrd of eg mgo was obtained by an x ray diffractometer philips england operated at 40 kv and 30 ma in the range of 1 2θ 90 raman spectra were recorded techsan n541 iran in a range of 200 to 4400 cm 1 at room temperature the fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy ray leigh 510a china was conducted in the range of 400 to 4000 cm 1 to acquire ftir spectra of eg and eg mgo to demonstrate surface functional groups specific surface areas pore volumes and average pore diameter were examined using the brunauer emmett teller bet analyzer tristar ii plus micromeritics usa 2 4 effect of experimental parameters and optimization numerous experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of different experimental variables on phosphate adsorption by eg mgo the influence of different initial ph values 2 to 11 mgo eg mass ratios 0 1 to 2 and phosphate concentrations 10 to 2000 mg l and contact times 1 to 120 min were evaluated to find optimum conditions furthermore some experiments with different adsorbent dosages were carried out to find the most cost effective amount the range of mentioned parameters was chosen according to similar papers cited in this study and the pre tests carried out for the research 2 5 batch adsorption experiments phosphate stock solution 1000 mg l was prepared by dissolving a 0 4 g of tri sodium phosphate dodecahydrate na3po4 12h2o into 99 6 ml deionized water all adsorption experiments were performed by adding a 0 05 g of adsorbent in 50 ml of the sample after being stirred for 3 h at 25 c sample solutions were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min to separate residual particles of the adsorbent the initial phosphate concentration and the final phosphate concentration in the samples were determined with a uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr5000 usa according to standard methods 43 all experiments were conducted three times and the average values were reported with an error bar demonstrating a variation range of experimental results eg mgo adsorption capacity and total phosphate removal were calculated by the following equations 44 1 q t c 0 c t volume of the solution mass of the adsorbent 2 q e c 0 c e volume of the solution mass of the adsorbent 3 removal efficiency c 0 c e c 0 100 where qt represents phosphate adsorbed by the adsorbent at time t mg g c0 and ce are phosphate concentrations in sample solutions before and after the adsorption process and qe indicates phosphate adsorbed at the equilibrium state the kinetics data were simulated on three common models for phosphate concentration of 100 and 10 mg l in the optimum experimental conditions to gain more insights

each cycle the adsorbent was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min then stirred for 2 h in 0 25 mol l naoh solution and washed with deionized water three times afterward it was dried at 80 c for 2 h after that the adsorbent was used in another cycle according to the mentioned method two sets of experiments were carried out on real wastewater instead of synthetic phosphate solution to evaluate eg mgo adsorption efficiency in real samples the sample was taken from shoosh wastewater treatment plant effluent in tehran iran to evaluate the seawater as a natural source of mgo 1 g of prepared expanded graphite was added to 318 ml of seawater then its ph was adjusted to 11 5 so the mg oh 2 was precipitated on the eg surface the next steps were followed according to the method presented in section 2 2 2 to obtain the final eg mgo adsorbent the water used for this work was provided from the caspian sea iran in this section a set of experiments was carried out on 10 mg l phosphate samples to investigate the effect of adsorbent synthesized using seawater for phosphate removal compared to the adsorbent synthesized using mgcl2 2 6 determination of phzpc 250 ml of 0 1 mol l kcl solution was prepared and added to 8 flasks of 25 ml to investigate phzpc 0 1 mol l naoh or hcl solutions were used to adjust the ph in the range of 2 12 and 0 25 g adsorbent was introduced to each flask the suspension was shaken for 24 h and the final ph was recorded after centrifuging the adsorbent from the solution to investigate phzpc 2 7 effect of co existing ions to consider the negative effects of co existing ions on the phosphate adsorption different solutions containing 100 mg l phosphates were spiked with 200 mg l l so4 2 cl no3 k and na the stock solutions of related ions 1000 mg l and phosphate ions 1000 mg l were prepared then the appropriate amount of phosphate ion and each interfering ion were transferred to a volumetric flask and diluted with deionized water this procedure was repeated to prepare all solutions containing phosphate ions and one interfering ion the phosphate adsorption of the prepared samples was investigated under the optimum conditions 2 8 error analysis the root mean square error rmse and chi square test χ2 were implicated on the base of the eqs 10 and 11 to compromise between experimental data and their conformity to practiced models 10 rmse 1 n p i

thermodynamic studies 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization all the characterization analyses were conducted on mgo eg with an optimum mass ratio of 0 50 the surface morphology of the eg and eg mgo was investigated by fesem as it is displayed in fig 1 a clear morphological distinction between eg and eg mgo can be observed it has been illustrated in images that mgo nanoparticles 20 to 40 nm are distributed effectively on and into eg hive like structures 48 providing a large number of active sites for adsorbing po4 3 ions according to eds analysis fig 2a and b mg and o on the surface of eg mgo were 12 55 and 25 96 respectively showing the immobilization of mgo nanoparticles on the eg surface structures the mg distribution was further confirmed by electron mapping fig 2f as expected eds spectrum mapping displayed that c was distributed uniformly and mg had an integrated proportion with o distribution in the eg mgo sample fig 2d f xrd patterns of eg and eg mgo can be seen in fig 3a in eg the diffraction peaks at 2θ of 26 8 and 54 8 are responsible for typical carbon diffraction and can be designated to 002 and 211 planes which are conformed to standard expanded graphite xrd patterns as illustrated in the eg mgo spectrum these two peaks have widened after immobilization of mgo nanoparticles covering the eg surface which is an indication of maintaining its crystalline structure 49 for mgo three new peaks in 36 9 42 9 and 62 2 which are corresponding to 111 200 and 220 respectively are detected as another sign of mgo nanoparticles distribution in the eg structure 2 50 fig 3b displays raman spectra of eg and eg mgo two distinguished bands in the eg spectrum at 1349 cm 1 and 1590 cm 1 are known as d and g bands the intensity of the d band is related to carbon structure defects 51 and the intensity of the g band is related to the vibration mode of graphite 52 which was decreased after surface modification by mgo resulting in wider peaks in the eg mgo spectrum this finding is also confirmed by the intensity ratio of bands id ig the id ig ratio increased from 0 34 in the eg sample to 0 89 in the eg mgo resulting in the disorder of hybridized and crystalline graphitic carbon 53 54 ftir spectroscopy was employed to indicate surface functional groups of the eg before and after mgo nanoparticles immobilization as fig 3c exhibits the eg spectrum before deposition of mgo has certain characteristic peaks the major peaks at 3434 and 1636 cm 1 are assigned to the vibration of oh bands because of the adsorption of the water molecules on the surface of the nanocomposite another major peak is attributed to the no group which is shown at 1385 cm 1 the minor peaks at 2927 and 2855 cm 1 correspond to the stretching vibration of ch bonds the other little peaks at 2341 and 1050 cm 1 can be related to coc vibration bands 55 56 in the eg mgo spectrum most of the major and minor peaks remained with less intensity witnessing water elimination in the interlayer areas 57 however some new peaks were found after adding the mgo onto the eg surface the most distinguished newly formed peak after mgo immobilization is at 1432 cm 1 which defines a hydroxyl group and two wide peaks at 609 and 431 cm 1 which is related to the mgo o bands 58 the bet analysis by n2 adsorption desorption is presented in fig s2a and b for eg and eg mgo respectively in addition the surface and textural properties of the eg and eg mgo were also investigated and results are displayed in table 1 as it can be found from the table the specific surface area and total pore volumes increased significantly due to the successful deposition of the mgo particles providing a more efficient adsorbent with a higher adsorption capacity for adsorbing phosphate ions furthermore the increase in surface area results from spherical mgo nanoparticles deposited on eg and resulting in rougher surface also another reason for the increase in surface area can be attributed to the calcination of eg mgo at a temperature of 600 c which results in the exfoliation of graphite layers and larger surface area meanwhile as anticipated the average pore diameters decreased because of the distribution of mgo nano size particles over the eg network that created smaller pore diameters the average pore volume also increased from 0 051 to 0 158 cm3 g for eg and eg mgo respectively indicating that mgo nanoparticle immobilization created more hollows and pores in the adsorbent structure 3 2 optimization of eg mgo adsorbent and adsorption process 3 2 1 effect of mgo eg mass ratio the mass ratio has a considerable influence on the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of phosphate as fig 4a depicts it can be concluded that the mass ratio has a significant role in the performance of the composite for the removal of phosphate as the textural properties of adsorbent would vary as the amount of mgo loaded on expanded graphite increases the maximum adsorption capacity 515 mg g and removal efficiency 61 took place at the mass ratio of 0 5 mgo eg this behavior can be explained in the concept of providing the higher mgo nanoparticles per total mass of the composite but after the mass ratio of 0 52 available mgo nanoparticles is constant whereas the total mass of the composite increases thereby decreasing the available mgo nanoparticles per total mass of the composite the eg with no mgo immobilization was also examined for phosphate adsorption which showed negligible adsorption capacity less than 0 75 mg g toward phosphate ions these results were consistent with the reported literature for the application of exfoliated graphite oxide for phosphate adsorption 59 3 2 2 effect of solution ph the solution ph plays a critical role in the adsorption process the adsorbate and adsorbent existing forms and their surface charges are corresponding to solution ph 30 60 the effect of initial ph varying from 2 to 11 is presented in fig 4b the results indicated in fig s3 show the zero point of charge phzpc of 11 2 for eg mgo therefore it can be concluded that as ph decreases from 11 2 ph phzpc the positive charge of the adsorbent increases as can be seen in fig 4b adsorption of phosphate gradually increased from 150 to 415 mg g as the initial ph changed from 11 to 7 reaching the highest adsorption capacity this is due to the stronger electrostatic interaction between negatively charged phosphate ions and the positively charged surface of the adsorbent leading to elevated phosphate removal 61 when the ph decreased from 7 to 2 the adsorption capacity declined from 415 to 65 mg g one explanation for this behavior is due to a decrease in the surface charge of phosphate in the strongly acidic environment thereby decreasing the electrostatic interaction between adsorbates and adsorbents another reason for the decrease in phosphate removal is attributed to the dissolution of mgo and mg oh 2 in acidic conditions 60 these results are consistent with the effect of ph on the different forms of phosphate ions which are shown in fig s4 a decrease in phosphate removal when the ph values decrease to 6 and lower is due to h₂po₄ and h₃po₄ formation which have lower negative charges thereby causing less interaction between adsorbents and phosphate ions and reducing the effect of the increase in the adsorbent positive charge surface it is noteworthy that optimum ph occurred at ph 7 which is at the neutral zone leading to convenience operation under practical conditions 3 2 3 effect of sample concentration and contact time fig 4c shows the effect of phosphate concentrations in the range of 10 to 2000 mg l on the adsorption capacity and the removal efficiency the adsorption capacity soared significantly as the phosphate concentration reached 2000 mg l however removal efficiency declined because of low active sites for adsorbing phosphate ions the number of phosphate ions in lower concentrations was less than active sites provided from eg mgo resulting in higher phosphate removal still in higher phosphate concentrations the situation was reversed due to excessive phosphate ions and lack of sufficient active sites some phosphate ions remained in the solution causing lower total phosphate removal 62 additional information about time and concentration dependant factors will be discussed in the kinetics and isotherm section fig 4d demonstrates the experimental results of the impact of contact time on the removal efficiency of phosphate at different concentrations of phosphate 10 and 100 mg l it is conspicuous that the removal efficiency of phosphate reached equilibrium around 90 min and further time was not effective on the removal efficiency comparing the two curves it can be concluded that phosphate concentration also plays a vital role in removal efficiency by decreasing the phosphate concentration the removal efficiency increased as a consequence of enough adsorption sites for adsorbing the phosphate ions 3 2 4 effect of adsorbent dosage adsorbent dosage is one of the fundamental parameters of the adsorption study as it is illuminated in fig 4e and f the impact of adsorbent dosage was explored on different concentrations of phosphate 100 and 10 mg l it can be implied that the removal efficiency increased dramatically by increasing the adsorbent dosage from 0 2 to 1 g l this could be ascribed as the extra adsorption sites provided by eg mgo nanocomposite which leads to enhancement in phosphate removal efficiency by the further increment of adsorbent dosage phosphate removal soared slightly the curves have flattened in the adsorbent dosage over 1 to 2 g l taking the cost effective aspect of the experiment into consideration the optimal adsorbent dosage for eg mgo adsorbent would seem to be around 1 g l 3 2 5 effect of co existing ions to have practical implications of phosphate removal from aqueous solutions it is essential to evaluate the impact of co existing ions on the adsorption process a variety of anions so4 2 cl no3 and cations k and na are always found in natural water and wastewater which can interfere with phosphate adsorption 63 to analyze the effect of each ion on adsorption capacity numerous similar experiments were carried out on the samples containing 100 mg l of phosphate spiked with 200 mg l of each ion the adsorbent dosage of 2 g l was used in these conducted tests the effect of the mentioned co existing ions on phosphate adsorption is presented in fig 5 the results revealed that interfering ions had little chance to compete with phosphate for binding on the active sites due to the high selectivity of eg mgo for adsorbing the phosphate ion 25 the three common anions such as cl so4 2 and no3 had a greater adverse impact on the adsorption process respectively 3 3 adsorption kinetics the adsorption capacity of adsorbent versus time was investigated for the determination of the experimental kinetic parameters it was observed that the sorption of phosphate into eg mgo active sites happened at high velocity in the first 5 min after that the sorption of adsorbate occurred at a slower rate and reached equilibrium around 90 min of reaction time the kinetics model parameters and the related plots are presented in table 2 and fig 6 respectively it can be seen that the second pseudo order model is in better agreement with experimental data with the highest correlation coefficient r2 of 0 9980 in comparison with other models showing adsorption rate is strongly related to the numbers of free active sites 64 65 furthermore the experimental value of q e which is 8 9 and 57 5 mg g for 10 and 100 mg l of phosphate respectively is almost in close accordance with the calculated q e values 9 045 and 58 65 in contrast to calculated ones by the first pseudo order model the intraparticle diffusion model also had the lowest error function value and it was divided into two separately linear parts it is clear in fig 6c that at the beginning of the experiment the dominant adsorption mechanism is intraparticle diffusion showing diffusion of phosphate onto adsorbent pores is the controlling step of the adsorption rate as the reaction moves forward the value of k dif would decline due to gradual adsorption of phosphate indicating low phosphate concentration for the external mass transfer as a consequence the intraparticle diffusion is not the only step in the adsorption process which is proved by the non zero intercept of the second part of the plot 3 4 adsorption isotherms the equilibrium of phosphate adsorption onto eg mgo was investigated at a broad initial concentration ranging from 10 to 2000 mg l the adsorption capacity increased as it was mentioned in section 2 2 2 reaching the highest adsorption capacity of 460 mg g at the initial concentration of 2000 mg l the isotherm of phosphate onto eg mgo is shown in fig 7a and the values of the different isotherm model parameters can be found in table 3 the reproduced data for the langmuir and freundlich models are indicated in fig 7b and c comparing three critical factors of r2 rmse and χ2 it is conspicuous that the langmuir model is the better and more reasonable model to describe the experimental data the rl which is denoted as a separation factor for adsorption process favourability was between 0 and 1 0 rl 1 for all the conducted experiments at different phosphate concentrations implying that the adsorption process was favorable 66 the maximum adsorption capacity of 491 6 mg g expressed by the langmuir model is remarkably higher than that of other adsorbents applied for phosphate adsorption from aqueous solutions indicating that the prepared adsorbent can be used for the removal of high concentrations of phosphate table 4 presents the comparison between sorption capacities of different adsorbents reported for phosphate removal this table firmly confirms the excellent potential of eg mgo adsorbent over other adsorbents reported in the literature 3 5 thermodynamic analysis one of the factors affecting the adsorption process is temperature the impact of temperature on the adsorption capacity of phosphate is presented in fig s5a the increase of adsorption capacity of eg mgo due to the increase in temperature can be understood that phosphate adsorption is an endothermic process which was also proved by thermodynamic parameters analysis the three important parameters of free energy change δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs are displayed in table 5 they are calculated by the following equations 72 using van t hoff s law plot presented in fig s5b 12 δg rt ln k d 13 k d q e c e 14 ln k d δ s r δ h rt according to table 5 δg values for all observed temperatures are negative indicating that the adsorption of phosphate onto the eg mgo surface was spontaneous and feasible 62 the decrease of δg values by increasing temperature from 283 k to 333 k indicates that the process would be more spontaneous at higher temperatures the δh value of 14 77 kj mol reveals that the adsorption process is endothermic and because it is 40 kj mol it can be implied that physical adsorption might be the dominant interaction the positive value of δs also demonstrates phosphate ions have an excellent affinity toward eg mgo adsorbents 73 3 6 regeneration and reusability of eg mgo regeneration and reusability are the factors of great influence in adsorption studies the application of the adsorbent in several cycles leads to significant cost reduction series of regeneration experiments 5 cycles were conducted to evaluate the reusability of eg mgo 57 the results in fig 8 show the remarkable reusability of eg mgo it is pointed out that the removal efficiency decreased from 93 to 81 after five consecutive cycles establishing eg mgo is a promising adsorbent for several times uses in the adsorption processes 3 7 phosphate removal by eg mgo from the real municipal effluent actual phosphate concentrations in municipal wastewater are generally lower than concentrations studied in this work effluent characteristics used in this study to conduct experiments on the real samples are shown in table 6 according to epa discharge standards for municipal effluent the reported phosphate exceeded the environmental limits establishing the essential need for advanced post treatment to phosphate removal before releasing it to the environment the phosphate concentration of 7 8 mg l in the effluent decreased to 1 8 and 1 5 mg l using the adsorbent dosage of 1 and 1 5 g l respectively the phosphate removal efficiency of 77 and 80 within the contact time of 90 min are extremely similar to the obtained results confirming that the adsorbent is capable of being used for removing low concentrations of phosphate in real municipal effluent phosphate concentration after the adsorption process meets environmental discharge standards of epa po4 3 6 mg l 74 75 3 8 application of seawater as the source of mg2 for adsorbent preparation the real seawater contains a high concentration of mg2 in the form of mgcl2 to consider the environment friendly aspects of using existing natural materials instead of industrialized chemicals seawater can be utilized as a source of natural mgcl2 to synthesize magnesium oxide nanoparticles 76 77 in this study seawater from the caspian sea iran was supplied as the natural source of mg2 analyzing by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes indicated a concentration of 992 mg l for the mg2 ion in seawater the results indicated 91 and 89 phosphate removal for the adsorbent synthesized using seawater and mgcl2 respectively the adsorbent prepared using seawater showed the same performance as that prepared using mgcl2 establishing that using seawater would provide an excellent adsorbent which is also cost effective and environment friendly 4 conclusion the novel eg mgo adsorbent was synthesized using chemical expansion and mgo immobilization using the pyrolysis process the prepared adsorbent was used to remove phosphate from aqueous solutions adsorbent surface morphology was investigated by sem images demonstrating successful mgo immobilization on the expanded graphite surface the porous structure of the adsorbent provided an excellent adsorption capacity for phosphate adsorption the impact of initial ph mgo eg mass ratio and adsorbent dosage was investigated and optimized the commonly co existing ions did not have a considerable effect on adsorbent performance adsorption kinetics determined the adsorption process follows the pseudo second model and the adsorption reached equilibrium around 90 min adsorption isotherm exhibited an outstanding adsorption capacity of 491 6 mg g for phosphate removal in neutral ph of 7 the thermodynamic studies established that the process is an endothermic reaction reusability tests found that the removal efficiency after 5 cycles did not decrease significantly the adsorption experiment was carried out on a real municipal effluent confirming previous experimental results and showing the practical aspect of the adsorbent to utilize in the industry finally the results showed that the eg mgo composite is a promising adsorbent considering its relatively low cost and high adsorption capacity and can be broadly used in further
