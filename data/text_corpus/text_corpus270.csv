1350,the salinization of the groundwater wells in siwa oasis egypt represents a critical environmental and economic issue developing low cost effective and self supported inorganic membranes were suggested as suitable desalination techniques zeolite geopolymer z gp membrane was synthesized as a potential low cost membrane for effective desalination of brackish groundwater in siwa oasis egypt the membrane was synthesized by simple geopolymerization for natural kaolinite and diatomite at room temperature this was followed by hydrothermal growth of zeolite at 100 c for 24 h to produce zeolitized geopolymer as potential inorganic membrane after that the prepared membrane was incorporated in the pervaporation desalination system considering the effect of the membrane thickness and the temperature the results demonstrated water flux values of 8 34 kg m 2 h 1 7 63 kg m 2 h 1 and 7 05 kg m 2 h 1 for the tested membrane at thicknesses of 1 mm 2 mm and 3 mm respectively this associated with significant salt rejection prearranges 95 8 1 mm 97 6 2 mm and 99 4 3 mm moreover the high temperature value 90 c is of strong positive impact on the water flux 7 82 kg m 2 h 1 and a slight impact on the salt rejection 99 6 the membrane is of significant stability considering the obtained water flux 7 51 kg m 2 h 1 and salt rejection 99 57 after 130 h the reusability properties of the z gp membrane demonstrated its suitability to be used in the desalination process for five runs therefore the synthetic z gp membrane is a highly recommended product for simple effective low cost and available desalination technique brackish groundwater in siwa oasis keywords geopolymer zeolite membrane siwa oasis groundwater desalination pervaporation 1 introduction the continuous salinization of groundwater resources is an essential issue for the future of the contemporary world giagnorio et al 2019 this threatens human life agricultural activities and biological diversity giagnorio et al 2019 srivastava et al 2021 siwa oasis is one of the most important oases in egypt that is of international interest for medical and environmental tourism aly et al 2016 moghazy and kaluarachchi 2020 more than 95 of the used water in the agricultural and domestic applications in siwa oasis is from the groundwater wells which recently suffer from the salinization effect aly et al 2016 several techniques have been suggested to solve the problem either partially or completely but most of them lack suitable efficiency and cost the desalination technologies as reverse osmosis membrane distillation and pervaporation depend essentially on the used membrane zhao et al 2021 xue et al 2020 in the later periods the synthetic inorganic membrane from natural silicate and aluminosilicate materials as zeolite was assessed as an alternative to the polymeric membrane in the desalination processes wen et al 2018 wang et al 2020 makhtar et al 2020 it was reported that the desalination systems of zeolite membranes achieved significant efficiency in reducing the salinity of the groundwater aloulou et al 2020 makhtar et al 2020 this was assigned to their high thermal and chemical stability in addition to their nano porous structures tao et al 2020 aloulou et al 2021 wang et al 2020 moreover they are low cost materials of high recyclability adsorption capacity and ion exchange capacity abukhadra and mostafa 2019 qiu et al 2020 the zeolitic membranes of fau form zeolite x and zeolite y are of large pore diameter and high hydrophilicity which induces the diffusion of the water molecules and increases the water flux values qiu et al 2020 zhou et al 2016 on the other hand the lta forms zeolite a are of small pore size diameter which qualifies them to be applied with high salt rejection percentages therefore zeolitic membranes of fau and lts content can achieve enhanced water flux and salt rejection efficiency however the low mechanical strength of such membranes sets limitations for their industrial applications as they commonly required additional support of porous substrates zhou et al 2016 this causes random orientation for the packed zeolite crystals for the roughness of the substrate which reduces the performance of the membrane he et al 2013 moreover the preparation of the substrates with specific pore diameters total porosity and chemical compatibility is of expensive cost he et al 2013 the self supporting zeolite membranes were reported in the literature but they were not covered but sufficient studies yet this is related to some disadvantages as they are highly fragile materials of low mechanical stability uncontrolled dimensions non homogeneous thickness and low mechanical strength makhtar et al 2020 moreover the traditional self supporting method by packing causes a reduction in the inter zeolitic pores he et al 2013 the polymerization of aluminosilicate precursors into inorganic polymers geopolymer was studied to produce novel nanoporous porous structures as membranes lei et al 2021 geopolymer as a material is a 3d poly alkali aluminosilicate structure that is of interconnected and condensed alo4 and sio4 tetrahedrons as structural units taki et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 as a membrane it is of significant porosity thermal stability chemical resistance ion exchange capacity adsorption properties and mechanical strength lei et al 2021 rossatto et al 2020 economically it can be produced from low cost natural materials and solid wastes based on simple techniques at low temperature therefore the desalination processes based on the geopolymer membranes are of suitable cost for developing countries lei et al 2021 shehata et al 2020 recently the zeolitization of geopolymer was studied to enhance its porosity surface area and adsorption capacity sanguanpak et al 2021 sithole et al 2020 the chemical composition of geopolymer is ideal for the synthesis of zeolite with remarkable impact for its polymeric matrix in directing the growth of the zeolite crystals shao et al 2020 this can provide the membrane with a considerable pore size distribution of significant water flux additionally the geopolymer matrix can act as a substrate for the synthetic zeolite as a self supporting membrane therefore the introduced study involved the synthesis of zeolite geopolymer membrane of two zeolite forms fau and lta zeolites as self supported zeolite membranes the synthetic membrane was applied to reduce the salinity of the groundwater wells in siwa oasis the characterization and the performance of the membrane were inspected in the study considering the essential desalination parameters the stability properties the reusability value and the suggested mechanism 2 experimental work 2 1 hydrogeology and hydrochemistry of siwa oasis siwa oasis is an isolated and closed depression in the northwestern desert of egypt it is situated between latitude 29 12 n and longitude 25 43 e fig 1 the groundwater potential of the siwa oasis is about 500 000 m3 d and delivered from two main regional aquifers nubian sandstone aquifer and tertiary fractured carbonate aquifer dahab 2004 el hossary 2013 the nubian sandstone aquifer is composed of sandstones intercalated with shales and clay deposits shadfan et al 1985 baioumy et al 2003 it represents the main source of freshwater 90 in the area and of considerable salinity 500 600 ppm the tertiary carbonate aquifer system tcas is represented by the miocene and eocene water bearing formations it is composed of carbonate rocks limestone and dolomite intercalated with shale siltstone sandstone and evaporates deposits in some localities ibrahim 1991 dahab 2004 the tertiary aquifer was classified into different subunits including quaternary aquifer shallow aquifer and carbonate aquifer miocene eocene and upper cretaceous the salinity in the quaternary aquifer is about 4200 ppm while the determined values for miocene eocene and upper cretaceous aquifers from 2000 to 4000 ppm 3000 to 16 000 ppm and 2000 to 8000 ppm respectively rigw 2000and aggour and faid 2006 the high salinity of such groundwater aquifers and their based wells represent the most damages issue that faces the future of such a vital oasis the high salinity of the wells impairs the quality of drinking water affects negatively the growth of crops causes destruction for the biological diversity and affects negatively the tourism value of the area therefore developing techniques of low production cost and promising desalination properties is the recent challenge to solve this problem considering the accepted levels of tds by the world health organization 1000 ppm and the egyptian higher committee for water 1200 ppm moghazy and kaluarachchi 2020 2 2 synthesis of zeolite geopolymer membrane 2 2 1 materials the precursors of kaolinite and diatomite as refined products were delivered from the central metallurgical development institute egypt naoh pellets of analytical grade purity 97 were delivered from el nasr company to be applied as the alkaline activator during the preparation steps of geopolymer and zeolitized product 2 2 2 synthesis procedures the diatomite kaolinite based geopolymer was synthesized according to papa et al 2018 the kaolinite powder was thermally converted into highly reactive metakaolinite 750 c for 5 h after that the produced metakaolinite was mixed homogeneously with diatomite as a silica source in the existence of naoh solution for 8 h at a stirring speed of 500 rpm the molar ratio of si al was adjusted during the preparation step to be at 2 1 considering the ratio of poly sialate siloxo geopolymer then the obtained slurry was transferred into a cylindrical mold and left for 24 h at a certain temperature of 50 c as a final step in the production of the geopolymer gp the obtained d k geopolymer was then used as a precursor in the hydrothermal zeolitization process the geopolymer cylinder was immersed within naoh solution using a hydrothermal alteration system composed of a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave this was followed by a stage of hydrothermal treatment for the mixture at 100 c for nearly 24 h as a synthesis period of zeolite then the zeolitized geopolymer was separated from the remaining naoh solution and washed using distilled water for several cycles before drying the products at 70 c for 10 h as a final step the resulted product zeolitized geopolymer was sliced into slabs of dicks shape different thicknesses and fixed radius of 2 5 cm using a laboratory rock cutting saw the used slaps of the prepared membrane are of flat shape and polished carefully using a metallographic double disc polishing machine to provide the membrane smooth and humongous surface 2 3 characterization techniques the crystal structures of the z gp membrane as well as the incorporated raw materials were assessed based on their xrd diffractions patterns which were obtained d by a panalytical x ray diffractometer empyrean the morphology of the membrane as well as the geopolymer substrate was studied considering their sem images by scanning electron microscope gemini zeiss ultra 55 the internal properties of the z gp membrane were studied considering its hrtem images using transmission electron microscope jeol jem2100 the chemical composition and the structural chemical groups were studied using panalytical axios advanced xrf technique and fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir 8400s shimadzu respectively the surface areas of the membrane as well as the pore size distribution were measured by a surface area analyzer beckman coulter sa3100 2 4 collection of groundwater samples about 12 samples of different tds percentages were collected from different groundwater wells in siwa oasis and each sample is of 2000 ml volume the collected water samples were preserved carefully in bottles after the previous step involved acidification of the water using diluted hno3 after that the samples were preserved in a refrigerator at a certain temperature of 2 c to be used in the desalination experiments before the desalination tests the collected samples were mixed with each other as a representative sample to the groundwater in the studied area and the present solid suspension was removed by normal filtration using whitman filter paper 45 μm the determined tds in the studied representative groundwater sample of siwa oasis is 3205 mg l the full chemical analysis of the studied representative water sample showed the existence of ca2 115 6 mg l mg2 113 5 mg l na 874 mg l k 46 mg l hco3 182 mg l co3 3 16 3 mg l cl 1630 mg l and so4 2 276 mg l 2 5 the desalination performance of zeolite geopolymer membrane the separation efficiency of the z gp membrane for the brackish groundwater of siwa oasis was assessed based on the pervaporation system as presented in fig 2 the z gp membrane was sealed within a permeation module supported with types of silicone o rings the pressure was kept at the value of the atmospheric pressure on the retentate side and below 10 kpa on the permeate side after that the permeate solutions were collected carefully in cold nitrogen liquid during the predetermined studied time intervals the brackish groundwater was applied in its natural concentration of tds as determined for the representative sample 3205 ppm considering the investigated temperature within the range from 30 c up to 90 c the feed was kept under continuous recirculating and stirring to keep the contact between the concentration polarization and the z gp membrane side and each test involved treating of 1000 ml of the water sample the performance of the z gp membrane during the desalination of the brackish groundwater of siwa oasis was assessed based on the values of the total salt rejection rj and the water flux f the water flux f values in kg m 2 h 1 were calculated based on eq 1 1 f w δt a x 100 the reported symbols in the equations of w δt and a refer to the permeate mass in kg the collecting time in h and the area of the used membrane in m2 respectively the total rejection of the ions was considered to be the ratio between the ion conductivity of the water in permeates and the feed and calculated based on eq 2 2 r j s if s ip s if x 100 the sif and sip symbols refer to the determined ion conductivity of the water in the feed and permeate respectively the conductivity was measured using the conductivity meter of the ddsj 308a type after dilution steps of the samples the present cations were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry perkin elmer while the anions were measured using dionex dx 120 ion chromatography 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization of the membrane 3 1 1 xrd analysis the xrd pattern of the z gp membrane was evaluated considering the patterns of the used precursors for kaolinite as starting materials its pattern exhibits the reported peaks of well crystalline kaolinite 12 3 001 20 8o 110 24 9 002 and 26 6o 111 xrd no 04 012 5104 fig 3a the obtained pattern of metakaolinite reflects significant destruction for the previously observed peak of kaolinite and the whole pattern appears to be for amorphous material fig 3b the synthetic d k geopolymer still shows the characterized pattern of the amorphous materials fig 1c for the zeolitized geopolymer membrane the obtained pattern demonstrates the formation of different phases of synthetic zeolite fig 3d the detected zeolite phases are zeolite a iccd ref code n 00 039 0222 zeolite x pdf

morphology in massive and agglomerated shape fig 4a the surface of d k geopolymer also characterizes by the presence of oriented pores that might be related to the incorporated skeletons of diatomite fig 4b the zeolitized membrane in the sem images appears in crystalline morphologies which are related to the growth of the zeolite crystals fig 4c the growth of these crystals according to the polymeric matrix resulted in an intersection between them forming a highly porous structure related to the formed zeolite and the interstitial nanopores fig 4c and d addressing the products at the hrtem images supports the previous description based on the sem images fig 4e and f the d k geopolymer appears as agglomerated particles with more detection for its porous matrix fig 4e for the zeolitized membrane appeared as a highly porous material of numerous pores of nano size which qualifies it to be applied as membrane considering the smaller pores of the zeolite crystals fig 4f 3 1 3 ft ir analysis the ft ir spectra of the d k geopolymer and the zeolitized membrane were presented in fig 5 the spectrum of d k geopolymer declared the existence of oh 3220 3385 cm 1 and h oh 1502 cm 1 1636 cm 1 groups which might be related to entrapped water molecules within its porous matrix in addition to the adsorbed molecules kljajević et al 2017 fig 5a the si o si and si o a identification bands were observed at 985 7 cm 1 and 602 cm 1 respectively which are deviated positions considering their positions for raw kaolinite fig 5a this reflects the amorphization of kaolinite layers into aluminosilicate gel which was assigned to the condensation of the essential structural units sio4 and alo4 tetrahedrons during the formation of the geopolymer caballero et al 2019 the spectrum of the synthetic zeolitized membrane is similar to that obtained for the synthetic zeolite in literature fig 5b the oh bearing groups and the coordinated water of zeolite were identified by the observed bands at 3452 cm 1 and 1435 cm 1 respectively the t o bending of to4 tetrahedrons t al and si the vibration of si o al and o t o were recognized by their bands at 1016 cm 1 400 cm 1 and 800 cm 1 respectively fig 5b mostafa et al 2021 liguori et al 2019 generally the si o al related bands used to signify the type of the formed zeolite the detection of bands at 469 cm 1 537 cm 1 and 673 cm 1 signifies the formation of fau zeolite zeolite x as well as the lta zeolite zeolite a the ft ir band at 740 cm 1 is related to both fau zeolite and gis zeolite zeolite p liguori et al 2019 3 1 4 microstructural and mechanical properties the determined surface area of the synthetic z gp membranes was estimated based on the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm curve fig 6 the determined values for gp and z gp membrane are 89 2 m2 g and 106 m2 g respectively table 1 it was predicted that the incorporated diatomite and the porous matrix are the main factors that enhanced the surface area of the geopolymer the observed increase in the surface area of the z gp membrane as compared to the synthetic gp signifies the role of formed zeolite phases with their microporous structures in enhancing the total surface area this was detected also in the measures average pore diameter as the determined value for the prepared z gp membrane 4 2 nm is smaller than the measured value of the prepared gp substrate 11 6 nm table 1 additionally the determined compressive and flexural strengths of z gp are 22 mpa and 3 6 mpa which are promising value for realistic applications 3 2 the desalination results 3 2 1 the desalination performances of z gp membrane with different thicknesses the influence of the z gp membrane thickness in its desalination performance was evaluated within the studied range from 1 mm up to 5 mm the desalination temperature was addressed at a constant temperature of 75 c fig 7a it can be detected that the achieved water flux shows observable declination with increasing the z gp membrane thickness from 1 mm up to 5 mm the obtained water flux at studied z gp thickness of 1 mm 2 mm 3 mm 4 mm and 5 mm is 8 34 kg m 2 h 1 7 63 kg m 2 h 1 7 05 kg m 2 h 1 5 72 kg m 2 h 1 and 3 63 kg m 2 h 1 respectively fig 7a on the other hand the salt rejection percentages enhanced strongly with using the z gp membrane at high thickness the rejection percentage increased from about 95 8 up to 99 8 with increasing the membrane thickness from 1 mm up to 5 mm fig 7a the increase in the membrane thickness causes an increment in the present resistance for the permeation of the water molecules through the porous structures of the formed zeolite phases as well as the pores of the geopolymer substrate zhou et al 2016 wang et al 2021 these cause declinations in the water flux values but on the other hand induce the salt rejection efficiency of the synthetic z gp membrane as both the high water flux and salt rejection efficiency control the performance the economic value of the used membrane using the synthetic z gp membrane at a thickness of 3 mm was preferred as it achieved significant salt rejection value 99 5 and promising water flux 7 05 kg m 2 h 1 considering the studied temperature 75 c therefore the thickness of the used z gp membrane was fixed at 3 mm for all the further desalination tests 3 2 2 the desalination performances of z gp membrane at different temperature the effect of the temperature on the z gp membrane performance in terms of water flux and salt rejection for the natural concentration of the representative sample 3205 mg l and membrane thickness of 3 mm was evaluated fig 7b the recognized water flux values increased significantly from 2 65 kg m 2 h 1 to 7 82 kg m 2 h 1 with expanding the temperature of the feed from 30 c up to 90 c fig 7b on the other hand the salt rejection percentage appears to be of slight effect with the changes in the temperature of the feed and the values at all the temperature values are higher than 99 fig 7b the reported increment in the water flux values at the high temperature conditions was assigned to the high driving forces which promote the penetration of the water molecules through the pores of the membrane zhou et al 2016 in the pv system the driving forces represent the differences between the partial pressure of the feed and the obtained permeate in addition to the diffusion rates of the penetrated water vapor zhou et al 2016 nigiz et al 2017 additionally the reported stabilization in the achieved salt rejection percentage at the studied temperature values reflects the significant role of the size exclusion mechanism during the desalination process wang et al 2021 3 2 3 stability of z gp membrane the stability of the z gp membrane during the desalination of the brackish groundwater in siwa oasis was assessed for 130 h considering the experimental conditions at 3 mm as the thickness of the used membrane and 90 c as temperature during the test the collected water from the tank was compensated carefully by adding additional water to the feed after certain intervals to preserve the actual concentration of the used feed at a constant value the test continued for about 130 h at total operation time considering a rest interval of 2 h after each essential operation interval of 10 h the values of water flux as well as the salt rejection percentages are of slight changes or nearly fixed from the starting interval 7 82 kg m 2 h 1 water flux and 99 6 salt rejection up to 60 h 7 76 kg m 2 h 1 water flux and 99 58 salt rejection fig 7c beyond this time interval the recognized water flux shows an observable decrease to 7 51 kg m 2 h 1 after a filtration interval of 130 h on the other hand the achieved salt rejection efficiency displayed significant stability 99 57 up to a working interval of 130 h fig 7c the documented decrease in the value of the water flux after 60 h was signified to three suggested reasons including a the accumulation of retained salts on z gp membrane surface which cause significant blocking for internal channels and pores and in turns increase the mass transfer resistance b the predicted increase the concentration of the delivered salts on the stream with increasing the operating time and this reduces the water flux and c the negative impact for the replacement of the dissolved ions ca2 and mg2 by the exchangeable ions within the structure of the zeolite phases during the desalination process zhou et al 2016 the chemical analysis of the z gp membrane after the desalination processes reflects a considerable increase in the na k ca2 and mg2 content this supports the previous suggestions about the accumulation of the rejected salts on its surface and the ion exchange processes zhou et al 2016 3 2 4 the reusability of z gp membrane the suitability of the synthetic z gp membrane to be reused in several desalination cycles was investigated for four runs at selected conditions of 3 mm thickness of the membrane and adjusted temperature of 90 c the regeneration of the z gp membrane was performed by backwashing process using freshwater considering the pressure at the atmospheric value on the retentate side and 10 kpa on the permeate side this was followed by a cycle of acidic washing using diluted hcl 0 02 m and then rinsed again in freshwater the washing step was repeated three times at fixed temperature of 30 c before the application of the membrane in another desalination cycle based on both the salt rejection percentages and the water flux values the synthetic z gp membrane is of significant recyclability or reusability properties for the four runs fig 7d the measured water flux for the reusing run1 run 2 run 3 and run 4 are 7 82 kg m 2 h 1 7 12 kg m 2 h 1 6 2 kg m 2 h 1 and 4 55 kg m 2 h 1 respectively fig 7d for the salt rejection percentages the obtained values are 99 6 99 4 98 8 and 98 4 for the reusing runs of run1 run 2 run 3 and run 4 respectively fig 7d the reported results during the reusability experiments reflect additional technical and commercial value for the synthetic z gp inorganic membrane this will save the costs that can be consumed in the continuous replacement of the used membranes by other new ones to maintain the permeate water at the required quality as a function of the total dissolved salts the observed reduction in the salt rejection and the water flux with repeating the desalination reusing runs was assigned to the continuous blocking of the pores with the salts and the quantities of the exchanges ions within the structure of the synthetic zeolite 3 2 5 the activation energy of the water permeation process based on the arrhenius relationship the value of the activation energy ea for the water permeation processes through the used z gp membrane was estimated based on eq 3 considering the slope of the fitting processes fig 8 the obtained value is 18 9 kj mol and its positive sign demonstrates the permeation of the water by activated diffusion mechanism causing a considerable increase in the water flux with increasing the temperature of the water feed 3 j i a i exp ep i rt the presented symbols in the equations are ji ai ep r and t refer to the permeate flux of the z gp membrane pre exponential factor the activation energy of the diffusion processes and the sorption heat the gas constant and the absolute temperature respectively the achieved water flux values are higher than the reported values for some of the previously investigated zeolite membranes in the literature are related to the type of the present zeolite phases this is related to the existence of zeolite x fau as the dominant synthetic zeolite phase which is of higher hydrophilicity and larger pore diameter than the reported values for the other phases of zeolite zhou et al 2016 qiu et al 2020 3 2 6 the suggested mechanism the predicted mechanism for the rejection of the salts from the siwa brackish groundwater can be described according to the suggested model by he et al 2013 firstly the metal species which are of positive charges as sodium ions were adsorbed by the surficial sites of the zeolite phases and the geopolymer substrate that are of negative charges at the experimental conditions this cause conversion for the whole surface of the membrane to be of positively charged surface cho et al 2011 after that the positively charged surface of the z gp membrane accelerates the mobility of the hydrated anions towards the non zeolitic pores of the geopolymer matrix and inhibits the mobility of the hydrated cations this involved cooperative operating of both the size exclusion mechanism and the charge exclusion mechanism he et al 2013 cho et al 2011 both hydrated cations and anions can be adsorbed on the surfaces of the present zeolite phases or in their internal pores after their diffusion into the membrane by the pores of the geopolymer matrix by attending the adsorption equilibrium with the polymeric pores of the membrane no additional ions can be adsorbed as a result of the concentration polarization effect considering the findings of the desalination experiments the salt rejection efficiency does not affect by the presence of the nano zeolitic pores in small quantities and depends essentially on the thickness of the membrane but at specific or thresholds values using the z gp membrane at this threshold thickness reduces or omits the impact of the defects in the present mesopores and macropores he et al 2013 the theoretical model of the synthetic membrane suggested its formation in symmetric and homogeneous structures fig 9 considering the previous assumption the zeolite phases present in many layers within the membrane in a vertical and horizontal orientation and impeded the non zeolitic pores that are related to the pores of the geopolymer substrate cho et al 2011 the influence of the non zeolitic pores or the polymeric matrix can be eliminated strongly by increasing the thickness of the membrane this induces the possible occurring of the size exclusion mechanism during the desalination tests he et al 2013 it was expected that the cations can enter within the interior of the zeolite phases of the membrane the existence of numerous internal pores increases the adsorption interface between the dissolved cations and the present zeolitic phases and in turn hider their diffusion he et al 2013 considering the estimated salt rejection results of the performed desalination tests the desalination mechanisms of siwa brackish groundwater using the synthetic z gp membrane involved size exclusion mesoporous adsorption and electrostatic repulsion the adsorption of the mechanism of the salts ions by zeolite was explained based on the assumption of electric double layer theory edl fig 9 according to this theory the interaction between the zeolite particles and high salinity water resulted in the formation of electrical double layers around the zeolitic grains wen et al 2018 the first layer stern layer characterizes by strong bound properties between the positively charged ions and the zeolite surface by van der waals forces attraction potential and significant rejection for the negatively charged ions by electrostatic repulsive forces repulsion potential wibowo et al 2017 the stability of the electric charges during the adsorption of the free salt ions causes the formation of the second layer which is known as the diffuse layer that exhibits high electrostatic potential as compared to the stern layer the second layer is of considerable impact in the capturing of the free salt ions wen et al 2018 this continued until the reduction of the total electric potential to zero which is associated with vanishing for the adsorption reactions between the salt ions and the zeolite surface wibowo et al 2017 3 2 7 technical evaluation of the water after the desalination process the chemical analysis of the feed was compared with the analysis of permeate after the desalination experiments using the synthetic z gp membrane table 2 the results demonstrate strong declination in the total dissolved salts as well as the essential salts bearing cations and anions to levels highly matched with the required international and national standards of drinking water as well as the irrigation water such results demonstrate the values of the synthetic z gp membrane as an inorganic membrane of low preparation cost and can be applied effectively in the desalination of the brackish groundwater in siwa oasis 3 2 8 comparison study the estimated desalination results by the synthetic z gp membrane were compared with other studied organic and inorganic membranes based on the results the synthetic membrane can achieve results close to the obtained results by such membranes considering its value as a self supporting inorganic membrane table 3 this qualifies the product to be applied as low cost membrane in the desalination of brackish groundwater in siwa oasis 4 conclusion diatomite kaolinite based geopolymer was synthesized and treated hydrothermally into zeolite impeded geopolymer as an inorganic

area of 106 m2 g and an average pore diameter of 4 2 nm the synthetic membrane was applied as a low cost membrane for the desalination of the brackish groundwater in siwa oasis by the pervaporation method the achieved water fluxes using the membrane at different thicknesses are 8 34 kg m 2 h 1 1 mm 7 63 kg m 2 h 1 2 mm and 7 05 kg m 2 h 1 3 mm while the determined salt rejection values are 95 8 1 mm 97 6 2 mm and 99 4 3 mm adjusting the feed temperature at 90 c causes enhancement in the water flux to 7 82 kg m 2 h 1 and the salt rejection to 99 6 the stability properties of the z gp membrane were evaluated for 140 h achieving a water flux of 7 5 kg m 2 h 1 and salt rejection of 99 57 additionally the membrane is of potential reusability to be applied in the desalination process of the

1350,the salinization of the groundwater wells in siwa oasis egypt represents a critical environmental and economic issue developing low cost effective and self supported inorganic membranes were suggested as suitable desalination techniques zeolite geopolymer z gp membrane was synthesized as a potential low cost membrane for effective desalination of brackish groundwater in siwa oasis egypt the membrane was synthesized by simple geopolymerization for natural kaolinite and diatomite at room temperature this was followed by hydrothermal growth of zeolite at 100 c for 24 h to produce zeolitized geopolymer as potential inorganic membrane after that the prepared membrane was incorporated in the pervaporation desalination system considering the effect of the membrane thickness and the temperature the results demonstrated water flux values of 8 34 kg m 2 h 1 7 63 kg m 2 h 1 and 7 05 kg m 2 h 1 for the tested membrane at thicknesses of 1 mm 2 mm and 3 mm respectively this associated with significant salt rejection prearranges 95 8 1 mm 97 6 2 mm and 99 4 3 mm moreover the high temperature value 90 c is of strong positive impact on the water flux 7 82 kg m 2 h 1 and a slight impact on the salt rejection 99 6 the membrane is of significant stability considering the obtained water flux 7 51 kg m 2 h 1 and salt rejection 99 57 after 130 h the reusability properties of the z gp membrane demonstrated its suitability to be used in the desalination process for five runs therefore the synthetic z gp membrane is a highly recommended product for simple effective low cost and available desalination technique brackish groundwater in siwa oasis keywords geopolymer zeolite membrane siwa oasis groundwater desalination pervaporation 1 introduction the continuous salinization of groundwater resources is an essential issue for the future of the contemporary world giagnorio et al 2019 this threatens human life agricultural activities and biological diversity giagnorio et al 2019 srivastava et al 2021 siwa oasis is one of the most important oases in egypt that is of international interest for medical and environmental tourism aly et al 2016 moghazy and kaluarachchi 2020 more than 95 of the used water in the agricultural and domestic applications in siwa oasis is from the groundwater wells which recently suffer from the salinization effect aly et al 2016 several techniques have been suggested to solve the problem either partially or completely but most of them lack suitable efficiency and cost the desalination technologies as reverse osmosis membrane distillation and pervaporation depend essentially on the used membrane zhao et al 2021 xue et al 2020 in the later periods the synthetic inorganic membrane from natural silicate and aluminosilicate materials as zeolite was assessed as an alternative to the polymeric membrane in the desalination processes wen et al 2018 wang et al 2020 makhtar et al 2020 it was reported that the desalination systems of zeolite membranes achieved significant efficiency in reducing the salinity of the groundwater aloulou et al 2020 makhtar et al 2020 this was assigned to their high thermal and chemical stability in addition to their nano porous structures tao et al 2020 aloulou et al 2021 wang et al 2020 moreover they are low cost materials of high recyclability adsorption capacity and ion exchange capacity abukhadra and mostafa 2019 qiu et al 2020 the zeolitic membranes of fau form zeolite x and zeolite y are of large pore diameter and high hydrophilicity which induces the diffusion of the water molecules and increases the water flux values qiu et al 2020 zhou et al 2016 on the other hand the lta forms zeolite a are of small pore size diameter which qualifies them to be applied with high salt rejection percentages therefore zeolitic membranes of fau and lts content can achieve enhanced water flux and salt rejection efficiency however the low mechanical strength of such membranes sets limitations for their industrial applications as they commonly required additional support of porous substrates zhou et al 2016 this causes random orientation for the packed zeolite crystals for the roughness of the substrate which reduces the performance of the membrane he et al 2013 moreover the preparation of the substrates with specific pore diameters total porosity and chemical compatibility is of expensive cost he et al 2013 the self supporting zeolite membranes were reported in the literature but they were not covered but sufficient studies yet this is related to some disadvantages as they are highly fragile materials of low mechanical stability uncontrolled dimensions non homogeneous thickness and low mechanical strength makhtar et al 2020 moreover the traditional self supporting method by packing causes a reduction in the inter zeolitic pores he et al 2013 the polymerization of aluminosilicate precursors into inorganic polymers geopolymer was studied to produce novel nanoporous porous structures as membranes lei et al 2021 geopolymer as a material is a 3d poly alkali aluminosilicate structure that is of interconnected and condensed alo4 and sio4 tetrahedrons as structural units taki et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 as a membrane it is of significant porosity thermal stability chemical resistance ion exchange capacity adsorption properties and mechanical strength lei et al 2021 rossatto et al 2020 economically it can be produced from low cost natural materials and solid wastes based on simple techniques at low temperature therefore the desalination processes based on the geopolymer membranes are of suitable cost for developing countries lei et al 2021 shehata et al 2020 recently the zeolitization of geopolymer was studied to enhance its porosity surface area and adsorption capacity sanguanpak et al 2021 sithole et al 2020 the chemical composition of geopolymer is ideal for the synthesis of zeolite with remarkable impact for its polymeric matrix in directing the growth of the zeolite crystals shao et al 2020 this can provide the membrane with a considerable pore size distribution of significant water flux additionally the geopolymer matrix can act as a substrate for the synthetic zeolite as a self supporting membrane therefore the introduced study involved the synthesis of zeolite geopolymer membrane of two zeolite forms fau and lta zeolites as self supported zeolite membranes the synthetic membrane was applied to reduce the salinity of the groundwater wells in siwa oasis the characterization and the performance of the membrane were inspected in the study considering the essential desalination parameters the stability properties the reusability value and the suggested mechanism 2 experimental work 2 1 hydrogeology and hydrochemistry of siwa oasis siwa oasis is an isolated and closed depression in the northwestern desert of egypt it is situated between latitude 29 12 n and longitude 25 43 e fig 1 the groundwater potential of the siwa oasis is about 500 000 m3 d and delivered from two main regional aquifers nubian sandstone aquifer and tertiary fractured carbonate aquifer dahab 2004 el hossary 2013 the nubian sandstone aquifer is composed of sandstones intercalated with shales and clay deposits shadfan et al 1985 baioumy et al 2003 it represents the main source of freshwater 90 in the area and of considerable salinity 500 600 ppm the tertiary carbonate aquifer system tcas is represented by the miocene and eocene water bearing formations it is composed of carbonate rocks limestone and dolomite intercalated with shale siltstone sandstone and evaporates deposits in some localities ibrahim 1991 dahab 2004 the tertiary aquifer was classified into different subunits including quaternary aquifer shallow aquifer and carbonate aquifer miocene eocene and upper cretaceous the salinity in the quaternary aquifer is about 4200 ppm while the determined values for miocene eocene and upper cretaceous aquifers from 2000 to 4000 ppm 3000 to 16 000 ppm and 2000 to 8000 ppm respectively rigw 2000and aggour and faid 2006 the high salinity of such groundwater aquifers and their based wells represent the most damages issue that faces the future of such a vital oasis the high salinity of the wells impairs the quality of drinking water affects negatively the growth of crops causes destruction for the biological diversity and affects negatively the tourism value of the area therefore developing techniques of low production cost and promising desalination properties is the recent challenge to solve this problem considering the accepted levels of tds by the world health organization 1000 ppm and the egyptian higher committee for water 1200 ppm moghazy and kaluarachchi 2020 2 2 synthesis of zeolite geopolymer membrane 2 2 1 materials the precursors of kaolinite and diatomite as refined products were delivered from the central metallurgical development institute egypt naoh pellets of analytical grade purity 97 were delivered from el nasr company to be applied as the alkaline activator during the preparation steps of geopolymer and zeolitized product 2 2 2 synthesis procedures the diatomite kaolinite based geopolymer was synthesized according to papa et al 2018 the kaolinite powder was thermally converted into highly reactive metakaolinite 750 c for 5 h after that the produced metakaolinite was mixed homogeneously with diatomite as a silica source in the existence of naoh solution for 8 h at a stirring speed of 500 rpm the molar ratio of si al was adjusted during the preparation step to be at 2 1 considering the ratio of poly sialate siloxo geopolymer then the obtained slurry was transferred into a cylindrical mold and left for 24 h at a certain temperature of 50 c as a final step in the production of the geopolymer gp the obtained d k geopolymer was then used as a precursor in the hydrothermal zeolitization process the geopolymer cylinder was immersed within naoh solution using a hydrothermal alteration system composed of a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave this was followed by a stage of hydrothermal treatment for the mixture at 100 c for nearly 24 h as a synthesis period of zeolite then the zeolitized geopolymer was separated from the remaining naoh solution and washed using distilled water for several cycles before drying the products at 70 c for 10 h as a final step the resulted product zeolitized geopolymer was sliced into slabs of dicks shape different thicknesses and fixed radius of 2 5 cm using a laboratory rock cutting saw the used slaps of the prepared membrane are of flat shape and polished carefully using a metallographic double disc polishing machine to provide the membrane smooth and humongous surface 2 3 characterization techniques the crystal structures of the z gp membrane as well as the incorporated raw materials were assessed based on their xrd diffractions patterns which were obtained d by a

55 the internal properties of the z gp membrane were studied considering its hrtem images using transmission electron microscope jeol jem2100 the chemical composition and the structural chemical groups were studied using panalytical axios advanced xrf technique and fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir 8400s shimadzu respectively the surface areas of the membrane as well as the pore size distribution were measured by a surface area analyzer beckman coulter sa3100 2 4 collection of groundwater samples about 12 samples of different tds percentages were collected from different groundwater wells in siwa oasis and each sample is of 2000 ml volume the collected water samples were preserved carefully in bottles after the previous step involved acidification of the water using diluted hno3 after that the samples were preserved in a refrigerator at a certain temperature of 2 c to be used in the desalination experiments before the desalination tests the collected samples were mixed with each other as a representative sample to the groundwater in the studied area and the present solid suspension was removed by normal filtration using whitman filter paper 45 μm the determined tds in the studied representative groundwater sample of siwa oasis is 3205 mg l the full chemical analysis of the studied representative water sample showed the existence of ca2 115 6 mg l mg2 113 5 mg l na 874 mg l k 46 mg l hco3 182 mg l co3 3 16 3 mg l cl 1630 mg l and so4 2 276 mg l 2 5 the desalination performance of zeolite geopolymer membrane the separation efficiency of the z gp membrane for the brackish groundwater of siwa oasis was assessed based on the pervaporation system as presented in fig 2 the z gp membrane was sealed within a permeation module supported with types of silicone o rings the pressure was kept at the value of the atmospheric pressure on the retentate side and below 10 kpa on the permeate side after that the permeate solutions were collected carefully in cold nitrogen liquid during the predetermined studied time intervals the brackish groundwater was applied in its natural concentration of tds as determined for the representative sample 3205 ppm considering the investigated temperature within the range from 30 c up to 90 c the feed was kept under continuous recirculating and stirring to keep the contact between the concentration polarization and the z gp membrane side and each test involved treating of 1000 ml of the water sample the performance of the z gp membrane during the desalination of the brackish groundwater of siwa oasis was assessed based on the values of the total salt rejection rj and the water flux f the water flux f values in kg m 2 h 1 were calculated based on eq 1 1 f w δt a x 100 the reported symbols in the equations of w δt and a refer to the permeate mass in kg the collecting time in h and the area of the used membrane in m2 respectively the total rejection of the ions was considered to be the ratio between the ion conductivity of the water in permeates and the feed and calculated based on eq 2 2 r j s if s ip s if x 100 the sif and sip symbols refer to the determined ion conductivity of the water in the feed and permeate respectively the conductivity was measured using the conductivity meter of the ddsj 308a type after dilution steps of the samples the present cations were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry perkin elmer while the anions were measured using dionex dx 120 ion chromatography 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization of the membrane 3 1 1 xrd analysis the xrd pattern of the z gp membrane was evaluated considering the patterns of the used precursors for kaolinite as starting materials its pattern exhibits the reported peaks of well crystalline kaolinite 12 3 001 20 8o 110 24 9 002 and 26 6o 111 xrd no 04 012 5104 fig 3a the obtained pattern of metakaolinite reflects significant destruction for the previously observed peak of kaolinite and the whole pattern appears to be for amorphous material fig 3b the synthetic d k geopolymer still shows the characterized pattern of the amorphous materials fig 1c for the zeolitized geopolymer membrane the obtained pattern demonstrates the formation of different phases of synthetic zeolite fig 3d the detected zeolite phases are zeolite a iccd ref code n 00 039 0222 zeolite x pdf

morphology in massive and agglomerated shape fig 4a the surface of d k geopolymer also characterizes by the presence of oriented pores that might be related to the incorporated skeletons of diatomite fig 4b the zeolitized membrane in the sem images appears in crystalline morphologies which are related to the growth of the zeolite crystals fig 4c the growth of these crystals according to the polymeric matrix resulted in an intersection between them forming a highly porous structure related to the formed zeolite and the interstitial nanopores fig 4c and d addressing the products at the hrtem images supports the previous description based on the sem images fig 4e and f the d k geopolymer appears as agglomerated particles with more detection for its porous matrix fig 4e for the zeolitized membrane appeared as a highly porous material of numerous pores of nano size which qualifies it to be applied as membrane considering the smaller pores of the zeolite crystals fig 4f 3 1 3 ft ir analysis the ft ir spectra of the d k geopolymer and the zeolitized membrane were presented in fig 5 the spectrum of d k geopolymer declared the existence of oh 3220 3385 cm 1 and h oh 1502 cm 1 1636 cm 1 groups which might be related to entrapped water molecules within its porous matrix in addition to the adsorbed molecules kljajević et al 2017 fig 5a the si o si and si o a identification bands were observed at 985 7 cm 1 and 602 cm 1 respectively which are deviated positions considering their positions for raw kaolinite fig 5a this reflects the amorphization of kaolinite layers into aluminosilicate gel which was assigned to the condensation of the essential structural units sio4 and alo4 tetrahedrons during the formation of the geopolymer caballero et al 2019 the spectrum of the synthetic zeolitized membrane is similar to that obtained for the synthetic zeolite in literature fig 5b the oh bearing groups and the coordinated water of zeolite were identified by the observed bands at 3452 cm 1 and 1435 cm 1 respectively the t o bending of to4 tetrahedrons t al and si the vibration of si o al and o t o were recognized by their bands at 1016 cm 1 400 cm 1 and 800 cm 1 respectively fig 5b mostafa et al 2021 liguori et al 2019 generally the si o al related bands used to signify the type of the formed zeolite the detection of bands at 469 cm 1 537 cm 1 and 673 cm 1 signifies the formation of fau zeolite zeolite x as well as the lta zeolite zeolite a the ft ir band at 740 cm 1 is related to both fau zeolite and gis zeolite zeolite p liguori et al 2019 3 1 4 microstructural and mechanical properties the determined surface area of the synthetic z gp membranes was estimated based on the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm curve fig 6 the determined values for gp and z gp membrane are 89 2 m2 g and 106 m2 g respectively table 1 it was predicted that the incorporated diatomite and the porous matrix are the main factors that enhanced the surface area of the geopolymer the observed increase in the surface area of the z gp membrane as compared to the synthetic gp signifies the role of formed zeolite phases with their microporous structures in enhancing the total surface area this was detected also in the measures average pore diameter as the determined value for the prepared z gp membrane 4 2 nm is smaller than the measured value of the prepared gp substrate 11 6 nm table 1 additionally the determined compressive and flexural strengths of z gp are 22 mpa and 3 6 mpa which are promising value for realistic applications 3 2 the desalination results 3 2 1 the desalination performances of z gp membrane with different thicknesses the influence of the z gp membrane thickness in its desalination performance was evaluated within the studied range from 1 mm up to 5 mm the desalination temperature was addressed at a constant temperature of 75 c fig 7a it can be detected that the achieved water flux shows observable declination with increasing the z gp membrane thickness from 1 mm up to 5 mm the obtained water flux at studied z gp thickness of 1 mm 2 mm 3 mm 4 mm and 5 mm is 8 34 kg m 2 h 1 7 63 kg m 2 h 1 7 05 kg m 2 h 1 5 72 kg m 2 h 1 and 3 63 kg m 2 h 1 respectively fig 7a on the other hand the salt rejection percentages enhanced strongly with using the z gp membrane at high thickness the rejection percentage increased from about 95 8 up to 99 8 with increasing the membrane thickness from 1 mm up to 5 mm fig 7a the increase in the membrane thickness causes an increment in the present resistance for the permeation of the water molecules through the porous structures of the formed zeolite phases as well as the pores of the geopolymer substrate zhou et al 2016 wang et al 2021 these cause declinations in the water flux values but on the other hand induce the salt rejection efficiency of the synthetic z gp membrane as both the high water flux and salt rejection efficiency control the performance the economic value of the used membrane using the synthetic z gp membrane at a thickness of 3 mm was preferred as it achieved significant salt rejection value 99 5 and promising water flux 7 05 kg m 2 h 1 considering the studied temperature 75 c therefore the thickness of the used z gp membrane was fixed at 3 mm for all the further desalination tests 3 2 2 the desalination performances of z gp membrane at different temperature the effect of the temperature on the z gp membrane performance in terms of water flux and salt rejection for the natural concentration of the representative sample 3205 mg l and membrane thickness of 3 mm was evaluated fig 7b the recognized water flux values increased significantly from 2 65 kg m 2 h 1 to 7 82 kg m 2 h 1 with expanding the temperature of the feed from 30 c up to 90 c fig 7b on the other hand the salt rejection percentage appears to be of slight effect with the changes in the temperature of the feed and the values at all the temperature values are higher than 99 fig 7b the reported increment in the water flux values at the high temperature conditions was assigned to the high driving forces which promote the penetration of the water molecules through the pores of the membrane zhou et al 2016 in the pv system the driving forces represent the differences between the partial pressure of the feed and the obtained permeate in addition to the diffusion rates of the penetrated water vapor zhou et al 2016 nigiz et al 2017 additionally the reported stabilization in the achieved salt rejection percentage at the studied temperature values reflects the significant role of the size exclusion mechanism during the desalination process wang et al 2021 3 2 3 stability of z gp membrane the stability of the z gp membrane during the desalination of the brackish groundwater in siwa oasis was assessed for 130 h considering the experimental conditions at 3 mm as the thickness of the used membrane and 90 c as temperature during the test the collected water from the tank was compensated carefully by adding additional water to the feed after certain intervals to preserve the actual concentration of the used feed at a constant value the test continued for about 130 h at total operation time considering a rest interval of 2 h after each essential operation interval of 10 h the values of water flux as well as the salt rejection percentages are of slight changes or nearly fixed from the starting interval 7 82 kg m 2 h 1 water flux and 99 6 salt rejection up to 60 h 7 76 kg m 2 h 1 water flux and 99 58 salt rejection fig 7c beyond this time interval the recognized water flux shows an observable decrease to 7 51 kg m 2 h 1 after a filtration interval of 130 h on the other hand the achieved salt rejection efficiency displayed significant stability 99 57 up to a working interval of 130 h fig 7c the documented decrease in the value of the water flux after 60 h was signified to three suggested reasons including a the accumulation of retained salts on z gp membrane surface which cause significant blocking for internal channels and pores and in turns increase the mass transfer resistance b the predicted increase the concentration of the delivered salts on the stream with increasing the operating time and this reduces the water flux and c the negative impact for the replacement of the dissolved ions ca2 and mg2 by the exchangeable ions within the structure of the zeolite phases during the desalination process zhou et al 2016 the chemical analysis of the z gp membrane after the desalination processes reflects a considerable increase in the na k ca2 and mg2 content this supports the previous suggestions about the accumulation of the rejected salts on its surface and the ion exchange processes zhou et al 2016 3 2 4 the reusability of z gp membrane the suitability of the synthetic z gp membrane to be reused in several desalination cycles was investigated for four runs at selected conditions of 3 mm thickness of the membrane and adjusted temperature of 90 c the regeneration of the z gp membrane was performed by backwashing process using freshwater considering the pressure at the atmospheric value on the retentate side and 10 kpa on the permeate side this was followed by a cycle of acidic washing using diluted hcl 0 02 m and then rinsed again in freshwater the washing step was repeated three times at fixed temperature of 30 c before the application of the membrane in another desalination cycle based on both the salt rejection percentages and the water flux values the synthetic z gp membrane is of significant recyclability or reusability properties for the four runs fig 7d the measured water flux for the reusing run1 run 2 run 3 and run 4 are 7 82 kg m 2 h 1 7 12 kg m 2 h 1 6 2 kg m 2 h 1 and 4 55 kg m 2 h 1 respectively fig 7d for the salt rejection percentages the obtained values are 99 6 99 4 98 8 and 98 4 for the reusing runs of run1 run 2 run 3 and run 4 respectively fig 7d the reported results during the reusability experiments reflect additional technical and commercial value for the synthetic z gp inorganic membrane this will save the costs that can be consumed in the continuous replacement of the used membranes by other new ones to maintain the permeate water at the required quality as a function of the total dissolved salts the observed reduction in the salt rejection and the water flux with repeating the desalination reusing runs was assigned to the continuous blocking of the pores with the salts and the quantities of the exchanges ions within the structure of the synthetic zeolite 3 2 5 the activation energy of the water permeation process based on the arrhenius relationship the value of the activation energy ea for the water permeation processes through the used z gp membrane was estimated based on eq 3 considering the slope of the fitting processes fig 8 the obtained value is 18 9 kj mol and its positive sign demonstrates the permeation of the water by activated diffusion mechanism causing a considerable increase in the water flux with increasing the temperature of the water feed 3 j i a i exp ep i rt the presented symbols in the equations are ji ai ep r and t refer to the permeate flux of the z gp membrane pre exponential factor the activation energy of the diffusion processes and the sorption heat the gas constant and the absolute temperature respectively the achieved water flux values are higher than the reported values for some of the previously investigated zeolite membranes in the literature are related to the type of the present zeolite phases this is related to the existence of zeolite x fau as the dominant synthetic zeolite phase which is of higher hydrophilicity and larger pore diameter than the reported values for the other phases of zeolite zhou et al 2016 qiu et al 2020 3 2 6 the suggested mechanism the predicted mechanism for the rejection of the salts from the siwa brackish groundwater can be described according to the suggested model by he et al 2013 firstly the metal species which are of positive charges as sodium ions were adsorbed by the surficial sites of the zeolite phases and the geopolymer substrate that are of negative charges at the experimental conditions this cause conversion for the whole surface of the membrane to be of positively charged surface cho et al 2011 after that the positively charged surface of the z gp membrane accelerates the mobility of the hydrated anions towards the non zeolitic pores of the geopolymer matrix and inhibits the mobility of the hydrated cations this involved cooperative operating of both the size exclusion mechanism and the charge exclusion mechanism he et al 2013 cho et al 2011 both hydrated cations and anions can be adsorbed on the surfaces of the present zeolite phases or in their internal pores after their diffusion into the membrane by the pores of the geopolymer matrix by attending the adsorption equilibrium with the polymeric pores of the membrane no additional ions can be adsorbed as a result of the concentration polarization effect considering the findings of the desalination experiments the salt rejection efficiency does not affect by the presence of the nano zeolitic pores in small quantities and depends essentially on the thickness of the membrane but at specific or thresholds values using the z gp membrane at this threshold thickness reduces or omits the impact of the defects in the present mesopores and macropores he et al 2013 the theoretical model of the synthetic membrane suggested its formation in symmetric and homogeneous structures fig 9 considering the previous assumption the zeolite phases present in many layers within the membrane in a vertical and horizontal orientation and impeded the non zeolitic pores that are related to the pores of the geopolymer substrate cho et al 2011 the influence of the non zeolitic pores or the polymeric matrix can be eliminated strongly by increasing the thickness of the membrane this induces the possible occurring of the size exclusion mechanism during the desalination tests he et al 2013 it was expected that the cations can enter within the interior of the zeolite phases of the membrane the existence of numerous internal pores increases the adsorption interface between the dissolved cations and the present zeolitic phases and in turn hider their diffusion he et al 2013 considering the estimated salt rejection results of the performed desalination tests the desalination mechanisms of siwa brackish groundwater using the synthetic z gp membrane involved size exclusion mesoporous adsorption and electrostatic repulsion the adsorption of the mechanism of the salts ions by zeolite was explained based on the assumption of electric double layer theory edl fig 9 according to this theory the interaction between the zeolite particles and high salinity water resulted in the formation of electrical double layers around the zeolitic grains wen et al 2018 the first layer stern layer characterizes by strong bound properties between the positively charged ions and the zeolite surface by van der waals forces attraction potential and significant rejection for the negatively charged ions by electrostatic repulsive forces repulsion potential wibowo et al 2017 the stability of the electric charges during the adsorption of the free salt ions causes the formation of the second layer which is known as the diffuse layer that exhibits high electrostatic potential as compared to the stern layer the second layer is of considerable impact in the capturing of the free salt ions wen et al 2018 this continued until the reduction of the total electric potential to zero which is associated with vanishing for the adsorption reactions between the salt ions and the zeolite surface wibowo et al 2017 3 2 7 technical evaluation of the water after the desalination process the chemical analysis of the feed was compared with the analysis of permeate after the desalination experiments using the synthetic z gp membrane table 2 the results demonstrate strong declination in the total dissolved salts as well as the essential salts bearing cations and anions to levels highly matched with the required international and national standards of drinking water as well as the irrigation water such results demonstrate the values of the synthetic z gp membrane as an inorganic membrane of low preparation cost and can be applied effectively in the desalination of the brackish groundwater in siwa oasis 3 2 8 comparison study the estimated desalination results by the synthetic z gp membrane were compared with other studied organic and inorganic membranes based on the results the synthetic membrane can achieve results close to the obtained results by such membranes considering its value as a self supporting inorganic membrane table 3 this qualifies the product to be applied as low cost membrane in the desalination of brackish groundwater in siwa oasis 4 conclusion diatomite kaolinite based geopolymer was synthesized and treated hydrothermally into zeolite impeded geopolymer as an inorganic

area of 106 m2 g and an average pore diameter of 4 2 nm the synthetic membrane was applied as a low cost membrane for the desalination of the brackish groundwater in siwa oasis by the pervaporation method the achieved water fluxes using the membrane at different thicknesses are 8 34 kg m 2 h 1 1 mm 7 63 kg m 2 h 1 2 mm and 7 05 kg m 2 h 1 3 mm while the determined salt rejection values are 95 8 1 mm 97 6 2 mm and 99 4 3 mm adjusting the feed temperature at 90 c causes enhancement in the water flux to 7 82 kg m 2 h 1 and the salt rejection to 99 6 the stability properties of the z gp membrane were evaluated for 140 h achieving a water flux of 7 5 kg m 2 h 1 and salt rejection of 99 57 additionally the membrane is of potential reusability to be applied in the desalination process of the brackish groundwater in siwa oasis the groundwater sample of siwa oasis after the desalination processes show chemical properties with the accepted limits for irrigation water as well as drinking

choice and implementation of a model jakeman and letcher 2003 stenson et al 2011 there is still no reliable salinity model that makes the most sense in all circumstances bailey et al 2019 among water quality models empirical models use regression equations based on the observed data empirical models analyze data and fit equations to the data and limitations in capturing water quantity and quality processes siad et al 2019 also many one dimensional physically based models are developed to simulate water and solute dynamics invariably in saturated unsaturated soil at a local scale these models include 3dade leij and bradford 1994 hydrus 1d simunek et al 2005 leachm hutson and wagenet 1989 saltmod oosterbaan 2001 swap kroes et al 2017 and so on these models have been widely used for the study of anthropogenic salinity processes related to agriculture also groundwater models such as modflow harbaugh 2005 and perfect wlag kelley and o brien 2012 have been utilized as a basis for computing salt mass loadings from the groundwater into the river for example tavakoli kivi et al 2019 developed the uzf rt3d sec model to simulate the fate and transport of major salt ions calcium magnesium sodium potassium sulfate chloride bicarbonate and carbonate due to advection dispersion source sink mixing sulfur cycling redox reactions precipitation dissolution aqueous complexation and cation exchange for regional scale agricultural groundwater systems however the salinity model of tavakoli kivi et al 2019 is limited in addressing salinity processes such as groundwater solution temperature and ph non equilibrium reactions between the solid phase and the soil solution due to heterogeneities effects of chemical precipitation and dissolution on soil porosity the impact of partial co2 pressure on the full carbon cycle and consideration of high ionic strength i 0 5 moreover in stream models such as msm bigmod close et al 2004 iqqm simons et al 1996 and realm perera et al 2005 can predict the fate and transport of pollutants in surface waters furthermore watershed scale models such as bc2c gilfedder et al 2009 catsalt tuteja et al 2003 2csalt stenson et al 2011 wec c croton and barry 2001 swat salt model of bailey et al 2019 and swat s maleki tirabadi et al 2021 can predict the quantity and quality of pollutants from the defined watershed area however many issues limit the usability of water quality models for watershed scale salinity modeling for example the swat salt model of bailey et al 2019 is based on the salinity model of tavakoli kivi et al 2019 and can simulate the fate and transport of eight major salt ions so4 2 ca2 mg2 na k cl co3 2 and hco3 in the surface runoff soil percolation and leaching groundwater flow and streamflow therefore the swat salt model of bailey et al 2019 has similar limitations of the salinity model of tavakoli kivi et al 2019 besides some critical salinity processes such as dispersion and diffusion which were addressed in the salinity model of tavakoli kivi et al 2019 were not addressed in the modeling framework of the swat salt model of bailey et al 2019 furthermore the swat salt model of bailey et al 2019 does not address precipitation dissolution of salt in the river also given that swat s water quantity model is not based on the richards equation simunek et al 2005 critical processes such as the upward salt flux between the soil layers of the soil profile cannot be adequately modeled moreover the vadose zone is not a real soil layer for the swat model neitsch et al 2011 thus the amount of the solute leaching into the shallow aquifer and the solute amount in the shallow aquifer returning to the root zone via water in response to a moisture deficit can only be roughly estimated also an hru which may be a discontinuous in media does not connect to adjacent hrus neitsch et al 2011 these may be significantly influence the chemical equilibrium of the soil profile and aquifer furthermore natural salinity sources and processes were disregarded in their modeling framework also the swat salt model of bailey et al 2019 cannot adequately predict the trends in the groundwater salt loading into rivers thus the swat salt model of bailey et al 2019 cannot consider all salinity sources and processes at the watershed scale therefore there is a need to develop new water quality models to better consider water quality processes consideration of detailed all natural and anthropogenic salinity processes is an enormous complicated and time consuming task at a watershed scale biggs et al 2013 conceptual or physically based water quality models are typically limited by simplified approximations of large scale water quality processes they inevitably contain errors originating from model structures that lead to incorrect problem diagnosis and inefficient investment and management strategies schellart et al 2010 voinov and shugart 2013 hrachowitz et al 2016 guo et al 2020 these models which have different theories and algorithms yield different results despite receiving similar model inputs obropta et al 2008 van vliet et al 2019 thus there is a need to develop adaptable water quality models that provide an appropriate framework for incorporating scientific judgments to the modeling framework to reduce these deficiencies krueger et al 2012 tscheikner gratl et al 2019 expert judgment is based on the professional knowledge of skilled experts and is complementary to simulation models expert opinion can fundamentally assist choices about process representations and adjust parameter values gassman et al 2007 the expert opinion may be the best available information in many complex environmental systems when there is a limitation inconsistency and lack of observed data and formal theories krueger et al 2012 thus expert opinion can help consider the temporal and spatial variability of water quality processes in the modeling framework over long periods and in large watersheds the soil and water assessment tool swat is a semi distributed watershed scale model designed to quantify the impact of land management practices on water sediment nutrients and pesticide yields in large complex catchments over long periods neitsch et al 2011 arnold et al 2012 many model comparison and review studies also suggested the swat model as the right choice for streamflow and pollutant modeling köhne et al 2009 fu et al 2019 tan et al 2020 main model components include weather hydrology sediments nutrients pesticides bacteria and pathogens plant and crop growth and land management the modularized fortran codes of the swat model are well organized and can be directly updated and added the swat model can be applied for catchments ranging from small to very large sizes thus the swat model s comprehensive framework can appropriately assist the consideration of main salt transportation processes throughout a watershed a flexible method is required to incorporate reliable expert scientific judgments into a watershed scale salinity model framework this study s main objective is to develop a salinity module for the swat model that can simulate soil and water salinity process using expert opinion at a watershed scale the method is novel in the application of expert opinions to a deterministic continuous time scale model by utilizing new methods and equations that affect salinity in surface runoff and subsurface flows the fortran codes of the proposed model were internally linked to the swat model 2 methodology 2 1 salinity modeling fig 1 illustrates the salinity processes of the swat sf model corresponding to all equations first three different concentrations are simulated for the surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow of hrus also the average soil salinities of hrus are simulated then input salt masses to river reaches are simulated then salt exports and salt concentrations of river reaches are simulated besides the dissolution and precipitation of salts are considered for river reaches the following equations define the salinity processes if the amount of the solid soluble salt in the soil is not enough to increase the dissolved salt concentration of the soil water to the maximum salt concentration the solid soluble salt completely dissolves in the soil water yang et al 2018 furthermore when the amount of the solid soluble salt in the soil is enough to increase the dissolved salt concentration of the soil water after evapotranspiration to the maximum salt concentration the salt solubility in the excess salt scenario is considered in the model the amount of salt in the soil profile in an hru can be derived using the following equation quílez et al 2009 1 m max a d root γ p sf 10 5 where m max is the maximum amount of the salt mass in the soil profile of the hru ton a is the area of the hru m2 d root is the average depth of the root zone of the hru mm γ is the average soil bulk density of the soil profile of the hru gr cm3 and p sf is the percentage of saline formations in the soil profile of the hru following equations are derived to calculate the salt pickup due to the salt dissolution in the root zone 2 tds max ω m m max 10 6 q sw 3 tds es ω m tds sf typ p sf 10 2 here tds max is the maximum theoretical tds of the soil water due to the salt dissolution for the hru mg l q sw is the soil water volume after the evapotranspiration for the hru m3 tds es is the tds of the soil water due to the salt dissolution in the excess salt scenario for the hru mg l ω m is the monthly mixing coefficient for the soil profile of the hru and tds sf typ is the tds of the soil water including seven types for the saline part of the hru due to the salt dissolution in the excess salt scenario mg l since solute leaching evapotranspiration and environmental conditions vary by months in a year for the root zone monthly mixing coefficients are considered akça et al 2020 these coefficients correspond to the mixing coefficient for the alluvial store and hillslope store of the 2csalt model stenson et al 2011 eq 3 calculates a weighted average of the salt concentration due to the salt dissolution based on the saline part with the concentration ω m tds sf typ and the non saline part with the concentration 0 mg l of the hru as shown in table 1 values of the tds sf typ in eq 3 are different for various types of soil water however any desired type of root zone water can be added to table 1 the type of soil water is determined based on the ionic composition of water i e the third column of table 1 two computable tds values which can be obtained from eqs 2 and 3 are compared to calculate the tds of the soil water of the soil profile due to the salt dissolution for the hru as follows 4 tds sw minimum tds max tds es here tds sw is the tds of the soil water of the soil profile due to the salt dissolution for the hru mg l the following equation can be derived for the total salt concentration of the soil water of the soil profile for the hru 5 c sw tds sw tds swn here c sw is the total salt concentration of the soil water of the soil profile for the hru mg l and tds swn is the tds of the soil water due to other salt sources such as the rainfall except the dissolution of the salt from the saline formation for the hru mg l the salt concentration of the lateral flow c lat is assumed equal to the total salt concentration of the soil water of the soil profile c sw for the hru eqs 1 5 indirectly address net effects of all occurring processes on variations of the salt concentration of the soil profile it is possible for skilled experts to introduce time series values of p sf ω m tds sf typ and tds swn to the model as input data the following equation can be derived for the salt concentration of the output surface runoff from the hru to the river reach 6 c surf α tds sw tds srn here c surf is the salt concentration of the surface runoff for the hru mg l α is the linear wash off coefficient stenson et al 2011 or salt percolation coefficient neitsch et al 2011 of the surface runoff for the hru and tds srn is the tds of the surface runoff due to other salt sources such as the rainfall except the dissolution of the salt from the saline formation for the hru mg l eq 6 addresses net effects of all occurring processes on variations of the salt concentration of the surface runoff it is possible for skilled experts to introduce time series values of α and tds srn to the model as input data the average soil salt content of the soil profile can be derived for the hru using the following equation jiang et al 2016 7 ssc c sw θ 10 3 γ here ssc is the average soil salt content of the soil profile for the hru gr kg and θ is the average soil water content of the soil profile for the hru cm3 cm3 the average electrical conductivity of the soil saturation extract of the soil profile can be derived for the hru from the soil water solute concentration of the soil profile using the following equation kroes et al 2008 8 ec sat 1 492 c sw θ 10 3 θ sat here ec sat is the average electrical conductivity of the saturation extract of the soil profile for the hru ds m and θ sat is the average soil saturated water content of the soil profile for the hru cm3 cm3 numerous studies have verified that there is a clear relationship between the groundwater table and salt concentration e g rao 2008 chowdhury et al 2008 kumar et al 2009 colombani et al 2016 kim et al 2017 akter et al 2021 once the groundwater table ascends above a certain depth the solute concentration is diluted and remained at these levels until the water table depth descends below this depth kim et al 2017 therefore the following equation can be derived for the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer for the hru 9 if aq sh aq th then c sh λ c sh max here aq sh is the depth of water in the shallow aquifer for the hru mm aq th is the threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer that is required to dilute the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer for the hru mm c sh is the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer for the hru mg l c sh max is the maximum salt concentration of the shallow aquifer for the hru mg l and λ is the mixing coefficient for the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer for the hru furthermore λ corresponds with the mixing coefficient for the alluvial store and hillslope store of the 2csalt model stenson et al 2011 also aq th corresponds with the discharge threshold for hillslope discharge of the 2csalt model stenson et al 2011 eq 9 indirectly addresses net effects of all occurring processes on variations of the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer based on the depth of water in the shallow aquifer however several threshold depths and mixing coefficients can be considered for the shallow aquifer the mass of the output salt from the hrus to the river reach in each subbasin is the total mass of the output salt from the hrus via the surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow in the subbasins the point source including spring and sewage discharges discharges the salt into the river reach the following equation can be derived for the salt concentration of the point source 10 c ps ψ c sub sh 1 ψ c psn here c ps is the total salt concentration of the point source for the subbasin mg l ψ is the adjustment factor for the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer and point source loads such as sewage for the subbasin c sub sh is the weighted average salt concentration of the shallow aquifer for the subbasin based on fractions of subbasin area in hrus mg l and c psn is the average salt concentration of point source loads which the salt concentration is not equal to the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer in the subbasin mg l the salt concentration of the point source may not a unique value for each subbasin and each time step the mass of each component can be derived according to the bellow generic equation 11 m c q 10 6 here m is the mass of the salt export ton c is the salt concentration of the flow mg l and q is the quantity of the flow m3 the salt concentration of the river reach c ir was compared to a threshold salt concentration c th if c ir is greater than c th then the precipitation of the salt will occur conversely if c ir is smaller than c th then the dissolution of the salt only will occur in river reaches that cross over saline formations then the mass of the available suspended salt in the river reach can be derived according to the salt balance using the following equations 12 m fr m ir ε c ir c th q r 10 6 if c ir c th 13 m fr m ir δ ε c ir c th q r 10 8 if c ir c th here m fr is the final output salt from the river reach ton m ir is the initial output salt from the river reach ton ε is the linear salt precipitation dissolution coefficient for the river reach c ir is the initial salt concentration of the river reach mg l c th is the threshold salt concentration of the river reach mg l q r is the total volume of water in the river reach m3 and δ is the coefficient for the dissolution in river reaches with a saline bed the river reach s final salt concentration can be calculated using the available mass of the suspended salt in the river reach and eq 11 it is possible for skilled experts to introduce time series values of ε δ and c th to the model as input data 2 2 model calibration the calibration of the model was done by applying the sufi 2 program abbaspour 2015 with the aid of the modified iswat interface to consider parameters of quantity and quality models yang 2006 in addition global sensitivity analysis was used to find the model s most sensitive parameters based on the regression method abbaspour 2015 in this study the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 was used as the objective function and the model parameters were calibrated to maximize the value of nse during the calibration period also degrees of uncertainty in model predictions were determined furthermore the coefficient of determination r2 percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr moriasi et al 2007 r factor and p factor were utilized to evaluate the model performances 2 3 description of the study area the dehram river basin has an area of about 4140 km2 and is located in southern iran between 28 n to 30 n and 52 e to 53 e fig 2 shows the location topography monitoring station land use and saline formation map of the dehram river basin the average elevation of the basin is about 1400 m besides the average annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are approximately 300 and 1620 mm year respectively the average discharge of the river is about 10 m3 s at the dehram station abgeer 2011 there are natural and anthropogenic sources of salts in the dehram river basin saline formations are predominantly the oligocene miocene asmari formation a major hydrocarbon reservoir in southwestern iran limestone formation and salt diapir the average tds of the river is about 6000 mg l at the dehram station abgeer 2011 2 4 model setup land use map was acquired from the usgs global land use land cover characterization glcc database usgs 2018 the shrubland covers 80 of the watershed area soil map data on two layers 0 30 and 30 100 cm depth was obtained from the global map of the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 1995 the digital elevation model dem at a 90 m resolution was acquired from the srtm of nasa jarvis et al 2008 climate data were obtained from the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr ncep 2018 four subbasins and forty six hrus were considered for the dehram river basin discharge and tds data for the outlet river gauge of the dehram river basin were provided by the local water authorities the abgeer consulting engineers company acec provided data on water use point sources e g the spring discharge data and sewage discharge data and other maps and data abgeer 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 selected parameters for the model calibration seventeen parameters four parameters for the discharge and thirteen parameters for the salinity were used in the model calibration table 2 presents an overview of parameters used for the calibration of the model with their final ranges also the values of other parameters were determined through prior model calibrations based on field data furthermore salinity parameters were constrained based on the observed soil salinity data groundwater salinity data sewage salinity data and spring salinity data however some parameters were further differentiated for subbasins moreover upper limits for the soil salinity of hrus located in subbasins 1 2 3 and 4 were considered 0 3 1 4 2 9 and 2 4 ds m respectively also upper limits for the groundwater salinity of subbasins 1 2 3 and 4 were considered 500 500 1000 and 12 000 mg l respectively this is because of the existence of significant saline formations in the subbasin 4 besides the tds of municipal agricultural and industrial sewages of subbasins 2 3 4 are very higher than subbasin 1 moreover some extremely salty springs with tds up to about 350 000 mg l exist in the subbasin 4 thus upper limits considered for c psn of subbasins 1 2 3 and 4 were 2000 20 000 20 000 and 100 000 mg l respectively the amount of the available water capacity awc was increased during the calibration process table 2 this corresponds to water holding and evapotranspiration were increased in addition the calibrated value of the adjustment factor for the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer and other point source loads ψ for subbasin 4 indicated that the return flow from the shallow aquifer and other point source loads contributed almost the same amounts of the discharge into the river reach table 2 the calibrated value of the linear wash off coefficient of the surface runoff α indicated that the salt concentration of the surface runoff is not significantly lower than the salt concentration of the soil water of the soil profile table 2 moreover the monthly mixing coefficients of the soil profile ω had different calibrated values table 2 therefore the model addressed temporal variations of the salt concentration of the soil profile furthermore subbasins 2 and 3 had the same calibrated values of the average salt concentration of point source loads c psn in contrast the subbasin 4 had higher calibrated value of the average salt concentration of point source loads than other subbasins table 2 also subbasin 4 had higher calibrated value of the maximum salt concentration of the shallow aquifer c sh max than other subbasins table 2 3 2 model performance evaluation calibration and validation performance results of the dehram gauge for the prediction of discharges and salt exports are seen in table 3 according to the recommendations of moriasi et al 2007 r2 nse and rsr values of quantity and quality predictions are good or satisfactory for calibration and validation periods besides pbias values are very good furthermore while r factor values of model predictions are smaller than 1 5 p factor values of model predictions are above 0 7 therefore all processes leading to observations were somehow captured correctly a comparison between simulated and observed discharges and salt exports at the dehram station can be seen in fig 3 monthly simulated discharge and salt export results show that patterns in the simulated and observed discharges and salt exports were similar fig 3 locations of peak flows and peak salt exports were also well predicted base flows were better predicted than peak flows both overestimation and underestimation of peak salt export predictions were observed mainly due to corresponding discharge volumes fig 3 maximum salt concentrations of the river and minimum discharges of the river occurred at the same time steps however the accuracy of salt export and salt concentration predictions of the model correlates closely with the precision of discharge predictions the complex nature of salinity processes makes it difficult to predict accurately temporal changes of water and soil salinity states during the simulation period however mixing coefficients and adjustment factors can be directly updated for desired groups of time steps thus expert scientific judgments can directly modify errors related to the model predictions using mixing coefficients and adjustment factors 3 3 predictions of salt concentrations salt concentrations of waters vary throughout a basin over time fig 4 illustrates the box plot charts of salt concentrations for the surface runoff root zone and river reach as shown in fig 4 the 0th 25th 50th 75th and 100th percentiles of salt concentration predictions are different for each hru and river reach hrus 1 15 16 41 and 42 46 are generally located in the north middle and south of the dehram river basin respectively the range of the change in salt concentration of the southern parts of the dehram river basin is wider than in other parts of the basin fig 4 conversely the range of the change of the salt concentration of the northern parts of the dehram river basin is narrower than other parts of the basin fig 4 the swat sf model could consider monthly variations of salt concentrations for hrus and river reaches average salt concentrations of waters are not uniformly distributed throughout the basin spatial distributions of average tds values for surface runoff root zone aquifer and river are illustrated in fig 5a d the northern parts of the dehram river basin generally have a lower average salt concentration than other parts the comparison of fig 5 with fig 2 indicates that saline formations profoundly affect the salt concentration of water in the dehram river basin although one class of the water type initially was considered for the soil profile of all hrus fig 5f shows that water types of the soil profile of some hrus belonged to other classes after the model calibration therefore the swat sf model is significant in considering salinity sources and processes in the investigation of salinity problems as shown in fig 5e f the results of the swat sf model could show the spatial distribution of average salt content and ecsat of the soil at the watershed scale 3 4 average monthly flow and salt export the relation between the streamflow and salt export can be studied for a river fig 6 exhibits average monthly flows and salt exports at the dehram gauge there is a direct correlation between the amounts of discharge and salt export fig 6 with highest quantities of the flow and salt export occurred from december to april this is also correlated with the occurrence of rain also amounts of the flow and salt export are low from may to november therefore the swat sf model could indicate relations between the flow and salt export for rivers 3 5 salt loadings salts are transported in the soil environment through hydrological processes that transport salts fig 7a c show salt mass transportations from the surface runoff lateral flow and return flow into the dehram river basin streamflow fig 7d f depict the salt mass transportation through the percolation into the aquifer upflux into the soil profile and recharge into the deep aquifer for the dehram river basin fig 7 reveals that the amount of salt transportation has a non uniform distribution in the dehram river basin also salt transportation by the surface runoff and lateral flow is essential in some scattered parts of the dehram river basin fig 7 thus the swat sf model could identify parts of a basin endangered with considerable salt transportations there is a need to identify temporal patterns of salt loadings into rivers fig 8a d illustrate monthly salt loadings by the surface runoff lateral flow groundwater flow and point source into dehram river besides there is a need to determine the importance of each salt transport process compared to others fig 8e depicts the relative importance of salt mass balance components for the dehram river basin fig 8e f reveal that point sources the sum of spring and sewage discharges loaded considerable amounts of salts into the river than other components for the dehram river basin lateral flow is a critical component of the hydrological processes which can load considerable amounts of the salt into the reach in arid and semi arid areas jiang et al 2019 the river s salt balance indicates that about 17 of input salt loadings are deposited in the river fig 8e also the percent error of salt mass balance of the dehram river basin is about 1 2 moreover specifying the salt balance for each subbasin is required to assess the seriousness of the salinity problem bugan et al 2015 the salt balance of subbasins can be defined by salt export import e i ratios biggs et al 2013 fig 8g shows the salt export import e i ratio for all dehram river basin subbasins results of the swat sf model could model the temporal patterns and magnitudes of salt loadings at the watershed scale 4 practical implications available salinity models like bc2c and 2csalt are limited in simulating all salinity processes at a watershed scale the bc2c model gilfedder et al 2009 is a simple salinity model that does not simulate daily monthly and annual salinity processes the 2csalt model stenson et al 2011 was developed to predict the salt movement from upland watersheds in murray darling basin therefore the usability of the 2csalt model is very restricted also the 2csalt model only simulates the salt export at the outlet of the watershed the swat sf model uses water quantity components of the swat model therefore the model can appropriately consider major salt transport processes at the watershed scale the swat sf model uses data which is generally available or can easily be gathered in large scale studies the usability of the model is not restricted to a specific watershed thus the swat sf model provides a general framework that can be used for the simulation of a broader range of water and soil salinity processes than bc2c and 2csalt models compared to the swat salt model of bailey et al 2019 the swat sf model can consider salinity processes related to the existence of saline formations also the swat sf model can address the precipitation dissolution of the salt in the river as the swat sf model can address the net effects of all processes e g precipitation dissolution processes on the solute concentration of 1 soil 2 aquifer and 3 river environments the solute concentration simulation of the model is not limited to whole tds that consists of many individual pollutions however addressing the net effects of fewer processes on an individual pollution concentration needs a separate model simulation and calibration in addition considering a very short warm up period such as smaller than one year is enough for the swat sf model even though chemical interactions are not directly considered in the swat sf model the spatial distribution of chemical interactions can be accounted for indirectly by the classification of water types of the soil profile furthermore local scale processes can be addressed accurately using local scale models then results of local scale models can be introduced directly to the swat sf model as input data the proposed framework can work in daily and monthly time steps also although vertical salt transportations do not directly contribute to the salinity modeling of the soil environment amounts of these vertical salt transportations can be estimated using the results of the swat sf model the main limitations of the swat sf model pertain to the limitations of the swat model for example the weakness of the groundwater flow modeling and the secondary consideration of vertical salt transportations in the soil environment 5 conclusion in this research a flexible salinity model swat sf was proposed for watershed scale water and soil salinity modeling the new swat sf is capable of addressing net effects of all processes on the solute concentration within soil aquifer and river environments without the need to simulate transport of each individual salt ion the model which was constrained by the data both at the outlet and within the watershed including the observed river discharge and salinity data soil salinity data groundwater salinity data sewage salinity data and spring salinity data was successfully applied and evaluated to the dehram river basin of iran the performance of the swat sf model was tested for an extended period sixteen years of the simulation results show that the proposed model could simulate monthly variations of salt concentrations for the surface runoff soil profile and aquifer of hrus and river reaches spatial distributions of average salt content and the ecsat of the soil profile at a watershed scale relationship between the streamflow and salt export parts of a basin that endanger with considerable salt transportations the temporal patterns and magnitude of salt loadings at the watershed scale the proposed model which can profit from the advantages of the expert opinion can simultaneously model natural and unnatural pollution sources and processes therefore it is recommended that the proposed model be utilized for the water and soil quality modeling of small to large watersheds in salinity studies especially in the assessment of soil and water qualities in water management projects code availability the codes of the swat sf module is available on github https github com m1s1m swat sf declaration of competing interest the authors

sufficient volume and water quality burek et al 2016 veldkamp et al 2017 while water demand is increasing water availability is shrinking because of declining resources and pollution the salinity of

all climatic conditions and can result from natural and human induced processes shahid et al 2018 non point source and point source pollutions from natural sources e g natural saline geologic

each model can work better in certain situations than others the data availability and the purpose of modeling such as water resource management and evaluation of water quality are constraints to the

quality models empirical models use regression equations based on the observed data empirical models analyze data and fit equations to the data and limitations in capturing water quantity and quality processes siad et al 2019 also many one dimensional physically based models are developed to simulate water and solute dynamics invariably in saturated unsaturated soil at a local scale these models include 3dade leij and bradford 1994 hydrus 1d simunek et al 2005 leachm hutson and wagenet 1989 saltmod oosterbaan 2001 swap kroes et al 2017 and so on these models have been widely used for the study of anthropogenic salinity processes related to agriculture also groundwater models such as modflow harbaugh 2005 and perfect wlag kelley and o brien 2012 have been utilized as a basis for computing salt mass loadings from the groundwater into the river for example tavakoli kivi et al 2019 developed the uzf rt3d sec model to simulate the fate and transport of major salt ions calcium magnesium sodium potassium sulfate chloride bicarbonate and carbonate due to advection dispersion source sink mixing sulfur cycling redox reactions precipitation dissolution aqueous complexation and cation exchange for regional scale agricultural groundwater systems however the salinity model of tavakoli kivi et al 2019 is limited in addressing salinity processes such as groundwater solution

partial co2 pressure on the full carbon cycle and consideration of high ionic strength i 0 5 moreover in stream models such as msm bigmod close et al 2004 iqqm simons et al 1996 and realm perera et al 2005 can predict the fate and transport of pollutants in surface waters furthermore watershed scale models such as bc2c gilfedder et al 2009 catsalt tuteja et al 2003 2csalt stenson et al 2011 wec c croton and barry 2001 swat salt model of bailey et al 2019 and swat s maleki tirabadi et al 2021 can predict the quantity and quality of pollutants from the defined watershed area however many issues limit the usability of water quality models for watershed scale salinity modeling for example the swat salt model of bailey et al 2019 is based on the salinity model of tavakoli kivi et al 2019 and can simulate the fate and transport of eight major salt ions so4 2 ca2 mg2 na k cl co3 2 and hco3 in the surface runoff soil percolation and leaching groundwater flow and streamflow therefore the swat salt model of bailey et al 2019 has similar limitations of the salinity model of tavakoli kivi et al 2019 besides some critical salinity processes such as dispersion and diffusion which were addressed in the salinity model of tavakoli kivi et al 2019 were not addressed in the modeling framework of the swat salt model of bailey et al 2019 furthermore the swat salt model of bailey et al 2019 does not address precipitation dissolution of salt in the river also given that swat s water quantity model is not based on the richards equation simunek et al 2005 critical processes such as the upward salt flux between the soil layers of the soil profile cannot be adequately modeled moreover the vadose zone is not a real soil layer for the swat model neitsch et al 2011 thus the amount of the solute leaching into the shallow aquifer and the solute amount in the shallow aquifer returning to the root zone via water in response to a moisture deficit can only be roughly estimated also an hru which may be a discontinuous in media does not connect to adjacent hrus neitsch et al 2011 these may be significantly influence the chemical equilibrium of the soil profile and aquifer furthermore natural salinity sources and processes were disregarded in their modeling framework also the swat salt model of bailey et al 2019 cannot adequately predict the trends in the groundwater salt loading into rivers thus the swat salt model of bailey et al 2019 cannot consider all salinity sources and processes at the watershed scale therefore there is a need to develop new water quality models to better consider water quality processes consideration of detailed all natural and anthropogenic salinity processes is an enormous complicated and time consuming task at a watershed scale biggs et al 2013 conceptual or physically based water quality models are typically limited by simplified approximations of large scale water quality processes they inevitably contain errors originating from model structures that lead to incorrect problem diagnosis and inefficient investment and management strategies schellart et al 2010 voinov and shugart 2013 hrachowitz et al 2016 guo et al 2020 these models which have different theories and algorithms yield different results despite receiving similar model inputs obropta et al 2008 van vliet et al 2019 thus there is a need to develop adaptable water quality models that provide an appropriate framework for incorporating scientific judgments to the modeling framework to reduce these deficiencies krueger et al 2012 tscheikner gratl et al 2019 expert judgment is based on the professional knowledge of skilled experts and is complementary to simulation models expert opinion can fundamentally assist choices about process representations and adjust parameter values gassman et al 2007 the expert opinion may be the best available information in many complex environmental systems when there is a limitation inconsistency and lack of observed data and formal theories krueger et al 2012 thus expert opinion can help consider the temporal and spatial variability of water quality processes in the modeling framework over long periods and in large watersheds the soil and water assessment tool swat is a semi distributed watershed scale model designed to quantify the impact of land management practices on water sediment nutrients and pesticide yields in large complex catchments over long periods neitsch et al 2011 arnold et al 2012 many model comparison and review studies also suggested the swat model as the right choice for streamflow and pollutant modeling köhne et al 2009 fu et al 2019 tan et al 2020 main model components include weather hydrology sediments nutrients pesticides bacteria and pathogens plant and crop growth and land management the modularized fortran codes of the swat model are well organized and can be directly updated and added the swat model can be applied for catchments ranging from small to very large sizes thus the swat model s comprehensive framework can appropriately assist the consideration of main salt transportation processes throughout a watershed a flexible method is required to incorporate reliable expert scientific judgments into a watershed scale salinity model framework this study s main objective is to develop a salinity module for the swat model that can simulate soil and water salinity process using expert opinion at a watershed scale the method is novel in the application of expert opinions to a deterministic continuous time scale model by utilizing new methods and equations that affect salinity in surface runoff and subsurface flows the fortran codes of the proposed model were internally linked to the swat model 2 methodology 2 1 salinity modeling fig 1 illustrates the salinity processes of the swat sf model corresponding to all equations first three different concentrations are simulated for the surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow of hrus also the average soil salinities of hrus are simulated then input salt masses to river reaches are simulated then salt exports and salt concentrations of river reaches are simulated besides the dissolution and precipitation of salts are considered for river reaches the following equations define the salinity processes if the amount of the solid soluble salt in the soil is not enough to increase the dissolved salt concentration of the soil water to the maximum salt concentration the solid soluble salt completely dissolves in the soil water yang et al 2018 furthermore when the amount of the solid soluble salt in the soil is enough to increase the dissolved salt concentration of the soil water after evapotranspiration to the maximum salt concentration the salt solubility in the excess salt scenario is considered in the model the amount of salt in the soil profile in an hru can be derived using the following equation quílez et al 2009 1 m max a d root γ p sf 10 5 where m max is the maximum amount of the salt mass in the soil profile of the hru ton a is the area of the hru m2 d root is the average depth of the root zone of the hru mm γ is the average soil bulk density of the soil profile of the hru gr cm3 and p sf is the percentage of saline formations in the soil profile of the hru following equations are derived to calculate the salt pickup due to the salt dissolution in the root zone 2 tds max ω m m max 10 6 q sw 3 tds es ω m tds sf typ p sf 10 2 here tds max is the maximum theoretical tds of the soil water due to the salt dissolution for the hru mg l q sw is the soil water volume after the evapotranspiration for the hru m3 tds es is the tds of the soil water due to the salt dissolution in the excess salt scenario for the hru mg l ω m is the monthly mixing coefficient for the soil profile of the hru and tds sf typ is the tds of the soil water including seven types for the saline part of the hru due to the salt dissolution in the excess salt scenario mg l since solute leaching evapotranspiration and environmental conditions vary by months in a year for the root zone monthly mixing coefficients are considered akça et al 2020 these coefficients correspond to the mixing coefficient for the alluvial store and hillslope store of the 2csalt model stenson et al 2011 eq 3 calculates a weighted average of the salt concentration due to the salt dissolution based on the saline part with the concentration ω m tds sf typ and the non saline part with the concentration 0 mg l of the hru as shown in table 1 values of the tds sf typ in eq 3 are different for various types of soil water however any desired type of root zone water can be added to table 1 the type of soil water is determined based on the ionic composition of water i e the third column of table 1 two computable tds values which can be obtained from eqs 2 and 3 are compared to calculate the tds of the soil water of the soil profile due to the salt dissolution for the hru as follows 4 tds sw minimum tds max tds es here tds sw is the tds of the soil water of the soil profile due to the salt dissolution for the hru mg l the following equation can be derived for the total salt concentration of the soil water of the soil profile for the hru 5 c sw tds sw tds swn here c sw is the total salt concentration of the soil water of the soil profile for the hru mg l and tds swn is the tds of the soil water due to other salt sources such as the rainfall except the dissolution of the salt from the saline formation for the hru mg l the salt concentration of the lateral flow c lat is assumed equal to the total salt concentration of the soil water of the soil profile c sw for the hru eqs 1 5 indirectly address net effects of all occurring processes on variations of the salt concentration of the soil profile it is possible for skilled experts to introduce time series values of p sf ω m tds sf typ and tds swn to the model as input data the following equation can be derived for the salt concentration of the output surface runoff from the hru to the river reach 6 c surf α tds sw tds srn here c surf is the salt concentration of the surface runoff for the hru mg l α is the linear wash off coefficient stenson et al 2011 or salt percolation coefficient neitsch et al 2011 of the surface runoff for the hru and tds srn is the tds of the surface runoff due to other salt sources such as the rainfall except the dissolution of the salt from the saline formation for the hru mg l eq 6 addresses net effects of all occurring processes on variations of the salt concentration of the surface runoff it is possible for skilled experts to introduce time series values of α and tds srn to the model as input data the average soil salt content of the soil profile can be derived for the hru using the following equation jiang et al 2016 7 ssc c sw θ 10 3 γ here ssc is the average soil salt content of the soil profile for the hru gr kg and θ is the average soil water content of the soil profile for the hru cm3 cm3 the average electrical conductivity of the soil saturation extract of the soil profile can be derived for the hru from the soil water solute concentration of the soil profile using the following equation kroes et al 2008 8 ec sat 1 492 c sw θ 10 3 θ sat here ec sat is the average electrical conductivity of the saturation extract of the soil profile for the hru ds m and θ sat is the average soil saturated water content of the soil profile for the hru cm3 cm3 numerous studies have verified that there is a clear relationship between the groundwater table and salt concentration e g rao 2008 chowdhury et al 2008 kumar et al 2009 colombani et al 2016 kim et al 2017 akter et al 2021 once the groundwater table ascends above a certain depth the solute concentration is diluted and remained at these levels until the water table depth descends below this depth kim et al 2017 therefore the following equation can be derived for the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer for the hru 9 if aq sh aq th then c sh λ c sh max here aq sh is the depth of water in the shallow aquifer for the hru mm aq th is the threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer that is required to dilute the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer for the hru mm c sh is the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer for the hru mg l c sh max is the maximum salt concentration of the shallow aquifer for the hru mg l and λ is the mixing coefficient for the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer for the hru furthermore λ corresponds with the mixing coefficient for the alluvial store and hillslope store of the 2csalt model stenson et al 2011 also aq th corresponds with the discharge threshold for hillslope discharge of the 2csalt model stenson et al 2011 eq 9 indirectly addresses net effects of all occurring processes on variations of the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer based on the depth of water in the shallow aquifer however several threshold depths and mixing coefficients can be considered for the shallow aquifer the mass of the output salt from the hrus to the river reach in each subbasin is the total mass of the output salt from the hrus via the surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow in the subbasins the point source including spring and sewage discharges discharges the salt into the river reach the following equation can be derived for the salt concentration of the point source 10 c ps ψ c sub sh 1 ψ c psn here c ps is the total salt concentration of the point source for the subbasin mg l ψ is the adjustment factor for the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer and point source loads such as sewage for the subbasin c sub sh is the weighted average salt concentration of the shallow aquifer for the subbasin based on fractions of subbasin area in hrus mg l and c psn is the average salt concentration of point source loads which the salt concentration is not equal to the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer in the subbasin mg l the salt concentration of the point source may not a unique value for each subbasin and each time step the mass of each component can be derived according to the bellow generic equation 11 m c q 10 6 here m is the mass of the salt export ton c is the salt concentration of the flow mg l and q is the quantity of the flow m3 the salt concentration of the river reach c ir was compared to a threshold salt concentration c th if c ir is greater than c th then the precipitation of the salt will occur conversely if c ir is smaller than c th then the dissolution of the salt only will occur in river reaches that cross over saline formations then the mass of the available suspended salt in the river reach can be derived according to the salt balance using the following equations 12 m fr m ir ε c ir c th q r 10 6 if c ir c th 13 m fr m ir δ ε c ir c th q r 10 8 if c ir c th here m fr is the final output salt from the river reach ton m ir is the initial output salt from the river reach ton ε is the linear salt precipitation dissolution coefficient for the river reach c ir is the initial salt concentration of the river reach mg l c th is the threshold salt concentration of the river reach mg l q r is the total volume of water in the river reach m3 and δ is the coefficient for the dissolution in river reaches with a saline bed the river reach s final salt concentration can be calculated using the available mass of the suspended salt in the river reach and eq 11 it is possible for skilled experts to introduce time series values of ε δ and c th to the model as input data 2 2 model calibration the calibration of the model was done by applying the sufi 2 program abbaspour 2015 with the aid of the modified iswat interface to consider parameters of quantity and quality models yang 2006 in addition global sensitivity analysis was used to find the model s most sensitive parameters based on the regression method abbaspour 2015 in this study the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 was used as the objective function and the model parameters were calibrated to maximize the value of nse during the calibration period also degrees of uncertainty in model predictions were determined furthermore the coefficient of determination r2 percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr moriasi et al 2007 r factor and p factor were utilized to evaluate the model performances 2 3 description of the study area the dehram river basin has an area of about 4140 km2 and is located in southern iran between 28 n to 30 n and 52 e to 53 e fig 2 shows the location topography monitoring station land use and saline formation map of the dehram river basin the average elevation of the basin is about 1400 m besides the average annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are approximately 300 and 1620 mm year respectively the average discharge of the river is about 10 m3 s at the dehram station abgeer 2011 there are natural and anthropogenic sources of salts in the dehram river basin saline formations are predominantly the oligocene miocene asmari formation a major hydrocarbon reservoir in southwestern iran limestone formation and salt diapir the average tds of the river is about 6000 mg l at the dehram station abgeer 2011 2 4 model setup land use map was acquired from the usgs global land use land cover characterization glcc database usgs 2018 the shrubland covers 80 of the watershed area soil map data on two layers 0 30 and 30 100 cm depth was obtained from the global map of the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 1995 the digital elevation model dem at a 90 m resolution was acquired from the srtm of nasa jarvis et al 2008 climate data were obtained from the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr ncep 2018 four subbasins and forty six hrus were considered for the dehram river basin discharge and tds data for the outlet river gauge of the dehram river basin were provided by the local water authorities the abgeer consulting engineers company acec provided data on water use point sources e g the spring discharge data and sewage discharge data and other maps and data abgeer 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 selected parameters for the model calibration seventeen parameters four parameters for the discharge and thirteen parameters for the salinity were used in the model calibration table 2 presents an overview of parameters used for the calibration of the model with their final ranges also the values of other parameters were determined through prior model calibrations based on field data furthermore salinity parameters were constrained based on the observed soil salinity data groundwater salinity data sewage salinity data and spring salinity data however some parameters were further differentiated for subbasins moreover upper limits for the soil salinity of hrus located in subbasins 1 2 3 and 4 were considered 0 3 1 4 2 9 and 2 4 ds m respectively also upper limits for the groundwater salinity of subbasins 1 2 3 and 4 were considered 500 500 1000 and 12 000 mg l respectively this is because of the existence of significant saline formations in the subbasin 4 besides the tds of municipal agricultural and industrial sewages of subbasins 2 3 4 are very higher than subbasin 1 moreover some extremely salty springs with tds up to about 350 000 mg l exist in the subbasin 4 thus upper limits considered for c psn of subbasins 1 2 3 and 4 were 2000 20 000 20 000 and 100 000 mg l respectively the amount of the available water capacity awc was increased during the calibration process table 2 this corresponds to water holding and evapotranspiration were increased in addition the calibrated value of the adjustment factor for the salt concentration of the shallow aquifer and other point source loads ψ for subbasin 4 indicated that the return flow from the shallow aquifer and other point source loads contributed almost the same amounts of the discharge into the river reach table 2 the calibrated value of the linear wash off coefficient of the surface runoff α indicated that the salt concentration of the surface runoff is not significantly lower than the salt concentration of the soil water of the soil profile table 2 moreover the monthly mixing coefficients of the soil profile ω had different calibrated values table 2 therefore the model addressed temporal variations of the salt concentration of the soil profile furthermore subbasins 2 and 3 had the same calibrated values of the average salt concentration of point source loads c psn in contrast the subbasin 4 had higher calibrated value of the average salt concentration of point source loads than other subbasins table 2 also subbasin 4 had higher calibrated value of the maximum salt concentration of the shallow aquifer c sh max than other subbasins table 2 3 2 model performance evaluation calibration and validation performance results of the dehram gauge for the prediction of discharges and salt exports are seen in table 3 according to the recommendations of moriasi et al 2007 r2 nse and rsr values of quantity and quality predictions are good or satisfactory for calibration and validation periods besides pbias values are very good furthermore while r factor values of model predictions are smaller than 1 5 p factor values of model predictions are above 0 7 therefore all processes leading to observations were somehow captured correctly a comparison between simulated and observed discharges and salt exports at the dehram station can be seen in fig 3 monthly simulated discharge and salt export results show that patterns in the simulated and observed discharges and salt exports were similar fig 3 locations of peak flows and peak salt exports were also well predicted base flows were better predicted than peak flows both overestimation and underestimation of peak salt export predictions were observed mainly due to corresponding discharge volumes fig 3 maximum salt concentrations of the river and minimum discharges of the river occurred at the same time steps however the accuracy of salt export and salt concentration predictions of the model correlates closely with the precision of discharge predictions the complex nature of salinity processes makes it difficult to predict accurately temporal changes of water and soil salinity states during the simulation period however mixing coefficients and adjustment factors can be directly updated for desired groups of time steps thus expert scientific judgments can directly modify errors related to the model predictions using mixing coefficients and adjustment factors 3 3 predictions of salt concentrations salt concentrations of waters vary throughout a basin over time fig 4 illustrates the box plot charts of salt concentrations for the surface runoff root zone and river reach as shown in fig 4 the 0th 25th 50th 75th and 100th percentiles of salt concentration predictions are different for each hru and river reach hrus 1 15 16 41 and 42 46 are generally located in the north middle and south of the dehram river basin respectively the range of the change in salt concentration of the southern parts of the dehram river basin is wider than in other parts of the basin fig 4 conversely the range of the change of the salt concentration of the northern parts of the dehram river basin is narrower than other parts of the basin fig 4 the swat sf model could consider monthly variations of salt concentrations for hrus and river reaches average salt concentrations of waters are not uniformly distributed throughout the basin spatial distributions of average tds values for surface runoff root zone aquifer and river are illustrated in fig 5a d the northern parts of the dehram river basin generally have a lower average salt concentration than other parts the comparison of fig 5 with fig 2 indicates that saline formations profoundly affect the salt concentration of water in the dehram river basin although one class of the water type initially was considered for the soil profile of all hrus fig 5f shows that water types of the soil profile of some hrus belonged to other classes after the model calibration therefore the swat sf model is significant in considering salinity sources and processes in the investigation of salinity problems as shown in fig 5e f the results of the swat sf model could show the spatial distribution of average salt content and ecsat of the soil at the watershed scale 3 4 average monthly flow and salt export the relation between the streamflow and salt export can be studied for a river fig 6 exhibits average monthly flows and salt exports at the dehram gauge there is a direct correlation between the amounts of discharge and salt export fig 6 with highest quantities of the flow and salt export occurred from december to april this is also correlated with the occurrence of rain also amounts of the flow and salt export are low from may to november therefore the swat sf model could indicate relations between the flow and salt export for rivers 3 5 salt loadings salts are transported in the soil environment through hydrological processes that transport salts fig 7a c show salt mass transportations from the surface runoff lateral flow and return flow into the dehram river basin streamflow fig 7d f depict the salt mass transportation through the percolation into the aquifer upflux into the soil profile and recharge into the deep aquifer for the dehram river basin fig 7 reveals that the amount of salt transportation has a non uniform distribution in the dehram river basin also salt transportation by the surface runoff and lateral flow is essential in some scattered parts of the dehram river basin fig 7 thus the swat sf model could identify parts of a basin endangered with considerable salt transportations there is a need to identify temporal patterns of salt loadings into rivers fig 8a d illustrate monthly salt loadings by the surface runoff lateral flow groundwater flow and point source into dehram river besides there is a need to determine the importance of each salt transport process compared to others fig 8e depicts the relative importance of salt mass balance components for the dehram river basin fig 8e f reveal that point sources the sum of spring and sewage discharges loaded considerable amounts of salts into the river than other components for the dehram river basin lateral flow is a critical component of the hydrological processes which can load considerable amounts of the salt into the reach in arid and semi arid areas jiang et al 2019 the river s salt balance indicates that about 17 of input salt loadings are deposited in the river fig 8e also the percent error of salt mass balance of the dehram river basin is about 1 2 moreover specifying the salt balance for each subbasin is required to assess the seriousness of the salinity problem bugan et al 2015 the salt balance of subbasins can be defined by salt export import e i ratios biggs et al 2013 fig 8g shows the salt export import e i ratio for all dehram river basin subbasins results of the swat sf model could model the temporal patterns and magnitudes of salt loadings at the watershed scale 4 practical implications available salinity models like bc2c and 2csalt are limited in simulating all salinity processes at a watershed scale the bc2c model gilfedder et al 2009 is a simple salinity model that does not simulate daily monthly and annual salinity processes the 2csalt model stenson et al 2011 was developed to predict the salt movement from upland watersheds in murray darling basin therefore the usability of the 2csalt model is very restricted also the 2csalt model only simulates the salt export at the outlet of the watershed the swat sf model uses water quantity components of the swat model therefore the model can appropriately consider major salt transport processes at the watershed scale the swat sf model uses data which is generally available or can easily be gathered in large scale studies the usability of the model is not restricted to a specific watershed thus the swat sf model provides a general framework that can be used for the simulation of a broader range of water and soil salinity processes than bc2c and 2csalt models compared to the swat salt model of bailey et al 2019 the swat sf model can consider salinity processes related to the existence of saline formations also the swat sf model can address the precipitation dissolution of the salt in the river as the swat sf model can address the net effects of all processes e g precipitation dissolution processes on the solute concentration of 1 soil 2 aquifer and 3 river environments the solute concentration simulation of the model is not limited to whole tds that consists of many individual pollutions however addressing the net effects of fewer processes on an individual pollution concentration needs a separate model simulation and calibration in addition considering a very short warm up period such as smaller than one year is enough for the swat sf model even though chemical interactions are not directly considered in the swat sf model the spatial distribution of chemical interactions can be accounted for indirectly by the classification of water types of the soil profile furthermore local scale processes can be addressed accurately using local scale models then results of local scale models can be introduced directly to the swat sf model as input data the proposed framework can work in daily and monthly time steps also although vertical salt transportations do not directly contribute to the salinity modeling of the soil environment amounts of these vertical salt transportations can be estimated using the results of the swat sf model the main limitations of the swat sf model pertain to the limitations of the swat model for example the weakness of the groundwater flow modeling and the secondary consideration of vertical salt transportations in the soil environment 5 conclusion in this research a flexible salinity model swat sf was proposed for watershed scale water and soil salinity modeling the new swat sf is capable of addressing net effects of all processes on the solute concentration within soil aquifer and river environments without the need to simulate transport of each individual salt ion the model which was constrained by the data both at the outlet and within the watershed including the observed river discharge and salinity data soil salinity data groundwater salinity data sewage salinity data and spring salinity data was successfully applied and evaluated to the dehram river basin of iran the performance of the swat sf model was tested for an extended period sixteen years of the simulation results show that the proposed model could simulate monthly variations of salt concentrations for the surface runoff soil profile and aquifer of hrus and river reaches spatial distributions of average salt content and the ecsat of the soil profile at a watershed scale relationship between the streamflow and salt export parts of a basin that endanger with considerable salt transportations the temporal patterns and magnitude of salt loadings at the watershed scale the proposed model which can profit from the advantages of the expert opinion can simultaneously model natural and unnatural pollution sources and processes therefore it is recommended that the proposed model be utilized for the water and soil quality modeling of small to large watersheds in salinity studies especially in the assessment of soil and water qualities in water management projects code availability the codes of the swat sf module is available on github https github com m1s1m swat sf declaration of competing interest the authors

1352,reactive transport models have proven abilities to simulate the quantity and quality of drainage from mine waste rock tracer experiments indicate the presence of fast and slow flow regimes in many heterogeneous waste rock piles although multidomain models have been developed specifically for systems with such distinctive hydrodynamics there have been limited applications of multidomain reactive transport models to simulate composite drainage chemistries from waste rock piles to date this work evaluated the ability of dual domain multicomponent reactive transport models ddmrtms to reproduce breakthrough curves of conservative chloride and reactive molybdenum solutes observed at a well characterized experimental waste rock pile at the antamina mine peru we found that the ddmrtm simulations quantitatively matched eight year long records of conservative transport through the waste rock pile when parameterized mainly with field measured properties obtained from the site and limited calibration the ddmrtm model also provided a reasonable match to field observations of the reactive solute the limited calibrated parameters are physically realistic corroborating the ability of these multidomain models to reproduce the complex reactive transport processes governing polluted rock drainage from large scale waste rock piles keywords reactive transport modeling acid mine drainage acid rock drainage molybdenum dual porosity 1 introduction waste rock piles wrps are large heterogeneous structures that contain mine waste rock and below grade ore the weathering of waste rock can generate poor quality drainage i e alkaline circum neutral or acidic seepage with elevated metal loid concentrations for many decades after construction or mine closure predictions of the quantity and quality of this mine drainage including flow rates and geochemical compositions are needed to make reliable mine waste management decisions and to limit environmental impact blowes et al 2003 sracek et al 2004 wolkersdorfer et al 2020 multicomponent reactive transport models mrtms are established tools for simulating the release of polluted mine drainage from waste rock gerke et al 1998 molson et al 2012 fala et al 2013 lahmira et al 2016 muniruzzaman and pedretti 2020 and to assist industry and government stakeholders with mine waste and wastewater management during the entire mining lifecycle the development and parameterization of mrtms for wrps is complicated by the physical and mineralogical heterogeneities within these piles gerke et al 1998 nichol et al 2005 demers et

hundreds of meters tall waste rock piles is limited resulting in uncertain model predictions pedretti et al 2017 2020 furthermore even if all model parameters could be hypothetically characterized at the pore scale of a full scale wrp which contains thousands of m3 of waste rock the resulting fully parameterized mrtm would be computationally prohibitive to resolve as multiple nonlinearly coupled

efficient surrogates of more complex models neuman and tartakovsky 2009 asher et al 2015 fiori et al 2015 the dual domain model ddm also sometimes referred to as a dual porosity or mobile immobile model is an example of a widely adopted upscaled model it has been developed for modeling flow and transport in heterogeneous porous media with low and high permeability zones simunek et al 2003 zheng et al 2011 the ddm approach fig 1 represents the high and low permeability system as a continuum comprised of two domains or porosities at every point the mobile porosity θ m is characterized by a much shorter solute residence time than in the immobile porosity θ im advection occurs solely in the mobile domain water and solutes are exchanged between the mobile and immobile porosities by means of non equilibrium i e kinetic mass transfer the ddm representation is well suited to describe solute transport in systems with bimodal distributions of water residence times e g porous media with well defined contrasts in hydraulic conductivity or fractured aquifers hadermann and heer 1996 pedretti et al 2014 molinari et al 2015 dual domain models have proven useful to describe the behavior of flow and conservative tracers in wrps blackmore et al 2018 however they have rarely been applied to reactive transport simulations of leachate composition from wrps in particular for multicomponent simulations despite the heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivities intrinsic to wrps one possible reason for this paucity is that the parameters of upscaled models such as the mass transfer rates of dual domain models are difficult to constrain experimentally this is true for reactive solutes and full scale heterogeneous wrps but even for non reactive solutes in well controlled theoretical studies and laboratory experiments donado et al 2009 willmann et al 2010 molinari et al 2015 in this work we evaluated the ability of a dual domain multicomponent reactive transport model ddmrtm to

and conservative solutes provide a dataset well suited to assess the capabilities of our ddmrtm to simulate nrd generation and release the adopted methodology can be summarized as follows first we performed a forward modeling analysis to reproduce flow and conservative transport in the studied pile the adopted non calibrated parameters were obtained from previous dual domain modeling analyses blackmore et al 2018 targeting conservative transport in other experimental piles with similar geometrical textural and compositional characteristics this allowed us to evaluate if empirical parameters obtained for similar piles are useful to make predictions on others then the conservative transport model was upgraded to a reactive transport model making this a novel contribution compared to the previous upscaling modeling analysis for waste rock which focused exclusively on conservative transport we constrained the incorporated geochemical reactions a priori through a selection of kinetic parameters from the literature and existing field data from the studied site only one parameter the kinetic rate of molybdenite oxidation was treated as fitting parameter a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the controls of the key parameters on the model outputs 2 materials and methods 2 1 site overview and experimental data the antamina mine in peru hosts one of the world s largest experimental sites purposed for studying long term mine waste weathering and drainage processes within the multi scale research program a signature experiment included a group of five fully instrumented mesoscale experimental wrps 36 m 36 m 10 m in size 20 000 tons of material each that contained different types of waste rock details on the analysis of rates and chemical composition of drainage from these experimental piles can be found in vriens et al 2019a each pile was constructed in three major depositional events i e end dumped tipping phases on top of a protective layer infiltrating water originating from precipitation was captured by lysimeters fig 2 each pile was underlain by three smaller sub lysimeters of size 4 m 4 m a b c under the individual tipping phases as well as by a large basal lysimeter spanning the bottom of the entire pile 36 m 36 m lysimeter d in all piles sub lysimeters b were installed below the waste rock positioned closest to the bedrock and thus least exposed to fluctuations at the atmospheric boundaries in turn sub lysimeters c captured drainage from waste rock below the frontal batter that was more sensitive to fluctuations in atmospheric conditions fig 2 of the antamina experimental wrps pile 2 contained the most reactive and finest grained waste rock with a median particle diameter d 50 between 9 mm and 30 mm and the 10th weight percentile of particles d 10 varying in size from 0 1 mm to 0 15 mm lorca et al 2016 vriens et al 2019a very coarse material with diameter 100 mm expected to contribute minimally due to lower exposure of chemically reactive mineral surfaces accounted for less than 10 of the total grain size distribution in this pile the waste rock in the various tipping phases of pile 2 contained mainly class a rocks the class of most reactive material produced at the site the mineralogical composition was on average up to 2 7 wt pyrite up to 2 4 wt chalcopyrite and up to 0 1 wt molybdenite mos2 rock mo abundance varied roughly between 200 and 400 ppm carbonates comprised up to 1 of the bulk mineralogical assemblage in the pile vriens et al 2019a the pile 2 drainage chemistry record spans from 2007 to 2016 revealing that the sub lysimeter b displayed characteristic features of nrd with circumneutral ph until the end of the experiment part of the long term geochemical drainage record for sub lysimeter b in pile 2 hereafter referred to as sl2b is given in fig 3 the record reveals relatively stable circumneutral drainage ph and stable ca and so4 concentrations with only minor seasonal oscillations this behavior is explained by the fact that waste rock sampled along the flow paths arriving at sl2b contained considerable carbonate providing a neutralizing potential ratio npr 2 lorca et al 2016 chloride cl concentrations a residue from blasting booster agents drop consistently from a maximum of 100 mgl 1 to a minimum of 0 1 mgl 1 through time with minor oscillations molybdenum mo concentrations rise to a maximum of 30 mgl 1 after 800 1100 days then steadily decline to 10 mgl 1 at the end of the experimental period 2 2 geochemical tracer data the analysis of an artificial tracer test peterson 2014 suggested that the flow domain in pile 2 is mostly matrix flow with mean seepage velocities estimated as 2 0 2 4 cm day although the flow rates vary in response to rainfall events the portion of the fluid flow following rapid or preferential flow paths open void or film flow was a minor component 7 of the overall flow regime in our upscaled model one mobile flow zone was considered to account for contributions from matrix flow and preferential flow this mobile zone was complemented with an immobile zone in which flow rates are negligible fig 1 dissolved cl in the wrp drainage can be considered as an internal conservative tracer blackmore et al 2018 rather than an externally applied conservative tracer chloride was released by rapid dissolution of cl salts from blasting residues that were imported with the waste rock during pile construction and assumed evenly distributed as such dissolved cl reflects the physical transport dynamics in the wrp matrix flow domain as well as mass transfer between the immobile and mobile domain chloride migrated predominantly downward throughout the entire pile during weathering and drainage blackmore et al 2018 chloride transport began immediately after the pile s construction i e wrp weathering time zero making cl a suitable conservative solute for the assessment of physical transport properties through sl2b previous modeling by blackmore et al 2018 focused on cl transport in two other experimental wrps at antamina pile 4 and pile 5 the analysis of sub lysimeter b of pile 5 hereafter sl5b is of specific interest for the present study because it has similar geometry as pile 2 and contained waste rock with comparable texture grain size and lithological composition as described below blackmore et al 2018 successfully reproduced cl transport in sl5b using a similar ddm formulation among the key results they found that simulating mass transfer between the mobile and immobile zones provided a superior fit of the cl breakthrough curve btc tails compared to a formulation that ignores this mass transfer the physical processes sustaining the long term release of contaminant from the less mobile zones of the wrp could not be properly simulated using a 1 d single domain conservative transport model in contrast to cl mo is a reactive solute that can be used to test our model s capability to simulate multicomponent reactive transport within the wrp and to investigate distinct geochemical processes various geochemical processes relating to the mobilization and attenuation of mo in weathering waste rock i e sulfide oxidation sorption and secondary mineral formation have been observed at antamina and elsewhere and have been previously parameterized making it an excellent reactive solute for a mrtm comparison in antamina waste rock aqueous mo predominantly originates from the oxidation of molybdenite mos2 conlan et al 2012 skierszkan et al 2016 hirsche et al 2017 while the initial abundance of mos2 estimated in the pile was less than 0 1 wt vriens et al 2019a that amount is sufficient to generate mo drainage levels 20 mgl 1 as observed in the drainage btc in fig 3 in fact data from other antamina field experiments similarly reveal that mo is highly mobile under circumneutral ph drainage conlan et al 2012 skierszkan et al 2016 hirsche et al 2017 with aqueous concentrations reaching 50 mgl 1 vriens et al 2019c additional information on mo primary and secondary species speciation and eh ph diagrams can be found in e g smedley and kinniburgh 2017 2 3 modeling framework to model conservative and reactive transport with a consistent ddmrtm framework simulations were conducted using the code min3pdual cheng et al 2004 cheng 2006 a dual domain version of the multicomponent reactive transport code min3p mayer et al 2002 min3pdual adopts the same overall structure of min3p but is extended with terms for secondary immobile porosity the conceptual model of min3pdual is shown in fig 1 and the main governing equations and parameters necessary to run the simulations are presented below using min3pdual we first simulated flow and conservative transport using the ddm parameters determined by blackmore et al 2018 on sl5b for the sub lysimeter analyzed in this work sl2b then we extended blackmore et al 2018 s conservative ddm model incorporating multicomponent reactions to simulate the mo btc as well as the other btcs relevant for the control of nrd in sl2b fig 3 2 3 1 flow and conservative transport variably saturated flow in the mobile zone of min3pdual is defined in the same way as in the first release of min3p there is no flow in the immobile domain which is assumed to be fully saturated with water flow in the mobile domain is described by richards equation where fluid saturation s relative permeability k r and pressure defined in terms of hydraulic head ℎ are related to each other by standard soil hydraulic functions wösten and van genuchten 1988 the general advection dispersion reaction equation for multicomponent reactive transport in the mobile m domain can be written as 1 t θ m a t m j a θ m g t m j g f t j s θ m a d a t m j a θ m g d g t m j g q a t m j a γ j m where the suffixes a g and s represent aqueous gaseous and sorbed phases respectively t is time s θ is the fluid content t j is the total phase component concentration mol l 1 f is the mobile porosity fraction and also the fraction of mobile sorption sites d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient m2 s 1 d α l qθ 1 d αl is the local dispersivity m d is the effective pore water diffusion coefficient which depends on d w the free diffusion coefficient in water m2 s 1 and and q is darcy flux for water only m s 1 the term γ m j encompasses multiple sink source terms for the j th component such that 2 γ m j q m j a min q m j ext q j mt where q m j a min represents the sink source term due to mineral dissolution precipitation and q m j ext represents the sink sources terms caused by mass fluxes at the boundaries and q j mt represents the exchange between mobile m and immobile im domains this last term adds the dual domain capacity to min3pdual compared to the standard single domain version of min3p the term q j mt is defined as 3 q j mt ω t m j a t im j a where ω represents the first order mass transfer rate coefficient s 1 in the immobile domain the solute mass balance equation is 4 t θ im a t im j a 1 f t j s γ j im and 5 γ j im q im j a m q im j ext q j mt noticing that the dual domain advection dispersion model approaches the single domain equivalent as ω 0 it was assumed that the mass transfer term ω is ion independent i e the same for all aqueous components key input parameters used in the transport model are listed in table 1 the vertically oriented 1 d model was set to reproduce the 10 m tall waste rock column above sl2b discretized into 100 control volumes second type neumann boundary conditions were adopted to simulate the net recharge at the top of the pile basal exfiltration from the pile was simulated as a seepage boundary which also acts as a free exit boundary for solutes to simulate non calibrated flow and conservative transport we assumed that pile 2 and pile 5 were exposed to the same precipitation rates and climatic conditions the top of the column of material above pile 5b receiving precipitation was composed of the intrusive material classified as class a waste rock blackmore et al 2018 as pile 2 as such recharge rates flow and conservative transport parameters for our model were considered the same as those for class a of pile 5 table 1 initial dissolved concentrations of cl were estimated from maximum concentrations observed from the btc 100 mgl 1 from blackmore et al 2018 we retained the same mass transfer coefficient of ω 5 21 10 9 s 1 and the total porosity of θ 0 24 split into a mobile porosity θ m 0 06 and an immobile porosity θ im 0 18 2 3 2 dual domain multicomponent reactive transport the geochemical reactions incorporated in the ddmrtm model were selected according to the adagio as simple as possible but as complicated as necessary and include a purposely limited set of reactions to maximize model transparency simplifications and assumptions made for the geochemical model include sulfate and acidity are generated exclusively by oxidation of pyrite and molybdenite calcite is the only mineral buffering the drainage acidity other carbonates and silicates known to occur at antamina were not part of the geochemical reaction network as their buffering capacity was small compared to that provided by calcite vriens et al 2019a gypsum powellite and ferrihydrite are the only secondary mineral phases considered providing the dominant solubility controls for ca moo4 2 so4 2 and fe3 powellite was used as the sole secondary mineral phase containing mo conlan et al 2012 skierszkan et al 2016 hirsche et al 2017 vriens et al 2019c given the low amount of pb in pile 2 wulfenite pbmoo4 another potential mo bearing secondary mineral observed in other antamina waste rock conlan et al 2012 was expected to be negligible as a mo sink above sl2b pore gas concentrations measured in pile 2 using in situ instrumentation lorca et al 2016 vriens et al 2019b showed near atmospheric levels for o2 and elevated co2 and in the model were fixed to o2 g 21 v v and co2 g 0 1 v v the main geochemical parameters used in the ddrmtm analysis are listed in table 2 this table also reports the initial volumetric fractions ψ of the reactive minerals used in the simulations their stoichiometries and equilibrium constants log k as well as the aqueous concentrations of the components characterizing the recharging and initial background pore waters table 2 also includes the composition of the infiltrating precipitation and the initial porewater for the reactive transport modeling min3pdual utilizes a kinetic formulation for reaction rates r x of reversible surface controlled dissolution precipitation reactions mayer et al 2002 a precipitation or dissolution rate r x was defined for each mineral x as 6 r x k x 1 iap x k x where k x is a zero order kinetic rate coefficient and iap x the ion activity product rate coefficients were set to yield quasi equilibrium conditions for calcite gypsum and ferrihydrite a sensitivity analysis not shown suggested that our models were insensitive to rate coefficients used to simulate powellite precipitation which is kinetically limited conlan et al 2012 skierszkan et al 2019a therefore we also imposed quasi equilibrium conditions for powellite mineral specific thermodynamic equilibrium constants k x were based on the minteqa2 database version 4 allison et al 1998 we modeled pyrite and molybdenite oxidation as zero order irreversible processes in the absence of supporting data that could justify more complex modeling formulations for sulfide weathering for instance a shrinking core model this choice was also made to limit the number of model unknowns and potential complexity of the model interpretation the zero order approach is further justified by mass balance analyses of the drainage from pile 2 and its bulk waste rock fe content vriens et al 2019a which suggest that fe depletion in pile 2 was 10 over 10 years after initial tests we fixed the pyrite rate coefficient at k fes2 5 10 10 mol l 1 s 1 which allows the simulation to match the observed release of so4 2 and indirectly ca through the precipitation of gypsum and the drainage ph which does not drop substantially this value for k fes2 is in line with other works on sulfide rich wrps using similar modeling approaches javadi 2019 for molybdenite the value of k mos2 was more difficult to estimate a priori and it remains poorly constrained in the literature johnson et al 2019 thus it was instead treated as a fitting parameter the best fitting parameter was obtained using an iterative procedure that minimizes the root mean square error rmse between observed and simulated values adsorption onto mineral surfaces is an additional process attenuating mo drainage concentrations adsorption can become the dominant attenuating process in oxic and sub oxic waste rock environments skierszkan et al 2019b nonlinear mo sorption in which a greater proportion adsorbs at low concentrations has been previously observed and inferred to explain mo tailing behavior stollenwerk 1995 under oxic conditions at ph 6 molybdate may be strongly adsorbed through inner sphere complexation with fe oxyhydr oxides under circumneutral ph however molybdate sorption involves weaker outer sphere complexation that can lead to enhanced mo mobility in circumneutral to slightly alkaline drainage ph as observed in pile 2b skierszkan et al 2016 vriens et al 2019b adsorption of mo to prototypical hydrous ferrous oxides hfos and select other fe minerals ferrihydrite hematite and goethite has been studied previously goldberg et al 2009 arai 2010 kashiwabara et al 2011 gustafsson and tiberg 2015 adsorption of mo on hfos was implemented in the ddmrtm as a reversible equilibrium controlled term aggregating the variety of experimentally detected fe oxyhydr oxide phases in class a antamina waste rock vriens et al 2019c 2019a under a single idealized hfo phase feoh a non electrostatic surface complexation model scm was adopted the minteqa2 database contains ph dependent sorption surfaces forming from the binding between cations and anions including mo species onto strong feoh s and weak feoh w surface sites dzombak and morel 1990 a list of the considered surface species their formulae and log k values is provided in table 3 the scm depends on the total concentration of the surfaces where mo can adsorb c surf mol l 1 expressed in min3p as 7 c surf 10 9 a v σ s λ where a v is the avogadro constant mol sites σ s is the density of reactive hfo sites sites nm 2 and λ m2l 1 is obtained as 8 λ s s m s where m s is the mass of the sites g l 1 and s s is the specific surface area of the hfo m2 g 1 for σ hfo we considered that hfo contains 50 μmol m 2 of sorption sites dzombak and morel 1990 resulting in σ s 6 sites nm 2 consistent with the previous analyses involving the adopted scm model davis and kent 1990 appelo and postma 2005 demers et al 2013 an estimation of m s based on our mineralogical data vriens et al 2019a shows that the abundance of hfo assumed as aggregate for all secondary fe oxyhydr oxides was 0 1 wt at the beginning of the simulations assuming that this amount is an average value that remains constant with time in reality hfo will grow and undergo phase changes as weathering proceeds this corresponds to a mass of hfos above sl2b of m s 8 8 gl 1 adopting the total porous volume of the projected waste rock and its mean density above sub lysimeter pile 2 vriens et al 2019b this value is of the same order of magnitude but about 4 5 lower for instance than the adopted value by demers et al 2013 for another slightly more fine grained waste rock pile m s 40 gl 1 the estimation of s s was more uncertain because we lacked specific surface area measured on waste rock particles e g bet and because the heterogeneity of waste rock renders it complicated to provide average upscaled values for the broad range of materials in this pile a first cut estimation of s s was obtained by assuming that all waste rock particles exhibited a uniform spherical geometry that density was uniform across the entire particle size distribution and that mineral phases were homogeneously distributed over the different size fractions this way we obtained a range of s s 0 2 3 m2g 1 hfos which is in line with the results from other waste rock studies e g s s 0 8 m2g 1 hfos reported by demers et al 2013 due to the adopted simplifications however the range of s s remains uncertain the fact that waste rock is a coarse material explains at least in part that the surface area is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than typical values reported in the literature for sorption on hfo minerals appelo and postma 2005 also not all waste rock minerals contain reactive iron as such we assumed a base case value of s s 1 m2g 1 hfos an intermediate value representative of the field based estimation and performed a sensitivity around this value 3 results analysis and discussion 3 1 analysis of the observed btcs the shape of the double log plots of cl and mo drainage concentrations over time fig 4 red symbols are diagnostic to evaluate whether upscaled transport simulation using ddm formulations is a reasonable choice for the selected case study the observed btcs of cl and mo show that conservative cl behaves distinctly from reactive mo in pile 2b for cl the btc concentrations are initially high and gradually trend towards lower concentrations through time illustrative of the conservative nature of cl it can further be observed that the double log btc for cl displays patterns indicative of mobile immobile transport namely the shape of the double log btc of cl is strongly asymmetric and its tailing i e the post peak part of the btc can be described by a power law function with slope 9 c t β where c is concentration t is time and β is the power law exponent for cl we find that the tails scale close to β 3 2 the characteristic slope of btc tailings determined analytically for non equilibrium matrix diffusion models in dual porosity systems hadermann and heer 1996 which are conceptually and mathematically similar to a ddm model although much longer records would be needed to properly identify a power law scaling of the btcs compared to other heavily tailed statistical models pedretti and bianchi 2018 the data suggests that a dual domain transport formulation is a reasonable choice to describe the behavior of conservative tracers like cl in the studied wrp compared to cl the btc of mo fig 4 blue symbols shows a relatively elongated shape with an initially delayed mobilization as well as a gradual reduction of leachate concentrations over the course of several years considering that no geochemical processes inhibited the mobility of cl in these simulations we contrast cl as a reference conservative tracer and mo as a reactive tracer the reactive nature of mo can be phenomenologically appreciated from its btc when plotted in double log normalization fig 4 blue symbols firstly the rising part of the btc of mo is delayed compared to that of cl indicating that mo release is slower than conservative transport this is consistent with the kinetic release of mo by the weathering of mo bearing sulfides contrasting the quicker release of cl that is associated to a first flush of soluble cl bearing salts in addition the btc tail for mo scales close to β 1 i e a smaller exponent than that for cl suggesting a higher persistence of mo in the waste rock matrix compared to cl and consistent with an internal release limitation and or attenuation process beyond purely conservative mass transport 3 2 flow and conservative transport modeling a comparison between forward simulated cumulative flow and cl exfiltrating at pile 2b and the observed values is shown in fig 5 we contrasted the ddm simulations against single domain simulations i e the results from the use of a classic one dimensional single domain advection dispersion equation ade obtained by setting ω 0 the test was performed by setting the concentration of cl in the water resident in the pile at the start of the simulation to 100 mgl 1 considering that the ddm model parameters were not calibrated but obtained directly from class a materials for pile 5b both flow top plot and conservative cl records middle and bottom plots were reasonably well reproduced both the single domain and ddm model simulations quantitatively agree with measured values in cumulative drainage from pile 2b flow is the same in both ade based and ddm based models in arithmetic scales both the initial maximum concentrations and the decrease in concentration c 0 are correctly captured by both models however the use of linear scales obscures the performance of the transport models at lower concentrations i e the btc tails which are key for identifying mass transfer between the zones of different mobility more importantly the btc tails are key features to obtain wrp model parameters that can describe the long term behavior of solute transport it is important that models used to assist decision makers for prediction of post closure contaminant transport from wrps properly reproduce the btc tails and the evolution of the contaminants at timescales far beyond those characterizing the initial weathering process when plotted on a logarithmic concentration scale bottom plot of fig 5 the differences between the ade and the ddm outputs become more noticeable on the tails the dual domain model sustains cl concentrations in line with those measured in the field whereas the single porosity model yields a too rapid decrease in cl concentrations the fact that the ddm provides a superior fit of the experimental btcs compared to the single domain ade model corroborates the findings by blackmore et al blackmore et al 2018 who obtained a superior fit for the btc of cl from pile 5b with the ddm model compared to a single domain model better agreement with dual porosity over single porosity formulations was also obtained in several other analyses from systems embedding different flow geometries sánchez vila and carrera 2004 molinari et al 2015 sharma et al 2015 owing to the fact that the mass transfer between mobile and immobile domains effectively accounts for the small scale heterogeneities that cannot be reproduced using a 1 d ade model since the results of the conservative transport modeling indicate that a single domain ade formulation does not well describe solute transport in sl2b the focus of the remaining work is to reproduce drainage dynamics of the reactive solutes using dual domain formulations only finally the conservative transport simulations indicate that the ddm model for pile 2b was able to reproduce field observations using parameters calibrated towards a specific portion of pile 5b which had a similar lithology as pile 2b i e intrusive rocks therefore ddm transport parameters determined for materials with similar grain sizes appear to be transferable to other systems although further confirmation across grain size ranges is required 3 3 dual domain multicomponent reactive transport modeling the result of the ddmrtm simulation embedding the calibrated best fitting k mos2 4 10 13 mol l 1 s 1 resulting in rmse 0 14 are shown in fig 6a and fig 6b which compare the mo breakthrough curves and the cumulative mo mass against measured data fig 6c provides the ca btc the drainage ph and the so4 btc from pile 2b respectively the ddmrtm model captures the recorded drainage ph and so4 concentrations accurately while only marginally overpredicting ca concentrations in sl2b drainage molybdenum btcs fig 6a and the corresponding cumulative values fig 6b are reproduced equally well capturing the buildup segment of the observed btc the model is able to capture the early time arrival of the mo btc at the sub lysimeter the maximum observed mo concentrations and the btc tails i e 1500 days overall the model appears to properly reproduce mo concentrations in agreement with the cl btc tail that the dual domain model could quantitatively reproduce fig 5 the model also satisfactorily captures the cumulative amount of mo released from sl2b the relatively stable ca and so4 drainage concentrations are strongly tied to the solubility limit of secondary gypsum as has been previously experimentally observed vriens et al 2019a we thus conclude that a ddmrtm is appropriate to reproduce the observed drainage record it is particularly relevant that the model works well using just one fitting parameter i e the rate constant for molybdenite oxidation k mos2 a sensitivity analysis performed to evaluate the uncertainty around this parameter suggested fig 7 that a small variation of k mos2 causes large variations in the modeled mo btc resulting in substantial discrepancies in the cumulative mo from the reference best fit simulation this is true for both an increase green lines with square markers and a decrease light blue lines with crosses in k mos2 indicating that the parameter is identifiable well constrained by the mo concentration data and is essential to accurately reproduce the pile s drainage a sensitivity analysis was also conducted around another uncertain parameter the specific surface area of the hfo s s while keeping the k mos2 4x10 13 mol l 1 s 1 the results fig 8 suggested that the model was relatively insensitive to a decrease in s s as comparable results are obtained in simulations with a multiplicative factor up to 0 01 i e to s s 0 01 m2g 1 instead simulations with larger s s reveal the opposite behavior multiplicative factors 10 s s 10 m2g 1 and 100 s s 100 m2g 1 produce strongly decreasing and ultimately negligible mo concentrations respectively these results suggest that the presence of additional sorption sites would strongly attenuate the mobility of mo but also that hfo and other minerals may currently be controlling the net adsorption of mo because there appear to be limited available sorption sites mo exhibits relatively elevated mobility in the studied pile no significant variations in ca so4 and ph were observed in the sensitivity analyses which instead remained at levels similar to those of the best fit model data not shown finally simulations also revealed that competition for sorption sites by other anions did not influence the long term mo record results not reported the drainage from sl2b exhibited concentrations of potentially competing oxyanions phosphate arsenate tungstate or chromate smedley and kinniburgh 2017 that were either below detection limits or at least an order of magnitude lower than mo concentrations vriens et al 2019b the inferred lack of competition for sorption sites is consistent with previous studies that found that tungstate and phosphate appear to be the strongest competitors of mo for the adsorption sites of goethite whereas only minor competitive effects were observed in the case of silicate and sulfate xu et al 2009 4 conclusion upscaled or effective models are appealing for modeling reactive transport in complex systems due to a reduced computational burden compared to multidimensional reactive transport models however a drawback of effective models is that linking physical and mathematical ddm parameters is highly difficult consequently in many practical applications upscaled model parameters are treated as empirical parameters that are fitted to site specific observations such as solute btcs from tracer tests this fitting casts legitimate doubts regarding the predictive ability of upscaling models and their calibrated parameters this work presented reactive transport simulations with single and dual domain multicomponent reactive transport models ddmrtms and corresponding parameter sensitivity analyses for the prediction of conservative and reactive solute transport through a mine waste rock pile our work is one of the first ever presented application of a ddmrtm model for upscaling purposes on waste rock drainage we found that the dual domain formulation outperformed its single domain counterpart in the reproduction of conservative cl solute trends in line with previous studies blackmore et al 2018 experimentally pre calibrated parameters of the dual domain model e g van genuchten parameters particle sizes mineral fractions kinetic mass transfer coefficients appeared extrapolatable across similar scale experiments with comparable material types in this sense our results prove that linking physical and mathematical dual domain parameters is not impossible the ddmrtm model successfully simulated long term mo drainage chemistry dynamics the ultimate best fit model and parameters were consistent with the current mechanistic understanding of mo waste rock geochemistry the great majority of model parameters were established by experimental evidence or literature values a critical fitting parameter remains the kinetic rate coefficient for molybdenite oxidation k mos2 which the model is very sensitive to an increase in k mos2 could be balanced out by increasing the surface complexation the sink term we thus conclude that the ddmrtm model works well for reproducing btcs of drainage from reactive waste rock piles as such we recommend the ddmrtm approach going forward for upscaling waste rock drainage a proper characterization of source and sink terms in waste rock will provide better constraints for ddmrtm predictions research data all data

1352,reactive transport models have proven abilities to simulate the quantity and quality of drainage from mine waste rock tracer experiments indicate the presence of fast and slow flow regimes in many heterogeneous waste rock piles although multidomain models have been developed specifically for systems with such distinctive hydrodynamics there have been limited applications of multidomain reactive transport models to simulate composite drainage chemistries from waste rock piles to date this work evaluated the ability of dual domain multicomponent reactive transport models ddmrtms to reproduce breakthrough curves of conservative chloride and reactive molybdenum solutes observed at a well characterized experimental waste rock pile at the antamina mine peru we found that the ddmrtm simulations quantitatively matched eight year long records of conservative transport through the waste rock pile when parameterized mainly with field measured properties obtained from the site and limited calibration the ddmrtm model also provided a reasonable match to field observations of the reactive solute the limited calibrated parameters are physically realistic corroborating the ability of these multidomain models to reproduce the complex reactive transport processes governing polluted rock drainage from large scale waste rock piles keywords reactive transport modeling acid mine drainage acid rock drainage molybdenum dual porosity 1 introduction waste rock piles wrps are large heterogeneous structures that contain mine waste rock and below grade ore the weathering of waste rock can generate poor quality drainage i e alkaline circum neutral or acidic seepage with elevated metal loid concentrations for many decades after construction or mine closure predictions of the quantity and quality of this mine drainage including flow rates and geochemical compositions are needed to make reliable mine waste management decisions and to limit environmental impact blowes et al

mining lifecycle the development and parameterization of mrtms for wrps is complicated by the physical and mineralogical heterogeneities within these piles gerke et al 1998 nichol et al 2005 demers et

the pore scale of a full scale wrp which contains thousands of m3 of waste rock the resulting fully parameterized mrtm would be computationally prohibitive to resolve as multiple nonlinearly coupled processes are implicated in the prediction of wrps drainage quantity and quality amos et al 2015 upscaled models have been increasingly used in hydrogeological applications as computationally efficient surrogates of more complex models neuman and tartakovsky 2009 asher et al 2015 fiori et al 2015 the dual domain model ddm also sometimes referred to as a dual porosity or mobile immobile model is an example of a widely adopted upscaled model it has been developed for modeling flow and transport in heterogeneous porous media with low and high permeability zones simunek et al 2003 zheng et al 2011 the ddm approach fig 1 represents the high and low permeability system as a continuum comprised of two domains or porosities at every point the mobile porosity θ m is characterized by a much shorter solute residence time than in the immobile porosity θ im advection occurs solely in the mobile domain water and solutes are exchanged between the mobile and immobile porosities by means of non equilibrium i e kinetic mass transfer the ddm representation is well suited to describe solute transport in systems with bimodal distributions of water residence times e g porous media with well defined contrasts in hydraulic conductivity or fractured aquifers hadermann and heer 1996 pedretti et al 2014 molinari et al 2015 dual domain models have proven useful to describe the behavior of flow and conservative tracers in wrps blackmore et al 2018 however they have rarely been applied to reactive transport simulations of leachate composition from wrps in particular for multicomponent simulations despite the heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivities intrinsic to wrps one possible reason for this paucity is that the parameters of upscaled models such as the mass transfer rates of dual domain models are difficult to constrain experimentally this is true for reactive solutes and full scale heterogeneous wrps but even for non reactive solutes in well controlled theoretical studies and laboratory experiments donado et al 2009 willmann et al 2010 molinari et al 2015 in this work we evaluated the ability of a dual domain multicomponent reactive transport model ddmrtm to predict long term records of neutral rock drainage nrd from a well studied experimental wrp at the antamina mine in peru conlan et al 2012 lorca et al 2016 skierszkan et al 2016 vriens et al 2019c 2019a 2019b our goal was to analyze in detail the parameterization of our model and determine whether a ddmrtm can be a useful upscaled modeling approach that is able to predict nrd with limited empirical fitting of model parameters in the analyzed experimental pile reactive species were mobilized under circumneutral ph conditions vriens et al 2019c the breakthrough curves btcs of reactive and conservative solutes provide a dataset well suited to assess the capabilities of our ddmrtm to simulate nrd generation and release the adopted methodology can be summarized as follows first we performed a forward modeling analysis to reproduce flow and conservative transport in the studied pile the adopted non calibrated parameters were obtained from previous dual domain modeling analyses blackmore et al 2018 targeting conservative transport in other experimental piles with similar geometrical textural and compositional characteristics this allowed us to evaluate if empirical parameters obtained for similar piles are useful to make predictions on others then the conservative transport model was upgraded to a reactive transport model making this a novel contribution compared to the previous upscaling modeling analysis for waste rock which focused exclusively on conservative transport we constrained the incorporated geochemical reactions a priori through a selection of kinetic parameters from the literature and existing field data from the studied site only one parameter the kinetic rate of molybdenite oxidation was treated as fitting parameter a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the controls of the key parameters on the model outputs 2 materials and methods 2 1 site overview and experimental data the antamina mine in peru hosts one of the world s largest experimental sites purposed for studying long term mine waste weathering and drainage processes within the multi scale research program a signature experiment included a group of five fully instrumented mesoscale experimental wrps 36 m 36 m 10 m in size 20 000 tons of material each that contained different types of waste rock details on the analysis of rates and chemical composition of drainage from these experimental piles can be found in vriens et al 2019a each pile was constructed in three major depositional events i e end dumped tipping phases on top of a protective layer infiltrating water originating from precipitation was captured by lysimeters fig 2 each pile was underlain by three smaller sub lysimeters of size 4 m 4 m a b c under the individual tipping phases as well as by a large basal lysimeter spanning the bottom of the entire pile 36 m 36 m lysimeter d in all piles sub lysimeters b were installed below the waste rock positioned closest to the bedrock and thus least exposed to fluctuations at the atmospheric boundaries in turn sub lysimeters c captured drainage from waste rock below the frontal batter that was more sensitive to fluctuations in atmospheric conditions fig 2 of the antamina experimental wrps pile 2 contained the most reactive and finest grained waste rock with a median particle diameter d 50 between 9 mm and 30 mm and the 10th weight percentile of particles d 10 varying in size from 0 1 mm to 0 15 mm lorca et al 2016 vriens et al 2019a very coarse material with diameter 100 mm expected to contribute minimally due to lower exposure of chemically reactive mineral surfaces accounted for less than 10 of the total grain size distribution in this pile the waste rock in the various tipping phases of pile 2 contained mainly class a rocks the class of most reactive material produced at the site the mineralogical composition was on average up to 2 7 wt pyrite up to 2 4 wt chalcopyrite and up to 0 1 wt molybdenite mos2 rock mo abundance varied roughly between 200 and 400 ppm carbonates comprised up to 1 of the bulk mineralogical assemblage in the pile vriens et al 2019a the pile 2 drainage chemistry record spans from 2007 to 2016 revealing that the sub lysimeter b displayed characteristic features of nrd with circumneutral ph until the end of the experiment part of the long term geochemical drainage record for sub lysimeter b in pile 2 hereafter referred to as sl2b is given in fig 3 the record reveals relatively stable circumneutral drainage ph and stable ca and so4 concentrations with only minor seasonal oscillations this behavior is explained by the fact that waste rock sampled along the flow paths arriving at sl2b contained considerable carbonate providing a neutralizing potential ratio npr 2 lorca et al 2016 chloride cl concentrations a residue from blasting booster agents drop consistently from a maximum of 100 mgl 1 to a minimum of 0 1 mgl 1 through time with minor oscillations molybdenum mo concentrations rise to a maximum of 30 mgl 1 after 800 1100 days then steadily decline to 10 mgl 1 at the end of the experimental period 2 2 geochemical tracer data the analysis of an artificial tracer test peterson 2014 suggested that the flow domain in pile 2 is mostly matrix flow with mean seepage velocities estimated as 2 0 2 4 cm day although the flow rates vary in response to rainfall events the portion of the fluid flow following rapid or preferential flow paths open void or film flow was a minor component 7 of the overall flow regime in our upscaled model one mobile flow zone was considered to account for contributions from matrix flow and preferential flow this mobile zone was complemented with an immobile zone in which flow rates are negligible fig 1 dissolved cl in the wrp drainage can be considered as an internal conservative tracer blackmore et al 2018 rather than an externally applied conservative tracer chloride was released by rapid dissolution of cl salts from blasting residues that were imported with the waste rock during pile construction and assumed evenly distributed as such dissolved cl reflects the physical transport dynamics in the wrp matrix flow domain as well as mass transfer between the immobile and mobile domain chloride migrated predominantly downward throughout the entire pile during weathering and drainage blackmore et al 2018 chloride transport began immediately after the pile s construction i e wrp weathering time zero making cl a suitable conservative solute for the assessment of physical transport properties through sl2b previous modeling by blackmore et al 2018 focused on cl transport in two other experimental wrps at antamina pile 4 and pile 5 the analysis of sub lysimeter b of pile 5 hereafter sl5b is of specific interest for the present study because it has similar geometry as pile 2 and contained waste rock with comparable texture grain size and lithological composition as described below blackmore et al 2018 successfully reproduced cl transport in sl5b using a similar ddm formulation among the key results they found that simulating mass transfer between the mobile and immobile zones provided a superior fit of the cl breakthrough curve btc tails compared to a formulation that ignores this mass transfer the physical processes sustaining the long term release of contaminant from the less mobile zones of the wrp could not be properly simulated using a 1 d single domain conservative transport model in contrast to cl mo is a reactive solute that can be used to test our model s capability to simulate multicomponent reactive transport within the wrp and to investigate distinct geochemical processes various geochemical processes relating to the mobilization and attenuation of mo in weathering waste rock i e sulfide oxidation sorption and secondary mineral formation have been observed at antamina and elsewhere and have been previously parameterized making it an excellent reactive solute for a mrtm comparison in antamina waste rock aqueous mo predominantly originates from the oxidation of molybdenite mos2 conlan et al 2012 skierszkan et al 2016 hirsche et al 2017 while the initial abundance of mos2 estimated in the pile was less than 0 1 wt vriens et al 2019a that amount is sufficient to generate mo drainage levels 20 mgl 1 as observed in the drainage btc in fig 3 in fact data from other antamina field experiments similarly reveal that mo is highly mobile under circumneutral ph drainage conlan et al 2012 skierszkan et al 2016 hirsche et al 2017 with aqueous concentrations reaching 50 mgl 1 vriens et al 2019c additional information on mo primary and secondary species speciation and eh ph diagrams can be found in e g smedley and kinniburgh 2017 2 3 modeling framework to model conservative and reactive transport with a consistent ddmrtm framework simulations were conducted using the code min3pdual cheng et al 2004 cheng 2006 a dual domain version of the multicomponent reactive transport code min3p mayer et al 2002 min3pdual adopts the same overall structure of min3p but is extended with terms for secondary immobile porosity the conceptual model of min3pdual is shown in fig 1 and the main governing equations and parameters necessary to run the simulations are presented below using min3pdual we first simulated flow and conservative transport using the ddm parameters determined by blackmore et al 2018 on sl5b for the sub lysimeter analyzed in this work sl2b then we extended blackmore et al 2018 s conservative ddm model incorporating multicomponent reactions to simulate the mo btc as well as the other btcs relevant for the control of nrd in sl2b fig 3 2 3 1 flow and conservative transport variably saturated flow in the mobile zone of min3pdual is defined in the same way as in the first release of min3p there is no flow in the immobile domain which is assumed to be fully saturated with water flow in the mobile domain is described by richards equation where fluid saturation s relative permeability k r and pressure defined in terms of hydraulic head ℎ are related to each other by standard soil hydraulic functions wösten and van genuchten 1988 the general advection dispersion reaction equation for multicomponent reactive transport in the mobile m domain can be written as 1 t θ m a t m j a θ m g t m j g f t j s θ m a d a t m j a θ m g d g t m j g q a t m j a γ j m where the suffixes a g and s represent aqueous gaseous and sorbed phases respectively t is time s θ is the fluid content t j is the total phase component concentration mol l 1 f is the mobile porosity fraction and also the fraction of mobile sorption sites d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient m2 s 1 d α l qθ 1 d αl is the local dispersivity m d is the effective pore water diffusion coefficient which depends on d w the free diffusion coefficient in water m2 s 1 and and q is darcy flux for water only m s 1 the term γ m j encompasses multiple sink source terms for the j th component such that 2 γ m j q m j a min q m j ext q j mt where q m j a min represents the sink source term due to mineral dissolution precipitation and q m j ext represents the sink sources terms caused by mass fluxes at the boundaries and q j mt represents the exchange between mobile m and immobile im domains this last term adds the dual domain capacity to min3pdual compared to the standard single domain version of min3p the term q j mt is defined as 3 q j mt ω t m j a t im j a where ω represents the first order mass transfer rate coefficient s 1 in the immobile domain the solute mass balance equation is 4 t θ im a t im j a 1 f t j s γ j im and 5 γ j im q im j a m q im j ext q j mt noticing that the dual domain advection dispersion model approaches the single domain equivalent as ω 0 it was assumed that the mass transfer term ω is ion independent i e the same for all aqueous components key input parameters used in the transport model are listed in table 1 the vertically oriented 1 d model was set to reproduce the 10 m tall waste rock column above sl2b discretized into 100 control volumes second type neumann boundary conditions were adopted to simulate the net recharge at the top of the pile basal exfiltration from the pile was simulated as a seepage boundary which also acts as a free exit boundary for solutes to simulate non calibrated flow and conservative transport we assumed that pile 2 and pile 5 were exposed to the same precipitation rates and climatic conditions the top of the column of material above pile 5b receiving precipitation was composed of the intrusive material classified as class a waste rock blackmore et al 2018 as pile 2 as such recharge rates flow and conservative transport parameters for our model were considered the same as those for class a of pile 5 table 1 initial dissolved concentrations of cl were estimated from maximum concentrations observed from the btc 100 mgl 1 from blackmore et al 2018 we retained the same mass transfer coefficient of ω 5 21 10 9 s 1 and the total porosity of θ 0 24 split into a mobile porosity θ m 0 06 and an immobile porosity θ im 0 18 2 3 2 dual domain multicomponent reactive transport the geochemical reactions incorporated in the ddmrtm model were selected according to the adagio as simple as possible but as complicated as necessary and include a purposely limited set of reactions to maximize model transparency simplifications and assumptions made for the geochemical model include sulfate and acidity are generated exclusively by oxidation of pyrite and molybdenite calcite is the only mineral buffering the drainage acidity other carbonates and silicates known to occur at antamina were not part of the geochemical reaction network as their buffering capacity was small compared to that provided by calcite vriens et al 2019a gypsum powellite and ferrihydrite are the only secondary mineral phases considered providing the dominant solubility controls for ca moo4 2 so4 2 and fe3 powellite was used as the sole secondary mineral phase containing mo conlan et al 2012 skierszkan et al 2016 hirsche et al 2017 vriens et al 2019c given the low amount of pb in pile 2 wulfenite pbmoo4 another potential mo bearing secondary mineral observed in other antamina waste rock conlan et al 2012 was expected to be negligible as a mo sink above sl2b pore gas concentrations measured in pile 2 using in situ instrumentation lorca et al 2016 vriens et al 2019b showed near atmospheric levels for o2 and elevated co2 and in the model were fixed to o2 g 21 v v and co2 g 0 1 v v the main geochemical parameters used in the ddrmtm analysis are listed in table 2 this table also reports the initial volumetric fractions ψ of the reactive minerals used in the simulations their stoichiometries and equilibrium constants log k as well as the aqueous concentrations of the components characterizing the recharging and initial background pore waters table 2 also includes the composition of the infiltrating precipitation and the initial porewater for the reactive transport modeling min3pdual utilizes a kinetic formulation for reaction rates r x of reversible surface controlled dissolution precipitation reactions mayer et al 2002 a precipitation or dissolution rate r x was defined for each mineral x as 6 r x k x 1 iap x k x where k x is a zero order kinetic rate coefficient and iap x the ion activity product rate coefficients were set to yield quasi equilibrium conditions for calcite gypsum and ferrihydrite a sensitivity analysis not shown suggested that our models were insensitive to rate coefficients used to simulate powellite precipitation which is kinetically limited conlan et al 2012 skierszkan et al 2019a therefore we also imposed quasi equilibrium conditions for powellite mineral specific thermodynamic equilibrium constants k x were based on the minteqa2 database version 4 allison et al 1998 we modeled pyrite and molybdenite oxidation as zero order irreversible processes in the absence of supporting data that could justify more complex modeling formulations for sulfide weathering for instance a shrinking core model this choice was also made to limit the number of model unknowns and potential complexity of the model interpretation the zero order approach is further justified by mass balance analyses of the drainage from pile 2 and its bulk waste rock fe content vriens et al 2019a which suggest that fe depletion in pile 2 was 10 over 10 years after initial tests we fixed the pyrite rate coefficient at k fes2 5 10 10 mol l 1 s 1 which allows the simulation to match the observed release of so4 2 and indirectly ca through the precipitation of gypsum and the drainage ph which does not drop substantially this value for k fes2 is in line with other works on sulfide rich wrps using similar modeling approaches javadi 2019 for molybdenite the value of k mos2 was more difficult to estimate a priori and it remains poorly constrained in the literature johnson et al 2019 thus it was instead treated as a fitting parameter the best fitting parameter was obtained using an iterative procedure that minimizes the root mean square error rmse between observed and simulated values adsorption onto mineral surfaces is an additional process attenuating mo drainage concentrations adsorption can become the dominant attenuating process in oxic and sub oxic waste rock environments skierszkan et al 2019b nonlinear mo sorption in which a greater proportion adsorbs at low concentrations has been previously observed and inferred to explain mo tailing behavior stollenwerk 1995 under oxic conditions at ph 6 molybdate may be strongly adsorbed through inner sphere complexation with fe oxyhydr oxides under circumneutral ph however molybdate sorption involves weaker outer sphere complexation that can lead to enhanced mo mobility in circumneutral to slightly alkaline drainage ph as observed in pile 2b skierszkan et al 2016 vriens et al 2019b adsorption of mo to prototypical hydrous ferrous oxides hfos and select other fe minerals ferrihydrite hematite and goethite has been studied previously goldberg et al 2009 arai 2010 kashiwabara et al 2011 gustafsson and tiberg 2015 adsorption of mo on hfos was implemented in the ddmrtm as a reversible equilibrium controlled term aggregating the variety of experimentally detected fe oxyhydr oxide phases in class a antamina waste rock vriens et al 2019c 2019a under a single idealized hfo phase feoh a non electrostatic surface complexation model scm was adopted the minteqa2 database contains ph dependent sorption surfaces forming from the binding between cations and anions including mo species onto strong feoh s and weak feoh w surface sites dzombak and morel 1990 a list of the considered surface species their formulae and log k values is provided in table 3 the scm depends on the total concentration of the surfaces where mo can adsorb c surf mol l 1 expressed in min3p as 7 c surf 10 9 a v σ s λ where a v is the avogadro constant mol sites σ s is the density of reactive hfo sites sites nm 2 and λ m2l 1 is obtained as 8 λ s s m s where m s is the mass of the sites g l 1 and s s is the specific surface area of the hfo m2 g 1 for σ hfo we considered that hfo contains 50 μmol m 2 of sorption sites dzombak and morel 1990 resulting in σ s 6 sites nm 2 consistent with the previous analyses involving the adopted scm model davis and kent 1990 appelo and postma 2005 demers et al 2013 an estimation of m s based on our mineralogical data vriens et al 2019a shows that the abundance of hfo assumed as aggregate for all secondary fe oxyhydr oxides was 0 1 wt at the beginning of the simulations assuming that this amount is an average value that remains constant with time in reality hfo will grow and undergo phase changes as weathering proceeds this corresponds to a mass of hfos above sl2b of m s 8 8 gl 1 adopting the total porous volume of the projected waste rock and its mean density above sub lysimeter pile 2 vriens et al 2019b this value is of the same order of magnitude but about 4 5 lower for instance than the adopted value by demers et al 2013 for another slightly more fine grained waste rock pile m s 40 gl 1 the estimation of s s was more uncertain because we lacked specific surface area measured on waste rock particles e g bet and because the heterogeneity of waste rock renders it complicated to provide average upscaled values for the broad range of materials in this pile a first cut estimation of s s was obtained by assuming that all waste rock particles exhibited a uniform spherical geometry that density was uniform across the entire particle size distribution and that mineral phases were homogeneously distributed over the different size fractions this way we obtained a range of s s 0 2 3 m2g 1 hfos which is in line with the results from other waste rock studies e g s s 0 8 m2g 1 hfos reported by demers et al 2013 due to the adopted simplifications however the range of s s remains uncertain the fact that waste rock is a coarse material explains at least in part that the surface area is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than typical values reported in the literature for sorption on hfo minerals appelo and postma 2005 also not all waste rock minerals contain reactive iron as such we assumed a base case value of s s 1 m2g 1 hfos an intermediate value representative of the field based estimation and performed a sensitivity around this value 3 results analysis and discussion 3 1 analysis of the observed btcs the shape of the double log plots of cl and mo drainage concentrations over time fig 4 red symbols are diagnostic to evaluate whether upscaled transport simulation using ddm formulations is a reasonable choice for the selected case study the observed btcs of cl and mo show that conservative cl behaves distinctly from reactive mo in pile 2b for cl the btc concentrations are initially high and gradually trend towards lower concentrations through time illustrative of the conservative nature of cl it can further be observed that the double log btc for cl displays patterns indicative of mobile immobile transport namely the shape of the double log btc of cl is strongly asymmetric and its tailing i e the post peak part of the btc can be described by a power law function with slope 9 c t β where c is concentration t is time and β is the power law exponent for cl we find that the tails scale close to β 3 2 the characteristic slope of btc tailings determined analytically for non equilibrium matrix diffusion models in dual porosity systems hadermann and heer 1996 which are conceptually and mathematically similar to a ddm model although much longer records would be needed to properly identify a power law scaling of the btcs compared to other heavily tailed statistical models pedretti and bianchi 2018 the data suggests that a dual domain transport formulation is a reasonable choice to describe the behavior of conservative tracers like cl in the studied wrp compared to cl the btc of mo fig 4 blue symbols shows a relatively elongated shape with an initially delayed mobilization as well as a gradual reduction of leachate concentrations over the course of several years considering that no geochemical processes inhibited the mobility of cl in these simulations we contrast cl as a reference conservative tracer and mo as a reactive tracer the reactive nature of mo can be phenomenologically appreciated from its btc when plotted in double log normalization fig 4 blue symbols firstly the rising part of the btc of mo is delayed compared to that of cl indicating that mo release is slower than conservative transport this is consistent with the kinetic release of mo by the weathering of mo bearing sulfides contrasting the quicker release of cl that is associated to a first flush of soluble cl bearing salts in addition the btc tail for mo scales close to β 1 i e a smaller exponent than that for cl suggesting a higher persistence of mo in the waste rock matrix compared to cl and consistent with an internal release limitation and or attenuation process beyond purely conservative mass transport 3 2 flow and conservative transport modeling a comparison between forward simulated cumulative flow and cl exfiltrating at pile 2b and the observed values is shown in fig 5 we contrasted the ddm simulations against single domain simulations i e the results from the use of a classic one dimensional single domain advection dispersion equation ade obtained by setting ω 0 the test was performed by setting the concentration of cl in the water resident in the pile at the start of the simulation to 100 mgl 1 considering that the ddm model parameters were not calibrated but obtained directly from class a materials for pile 5b both flow top plot and conservative cl records middle and bottom plots were reasonably well reproduced both the single domain and ddm model simulations quantitatively agree with measured values in cumulative drainage from pile 2b flow is the same in both ade based and ddm based models in arithmetic scales both the initial maximum concentrations and the decrease in concentration c 0 are correctly captured by both models however the use of linear scales obscures the performance of the transport models at lower concentrations i e the btc tails which are key for identifying mass transfer between the zones of different mobility more importantly the btc tails are key features to obtain wrp model parameters that can describe the long term behavior of solute transport it is important that models used to assist decision makers for prediction of post closure contaminant transport from wrps properly reproduce the btc tails and the evolution of the contaminants at timescales far beyond those characterizing the initial weathering process when plotted on a logarithmic concentration scale bottom plot of fig 5 the differences between the ade and the ddm outputs become more noticeable on the tails the dual domain model sustains cl concentrations in line with those measured in the field whereas the single porosity model yields a too rapid decrease in cl concentrations the fact that the ddm provides a superior fit of the experimental btcs compared to the single domain ade model corroborates the findings by blackmore et al blackmore et al 2018 who obtained a superior fit for the btc of cl from pile 5b with the ddm model compared to a single domain model better agreement with dual porosity over single porosity formulations was also obtained in several other analyses from systems embedding different flow geometries sánchez vila and carrera 2004 molinari et al 2015 sharma et al 2015 owing to the fact that the mass transfer between mobile and immobile domains effectively accounts for the small scale heterogeneities that cannot be reproduced using a 1 d ade model since the results of the conservative transport modeling indicate that a single domain ade formulation does not well describe solute transport in sl2b the focus of the remaining work is to reproduce drainage dynamics of the reactive solutes using dual domain formulations only finally the conservative transport simulations indicate that the ddm model for pile 2b was able to reproduce field observations using parameters calibrated towards a specific portion of pile 5b which had a similar lithology as pile 2b i e intrusive rocks therefore ddm transport parameters determined for materials with similar grain sizes appear to be transferable to other systems although further confirmation across grain size ranges is required 3 3 dual domain multicomponent reactive transport modeling the result of the ddmrtm simulation embedding the calibrated best fitting k mos2 4 10 13 mol l 1 s 1 resulting in rmse 0 14 are shown in fig 6a and fig 6b which compare the mo breakthrough curves and the cumulative mo mass against measured data fig 6c provides the ca btc the drainage ph and the so4 btc from pile 2b respectively the ddmrtm model captures the recorded drainage ph and so4 concentrations accurately while only marginally overpredicting ca concentrations in sl2b drainage molybdenum btcs fig 6a and the corresponding cumulative values fig 6b are reproduced equally well capturing the buildup segment of the observed btc the model is able to capture the early time arrival of the mo btc at the sub lysimeter the maximum observed mo concentrations and the btc tails i e 1500 days overall the model appears to properly reproduce mo concentrations in agreement with the cl btc tail that the dual domain model could quantitatively reproduce fig 5 the model also satisfactorily captures the cumulative amount of mo released from sl2b the relatively stable ca and so4 drainage concentrations are strongly tied to the solubility limit of secondary gypsum as has been previously experimentally observed vriens et al 2019a we thus conclude that a ddmrtm is appropriate to reproduce the observed drainage record it is particularly relevant that the model works well using just one fitting parameter i e the rate constant for molybdenite oxidation k mos2 a sensitivity analysis performed to evaluate the uncertainty around this parameter suggested fig 7 that a small variation of k mos2 causes large variations in the modeled mo btc resulting in substantial discrepancies in the cumulative mo from the reference best fit simulation this is true for both an increase green lines with square markers and a decrease light blue lines with crosses in k mos2 indicating that the parameter is identifiable well constrained by the mo concentration data and is essential to accurately reproduce the pile s drainage a sensitivity analysis was also conducted around another uncertain parameter the specific surface area of the hfo s s while keeping the k mos2 4x10 13 mol l 1 s 1 the results fig 8 suggested that the model was relatively insensitive to a decrease in s s as comparable results are obtained in simulations with a multiplicative factor up to 0 01 i e to s s 0 01 m2g 1 instead simulations with larger s s reveal the opposite behavior multiplicative factors 10 s s 10 m2g 1 and 100 s s 100 m2g 1 produce strongly decreasing and ultimately negligible mo concentrations respectively these results suggest that the presence of additional sorption sites would strongly attenuate the mobility of mo but also that hfo and other minerals may currently be controlling the net adsorption of mo because there appear to be limited available sorption sites mo exhibits relatively elevated mobility in the studied pile no significant variations in ca so4 and ph were observed in the sensitivity analyses which instead remained at levels similar to those of the best fit model data not shown finally simulations also revealed that competition for sorption sites by other anions did not influence the long term mo record results not reported the drainage from sl2b exhibited concentrations of potentially competing oxyanions phosphate arsenate tungstate or chromate smedley and kinniburgh 2017 that were either below detection limits or at least an order of magnitude lower than mo concentrations vriens et al 2019b the inferred lack of competition for sorption sites is consistent with previous studies that found that tungstate and phosphate appear to be the strongest competitors of mo for the adsorption sites of goethite whereas only minor competitive effects were observed in the case of silicate and sulfate xu et al 2009 4 conclusion upscaled or effective models are appealing for modeling reactive transport in complex systems due to a reduced computational burden compared to multidimensional reactive transport models however a drawback of effective models is that linking physical and mathematical ddm parameters is highly difficult consequently in many practical applications upscaled model parameters are treated as empirical parameters that are fitted to site specific observations such as solute btcs from tracer tests this fitting casts legitimate doubts regarding the predictive ability of upscaling models and their calibrated parameters this work presented reactive transport simulations with single and dual domain multicomponent reactive transport models ddmrtms and corresponding parameter sensitivity analyses for the prediction of conservative and reactive solute transport through a mine waste rock pile our work is one of the first ever presented application of a ddmrtm model for upscaling purposes on waste rock drainage we found that the dual domain formulation outperformed its single domain counterpart in the reproduction of conservative cl solute trends in line with previous studies blackmore et al 2018 experimentally pre calibrated parameters of the dual domain model e g van genuchten parameters particle sizes mineral fractions kinetic mass transfer coefficients appeared extrapolatable across similar scale experiments with comparable material types in this sense our results prove that linking physical and mathematical dual domain parameters is not impossible the ddmrtm model successfully simulated long term mo drainage chemistry dynamics the ultimate best fit model and parameters were consistent with the current mechanistic understanding of mo waste rock geochemistry the great majority of model parameters were established by experimental evidence or literature values a critical fitting parameter remains the kinetic rate coefficient for molybdenite oxidation k mos2 which the model is very sensitive to an increase in k mos2 could be balanced out by increasing the surface complexation the sink term we thus conclude that the ddmrtm model works well for reproducing btcs of drainage from reactive waste rock piles as such we recommend the ddmrtm approach going forward for upscaling waste rock drainage a proper characterization of source and sink terms in waste rock will provide better constraints for ddmrtm predictions research data all data

1353,models for the co transport of two different colloids commonly assume a one way coupling this is because often a large colloid and small colloid are involved therefore they assume that the spread of smaller colloid is affected by the transport of larger colloids but not the other way around however a number of studies have shown that this assumption is not valid even for large and small colloids therefore in this study a two way coupled model is developed to simulate the co transport of two different colloids in porous media and their effect on each other we have considered the interactions of the two colloids with the grain surface kinetics of heteroaggregation of the two colloids and heteroaggregate deposition onto the grain surface we assumed a first order kinetic model to represent heteroaggregate formation and its deposition on the grain surface the model is evaluated by fitting the experimental data reported in four different papers from the literature on the co transport of clay colloids and viruses bacteria and graphene oxide nanoparticles and clay colloids and graphene oxide nanoparticles the model performance is compared with the commonly used one way coupled model the two way coupled model is found to satisfactorily simulate most of the experimental conditions reported in the above papers except for the co transport of montmorillonite adenovirus and staphylococcus aureus graphene oxide nanoparticles keywords co transport colloids porous media heteroaggregation two way coupled model 1 introduction predicting the transport behaviour of colloidal contaminants such as pathogenic microorganisms and engineered nanoparticles in the subsurface is essential for the assessment of groundwater contamination risks ron and johnson 2020 schijven and hassanizadeh 2002 schijven et al 2010 to estimate the safe distance of drinking water wells from potential contamination sources schijven et al 2006 to decide on the degree of treatment required before supplying the groundwater for drinking purposes schijven et al 1999 2000 and to remediate contaminated groundwater malakar and snow 2020 it is found that the release pathways of colloidal contaminants including point sources such as deep well injection for bioremediation and distributed sources e g rainfall events landfills irrigation activities have a significant impact on their fate and transport in the subsurface mahmoudi et al 2020 there are also colloids that do not really pose any groundwater quality threats but may act as carriers of contaminating colloids for example natural colloids such as clays are abundant in the subsurface and have been found to facilitate the transport of contaminants such as biocolloids and engineered nanoparticles cai et al 2014 vasiliadou and chrysikopoulos 2011 walshe et al 2010 so it is very important to study the co transport of two different colloids a number of experimental studies have investigated the co transport of multiple colloids in porous media including clay and bacteria vasiliadou and chrysikopoulos 2011 yang et al 2012 clay and viruses jin et al 2000 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 syngouna et al 2017 walshe et al 2010 clay and engineered nanoparticles bayat et al 2015 cai et al 2014 chrysikopoulos et al 2017 clay and plastic particles li et al 2020 silica nanoparticles and viruses qin et al 2020 bacteria and engineered nanoparticles cai et al 2016 georgopoulou et al 2020 viruses and engineered nanoparticles syngouna et al 2017 iron oxide particles and engineered nanoparticles wang et al 2021 plastic particles and engineered nanoparticles cai et al 2019 dong et al 2019 and a mixture of engineered nanoparticles cai et al 2013 kumari et al 2015 experimental results from these studies indicate that the transport behaviors of both colloids are different when they are co present as compared to their individual transport also the co presence of a different colloid can either increase or decrease the transport of bacteria viruses and engineered nanoparticles depending on the interactions of the two colloids with the grain surface competition between the two colloids to find deposition sites on the grain surface heteroaggregation of colloids in the aqueous phase and at the grain surface and deposition of heteroaggregates on the grain surface the experimental studies involving the co transport of micrometer and nanometer sized particles e g clay bacteria clay viruses clay engineered nanoparticles and bacteria engineered nanoparticles revealed a greater retention of both particles in porous media when they are co present together than their individual transport behaviour the mechanisms that have been proposed for the increased retention are the formation of heteroaggregates aggregates of two different colloids in the aqueous and solid phases and the co deposition of the two colloids to the grain surface chrysikopoulos et al 2017 georgopoulou et al 2020 li et al 2019 yang et al 2012 sotirelis and chrysikopoulos 2017 georgopoulou et al 2020 and vasiliadou and chrysikopoulos 2011 found from batch experiments that the heteroaggregation of graphene oxide nanoparticles kaolinite graphene oxide nanoparticles montmorillonite and pseudomonas putida kaolinite respectively can be described using a pseudo second order kinetic model also heteroaggregates e g iron oxide plastic particles nanoplastics fullerene micron sized plastic particles kaolinite and zno cuo are found to have different surface charges and hence may interact differently with the solid surface than the individual colloids dong et al 2019 li et al 2019 2020 parsai and kumar 2019 therefore it is important to account for the kinetics of heteroaggregation and its deposition on the grain surface to simulate the co transport of multiple colloids in porous media a one dimensional one way coupled mathematical model describing the co transport of clay particles and bacteria under saturated conditions was developed by vasiliadou and chrysikopoulos 2011 and was used by seetha et al 2015 to describe the co transport of viruses and clay colloids this model has been further extended to three dimensions by katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2014 2015 the above models assume that the presence of attached bacteria or viruses on the clay particle surface will not affect the transport behaviour of clay colloids this model does not account for the kinetics of heteroaggregate formation and does not distinguish between the interaction of clay colloids and clay bacteria heteroaggregate with the grain surface thus clay colloid transport equations were decoupled from the bacteria or virus transport equations this would imply that the individual clay colloids and heteroaggregates of clay bacteria or clay viruses should have the same transport behaviour and the values of attachment and detachment rate coefficients for clay colloids obtained from experiments with clay colloids only should be applicable in modelling co transport experiments however results of simulations by seetha et al 2015 showed that this is not the case for a satisfactory fit of co transport experimental data using one way coupled model they had to use significantly different values for attachment and detachment rate coefficients of clay colloids during co transport than the values obtained from clay colloids only transport experiments this means that transport behaviour of both clays and bacteria or viruses are different when they are co present as compared to their individual transport this implies that a two way coupled model describing the co transport of two different colloids is needed the objective of this study is to develop a 1d two way coupled model to simulate the co transport of two different colloids in saturated porous media the extension to three dimensions is trivial the model accounts for deposition of both colloids on the grain surface kinetics of heteroaggregation using a first order model and deposition of heteroaggregates onto the grain surface this is the first study where the co transport of two different colloids in porous media is modelled by accounting for the heteroaggregation kinetics the developed model is evaluated by fitting experimental data from four different studies reported in the literature the model performance is also compared with that of a simple one way coupled model 2 two way coupled mathematical model 2 1 model development in this study we consider the co transport of two different colloids fig 1 shows the various forms of colloids and the interactions among colloids and with grain surface here we have shown a large colloid colloid 1 and a small one colloid 2 because that is the case in many applications as well as in the four experimental studies that we have simulated here however the model developed here and governing equations that are presented below are valid for any size of colloids both colloids 1 and 2 can exist in free form in aqueous phase and as immobile colloids attached to solid surface in addition colloids 1 and 2 undergo heteroaggregation heteroaggregates exists in two different forms in mobile form in aqueous phase and in immobile form attached to solid surface assumptions involved in the model development are a the formation of the heteroaggregates is described using a first order reversible kinetic model b the rate coefficients for attachment of colloid 1 to colloid 2 is the same as that of colloid 2 to colloid 1 c the properties of heteroaggregates are different from that of

form of colloids 1 and 2 at inlet eq 14 indicates a zero inlet concentration for the heteroaggregates in aqueous phase eq 15 indicates a neumann type boundary condition at the outlet for the mobile forms of colloids 1 and 2 the governing eqs 1 2 or 3 4 5 or 6 or 7 8 9 10 and 11 subject to the initial and boundary conditions are solved numerically using an alternating three step operator splitting approach seetha et al 2015 this numerical scheme involves splitting the governing equations into advection dispersion and reaction operators and then solving them sequentially for the first half of every time step the order of solution is then reversed in the second half of every time step the advection dispersion and reaction operators are solved using an explicit finite volume scheme with minmod limiter implicit finite difference method and fourth order runge kutta method respectively more details about the above numerical scheme are given in seetha et al 2015 3 one way coupled model the one way coupled model has been the most common approach to simulate the co transport of two different colloids in porous media this model assumes that the transport properties of colloid 1 are not affected by the presence of colloid 2 on its surface and does not account for heteroaggregation kinetics though this model is already available in the literature seetha et al 2015 vasiliadou and chrysikopoulos 2011 the governing equations are reproduced in the appendix eqs a1 to a5 to maintain the consistency in the notations throughout this paper 4 model evaluation the developed two way coupled model is evaluated by reproducing the observed behaviour in several sets of experiments reported in four publications chrysikopoulos et al 2017 georgopoulou et al 2020 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 syngouna et al 2017 these experiments involved studying the co transport of a micrometer sized colloid kaolinite montmorillonite escherichia coli e coli enterococcus faecalis e faecalis or staphylococcus aureus s aureus and a nanometer sized colloid graphene oxide go nanoparticles ms2 φx174 or adenovirus the general scheme of all column experiments was as follows first the dispersivity of the porous medium was determined by performing a tracer experiment then the transport of each colloid large or small was studied in separate experiments to understand their individual deposition behaviour onto the grain surface this was followed by co transport experiments involving simultaneous injection of both the micrometer and nanometer sized colloids into the column 4 1 description of fitting procedure the procedure for fitting the experimental data with the one way and two way coupled models along with the objective function and the number of calibrated parameters in each step is given in the form of a flow chart in fig 2 for fitting the experimental data first the value of dispersivity of the porous medium is estimated by fitting the tracer breakthrough curve with 1d advection dispersion equation it is known that colloid dispersivity is size dependent and can be different from tracer dispersivity chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 keller et al 2004 nevertheless except in the case of georgopoulou et al 2020 we assume colloids dispersivity to be the same as the tracer dispersivity in order to reduce the number of fitted parameters also all colloids are assumed to travel at the same velocity as the pore water ofcourse the correct procedure would have been to estimate the values of velocity and dispersivity along with the deposition parameters for each colloid by fitting colloid breakthrough curve with advection dispersion sorption equation however we find that the available experimental data do not contain sufficient information to warrant estimating so many parameters independently the aforementioned procedure for estimating dispersivity was the same for both one way and two way models next for the one way coupled model breakthrough curves of colloid 1 and colloid 2 from the individual transport experiments are fitted with advection dispersion equation with one site or two site kinetic model to estimate the values of attachment and detachment rate coefficients for colloid 1 to the grain surface k 1cs and k 1sc or k 11cs k 11sc and k 12cs and for colloid 2 k 2cs and k 2sc or k 2cs k 2sc and s 2max or k 21cs k 21sc and k 22cs the governing equations for the individual transport of colloid 1 and colloid 2 are given in appendix b in line with the underlying assumption of one way coupled model parameter values for individual particles of both colloid 1 and colloid 2 either in aqueous phase or adsorbed are assumed to remain unchanged when simulating co transport experiments then the breakthrough curve of colloid 2 from the co transport experiments is fitted to estimate the values of parameters describing the interaction of colloid 2 with colloid 1 k a and k d where k a and k d are the rate coefficients for attachment and detachment of colloid 2 to colloid 1 in all four papers used for model evaluation the effluent breakthrough curves were reported in terms of the total mobile concentration of colloid 1 and colloid 2 chrysikopoulos et al 2017 georgopoulou et al 2020 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 syngouna et al 2017 in the one way coupled model this would correspond to c 1 and c 2 s m c 1 respectively in addition syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 also reported the breakthrough concentration of colloid 2 alone in the free form c 2 next we explain the step by step procedure for fitting the experimental data for the co transport of two different colloids with the two way coupled model the estimation of dispersivity of porous medium and the attachment and detachment rate coefficients of colloid 1 and colloid 2 to the grain surface are the same as explained in the previous paragraph after knowing the values of individual deposition parameters of colloid 1 and colloid 2 breakthrough curves of colloid 1 and colloid 2 from the co transport experiments are fitted with eqs 1 11 to estimate the values of parameters describing heteroaggregation kinetics k a and k d and heteroaggregate interaction with the grain surface k a agg and k d agg in our model the total mobile concentrations of colloid 1 and colloid 2 would correspond to c 1 1 s m c 3 and c 2 s m c 3 respectively and the free form of colloid 2 would correspond to c 2 we used levenberg marquardt algorithm to find the best fit between the observed and the modelled breakthrough curves for colloid 1 and colloid 2 the performance of the one way and two way coupled models is compared quantitatively using information theoretic criteria aic and aicc and bayesian criteria bic which serve as model selection criteria ye et al 2008 these criteria favour the model which reproduces the experimental data closely and having the least number of fitting parameters the model with the lowest value of a given criterion is the preferred model aic aicc and bicare calculated as ye et al 2008 16 aic n obs ln σ 2 2 p 17 aicc n obs ln σ 2 2 p 2 n n 1 n obs n 1 18 bic n obs ln σ 2 p ln n obs where n obs is the number of observations σ 2 is the sum of squared residuals divided by the number of observations p is the number of model parameters estimated and n p 1 4 2 simulating experimental results of chrysikopoulos et al 2017 chrysikopoulos et al 2017 conducted laboratory column experiments to study the influence of ph and ionic strength on the co transport of go nanoparticles and kaolinite colloids under saturated conditions obviously in our model kaolinite is colloid 1 and go nanoparticles are colloid 2 two types of porous media were used in this study glass beads and quartz sand the column was 30 cm long with a diameter of 2 5 cm the porosity and bulk density of glass beads were 0 42 and 1 68 g cm3 respectively the respective values for quartz sand were 0 39 and 1 7 g cm3 the hydrodynamic diameters of go nanoparticles and kaolinite were in the range of 413 654 nm and 513 709 nm respectively experiments were conducted at a flow rate of 1 5 ml min and at three different values of ph 4 7 10 and ionic strength 7 12 27 mm the inlet concentrations of kaolinite and go nanoparticles were 50 mg l and 5 mg l respectively each experiment consisted of injecting appropriate colloidal suspensions kaolinite or go nanoparticles or simultaneous injection of kaolinite and go nanoparticles for 3 pore volumes pvs followed by flushing the column with colloid free background solution for 2 pvs all experiments were conducted at room temperature more details about the experiments are given in chrysikopoulos et al 2017 chrysikopoulos et al 2017 observed greater retention and larger collision efficiency of both go nanoparticles and kaolinite during their co transport than during their individual transport the deposition of kaolinite and go nanoparticles to the grain surface is described using a two site kinetic model appendix b the estimated values of the various parameters for the two way and one way coupled models are given in table 1 fig 3 compares the observed and fitted breakthrough curves of kaolinite and go nanoparticles during their co transport through columns packed with glass beads at various ph and ionic strength values of the background solution the simulated breakthrough curves from the two way coupled model matches the observed data reasonably well for all cases except for the breakthrough curve of go nanoparticles at ph 4 and ionic strength 7 mm through glass bead packed columns fig 3b fig 4 compares the observed and fitted breakthrough curves of kaolinite and go nanoparticles during their co transport through columns packed with quartz sand at ph 7 and ionic strength 7 mm the one way coupled model could not simulate the observed breakthrough curves of kaolinite for any of the co transport experiments figs 3 and 4 and table 1 the values of aic aicc and bic for the two way coupled model are smaller than the one way coupled model which indicates that the latter is the most preferred model chrysikopoulos et al 2017 observed from the co transport experimental data that go nanoparticle retention inside porous medium increased with decreasing ph due to the possible increase in heteroaggregation this is supported by the experimental results of sotirelis and chrysikopoulos 2017 who observed from batch experiments a greater attachment of go particles onto kaolinite colloids with decreasing ph this is due to less negative surface potential of kaolinite colloids and go nanoparticles with decreasing ph which leads to greater attraction between them as a result of deeper secondary minimum this agrees with the estimated parameters for the two way coupled model given in table 1 which shows that the ratio of attachment and detachment rate coefficients of go nanoparticles to kaolinite colloids increases with decreasing ph further table 1 shows that the attachment rate coefficient of heteroaggregates to the grain surface increases with decreasing ph since the surface potentials of both go nanoparticles and kaolinite become less negative with decreasing ph the surface potential of heteroaggregates may also decrease resulting in more attachment to the grain surfaces also table 1 indicates that the attachment of go nanoparticles to kaolinite increased slightly with increasing ionic strength this is in line with the observations of sotirelis and chrysikopoulos 2017 who found from batch experiments that the mass of go nanoparticles attached to kaolinite colloids increased with ionic strength due to less negative zeta potentials of go nanoparticles and kaolinite with increasing ionic strength and thus less repulsion between them the attachment rate coefficient of heteroaggregates to the grain surface and go nanoparticle attachment to kaolinite is found to be larger for sand than for glass beads table 1 this is in agreement with the observations of chrysikopoulos et al 2017 who found greater retention and larger collision efficiency of go nanoparticles in columns packed with quartz sand than glass beads though the zeta potential of the sand and the energy profiles for go nanoparticle quartz sand and kaolinite quartz sand are similar to those in the presence of glass beads chrysikopoulos et al 2017 the greater retention of go nanoparticles on sand may be due to the heterogeneity of the sand surface as compared to the glass beads 4 3 simulating experimental results of syngouna et al 2017 syngouna et al 2017 conducted experiments to study the co transport of clay colloids kaolinite and montmorillonite and human adenovirus through laboratory columns in our model they are colloid 1 and colloid 2 respectively columns of 2 5 cm in diameter and 30 cm in length were packed with glass beads under saturated conditions the dry bulk density of the porous medium was 2 65 g cm3 and porosity was 0 42 sterile dnase i reaction solution was used as the background solution the size of kaolinite particles was in the range of 0 2 1 μm and the average size of montmorillonite particles was 0 5 μm adenovirus size is in the range of 65 85 nm two sets of experiments were performed in this study the first set of experiments involved studying the individual transport behaviour of kaolinite montmorillonite and adenovirus and the second set involved studying the co transport behaviour of clay colloids and adenovirus each co transport experiment involved passing clay and adenovirus suspension simultaneously for 3 pvs through the column followed by flushing the column with 3pvs of colloid free background solution a total of six experiments were reported in this study for the co transport of kaolinite adenovirus and montmorillonite adenovirus at three different flow rates of 0 8 1 5 and 2 5 ml min the effluent total suspended virus concentration and the effluent total clay concentration were measured using qpcr and uv vis spectrophotometer respectively more details about the experimental protocol are available in syngouna et al 2017 the influent concentrations of kaolinite montmorillonite and adenovirus for the various experiments are given in table 1 of syngouna et al 2017 syngouna et al 2017 observed higher retention of both adenovirus and clay colloids when they were co present than during their individual transport due to the formation of large clay virus heteroaggregates that clogged the pores and the attachment of heteroaggregates to the grain surface the interactions of kaolinite montmorillonite and adenovirus with the grain surface are described using a two site kinetic model appendix b the inactivation of adenovirus is neglected in our model table 2 gives the fitted values of parameters for the two way and one way coupled models the dispersivity values estimated by seetha et al 2015 by fitting the tracer breakthrough curves of syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 are used in this study figs 5 and 6 show the comparisons of observed and the fitted breakthrough curves for the co transport of kaolinite and adenovirus and montmorillonite and adenovirus respectively at different flow rates it is clear from fig 5 that the two way coupled model could simulate the observed breakthrough curves for the co transport of kaolinite and adenovirus reasonably well and the performance of the one way coupled model is rather poor at all the flow rates the values of aic aiccand bic also indicate that two way coupled model is preferable over the one way coupled model table 2 syngouna et al 2017 found that the collision efficiency attachment rate coefficient is proportional to collision efficiency of clays and viruses was higher during co transport experiments than during their individual transport this is supported by the values of fitted parameters in table 2 for a two way coupled model which indicates that the kinetics of heteroaggregation and heteroaggregate deposition to the grain surface is irreversible detachment rate coefficient is zero whereas the deposition of clays and viruses to the grain surface is reversible during their individual transport syngouna et al 2017 also observed that the values of collision efficiency increased with increasing flow rate during the co transport studies this is in line with the estimated values of parameters obtained in this study using a two way coupled model for the co transport of kaolinite and adenovirus we have found that the rate coefficient of attachment of heteroaggregates to the grain surface increased with increasing flow rate table 2 this indicates that the kinetics of interaction of heteroaggregates with the grain surface controls kaolinite adenovirus co transport graphs shown in fig 6 and r2 values given in table 2 indicate that neither the two way coupled model nor the one way coupled model could satisfactorily fit the co transport data of montmorillonite and adenovirus at all flow rates except for the two way coupled model at 2 5 ml min further syngouna et al 2017 observed greater retention of adenovirus in the presence of montmorillonite than kaolinite the fitted values of k a and k a agg from our study shows similar values for kaolinite and montmorillonite at 2 5 ml min as the fit is poor for montmorillonite at other flow rates this is in agreement with the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo energy profiles for adenovirus interaction with kaolinite and montmorillonite which have similar values of primary and

are calculated using the hamaker constants for adenovirus water adenovirus and kaolinite water kaolinite chrysikopoulos et al 2017 kokkinos et al 2015 4 4 simulating experimental results of syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 studied the co transport of clay colloids kaolinite and montmorillonite and bacteriophages ms2 and φx174 in laboratory columns of 2 5 cm in diameter and 30 cm long packed with glass beads in our model clay colloids are colloid 1 and bacteriophages are colloid 2 the dry bulk density of the porous medium was 1 61 g cm3 and porosity was 0 42 the hydrodynamic diameters of kaolinite and montmorilonite were 842 85 125 85 nm and 1187 380 81 nm respectively the effective particle diameters of ms2 and φx174 were in the range of 24 26 nm and 25 27 nm respectively this study involved twelve co transport experiments kaolinite ms2 montmorillonite ms2 kaolinite φx174 and montmorillonite φx174 each at three different flow rates of 0 8 1 5 and 2 5 ml min each co transport experiment involved passing clay colloidal suspension and viral suspension simultaneously into the column for 3 pvs followed by flushing the column with ddh2o for 3pvs effluent samples were collected at regular intervals and analysed for total clay free virus and total mobile virus concentrations the deposition of clay colloids and viruses to the solid surface is described by two site and one site kinetic models respectively appendix b the parameters describing the deposition of viruses and clays to the grain surface during their individual transport are given in table 1 of seetha et al 2015 and are not reproduced here the deposition parameters estimated using two way and one way coupled models are given in table 3 figs 8 9 10 and 11 show the observed and fitted breakthrough curves of clays and viruses obtained by using one way and two way coupled models for the co transport of kaolinite ms2 montmorillonite ms2 kaolinite φx174 and montmorillonite φx174 respectively the two way coupled model fits the observed breakthrough curves reasonably well in most of the cases except for kaolinite data during kaolinite φx174 co transport at 0 8 and 2 5 ml min it is clear from figs 8 11 and table 3 that the one way coupled model could not fit the observed breakthrough curves of clay colloids in most of the experiments the above findings are in line with the values of aic aicc and bic which favours the two way coupled model table 3 seetha et al 2015 followed the procedure that was used by others sˇimunek et al 2006 vasiliadou and chrysikopoulos 2011 to fit the experimental data of syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 using a one way coupled model but that procedure is contradicting the physics of the one way coupled model which assumes that the transport properties of colloid 1 are not affected by the presence of colloid 2 on its surface the fitted curves and estimated parameter values for the one way coupled model given in this paper are different from those given in seetha et al 2015 for the experiments of syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 because of the more realistic fitting procedure we followed in this study table 3 shows that the rate coefficient of attachment of bacteriophages to clay particles obtained from the two way coupled model increased with flow rate for all co transport experiments syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 observed a greater value of collision efficiency of ms2 than φx174 to both clays which is attributed to the hydrophobic nature of ms2 based on the extended dlvo calculations chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2012 this is consistent with the values of k a estimated using a two way coupled model table 3 for most of the cases also syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 noticed that the retention of both viruses were more in the presence of kaolinite than montmorillonite due to more negative hydrophobic interaction energy for kaolinite than montmorillonite for both the viruses chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2012 this is in line with the estimated values of k a given in table 3 4 5 simulating the experimental results of georgopoulou et al 2020 georgopoulou et al 2020 studied the effect of go nanoparticles on the transport behaviour of e coli e faecalis and s aureus through saturated quartz sand by performing laboratory column experiments the column was 30 cm long and 2 5 cm in diameter the bulk density and porosity of the sand were 1 75 g cm3 and 0 39 respectively phosphate buffer solution of 2 mm ionic strength at neutral ph was used as the background solution the hydrodynamic diameters of e coli e faecalis s aureus and go nanoparticles were 1090 0 62 nm 1081 9 102 9 nm 729 9 85 9 nm and 546 3 43 4 nm respectively both individual and co transport experiments were conducted at a constant flow rate of 0 8 ml min individual transport experiments consisted of injecting 3 pvs of colloidal suspension of go nanoparticles or biocolloids into the column followed by flushing the column with colloid free background solution for 5 pvs each co transport experiment consisted of injecting 3 pvs of colloidal suspensions of go nanoparticles and biocolloids simultaneously into the column followed by flushing the column with colloid free background solution for 5 pvs the interaction of biocolloids with the grain surface is described using a first order kinetic model whereas the deposition of go nanoparticles onto the grain surface is described using a first order kinetic model with blocking appendix b the parameters describing the deposition of biocolloids to the grain surface during their individual transport and the inactivation in aqueous and solid phases as given in georgopoulou et al 2020 are used in our study fig 12 shows the observed and fitted breakthrough curves during the co transport of e coli go e faecalis go and s aureus go table 4 gives the values of fitted parameters the one way coupled model could not fit the breakthrough curves of e coli and e faecalis and its performance is poor as compared to the two way coupled model for the co transport of e coli go fig 12 a b and e faecalis go fig 12 c d this is supported by the model selection criteria aic aicc and bic which indicates that the performance of the two way coupled model is better than the one way coupled model table 4 fig 12e shows that neither the two way model nor the one way model could satisfactorily simulate the breakthrough curve of go nanoparticles during s aureus go co transport georgopoulou et al 2020 found that the presence of go nanoparticles increased biocolloid retention in the porous medium this is in line with the estimated values of parameters from the two way coupled model given in table 4 which shows that the attachment rate coefficient of heteroaggregation kinetics k a and the heteroaggregate deposition on to the grain surface k a agg are larger than the biocolloid attachment parameter during their individual transport k 1cs also georgopoulou et al 2020 found that e faecalis least affected the transport of go nanoparticles and go nanoparticle retention was largest in the presence of s aureus the estimated parameter values from the two way coupled model table 4 are consistent with this observation which shows the value of k a agg being smallest in the presence of e faecalis and largest in the presence of s aureus also the value of k a k d is smallest in the presence of e faecalis and the kinetics of heteroaggregation is irreversible in case of s aureus this is supported by the extended dlvo energy calculations given in georgopoulou et al 2020 which shows that go e faecalis interaction has the smallest secondary minimum and largest energy barrier and go s aureus has the largest secondary minimum depth and smallest energy barrier hence go nanoparticles will have less attachment to e faecalis compared to s aureus since e faecalis sand interaction has the least hydrophobic energy and largest energy barrier and s aureus sand has the largest secondary minimum depth and lowest energy barrier the heteroaggregates of go e faecalis and go s aureus may also behave similarly this implies that the deposition kinetics of heteroaggregates to the grain surface and kinetics of heteroaggregate formation play a dominant role in controlling the transport of go nanoparticles in the presence of biocolloids moreover georgopoulou et al 2020 observed from mass recovery data and the calculated collision efficiencies that in the presence of go nanoparticles e coli has the largest collision efficiency and hence the greatest affinity to adsorb to go nanoparticles and s aureus has the least affinity this is in line with the estimated values of parameters given in table 4 for a two way coupled model which indicates that the ratio of rate coefficients of heteroaggregation k a k d and heteroaggregate attachment rate coefficient to the solid surface k a agg for biocolloids being largest for e coli as compared to the corresponding rate coefficients during their individual transport k 1cs k 1sc there is not much difference in the values of k a agg and k 1cs for s aureus and hence its transport is least affected in the presence of go nanoparticles 5 discussions and conclusions experimental observations from literature show that during the concurrent transport of two different colloidal types the retention rates of both colloids are found to be different compared to when they undergo transport individually thus the underlying assumption of one way coupled models namely the transport of larger colloids not being affected by the presence of smaller colloids does not agree with observations this is supported by the results from this study which show that the one way coupled model is unable to satisfactorily simulate the observed breakthrough curves of two colloidal types for the co transport of clay virus clay nanoparticle and bacteria nanoparticle acceptable fitting of breakthrough curves of the one way coupled model to observations for both colloidal types could be achieved only by assigning different values of deposition parameters than those obtained from their individual transport as shown by seetha et al 2015 clearly this violates the assumption of the one way coupled model that the transport behaviour of larger colloid is unaffected by the presence of the smaller colloid attached to its surface the developed two way coupled model incorporating the first order heteroaggregation kinetics fits the observed breakthrough curves reasonably well for the co transport of kaolinite adenovirus kaolinite go kaolinite ms2 kaolinite φx174 montmorillonite ms2 montmorillonite φx174 e coli go and e faecalis go it is found that the kinetics of heteroaggregation and the deposition of heteroaggregates to the grain surface control the co transport of two different colloids there are two major difficulties with the fitting that we did first the data show a lot of scattering which makes any fitted curve unable to match much of the data another issue is that as we fit simultaneously the breakthrough curves of two different colloids it is difficult to get a satisfactory fitting for some cases for a two way coupled model the model selection criteria such as aic aicc and bic favours the two way coupled model over the one way coupled model for the experimental data considered in this study we found that the two way model is not capable of simulating the experimental results during the co transport of montmorillonite adenovirus and s aureus go the major limitation of the developed model is that it is applicable only to the cases in which the retention of both the colloidal types either increase or decrease during the co transport as compared to their individual transport behaviour the model output will be useful in predicting the travel distance of colloidal contaminants such as viruses bacteria and engineered nanoparticles in groundwater in the presence of natural colloids such as clays and bacteria this information in turn is essential to estimate the safe location of drinking water wells from the source of contamination

various forms of colloids and the interactions among colloids and with grain surface colloid 1 can exist in two different forms mobile colloids in aqueous phase and immobile colloids attached to grain surface colloid 2 can exist in four different forms free colloids in aqueous phase immobile colloids attached to grain surface attached to colloid 1 in aqueous phase and attached to colloid 1 present at grain surface the model assumes that the presence of colloid 2 attached onto the surface of colloid 1 does not affect the transport properties of colloid 1 and hence the transport equations of

1353,models for the co transport of two different colloids commonly assume a one way coupling this is because often a large colloid and small colloid are involved therefore they assume that the spread of smaller colloid is affected by the transport of larger colloids but not the other way around however a number of studies have shown that this assumption is not valid even for large and small colloids therefore in this study a two way coupled model is developed to simulate the co transport of two different colloids in porous media and their effect on each other we have considered the interactions of the two colloids with the grain surface kinetics of heteroaggregation of the two colloids and heteroaggregate deposition onto the grain surface we assumed a first order kinetic model to represent heteroaggregate formation and its deposition on the grain surface the model is evaluated by fitting the experimental data reported in four different papers from the literature on the co transport of clay colloids and viruses bacteria and graphene oxide nanoparticles and clay colloids and graphene oxide nanoparticles the model performance is compared with the commonly used one way coupled model the two way coupled model is found to satisfactorily simulate most of the experimental conditions reported in the above papers except for the co transport of montmorillonite adenovirus and staphylococcus aureus graphene oxide nanoparticles keywords co transport colloids porous media heteroaggregation two way coupled model 1 introduction predicting the transport behaviour of colloidal contaminants such as pathogenic microorganisms and engineered nanoparticles in the subsurface is essential for the assessment of groundwater contamination risks ron and johnson 2020 schijven and hassanizadeh 2002 schijven et al 2010 to estimate the safe distance of drinking water wells from potential contamination sources schijven et al 2006 to decide on the degree of treatment required before supplying the groundwater for drinking purposes schijven et al 1999 2000 and to remediate contaminated groundwater malakar and snow 2020 it is found that the release pathways of colloidal contaminants including point sources such as deep well injection for bioremediation and distributed sources e g rainfall events landfills irrigation activities have a significant impact on their fate and transport in the subsurface mahmoudi et al 2020 there are also colloids that do not really pose any groundwater quality threats but may act as carriers of contaminating colloids for example natural colloids such as clays are abundant in the subsurface and have been found to facilitate the transport of contaminants such as biocolloids and engineered nanoparticles cai et al 2014 vasiliadou and chrysikopoulos 2011 walshe et al 2010 so it is very important to study the co transport of two different colloids a number of experimental studies have investigated the co transport of multiple colloids in porous media including clay and bacteria vasiliadou and chrysikopoulos 2011 yang et al 2012 clay and viruses jin et al 2000 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 syngouna et al 2017 walshe et al 2010 clay and engineered nanoparticles bayat et al 2015 cai et al 2014 chrysikopoulos et al 2017 clay and plastic particles li et al 2020 silica nanoparticles and viruses qin et al 2020 bacteria and engineered nanoparticles cai et al 2016 georgopoulou et al 2020 viruses and engineered nanoparticles syngouna et al 2017 iron oxide particles and engineered nanoparticles wang et al 2021 plastic particles and engineered nanoparticles cai et al 2019 dong et al 2019 and a mixture of engineered nanoparticles cai et al 2013 kumari et al 2015 experimental results from these studies indicate that the transport behaviors of both colloids are different when they are co present as compared to their individual transport also the co presence of a different colloid can either increase or decrease the transport of bacteria viruses and engineered nanoparticles depending on the interactions of the two colloids with the grain surface competition between the two colloids to find deposition sites on the grain surface heteroaggregation of colloids in the aqueous phase and at the grain surface and deposition of heteroaggregates on the grain surface the experimental studies involving the co transport of micrometer and nanometer sized particles e g clay bacteria clay viruses clay engineered nanoparticles and bacteria engineered nanoparticles revealed a greater retention of both particles in porous media when they are co present together than their individual transport behaviour the mechanisms that have been proposed for the increased retention are the formation of heteroaggregates aggregates of two different colloids in the aqueous and solid phases and the co deposition of the two colloids to the grain surface chrysikopoulos et al 2017 georgopoulou et al 2020 li et al 2019 yang et al 2012 sotirelis and chrysikopoulos 2017 georgopoulou et al 2020 and vasiliadou and chrysikopoulos 2011 found from batch experiments that the heteroaggregation of graphene oxide nanoparticles kaolinite graphene oxide nanoparticles montmorillonite and pseudomonas putida kaolinite respectively can be described using a pseudo second order kinetic model also heteroaggregates e g iron oxide plastic particles nanoplastics fullerene micron sized plastic particles kaolinite and zno cuo are found to have different surface charges and hence may interact differently with the solid surface than the individual colloids dong et al 2019 li et al 2019 2020 parsai and kumar 2019 therefore it is important to account for the kinetics of heteroaggregation and its deposition on the grain surface to simulate the co transport of multiple colloids in porous media a one dimensional one way coupled mathematical model describing the co transport of clay particles and bacteria under saturated conditions was developed by vasiliadou and chrysikopoulos 2011 and was used by seetha et al 2015 to describe the co transport of viruses and clay colloids this model has been further extended to three dimensions by katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2014 2015 the above models assume that the presence of attached bacteria or viruses on the clay particle surface will not affect the transport behaviour of clay colloids this model does not account for the kinetics of heteroaggregate formation and does not distinguish between the interaction of clay colloids and clay bacteria heteroaggregate with the grain surface thus clay colloid transport equations were decoupled from the bacteria or virus transport equations this would imply that the individual clay colloids and heteroaggregates of clay bacteria or clay viruses should have the same transport behaviour and the values of attachment and detachment rate coefficients for clay colloids obtained from experiments with clay colloids only should be applicable in modelling co transport experiments however results of simulations by seetha et al 2015 showed that this is not the case for a satisfactory fit of co transport experimental data using one way coupled model they had to use significantly different values for attachment and detachment rate coefficients of clay colloids during co transport than the values obtained from clay colloids only transport experiments this means that transport behaviour of both clays and bacteria or viruses are different when they are co present as compared to their individual transport this implies that a two way coupled model describing the co transport of two different colloids is needed the objective of this study is to develop a 1d two way coupled model to simulate the co transport of two different colloids in saturated porous media the extension to three dimensions is trivial the model accounts for deposition of both colloids on the grain surface kinetics of heteroaggregation using a first order model and deposition of heteroaggregates onto the grain surface this is the first study where the co transport of two different colloids in porous media is modelled by accounting for the heteroaggregation kinetics the developed model is evaluated by fitting experimental data from four different studies reported in the literature the model performance is also compared with that of a simple one way coupled model 2 two way coupled mathematical model 2 1 model development in this study we consider the co transport of two different colloids fig 1 shows the various forms of colloids and the interactions among colloids and with grain surface here we have shown a large colloid colloid 1 and a small one colloid 2 because that is the case in many applications as well as in the four experimental studies that we have simulated here however the model developed here and governing equations that are presented below are valid for any size of colloids both colloids 1 and 2 can exist in free form in aqueous phase and as immobile colloids attached to solid surface in addition colloids 1 and 2 undergo heteroaggregation heteroaggregates exists in two different forms in mobile form in aqueous phase and in immobile form attached to solid surface assumptions involved in the model development are a the formation of the heteroaggregates is described using a first order reversible kinetic model b the rate coefficients for attachment of colloid 1 to colloid 2 is the same as that of colloid 2 to colloid 1 c the properties of heteroaggregates are different from that of individual colloids and d the deposition of heteroaggregates onto grain surface is described using a first order reversible kinetic model the governing equation for the transport of colloid 1 is given

colloid 2 respectively t in is the duration of input pulse for colloid 1 and colloid 2 and l is the length of the porous medium domain eqs 12 13 indicate a dirichlet boundary condition for the free form of colloids 1 and 2 at inlet eq 14 indicates a zero inlet concentration for the heteroaggregates in aqueous phase eq 15 indicates a neumann type boundary condition at the outlet for the mobile forms of colloids 1 and 2 the governing eqs 1 2 or 3 4 5 or 6 or 7 8 9 10 and 11 subject to the initial and boundary conditions are solved numerically using an alternating three step operator splitting approach seetha et al 2015 this numerical scheme involves splitting the governing equations into advection dispersion and reaction operators and then solving them sequentially for the first half of every time step the order of solution is then reversed in the second half of every time step the advection dispersion and reaction operators are solved using an explicit finite volume scheme with minmod limiter implicit finite difference method and fourth order runge kutta method respectively more details about the above numerical scheme are given in seetha et al 2015 3 one way coupled model the one way coupled model has been the most common approach to simulate the co transport of two different colloids in porous media this model assumes that the transport properties of colloid 1 are not affected by the presence of colloid 2 on its surface and does not account for heteroaggregation kinetics though this model is already available in the literature seetha et al 2015 vasiliadou and chrysikopoulos 2011 the governing equations are reproduced in the appendix eqs a1 to a5 to maintain the consistency in the notations throughout this paper 4 model evaluation the developed two way coupled model is evaluated by reproducing the observed behaviour in several sets of experiments reported in four publications chrysikopoulos et al 2017 georgopoulou et al 2020 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 syngouna et al 2017 these experiments involved studying the co transport of a micrometer sized colloid kaolinite montmorillonite escherichia coli e coli enterococcus faecalis e faecalis or staphylococcus aureus s aureus and a nanometer sized colloid graphene oxide go nanoparticles ms2 φx174 or adenovirus the general scheme of all column experiments was as follows first the dispersivity of the porous medium was determined by performing a tracer experiment then the transport of each colloid large or small was studied in separate experiments to understand their individual deposition behaviour onto the grain surface this was followed by co transport experiments involving simultaneous injection of both the micrometer and nanometer sized colloids into the column 4 1 description of fitting procedure the procedure for fitting the experimental data with the one way and two way coupled models along with the objective function and the number of calibrated parameters in each step is given in the form of a flow chart in fig 2 for fitting the experimental data first the value of dispersivity of the porous medium is estimated by fitting the tracer breakthrough curve with 1d advection dispersion equation it is known that colloid dispersivity is size dependent and can be different from tracer dispersivity chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 keller et al 2004 nevertheless except in the case of georgopoulou et al 2020 we assume colloids dispersivity to be the same as the tracer dispersivity in order to reduce the number of fitted parameters also all colloids are assumed to travel at the same velocity as the pore water ofcourse the correct procedure would have been to estimate the values of velocity and dispersivity along with the deposition parameters for each colloid by fitting colloid breakthrough curve with advection dispersion sorption equation however we find that the available experimental data do not contain sufficient information to warrant estimating so many parameters independently the aforementioned procedure for estimating dispersivity was the same for both one way and two way models next for the one way coupled model breakthrough curves of colloid 1 and colloid 2 from the individual transport experiments are fitted with advection dispersion equation with one site or two site kinetic model to estimate the values of attachment and detachment rate coefficients for colloid 1 to the grain surface k 1cs and k 1sc or k 11cs k 11sc and k 12cs and for colloid 2 k 2cs and k 2sc or k 2cs k 2sc and s 2max or k 21cs k 21sc and k 22cs the governing equations for the individual transport of colloid 1 and colloid 2 are given in appendix b in line with the underlying assumption of one way coupled model parameter values for individual particles of both colloid 1 and colloid 2 either in aqueous phase or adsorbed are assumed to remain unchanged when simulating co transport experiments then the breakthrough curve of colloid 2 from the co transport experiments is fitted to estimate the values of parameters describing the interaction of colloid 2 with colloid 1 k a and k d where k a and k d are the rate coefficients for attachment and detachment of colloid 2 to colloid 1 in all four papers used for model evaluation the effluent breakthrough curves were reported in terms of the total mobile concentration of colloid 1 and colloid 2 chrysikopoulos et al 2017 georgopoulou et al 2020 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 syngouna et al 2017 in the one way coupled model this would correspond to c 1 and c 2 s m c 1 respectively in addition syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 also reported the breakthrough concentration of colloid 2 alone in the free form c 2 next we explain the step by step procedure for fitting the experimental data for the co transport of two different colloids with the two way coupled model the estimation of dispersivity of porous medium and the attachment and detachment rate coefficients of colloid 1 and colloid 2 to the grain surface are the same as explained in the previous paragraph after knowing the values of individual deposition parameters of colloid 1 and colloid 2 breakthrough curves of colloid 1 and colloid 2 from the co transport experiments are fitted with eqs 1 11 to estimate the values of parameters describing heteroaggregation kinetics k a and k d and heteroaggregate interaction with the grain surface k a agg and k d agg in our model the total mobile concentrations of colloid 1 and colloid 2 would correspond to c 1 1 s m c 3 and c 2 s m c 3 respectively and the free form of colloid 2 would correspond to c 2 we used levenberg marquardt algorithm to find the best fit between the observed and the modelled breakthrough curves for colloid 1 and colloid 2 the performance of the one way and two way coupled models is compared quantitatively using information theoretic criteria aic and aicc and bayesian criteria bic which serve as model selection criteria ye et al 2008 these criteria favour the model which reproduces the experimental data closely and having the least number of fitting parameters the model with the lowest value of a given criterion is the preferred model aic aicc and bicare calculated as ye et al 2008 16 aic n obs ln σ 2 2 p 17 aicc n obs ln σ 2 2 p 2 n n 1 n obs n 1 18 bic n obs ln σ 2 p ln n obs where n obs is the number of observations σ 2 is the sum of squared residuals divided by the number of observations p is the number of model parameters estimated and n p 1 4 2 simulating experimental results of chrysikopoulos et al 2017 chrysikopoulos et al 2017 conducted laboratory column experiments to study the influence of ph and ionic strength on the co transport of go nanoparticles and kaolinite colloids under saturated conditions obviously in our model kaolinite is colloid 1 and go nanoparticles are colloid 2 two types of porous media were used in this study glass beads and quartz sand the column was 30 cm long with a diameter of 2 5 cm the porosity and bulk density of glass beads were 0 42 and 1 68 g cm3 respectively the respective values for quartz sand were 0 39 and 1 7 g cm3 the hydrodynamic diameters of go nanoparticles and kaolinite were in the range of 413 654 nm and 513 709 nm respectively experiments were conducted at a flow rate of 1 5 ml min and at three different values of ph 4 7 10 and ionic strength 7 12 27 mm the inlet concentrations of kaolinite and go nanoparticles were 50 mg l and 5 mg l respectively each experiment consisted of injecting appropriate colloidal suspensions kaolinite or go nanoparticles or simultaneous injection of kaolinite and go nanoparticles for 3 pore volumes pvs followed by flushing the column with colloid free background solution for 2 pvs all experiments were conducted at room temperature more details about the experiments are given in chrysikopoulos et al 2017 chrysikopoulos et al 2017 observed greater retention and larger collision efficiency of both go nanoparticles and kaolinite during their co transport than during their individual transport the deposition of kaolinite and go nanoparticles to the grain surface is described using a two site kinetic model appendix b the estimated values of the various parameters for the two way and one way coupled models are given in table 1 fig 3 compares the observed and fitted breakthrough curves of kaolinite and go nanoparticles during their co transport through columns packed with glass beads at various ph and ionic strength values of the background solution the simulated breakthrough curves from the two way coupled model matches the observed data reasonably well for all cases except for the breakthrough curve of go nanoparticles at ph 4 and ionic strength 7 mm through glass bead packed columns fig 3b fig 4 compares the observed and fitted breakthrough curves of kaolinite and go nanoparticles during their co transport through columns packed with quartz sand at ph 7 and ionic strength 7 mm the one way coupled model could not simulate the observed breakthrough curves of kaolinite for any of the co transport experiments figs 3 and 4 and table 1 the values of aic aicc and bic for the two way coupled model are smaller than the one way coupled model which indicates that the latter is the most preferred model chrysikopoulos et al 2017 observed from the co transport experimental data that go nanoparticle retention inside porous medium increased with decreasing ph due to the possible increase in heteroaggregation this is supported by the experimental results of sotirelis and chrysikopoulos 2017 who observed from batch experiments a greater attachment of go particles onto kaolinite colloids with decreasing ph this is due to less negative surface potential of kaolinite colloids and go nanoparticles with decreasing ph which leads to greater attraction between them as a result of deeper secondary minimum this agrees with the estimated parameters for the two way coupled model given in table 1 which shows that the ratio of attachment and detachment rate coefficients of go nanoparticles to kaolinite colloids increases with decreasing ph further table 1 shows that the attachment rate coefficient of heteroaggregates to the grain surface increases with decreasing ph since the surface potentials of both go nanoparticles and kaolinite become less negative with decreasing ph the surface potential of heteroaggregates may also decrease resulting in more attachment to the grain surfaces also table 1 indicates that the attachment of go nanoparticles to kaolinite increased slightly with increasing ionic strength this is in line with the observations of sotirelis and chrysikopoulos 2017 who found from batch experiments that the mass of go nanoparticles attached to kaolinite colloids increased with ionic strength due to less negative zeta potentials of go nanoparticles and kaolinite with increasing ionic strength and thus less repulsion between them the attachment rate coefficient of heteroaggregates to the grain surface and go nanoparticle attachment to kaolinite is found to be larger for sand than for glass beads table 1 this is in agreement with the observations of chrysikopoulos et al 2017 who found greater retention and larger collision efficiency of go nanoparticles in columns packed with quartz sand than glass beads though the zeta potential of the sand and the energy profiles for go nanoparticle quartz sand and kaolinite quartz sand are similar to those in the presence of glass beads chrysikopoulos et al 2017 the greater retention of go nanoparticles on sand may be due to the heterogeneity of the sand surface as compared to the glass beads 4 3 simulating experimental results of syngouna et al 2017 syngouna et al 2017 conducted experiments to study the co transport of clay colloids kaolinite and montmorillonite and human adenovirus through laboratory columns in our model they are colloid 1 and colloid 2 respectively columns of 2 5 cm in diameter and 30 cm in length were packed with glass beads under saturated conditions the dry bulk density of the porous medium was 2 65 g cm3 and porosity was 0 42 sterile dnase i reaction solution was used as the background solution the size of kaolinite particles was in the range of 0 2 1 μm and the average size of montmorillonite particles was 0 5 μm adenovirus size is in the range of 65 85 nm two sets of experiments were performed in this study the first set of experiments involved studying the individual transport behaviour of kaolinite montmorillonite and adenovirus and the second set involved studying the co transport behaviour of clay colloids and adenovirus each co transport experiment involved passing clay and adenovirus suspension simultaneously for 3 pvs through the column followed by flushing the column with 3pvs of colloid free background solution a total of six experiments were reported in this study for the co transport of kaolinite adenovirus and montmorillonite adenovirus at three different flow rates of 0 8 1 5 and 2 5 ml min the effluent total suspended virus concentration and the effluent total clay concentration were measured using qpcr and uv vis spectrophotometer respectively more details about the experimental protocol are available in syngouna et al 2017 the influent concentrations of kaolinite montmorillonite and adenovirus for the various experiments are given in table 1 of syngouna et al 2017 syngouna et al 2017 observed higher retention of both adenovirus and clay colloids when they were co present than during their individual transport due to the formation of large clay virus heteroaggregates that clogged the pores and the attachment of heteroaggregates to the grain surface the interactions of kaolinite montmorillonite and adenovirus with the grain surface are described using a two site kinetic model appendix b the inactivation of adenovirus is neglected in our model table 2 gives the fitted values of parameters for the two way and one way coupled models the dispersivity values estimated by seetha et al 2015 by fitting the tracer breakthrough curves of syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 are used in this study figs 5 and 6 show the comparisons of observed and the fitted breakthrough curves for the co transport of kaolinite and adenovirus and montmorillonite and adenovirus respectively at different flow rates it is clear from fig 5 that the two way coupled model could simulate the observed breakthrough curves for the co transport of kaolinite and adenovirus reasonably well and the performance of the one way coupled model is rather poor at all the flow rates the values of aic aiccand bic also indicate that two way coupled model is preferable over the one way coupled model table 2 syngouna et al 2017 found that the collision efficiency attachment rate coefficient is proportional to collision efficiency of clays and viruses was higher during co transport experiments than during their individual transport this is supported by the values of fitted parameters in table 2 for a two way coupled model which indicates that the kinetics of heteroaggregation and heteroaggregate deposition to the grain surface is irreversible detachment rate coefficient is zero whereas the deposition of clays and viruses to the grain surface is reversible during their individual transport syngouna et al 2017 also observed that the values of collision efficiency increased with increasing flow rate during the co transport studies this is in line with the estimated values of parameters obtained in this study using a two way coupled model for the co transport of kaolinite and adenovirus we have found that the rate coefficient of attachment of heteroaggregates to the grain surface increased with increasing flow rate table 2 this indicates that the kinetics of interaction of heteroaggregates with the grain surface controls kaolinite adenovirus co transport graphs shown in fig 6 and r2 values given in table 2 indicate that neither the two way coupled model nor the one way coupled model could satisfactorily fit the co transport data of montmorillonite and adenovirus at all flow rates except for the two way coupled model at 2 5 ml min further syngouna et al 2017 observed greater retention of adenovirus in the presence of montmorillonite than kaolinite the fitted values of k a and k a agg from our study shows similar values for kaolinite and montmorillonite at 2 5 ml min as the fit is poor for montmorillonite at other flow rates this is in agreement with the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo energy profiles for adenovirus interaction with kaolinite and montmorillonite which have similar values of primary and secondary minima depth for both kaolinite and montmorillonite fig 7 the dlvo energy profile is calculated as the sum of electric double layer energy hogg et al 1966 london van der waals energy gregory 1981 and born repulsion energy ruckenstein and prieve 1976 by assuming a sphere plate interaction between adenovirus and clay colloids the values of various parameters used in the calculation are particle radius of adenovirus 37 5 nm ionic strength 1 4 mm surface potential 26 03 mv kaolinite 20 5 mv montmorillonite and 21 78 mv adenovirus temperature 298 k hamaker constant 3 29 10 20 j adenovirus water kaolinite 2 78 10 20 j adenovirus water montmorillonite and dielectric constant of water 78 4 the hamaker constants for adenovirus water kaolinite and adenovirus water montmorillonite are calculated using the hamaker constants for adenovirus water adenovirus and kaolinite water kaolinite chrysikopoulos et al 2017 kokkinos et al 2015 4 4 simulating experimental results of syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 studied the co transport of clay colloids kaolinite and montmorillonite and bacteriophages ms2 and φx174 in laboratory columns of 2 5 cm in diameter and 30 cm long packed with glass beads in our model clay colloids are colloid 1 and bacteriophages are colloid 2 the dry bulk density of the porous medium was 1 61 g cm3 and porosity was 0 42 the hydrodynamic diameters of kaolinite and montmorilonite were 842 85 125 85 nm and 1187 380 81 nm respectively the effective particle diameters of ms2 and φx174 were in the range of 24 26 nm and 25 27 nm respectively this study involved twelve co transport experiments kaolinite ms2 montmorillonite ms2 kaolinite φx174 and montmorillonite φx174 each at three different flow rates of 0 8 1 5 and 2 5 ml min each co transport experiment involved passing clay colloidal suspension and viral suspension simultaneously into the column for 3 pvs followed by flushing the column with ddh2o for 3pvs effluent samples were collected at regular intervals and analysed for total clay free virus and total mobile virus concentrations the deposition of clay colloids and viruses to the solid surface is described by two site and one site kinetic models respectively appendix b the parameters describing the deposition of viruses and clays to the grain surface during their individual transport are given in table 1 of seetha et al 2015 and are not reproduced here the deposition parameters estimated using two way and one way coupled models are given in table 3 figs 8 9 10 and 11 show the observed and fitted breakthrough curves of clays and viruses obtained by using one way and two way coupled models for the co transport of kaolinite ms2 montmorillonite ms2 kaolinite φx174 and montmorillonite φx174 respectively the two way coupled model fits the observed breakthrough curves reasonably well in most of the cases except for kaolinite data during kaolinite φx174 co transport at 0 8 and 2 5 ml min it is clear from figs 8 11 and table 3 that the one way coupled model could not fit the observed breakthrough curves of clay colloids in most of the experiments the above findings are in line with the values of aic aicc and bic which favours the two way coupled model table 3 seetha et al 2015 followed the procedure that was used by others sˇimunek et al 2006 vasiliadou and chrysikopoulos 2011 to fit the experimental data of syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 using a one way coupled model but that procedure is contradicting the physics of the one way coupled model which assumes that the transport properties of colloid 1 are not affected by the presence of colloid 2 on its surface the fitted curves and estimated parameter values for the one way coupled model given in this paper are different from those given in seetha et al 2015 for the experiments of syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 because of the more realistic fitting procedure we followed in this study table 3 shows that the rate coefficient of attachment of bacteriophages to clay particles obtained from the two way coupled model increased with flow rate for all co transport experiments syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 observed a greater value of collision efficiency of ms2 than φx174 to both clays which is attributed to the hydrophobic nature of ms2 based on the extended dlvo calculations chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2012 this is consistent with the values of k a estimated using a two way coupled model table 3 for most of the cases also syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 noticed that the retention of both viruses were more in the presence of kaolinite than montmorillonite due to more negative hydrophobic interaction energy for kaolinite than montmorillonite for both the viruses chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2012 this is in line with the estimated values of k a given in table 3 4 5 simulating the experimental results of georgopoulou et al 2020 georgopoulou et al 2020 studied the effect of go nanoparticles on the transport behaviour of e coli e faecalis and s aureus through saturated quartz sand by performing laboratory column experiments the column was 30 cm long and 2 5 cm in diameter the bulk density and porosity of the sand were 1 75 g cm3 and 0 39 respectively phosphate buffer solution of 2 mm ionic strength at neutral ph was used as the background solution the hydrodynamic diameters of e coli e faecalis s aureus and go nanoparticles were 1090 0 62 nm 1081 9 102 9 nm 729 9 85 9 nm and 546 3 43 4 nm respectively both individual and co transport experiments were conducted at a constant flow rate of 0 8 ml min individual transport experiments consisted of injecting 3 pvs of colloidal suspension of go nanoparticles or biocolloids into the column followed by flushing the column with colloid free background solution for 5 pvs each co transport experiment consisted of injecting 3 pvs of colloidal suspensions of go nanoparticles and biocolloids simultaneously into the column followed by flushing the column with colloid free background solution for 5 pvs the interaction of biocolloids with the grain surface is described using a first order kinetic model whereas the deposition of go nanoparticles onto the grain surface is described using a first order kinetic model with blocking appendix b the parameters describing the deposition of biocolloids to the grain surface during their individual transport and the inactivation in aqueous and solid phases as given in georgopoulou et al 2020 are used in our study fig 12 shows the observed and fitted breakthrough curves during the co transport of e coli go e faecalis go and s aureus go table 4 gives the values of fitted parameters the one way coupled model could not fit the breakthrough curves of e coli and e faecalis and its performance is poor as compared to the two way coupled model for the co transport of e coli go fig 12 a b and e faecalis go fig 12 c d this is supported by the model selection criteria aic aicc and bic which indicates that the performance of the two way coupled model is better than the one way coupled model table 4 fig 12e shows that neither the two way model nor the one way model could satisfactorily simulate the breakthrough curve of go nanoparticles during s aureus go co transport georgopoulou et al 2020 found that the presence of go nanoparticles increased biocolloid retention in the porous medium this is in line with the estimated values of parameters from the two way coupled model given in table 4 which shows that the attachment rate coefficient of heteroaggregation kinetics k a and the heteroaggregate deposition on to the grain surface k a agg are larger than the biocolloid attachment parameter during their individual transport k 1cs also georgopoulou et al 2020 found that e faecalis least affected the transport of go nanoparticles and go nanoparticle retention was largest in the presence of s aureus the estimated parameter values from the two way coupled model table 4 are consistent with this observation which shows the value of k a agg being smallest in the presence of e faecalis and largest in the presence of s aureus also the value of k a k d is smallest in the presence of e faecalis and the kinetics of heteroaggregation is irreversible in case of s aureus this is supported by the extended dlvo energy calculations given in georgopoulou et al 2020 which shows that go e faecalis interaction has the smallest secondary minimum and largest energy barrier and go s aureus has the largest secondary minimum depth and smallest energy barrier hence go nanoparticles will have less attachment to e faecalis compared to s aureus since e faecalis sand interaction has the least hydrophobic energy and largest energy barrier and s aureus sand has the largest secondary minimum depth and lowest energy barrier the heteroaggregates of go e faecalis and go s aureus may also behave similarly this implies that the deposition kinetics of heteroaggregates to the grain surface and kinetics of heteroaggregate formation play a dominant role in controlling the transport of go nanoparticles in the presence of biocolloids moreover georgopoulou et al 2020 observed from mass recovery data and the calculated collision efficiencies that in the presence of go nanoparticles e coli has the largest collision efficiency and hence the greatest affinity to adsorb to go nanoparticles and s aureus has the least affinity this is in line with the estimated values of parameters given in table 4 for a two way coupled model which indicates that the ratio of rate coefficients of heteroaggregation k a k d and heteroaggregate attachment rate coefficient to the solid surface k a agg for biocolloids being largest for e coli as compared to the corresponding rate coefficients during their individual transport k 1cs k 1sc there is not much difference in the values of k a agg and k 1cs for s aureus and hence its transport is least affected in the presence of go nanoparticles 5 discussions and conclusions experimental observations from literature show that during the concurrent transport of two different colloidal types the retention rates of both colloids are found to be different compared to when they undergo transport individually thus the underlying assumption of one way coupled models namely the transport of larger colloids not being affected by the presence of smaller colloids does not agree with observations this is supported by the results from this study which show that the one way coupled model is unable to satisfactorily simulate the observed breakthrough curves of two colloidal types for the co transport of clay virus clay nanoparticle and bacteria nanoparticle acceptable fitting of breakthrough curves of the one way coupled model to observations for both colloidal types could be achieved only by assigning different values of deposition parameters than those obtained from their individual transport as shown by seetha et al 2015 clearly this violates the assumption of the one way coupled model that the transport behaviour of larger colloid is unaffected by the presence of the smaller colloid attached to its surface the developed two way coupled model incorporating the first order heteroaggregation kinetics fits the observed breakthrough curves reasonably well for the co transport of kaolinite adenovirus kaolinite go kaolinite ms2 kaolinite φx174 montmorillonite ms2 montmorillonite φx174 e coli go and e faecalis go it is found that the kinetics of heteroaggregation and the deposition of heteroaggregates to the grain surface control the co transport of two different colloids there are two major difficulties with the fitting that we did first the data show a lot of scattering which makes any fitted curve unable to match much of the data another issue is that as we fit simultaneously the breakthrough curves of two different colloids it is difficult to get a satisfactory fitting for some cases for a two way coupled model the model selection criteria such as aic aicc and bic favours the two way coupled model over the one way coupled model for the experimental data considered in this study we found that the two way model is not capable of simulating the experimental results during the co transport of montmorillonite adenovirus and s aureus go the major limitation of the developed model is that it is applicable only to the cases in which the retention of both the colloidal types either increase or decrease during the co transport as compared to their individual transport behaviour the model output will be useful in predicting the travel distance of colloidal contaminants such as viruses bacteria and engineered nanoparticles in groundwater in the presence of natural colloids such as clays and bacteria this information in turn is essential to estimate the safe location of drinking water wells from the source of contamination

1354,the application of electrokinetic techniques in porous media has great potential to enhance mass transfer rates and thus to mobilize contaminants and effectively deliver reactants and amendments however the transport mechanisms induced by the application of an external electric field are complex and entail the coupling of physical chemical and electrostatic processes in this study we focus on electromigration and we provide experimental evidence of the impact of compound specific properties such as the aqueous diffusivity and the valence of charged species on the macroscopic electrokinetic transport we performed a series of multidimensional experiments considering the displacement of three different tracer plumes i e permanganate allura red and new coccine in different background electrolyte solutions the outcomes of the experiments clearly show that both the compound specific diffusivity and the charge of the injected and resident ions impact the transport of the selected color tracer plumes whose evolution was monitored with image analysis the investigated experimental scenarios led to distinct plume behavior characterized by different mass distribution average displacement velocities longitudinal and lateral plume spreading shape of the invading and receding fronts as well as dilution of the injected solutes a numerical simulator based on the nernst planck poisson equations and on aqueous speciation reactions in the pore water allowed us to quantitatively interpret the experimental results to capture the observed patterns of plume evolution and to illuminate the coupling between the governing physico chemical mechanisms and the controlling role of small scale compound specific and electrostatic properties finally the model was also extended to a typical configuration of in situ electrokinetic remediation of contaminated groundwater to show the impact of such mechanisms at larger scale keywords electrokinetic transport electromigration charge interactions multicomponent ionic transport aqueous diffusivity reactive transport modeling 1 introduction understanding the mechanisms of transport in groundwater is key to predict the fate of contaminants and the evolution of groundwater quality as well as to design successful in situ remediation approaches such understanding is challenged by the inherent complexity of transport processes in porous media the presence of mass transfer limitations the interaction between solutes within the pore water and at solid solution interfaces the coupling of transport with a number of chemical and biological reactions the inaccessibility and multi scale heterogeneity of subsurface formations detailed studies using different experimental and modeling approaches investigated natural transport in groundwater flow systems from pore to field scales an important finding highlighted in such investigation was the importance of small scale processes such as compound specific diffusion and charge interactions for macroscopic transport of solutes in groundwater and the propagation of their effects to larger scales muniruzzaman and rolle 2021 rolle et al 2013a another aspect that has been increasingly recognized is the consideration of dimensionality effects and the advantage of investigating transport processes in multidimensional systems to fully appreciate the contribution of small scale mass transfer limitations to mixing and mixing controlled reactions in porous media e g cirpka et al 2012 cirpka et al 2015 heyman et al 2020 hochstetler et al 2013 ye et al 2015a ye et al 2015b yoon et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 electrokinetic ek transport processes are induced by the application of a low intensity electric field in a porous medium this is typically done with a low voltage direct current applied between at least two electrodes acar and alshawabkeh 1993 reddy et al 2003 reddy and cameselle 2009 considering transport of solute species the mass transfer mechanisms resulting from the application of an electric field are electromigration which consists in the displacement of charged species towards the electrodes of opposite polarity and electroosmosis which is the movement of water with ions in the electrical double layer on the surface of solid grains ek transport processes have received increasing attention for their application for in situ soil and groundwater remediation due to their potential of providing considerable mass transfer rates also in low permeability porous media where most of the in situ remediation approaches are not applicable or severely challenged electrokinetic remediation approaches have been proposed for different purposes including the mobilization and removal of organic and inorganic contaminants e g kim et al 2009

low permeability matrices where mass transfer is limited to diffusive processes jin et al 2014 yang et al 2017 leading to persistent contamination parker et al 2008 however the application of electric fields to induce electrokinetic transport has also a large and mostly unexplored potential in permeable porous media another aspect that is not typically considered in the investigation of electrokinetic processes is the system dimensionality and its impact on transport and mixing of the solutions delivered by electrokinetics with a few exceptions e g reynolds et al 2008 gill et al 2016 gill et al 2021 most ek transport studies have been performed in 1 d columns or with boundary conditions transforming multidimensional setups into 1 d equivalent systems and preventing the investigation of multidimensional spreading and dilution of injected plumes as well as of mixing and mixing controlled reactions with resident pore water solutions in permeable porous media ek transport mechanisms such as electromigration are of great interest since they can considerably increase mixing rates and provide effective mixing enhancement which is highly desired to overcome mass transfer limitations kitanidis and mccarty 2012 rolle and le borgne 2019 valocchi et al 2019 the latter are ubiquitous under natural groundwater transport and often represent the bottleneck of contaminant degradation since they restrict mixing and mixing controlled reactions to very small fringes at the boundaries of groundwater plumes anneser et al 2008 bauer et al 2009 prommer et al 2009 rolle et al 2009 in a recent study on ek transport we have shown that electromigration induced by the establishment of electric potential gradients can be considerably more effective to enhance mixing and mixing controlled degradation than an equivalent system undergoing natural groundwater flow and advective dispersive transport sprocati et al 2021 in that investigation we have also shown the effects of the concentration of a background electrolyte on conservative and reactive transport during electrokinetics in this study we focus on the compound specific properties of injected tracers and background electrolyte solutions and explore their impact on transport by electromigration with a series of multidimensional ek experiments we consider anionic tracers with different charges and aqueous diffusion coefficients as well as different buffer solutions in the background groundwater such experiments allow us to explore the effects of compound specific properties of the different tracers on their displacement velocity concentration distribution and plume dilution in the porous domain furthermore we assess the impact of the compound specific properties of the different dominant ions in the background electrolyte solutions and show that their charge and aqueous diffusivity control the transport of the injected tracers the delivered concentrations in the porous medium the shape of the concentration profiles and the characteristic propagation of the front and tail of the injected tracer plumes we use a process based reactive transport modeling approach to quantitatively interpret the experimental results the multidimensional model is based on a nernst planck poisson formulation that allows capturing the electrostatic interactions between the injected and resident charged species in the porous medium we compare the outcomes of the simulations with the experimental observations and we use the validated model to explore the impact of ion valences and diffusivities on a simple electrokinetic remediation setup at the larger field scale 2 experimental setup the electrokinetic transport experiments were performed is a vertical quasi two dimensional

analysis was performed with a calibration procedure translating the color intensity of the dye tracers into concentration values details about the experimental setup and image analysis are provided in the supplementary material the tracers selected to perform the different electrokinetic transport experiments were permanganate sigma aldrich germany which has a purple color and two food colorants allura red sigma aldrich germany and new coccine sigma aldrich germany characterized by a red color these tracers are all negatively charged and due to the electric voltage applied across the porous medium they are displaced towards the anode by electromigration they have different valence and charge in solution permanganate 1 allura red 2 and new coccine 3 furthermore these tracers have different aqueous diffusion coefficients with permanganate being the most mobile ion d aq 1 50 10 9 m2 s whereas allura red and new coccine have considerably smaller diffusivity d aq 5 46 10 10 m2 s and d aq 4 06 10 10 m2 s respectively four different experimental scenarios were investigated to explore the impact of compound specific and charge properties on electrokinetic transport the experiments considered the injection of the selected tracers and different pore water electrolytes consisting of bicarbonate carbonate bicarbonate and phosphate buffers table 1 reports the list of experimental scenarios and the concentration of the tracer and background electrolyte solutions scenario 1 consists of the same concentration of the tracer and background solutions where the latter is a buffer with the monovalent bicarbonate ion hco3 as the main anion in scenario 2 a carbonate bicarbonate buffer was used as a background electrolyte solution where the dominant anion co3 2 has a multivalent charge 2 scenario 3 considers a phosphate buffer with h2po4 as major anion finally scenario 4 considers the same bicarbonate dominated buffer as in scenario 1 however the concentration of

diffusion j i dif and the electromigation j i mig fluxes in presence of an applied electric field the electromigration flux is the dominant term and it is several orders of magnitude higher than the diffusive flux it is important to note that j i mig depends on the electric potential gradient as well as on compound specific properties of the charged species in the pore water such as their aqueous diffusion coefficient d i and their charge z i an accurate solution of multicomponent transport problems requires the consideration of the coulombic interactions between charged species both for natural groundwater transport appelo and wersin 2007 muniruzzaman et al 2014 muniruzzaman and rolle 2019 and under the application of an electric field krabbenhøft and krabbenhøft 2008 lópez vizcaíno

1968 sastre and santaballa 1989 and the solution must be electrostatically neutral in many porous media applications the conductivity of the pore water is dominant newman and thomas alyea 2004 and the

mobility and charge of the different ionic species changes in σ e induce spatial and temporal variations of the current density and the electric potential gradient which conversely impact the development of electromigration fluxes and the distribution of ionic species in the system 3 2 numerical model process based numerical simulations of electrokinetic transport were performed with the code np phreeqc ek sprocati et al 2019 this simulator is a coupling between comsol multiphysics used to solve the nernst planck poisson equations in multidimensional domains and the geochemical code phreeqcrm parkhurst and wissmeier 2015 allowing the description of a wide range of equilibrium and kinetically controlled reactions the approach is based on a sequential non iterative coupling between the transport simulator and phreeqcrm rolle et al 2018 simulations were performed for all experimental scenarios and for a field scale setup describing electrokinetic delivery of tracers in an electrode doublet configuration at the laboratory scale the model domain was a rectangular area with size 28 cm 15 cm representing the saturated porous medium in the ek experiments the 2 d domain was discretized into 13 400 triangular elements and dirichlet boundary conditions were set for the concentration at the sides of the domain with concentrations equal to the background electrolyte for each scenario considered the values of the concentrations were obtained through the evaluation of aqueous speciation reactions of the different species in the solution overall multicomponent ionic transport of 16 charged species was simulated and the diffusion coefficient of each species a t 22 c is provided in table 2 the injection of the tracer was simulated considering an initial circular zone of radius 2 15 cm the electric potential at the boundaries was set to the measured values during the experiments table s1 electrolysis reactions were not included in the numerical simulations due to the recirculation system and the large volume of the reservoirs employed to buffer such electrode reactions and to the use of the buffer solutions as electrolytes which allowed minimizing the effects of ph variations in the domain the tortuosity of the porous medium was considered as fitting parameter and was adjusted to fit the simulated longitudinal concentration profiles to the experimental observations a narrow range of tortuosity values 1 30 1 43 was obtained in the evaluation of all performed experiments 4 results and discussion here we show the results of the ek transport experiments and their model based interpretation for scenarios 1 3 the outcomes of scenario 4 with equal conductivity between the injected solutions and the background pore water electrolytes are reported in the supplementary material 4 1 scenario 1 in these experiments the three differently charged tracers permanganate 1 allura red 2 and new coccine 3 were transported by electromigration in a porous medium with bicarbonate as dominant anion in the pore water the transport of the color tracer plumes was recorded over time and successive images for five different time steps 0 min 30 min 60 min 90 min and 120 min are presented for all three tracers in fig 2 the applied electric field induces the displacement of the negatively charged tracers towards the anode on the right side of the domain the observations show different evolution and shapes of the color plumes the permanganate plume is smaller has a smooth advancing front whereas the solute mass appears to be preferentially located higher concentrations in the left portion of the plume the electromigration of allura red and new coccine results in more spread and symmetric plumes compared to the observed permanganate distribution also the average velocities are different in the three experiments the center of mass of the permanganate plume moves about 14 cm in 120 min 7 cm h whereas the displacement of the multivalent tracers is slower covering 12 5 cm and 12 cm in the same time and resulting in average velocities of 6 5 cm h and 6 cm h for allura red and new coccine respectively the computed 2 d concentration maps of fig 3 show the outcomes of the numerical simulations the results of the nernst planck poisson simulations can reproduce the patterns of concentration distribution plume shape and displacement observed in the multidimensional electrokinetic experiments a direct comparison between the experimental and modeling results is presented in fig 4 showing the observed and simulated concentration profiles along the longitudinal axis of the plumes here the effects of compound specific properties of the three considered tracers and their impact on the mass distribution are evident the permanganate profiles are asymmetric and their skewness increases as ek transport progresses this behavior can be ascribed to the main anions in the system the injected mno4 and the resident hco3 both are monovalent and undergo displacement by electromigration towards the anode however the higher aqueous diffusivity of permanganate 1 50 10 9 m2 s compared to bicarbonate 1 09 10 9 m2 s causes the former moving faster and resulting in a spread front allura red has a smaller diffusivity 5 46 10 10 m2 s than bicarbonate which would result in the development of a sharp front yet this does not happen due to the bivalent charge of this anionic tracer that contributes to increase its displacement by electromigration eq 2 in this case the effect of the tracer diffusivity and its charge compensate and result in a displacement by electromigration very similar to the bicarbonate ion in the background electrolyte thus leading to a symmetric tracer plume similar effects are observed for new coccine which has an even smaller aqueous diffusion coefficient 4 06 10 10 m2 s but has a higher trivalent negative charge the net effect is still a slightly higher displacement of new coccine with respect to bicarbonate which causes minor spreading and asymmetry in the observed plumes the electroneutrality constraint and the different conductivities of the injected and resident solutions also cause limitation to mass transfer by electromigration sprocati and rolle 2020 sprocati et al 2021 in the case of the permanganate injection the exclusive presence of monovalent ions in both solutions and the similar electrolyte conductivity allow the immediate mobilization of the entire mass of permanganate in the cases of multivalent tracer anions their solutions were prepared at the same concentration as the background electrolyte however when the tracer and its cation are moving in opposite directions the anionic tracer concentration is limited by the equivalent concentration of the cations in the background pore water thus the higher concentration of the tracers cannot be displaced but only plumes with significantly lower peak concentrations 60 and 40 of the injected solutions fig 4b and c respectively are transported towards the anode therefore tracers with a higher negative charge can only be transported at lower concentrations as their charge has to be counterbalanced by the sum of equivalents of all cations in the background consequently as long as the charge and chemical composition of the background electrolyte solution remains constant the charge of the selected tracer limits the delivered concentrations for all three examined cases the process based model taking into account the compound specific properties of the different species the coulombic interactions and the electroneutrality of the pore water solution allow capturing both the concentrations and the shapes of the color tracer plumes observed in the experiments 4 2 scenario 2 in this scenario the experiments were performed injecting the three tracers in the porous medium with a carbonate bicarbonate buffer solution carbonate dominant anion as pore water also in these experiments the spatial evolution of the distinct tracer plumes is quite different fig 5 the plume of permanganate shows a similar behavior as in scenario 1 and the plumes of allura red and new coccine have higher longitudinal and transverse spreading compared to permanganate however differently from the previous scenario the plumes at late times appear less symmetric and particularly the mass distribution of allura red appears skewed with an opposite pattern compared to permanganate i e with higher concentrations at the front of the plume and lower concentrations in the tail the analysis of the longitudinal concentration profiles fig 6 confirms the different patterns in presence of the carbonate dominated buffer the permanganate plumes still develops a spread front but less pronounced compared to scenario 1 in fact in this case the permanganate has still a higher electromigration flux than the background anions however the electromigration mobility of the latter is increased since the dominant anion carbonate despite having a lower diffusivity than bicarbonate has double charge the increased electromigration mobility of the background anions causes the formation of a sharp front for the plumes of allura red and new coccine the longitudinal profiles show asymmetric shapes with the development of a front with steep concentration gradients towards the anode followed by a smooth decrease of concentration and tailing of the advancing plume such tailing is caused by the background anions initially present in the portion of the porous domain close to the cathode i e to the left of the plume injection under the applied electric potential such background anions are displaced towards the anode like the injected color tracers however they displace faster and tend to partially overlap and to smooth the tail of the tracers plumes fig 6 also shows the results of the transport simulations for the other ions present in the system before injecting the tracer solution the major background ions na co3 2 and hco3 are homogeneously distributed in the domain and ensure the electroneutrality of the pore water the speciation calculations confirm that both carbonate and bicarbonate are present in the background and the former is the dominant anion in the case of permanganate injection the major ions in the injected solutions are k and mno4 under the applied electric field k moves towards the cathode and already after 60 min is completely displaced towards the cathodic chamber and replaced by na from the background solution as explained above also the simulation of the behavior of co3 2 and hco3 show that these anions are transported towards the anode like the injected permanganate in the case of allura red and new coccine the major cation in the injected solution is na that is also the dominant positively charged species in the background electrolyte its behavior as well as the one of the major anions and sulfate that was present in the injected solution is illustrated by the simulation of the ionic spatial profiles at different times fig 6d f 4 3 scenario 3 in this scenario electrokinetic transport of the charged tracers was investigated using a phosphate buffer as background electrolyte in the pore water fig 7 shows the observed plumes at different times it is interesting to note that in this case all plumes tend to develop a shape similar to the one of permanganate with a longitudinally and laterally spread front and higher concentrations in the opposite portion of the plume again these patterns of the tracer plumes are due to the compound specific properties of the different ionic species in the injected and background electrolyte solutions and their electrostatic interactions in the pore water such behavior is confirmed by the observed and simulated longitudinal concentration profiles fig 8 the evolution of the injected plumes towards shapes characterized by a smooth front and a sharp tail is evident for all tracers this is due to the properties of the phosphate ions in the pore water and their interactions with the injected permanganate allura red and new coccine in particular h2po4 is the dominant anion in the background electrolyte its rather low diffusivity d aq 7 81 10 10 m2 s and monovalent charge results in a low electromigration flux towards the anode the tracers instead due to either their higher d aq or higher valence tend to displace faster towards the electrode with positive polarity and this causes a high spreading at the plume front whereas steep concentration gradients develop at the plume tail the numerical simulations allow capturing both the displacement velocity and the shapes of the different plumes fig 8a the model describes the behavior of all ions in the domain the speciation performed by phreeqcrm shows that h2po4 is present at higher concentrations than hpo4 2 and is the dominant anion in the background pore water such calculations coupled with the electrokinetic transport described by the nernst planck poisson equations allowed us to reproduce the behavior of the experimentally observed color plumes and to elucidate the interacting behavior of all charged species present in the setup and their contribution to the fulfillment of the electroneutrality of the pore water solution fig 8d f the simulated profiles of the major ions k and h2po4 in the background solution show how they are displaced and how their concentration evolve to maintain the charged balance note that the shapes of h2po4 complementary mirror those of the injected tracers as these negatively charged species are displaced towards the anode under the applied electric field the other charged species also undergo electromigration and after the injected na leaves the porous medium to the cathodic chamber k is the only positive species maintaining electroneutrality in the domain the different charge and aqueous diffusivity of injected and resident ions also result in different values of electric potential gradients and electrolyte conductivities in the supplementary material we provide the simulated spatial profiles of such quantities for the considered experimental scenarios fig s2 4 4 plume dilution besides the shape of the injected tracer plumes and their spreading in the longitudinal and transverse direction it is important to investigate their mixing with the background pore water to this end we consider the dilution index kitanidis 1994 a metric based on the shannon entropy of the concentration distribution which has been extensively used in the quantification of mixing in porous media e g bolster et al 2011 de barros et al 2012 rolle and kitanidis 2014 mathematically the dilution index is expressed as 7 e i t exp v p i x t ln p i x t dv where p i is the concentration probability distribution defined over a volume v 8 p i x t c i x t v c i x t dv physically the dilution index represents the progressive distribution of solute mass over a larger volume and quantifies the effective volume occupied by a plume in a porous medium the values and the rate of increase of this entropy based metric are valuable to understand mixing and mixing controlled reactions in porous media e g chiogna et al 2012 ye et al 2015c we computed the dilution index and its evolution for the different plumes in the ek transport experiments fig 9a c show the trends for scenarios 1 3 where the three tracers where injected in different background electrolyte solutions the results show increasing patterns of plume dilution for the different tracers in the tested experimental scenarios the new coccine plume reaches higher values of dilution in all scenarios due to its higher electromigration fluxes stemming from the trivalent charge the dilution of the permanganate and allura red plumes is smaller and the compound specific diffusivities and electrostatic interactions between the dissolved species also determine different rate of increase of the dilution index the composition of the background pore water solution also impacts plume dilution for instance in the case of new coccine the plume dilution in presence of the carbonate bicarbonate buffer with the dominant bivalent anion scenario 2 reaches a value approximately 40 higher than the final dilution values in the other experimental scenarios with bicarbonate and phosphate buffers scenarios 1 and 3 4 5 implications at field scale in this section we illustrate the results of numerical simulations at a typical scale of application of electrokinetic remediation in groundwater e g inglis et al 2021 mattson et al 2002b sprocati et al 2020 we consider a simple configuration consisting of a doublet with electrodes of opposite polarity and the delivery of a negatively charged species from the anode to the cathode this scenario is of interest since many reactants and amendments for electrokinetically enhanced in situ chemical oxidation ek isco and in situ biodegradation ek bio are anionic solutes that are distributed in the subsurface by means of electromigration chowdhury et al 2017b head et al 2020 inglis et al 2021 mao et al 2012 sprocati et al 2021 wu et al 2013 we performed ek transport simulations with the nernst planck poisson based model used to interpret the multidimensional laboratory experiments in a two dimensional homogeneous domain representing a plan view of an electrode doublet we considered the same three tracers as in the laboratory experiments representing amendments with different aqueous diffusivity and charge and we assessed their transport and delivery in the domain under an applied constant voltage of 300 v between the two electrodes fig 10 shows the geometry of the setup the evolution of a permanganate plume at different times of 3 6 9 and 12 days for an injection in sodium bicarbonate groundwater with same composition as scenario 1 panels a d the computed electric potential and streamlines panel e and the electric potential gradient panel f the results show a good coverage of the domain by the injected amendments which is a key feature of electrokinetic delivery in fact ek transport ensures efficient distribution and thus the treatment of wide portions of contaminated porous media in comparison natural transport processes such as advection diffusion and hydrodynamic dispersion would only allow distributing the reactant in a considerably smaller portion of the domain sprocati et al 2020 the evolution of the permanganate plume shows its transport from the cathode towards the anode with an average velocity of 40 cm day also at this larger scale the plume shows an asymmetric mass distribution in the longitudinal direction similar to the experimental observations with a smooth front reaching the anode already at 9 days whereas the higher concentrations travel slower and arrive at the positively charged electrode only after 12 days we also evaluated different scenarios exploring the impact of the compound specific properties of the injected amendments and background groundwater composition for the former we considered species with same diffusivities and valences as the permanganate allura red and new coccine tracers studied in the laboratory experiments and with an initial concentration of the injection solution in the range 0 5 10 mm as a background electrolyte we considered groundwater with sodium as major cation and bicarbonate as major anion the concentration of these background groundwater ions were changed to obtain values for the sum of the anions or cations in the pore water γ 0 5 i 1 n c i of 3 and 10 mm respectively the results of the simulations are presented in fig 11 as breakthrough curves at a monitoring point in the middle of the domain fig 10a fig 11a shows the results for permanganate and illustrates that lower injected concentrations of the tracer plumes results in longer breakthrough times whereas higher injected concentrations yields a faster breakthrough of the tracer at the observation point such effects are more pronounced in presence of higher concentrations of the background electrolyte in the pore water fig 11d a similar behavior was also observed for the multivalent tracers where besides the distinct retardation at the distinct concentration levels of the injected tracers it is also apparent the impact of the valence on the maximum concentration values that can be injected in the domain fig 11b c e f the outcomes of this simplified modeling scenarios are of interest for applications since they highlight the macroscopic impact on ek transport of compound specific diffusivity and electrostatic interactions without considering these effects the risk would be to attribute the different behavior to only physical properties such as tortuosity which should be fitted and changed even in the same porous medium to capture the distinct solute breakthrough at the observation point 5 conclusions through the series of experiments performed in this study we have provided experimental evidence of the effects of compound specific properties such as the aqueous diffusivity and the charge of ionic species on electromigration in multidimensional porous media the outcomes of the investigation show that such microscopic properties have an important macroscopic impact on the evolution of injected plumes leading to distinct mass distribution average displacement velocities longitudinal and lateral spreading patterns of plume fronts and tails as well as different dilution of the injected solutes such dissimilar behaviors occurring during the displacement of charged species by electromigration are ultimately dependent on the intrinsic mobility and charge of the ionic species their coulombic interactions and the fulfillment of the neutrality condition of the pore water solution numerical modeling was performed with the code np phreeqc ek sprocati et al 2019 and was based on the solution of the nernst planck poisson equations and aqueous speciation reactions in the pore water the simulations allowed us to capture the plume behavior and the evolution patterns observed in the electrokinetic transport experiments the modeling was instrumental to integrate the different physical chemical and electrostatic processes governing the transport of charged species under the applied electric field and leading to the distinct behavior observed in the investigated experimental scenarios we also performed larger scale simulations to illustrate the effects of diffusivity and electrostatic properties of ionic species in a simplified scenario of electrokinetic application with the delivery of charged amendments in a field scale electrode doublet setup besides illuminating the coupling and the effects of the different fundamental mechanisms of mass transfer and coulombic interactions on macroscopic transport by electromigration the outcomes of this study have also important implications for practical applications for instance the results show that the selection of charged amendments the composition and concentration of the injected solutions as well as the hydrochemical characterization of the background groundwater are of key importance in determining the evolution spreading and mixing of the injected plumes therefore the evaluation of such effects will be beneficial to optimize delivery performances times and overall degradation efficiencies for in situ application of electrokinetic remediation technologies to this end the developed simulation approach can be used to guide the design and to select appropriate operational conditions for electrokinetic remediation at contaminated sites field applications can entail more complex hydrogeological and geochemical conditions than those investigated in this work e g presence of spatially variable and possibly evolving permeability distributions as well as complex chemistry induced by unbuffered reactions at the electrodes perturbing the surrounding porous medium the impact of such conditions should be addressed in future investigation it is envisioned that the process based understanding and the tools developed in this study will be helpful not only for ek applications in low permeability porous media but also to conceive and apply new approaches in permeable formations in which electrokinetics offer largely unexplored possibilities of mixing enhancement between delivered reactants and resident contaminants

1354,the application of electrokinetic techniques in porous media has great potential to enhance mass transfer rates and thus to mobilize contaminants and effectively deliver reactants and amendments however the transport mechanisms induced by the application of an external electric field are complex and entail the coupling of physical chemical and electrostatic processes in this study we focus on electromigration and we provide experimental evidence of the impact of compound specific properties such as the aqueous diffusivity and the valence of charged species on the macroscopic electrokinetic transport we performed a series of multidimensional experiments considering the displacement of three different tracer plumes i e permanganate allura red and new coccine in different background electrolyte solutions the outcomes of the experiments clearly show that both the compound specific diffusivity and the charge of the injected and resident ions impact the transport of the selected color tracer plumes whose evolution was monitored with image analysis the investigated experimental scenarios led to distinct plume behavior characterized by different mass distribution average displacement velocities longitudinal and lateral plume spreading shape of the invading and receding fronts as well as dilution of the injected solutes a numerical simulator based on the nernst planck poisson equations and on aqueous speciation reactions in the pore water allowed us to quantitatively interpret the experimental results to capture the observed patterns of plume evolution and to illuminate the coupling between the governing physico chemical mechanisms and the controlling role of small scale compound specific and electrostatic properties finally the model was also extended to a typical configuration of in situ electrokinetic remediation of contaminated groundwater to show the impact of such mechanisms at larger scale keywords electrokinetic transport electromigration charge interactions multicomponent ionic transport aqueous diffusivity reactive transport modeling 1 introduction understanding the mechanisms of transport in groundwater is key to predict the fate of contaminants and the evolution of groundwater quality as well as to design successful in situ remediation approaches such understanding is challenged by the inherent complexity of transport processes in porous media the presence of mass transfer limitations the interaction between solutes within the pore water and at solid solution interfaces the coupling of transport with a number of chemical and biological reactions the inaccessibility and multi scale heterogeneity of subsurface formations detailed studies using different experimental and modeling approaches investigated natural transport in groundwater flow systems from pore to field scales an important finding highlighted in such investigation was the importance of small scale processes such as compound specific diffusion and charge interactions for macroscopic transport of solutes in groundwater and the propagation of their effects to larger scales muniruzzaman and rolle 2021 rolle et al 2013a another aspect that has been increasingly recognized is the consideration of dimensionality effects and the advantage of investigating transport processes in multidimensional systems to fully appreciate the contribution of small scale mass transfer limitations to mixing and mixing controlled reactions in porous media e g cirpka et al 2012 cirpka et al 2015 heyman et al 2020 hochstetler et al 2013 ye et al 2015a ye et al 2015b yoon et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 electrokinetic ek transport processes are induced by the application of a low intensity electric field in a porous medium this is typically done with a low voltage direct current applied between at least two electrodes acar and alshawabkeh 1993 reddy et al 2003 reddy and cameselle 2009 considering transport of solute species the mass transfer mechanisms resulting from the application of an electric field are electromigration which consists in the displacement of charged species towards the electrodes of opposite polarity and electroosmosis which is the movement of water with ions in the electrical double layer on the surface of solid grains ek transport processes have received increasing attention for their application for in situ soil and groundwater remediation due to their potential of providing considerable mass transfer rates also in low permeability porous media where most of the in situ remediation approaches are not applicable or severely challenged electrokinetic remediation approaches have been proposed for different purposes including the mobilization and removal of organic and inorganic contaminants e g kim et al 2009

g gill et al 2014 2015 hyldegaard et al 2019 inglis et al 2021 mao et al 2012 ottosen et al 2019 sprocati et al 2020 most literature studies on electrokinetic transport in porous media have focused on low permeability matrices where mass transfer is limited to diffusive processes jin et al 2014 yang et al 2017 leading to persistent contamination parker et al 2008 however the application of electric fields to induce electrokinetic transport has also a large and mostly unexplored potential in permeable porous media another aspect that is not typically considered in the investigation of electrokinetic processes is the system dimensionality and its impact on transport and mixing of the solutions delivered by electrokinetics with a few exceptions e g reynolds et al 2008 gill et al 2016 gill et al 2021 most ek transport studies have been performed in 1 d columns or with boundary conditions transforming multidimensional setups into 1 d equivalent systems and preventing the investigation of multidimensional spreading and dilution of injected plumes as well as of mixing and mixing controlled reactions with resident pore water solutions in permeable porous media ek transport mechanisms such as electromigration are of great interest since they can considerably increase mixing rates and provide effective mixing enhancement which is highly desired to overcome mass transfer limitations kitanidis and mccarty 2012 rolle and le borgne 2019 valocchi et al 2019 the latter are ubiquitous under natural groundwater transport and often represent the bottleneck of contaminant degradation since they restrict mixing and mixing controlled reactions to very small fringes at the boundaries of groundwater plumes anneser et al 2008 bauer et al 2009 prommer et al 2009 rolle et al 2009 in a recent study on ek transport we have shown that electromigration induced by the establishment of electric potential gradients can be considerably more effective to enhance mixing and mixing controlled degradation than an equivalent system undergoing natural groundwater flow and advective dispersive transport sprocati et al 2021 in that investigation we have also shown the effects of the concentration of a background electrolyte on conservative and reactive transport during electrokinetics in this study we focus on the compound specific properties of injected tracers and background electrolyte solutions and explore their impact on transport by electromigration with a series of multidimensional ek experiments we consider anionic tracers with different charges and aqueous diffusion coefficients as well as different buffer solutions in the background groundwater such experiments allow us to explore the effects of compound specific properties of the different tracers on their displacement velocity concentration distribution and plume dilution in the porous domain furthermore we assess the impact of the compound specific properties of the different dominant ions in the background electrolyte solutions and show that their charge and aqueous diffusivity control the transport of the injected tracers the delivered concentrations in the porous medium the shape of the concentration profiles and the characteristic propagation of the front and tail of the injected tracer plumes we use a process based reactive transport modeling approach to quantitatively interpret the experimental results the multidimensional model is based on a nernst planck poisson formulation that allows capturing the electrostatic interactions between the injected and resident charged species in the porous medium we compare the outcomes of the simulations with the experimental observations and we use the validated model to explore the impact of ion valences and diffusivities on a simple electrokinetic remediation setup at the larger field scale 2 experimental setup the electrokinetic transport experiments were performed is a vertical quasi two dimensional

electrolyte solution between each electrode chamber and the respective external reservoir a ph probe wtw gmbh multi 3410 germany was used to measure the ph of the electrolyte solutions the

analysis was performed with a calibration procedure translating the color intensity of the dye tracers into concentration values details about the experimental setup and image analysis are provided in the supplementary material the tracers selected to perform the different electrokinetic transport experiments were permanganate sigma aldrich germany which has a purple color and two food colorants allura red sigma aldrich germany and new coccine sigma aldrich germany characterized by a red color these tracers are all negatively charged and due to the electric voltage applied across the porous medium they are displaced towards the anode by electromigration they have different valence and charge in solution permanganate 1 allura red 2 and new coccine 3 furthermore these tracers have different aqueous diffusion coefficients with permanganate being the most mobile ion d aq 1 50 10 9 m2 s whereas allura red and new coccine have considerably smaller diffusivity d aq 5 46 10 10 m2 s and d aq 4 06 10 10 m2 s respectively four different experimental scenarios were investigated to explore the impact of compound specific and charge properties on electrokinetic transport the experiments considered the injection of the selected tracers and different pore water electrolytes consisting of bicarbonate carbonate bicarbonate and phosphate buffers table 1 reports the list of experimental scenarios and the concentration of the tracer and background electrolyte solutions scenario 1 consists of the same concentration of the tracer and background solutions where the latter is a buffer with the monovalent bicarbonate ion hco3 as the main anion in scenario 2 a carbonate bicarbonate buffer was used as a background electrolyte solution where the dominant anion co3 2 has a multivalent charge 2 scenario 3 considers a phosphate buffer with h2po4 as major anion finally scenario 4 considers the same bicarbonate dominated buffer as in scenario 1 however the concentration of the background electrolyte solutions where prepared to match the electrical conductivity of the injected tracer solutions all the solutions in the different experiments were prepared with ultrapure

diffusion j i dif and the electromigation j i mig fluxes in presence of an applied electric field the electromigration flux is the dominant term and it is several orders of magnitude higher than the diffusive flux it is important to note that j i mig depends on the electric potential gradient as well as on compound specific properties of the charged species in the pore water such as their aqueous diffusion coefficient d i and their charge z i an accurate solution of multicomponent transport problems requires the consideration of the coulombic interactions between charged species both for natural groundwater transport appelo and wersin 2007 muniruzzaman et al 2014 muniruzzaman and rolle 2019 and under the application of an electric field krabbenhøft and krabbenhøft 2008 lópez vizcaíno

1968 sastre and santaballa 1989 and the solution must be electrostatically neutral in many porous media applications the conductivity of the pore water is dominant newman and thomas alyea 2004 and the

mobility and charge of the different ionic species changes in σ e induce spatial and temporal variations of the current density and the electric potential gradient which conversely impact the development of electromigration fluxes and the distribution of ionic species in the system 3 2 numerical model process based numerical simulations of electrokinetic transport were performed with the code np phreeqc ek sprocati et al 2019 this simulator is a coupling between comsol multiphysics used to solve the nernst planck poisson equations in multidimensional domains and the geochemical code phreeqcrm parkhurst and wissmeier 2015 allowing the description of a wide range of equilibrium and kinetically controlled reactions the approach is based on a sequential non iterative coupling between the transport simulator and phreeqcrm rolle et al 2018 simulations were performed for all experimental scenarios and for a field scale setup describing electrokinetic delivery of tracers in an electrode doublet configuration at the laboratory scale the model domain was a rectangular area with size 28 cm 15 cm representing the saturated porous medium in the ek experiments the 2 d domain was discretized into 13 400 triangular elements and dirichlet boundary conditions were set for the concentration at the sides of the domain with concentrations equal to the background electrolyte for each scenario considered the values of the concentrations were obtained through the evaluation of aqueous speciation reactions of the different species in the solution overall multicomponent ionic transport of 16 charged species was simulated and the diffusion coefficient of each species a t 22 c is provided in table 2 the injection of the tracer was simulated considering an initial circular zone of radius 2 15 cm the electric potential at the boundaries was set to the measured values during the experiments table s1 electrolysis reactions were not included in the numerical simulations due to the recirculation system and the large volume of the reservoirs employed to buffer such electrode reactions and to the use of the buffer solutions as electrolytes which allowed minimizing the effects of ph variations in the domain the tortuosity of the porous medium was considered as fitting parameter and was adjusted to fit the simulated longitudinal concentration profiles to the experimental observations a narrow range of tortuosity values 1 30 1 43 was obtained in the evaluation of all performed experiments 4 results and discussion here we show the results of the ek transport experiments and their model based interpretation for scenarios 1 3 the outcomes of scenario 4 with equal conductivity between the injected solutions and the background pore water electrolytes are reported in the supplementary material 4 1 scenario 1 in these experiments the three differently charged tracers permanganate 1 allura red 2 and new coccine 3 were transported by electromigration in a porous medium with bicarbonate as dominant anion in the pore water the transport of the color tracer plumes was recorded over time and successive images for five different time steps 0 min 30 min 60 min 90 min and 120 min are presented for all three tracers in fig 2 the applied electric field induces the displacement of the negatively charged tracers towards the anode on the right side of the domain the observations show different evolution and shapes of the color plumes the permanganate plume is smaller has a smooth advancing front whereas the solute mass appears to be preferentially located higher concentrations in the left portion of the plume the electromigration of allura red and new coccine results in more spread and symmetric plumes compared to the observed permanganate distribution also the average velocities are different in the three experiments the center of mass of the permanganate plume moves about 14 cm in 120 min 7 cm h whereas the displacement of the multivalent tracers is slower covering 12 5 cm and 12 cm in the same time and resulting in average velocities of 6 5 cm h and 6 cm h for allura red and new coccine respectively the computed 2 d concentration maps of fig 3 show the outcomes of the numerical simulations the results of the nernst planck poisson simulations can reproduce the patterns of concentration distribution plume shape and displacement observed in the multidimensional electrokinetic experiments a direct comparison between the experimental and modeling results is presented in fig 4 showing the observed and simulated concentration profiles along the longitudinal axis of the plumes here the effects of compound specific properties of the three considered tracers and their impact on the mass distribution are evident the permanganate profiles are asymmetric and their skewness increases as ek transport progresses this behavior can be ascribed to the main anions in the system the injected mno4 and the resident hco3 both are monovalent and undergo displacement by electromigration towards the anode however the higher aqueous diffusivity of permanganate 1 50 10 9 m2 s compared to bicarbonate 1 09 10 9 m2 s causes the former moving faster and resulting in a spread front allura red has a smaller diffusivity 5 46 10 10 m2 s than bicarbonate which would result in the development of a sharp front yet this does not happen due to the bivalent charge of this anionic tracer that contributes to increase its displacement by electromigration eq 2 in this case the effect of the tracer diffusivity and its charge compensate and result in a displacement by electromigration very similar to the bicarbonate ion in the background electrolyte thus leading to a symmetric tracer plume similar effects are observed for new coccine which has an even smaller aqueous diffusion coefficient 4 06 10 10 m2 s but has a higher trivalent negative charge the net effect is still a slightly higher displacement of new coccine with respect to bicarbonate which causes minor spreading and asymmetry in the observed plumes the electroneutrality constraint and the different conductivities of the injected and resident solutions also cause limitation to mass transfer by electromigration sprocati and rolle 2020 sprocati et al 2021 in the case of the permanganate injection the exclusive presence of monovalent ions in both solutions and the similar electrolyte conductivity allow the immediate mobilization of the entire mass of permanganate in the cases of multivalent tracer anions their solutions were prepared at the same concentration as the background electrolyte however when the tracer and its cation are moving in opposite directions the anionic tracer concentration is limited by the equivalent concentration of the cations in the background pore water thus the higher concentration of the tracers cannot be displaced but only plumes with significantly lower peak concentrations 60 and 40 of the injected solutions fig 4b and c respectively are transported towards the anode therefore tracers with a higher negative charge can only be transported at lower concentrations as their charge has to be counterbalanced by the sum of equivalents of all cations in the background consequently as long as the charge and chemical composition of the background electrolyte solution remains constant the charge of the selected tracer limits the delivered concentrations for all three examined cases the process based model taking into account the compound specific properties of the different species the coulombic interactions and the electroneutrality of the pore water solution allow capturing both the concentrations and the shapes of the color tracer plumes observed in the experiments 4 2 scenario 2 in this scenario the experiments were performed injecting the three tracers in the porous medium with a carbonate bicarbonate buffer solution carbonate dominant anion as pore water also in these experiments the spatial evolution of the distinct tracer plumes is quite different fig 5 the plume of permanganate shows a similar behavior as in scenario 1 and the plumes of allura red and new coccine have higher longitudinal and transverse spreading compared to permanganate however differently from the previous scenario the plumes at late times appear less symmetric and particularly the mass distribution of allura red appears skewed with an opposite pattern compared to permanganate i e with higher concentrations at the front of the plume and lower concentrations in the tail the analysis of the longitudinal concentration profiles fig 6 confirms the different patterns in presence of the carbonate dominated buffer the permanganate plumes still develops a spread front but less pronounced compared to scenario 1 in fact in this case the permanganate has still a higher electromigration flux than the background anions however the electromigration mobility of the latter is increased since the dominant anion carbonate despite having a lower diffusivity than bicarbonate has double charge the increased electromigration mobility of the background anions causes the formation of a sharp front for the plumes of allura red and new coccine the longitudinal profiles show asymmetric shapes with the development of a front with steep concentration gradients towards the anode followed by a smooth decrease of concentration and tailing of the advancing plume such tailing is caused by the background anions initially present in the portion of the porous domain close to the cathode i e to the left of the plume injection under the applied electric potential such background anions are displaced towards the anode like the injected color tracers however they displace faster and tend to partially overlap and to smooth the tail of the tracers plumes fig 6 also shows the results of the transport simulations for the other ions present in the system before injecting the tracer solution the major background ions na co3 2 and hco3 are homogeneously distributed in the domain and ensure the electroneutrality of the pore water the speciation calculations confirm that both carbonate and bicarbonate are present in the background and the former is the dominant anion in the case of permanganate injection the major ions in the injected solutions are k and mno4 under the applied electric field k moves towards the cathode and already after 60 min is completely displaced towards the cathodic chamber and replaced by na from the background solution as explained above also the simulation of the behavior of co3 2 and hco3 show that these anions are transported towards the anode like the injected permanganate in the case of allura red and new coccine the major cation in the injected solution is na that is also the dominant positively charged species in the background electrolyte its behavior as well as the one of the major anions and sulfate that was present in the injected solution is illustrated by the simulation of the ionic spatial profiles at different times fig 6d f 4 3 scenario 3 in this scenario electrokinetic transport of the charged tracers was investigated using a phosphate buffer as background electrolyte in the pore water fig 7 shows the observed plumes at different times it is interesting to note that in this case all plumes tend to develop a shape similar to the one of permanganate with a longitudinally and laterally spread front and higher concentrations in the opposite portion of the plume again these patterns of the tracer plumes are due to the compound specific properties of the different ionic species in the injected and background electrolyte solutions and their electrostatic interactions in the pore water such behavior is confirmed by the observed and simulated longitudinal concentration profiles fig 8 the evolution of the injected plumes towards shapes characterized by a smooth front and a sharp tail is evident for all tracers this is due to the properties of the phosphate ions in the pore water and their interactions with the injected permanganate allura red and new coccine in particular h2po4 is the dominant anion in the background electrolyte its rather low diffusivity d aq 7 81 10 10 m2 s and monovalent charge results in a low electromigration flux towards the anode the tracers instead due to either their higher d aq or higher valence tend to displace faster towards the electrode with positive polarity and this causes a high spreading at the plume front whereas steep concentration gradients develop at the plume tail the numerical simulations allow capturing both the displacement velocity and the shapes of the different plumes fig 8a the model describes the behavior of all ions in the domain the speciation performed by phreeqcrm shows that h2po4 is present at higher concentrations than hpo4 2 and is the dominant anion in the background pore water such calculations coupled with the electrokinetic transport described by the nernst planck poisson equations allowed us to reproduce the behavior of the experimentally observed color plumes and to elucidate the interacting behavior of all charged species present in the setup and their contribution to the fulfillment of the electroneutrality of the pore water solution fig 8d f the simulated profiles of the major ions k and h2po4 in the background solution show how they are displaced and how their concentration evolve to maintain the charged balance note that the shapes of h2po4 complementary mirror those of the injected tracers as these negatively charged species are displaced towards the anode under the applied electric field the other charged species also undergo electromigration and after the injected na leaves the porous medium to the cathodic chamber k is the only positive species maintaining electroneutrality in the domain the different charge and aqueous diffusivity of injected and resident ions also result in different values of electric potential gradients and electrolyte conductivities in the supplementary material we provide the simulated spatial profiles of such quantities for the considered experimental scenarios fig s2 4 4 plume dilution besides the shape of the injected tracer plumes and their spreading in the longitudinal and transverse direction it is important to investigate their mixing with the background pore water to this end we consider the dilution index kitanidis 1994 a metric based on the shannon entropy of the concentration distribution which has been extensively used in the quantification of mixing in porous media e g bolster et al 2011 de barros et al 2012 rolle and kitanidis 2014 mathematically the dilution index is expressed as 7 e i t exp v p i x t ln p i x t dv where p i is the concentration probability distribution defined over a volume v 8 p i x t c i x t v c i x t dv physically the dilution index represents the progressive distribution of solute mass over a larger volume and quantifies the effective volume occupied by a plume in a porous medium the values and the rate of increase of this entropy based metric are valuable to understand mixing and mixing controlled reactions in porous media e g chiogna et al 2012 ye et al 2015c we computed the dilution index and its evolution for the different plumes in the ek transport experiments fig 9a c show the trends for scenarios 1 3 where the three tracers where injected in different background electrolyte solutions the results show increasing patterns of plume dilution for the different tracers in the tested experimental scenarios the new coccine plume reaches higher values of dilution in all scenarios due to its higher electromigration fluxes stemming from the trivalent charge the dilution of the permanganate and allura red plumes is smaller and the compound specific diffusivities and electrostatic interactions between the dissolved species also determine different rate of increase of the dilution index the composition of the background pore water solution also impacts plume dilution for instance in the case of new coccine the plume dilution in presence of the carbonate bicarbonate buffer with the dominant bivalent anion scenario 2 reaches a value approximately 40 higher than the final dilution values in the other experimental scenarios with bicarbonate and phosphate buffers scenarios 1 and 3 4 5 implications at field scale in this section we illustrate the results of numerical simulations at a typical scale of application of electrokinetic remediation in groundwater e g inglis et al 2021 mattson et al 2002b sprocati et al 2020 we consider a simple configuration consisting of a doublet with electrodes of opposite polarity and the delivery of a negatively charged species from the anode to the cathode this scenario is of interest since many reactants and amendments for electrokinetically enhanced in situ chemical oxidation ek isco and in situ biodegradation ek bio are anionic solutes that are distributed in the subsurface by means of electromigration chowdhury et al 2017b head et al 2020 inglis et al 2021 mao et al 2012 sprocati et al 2021 wu et al 2013 we performed ek transport simulations with the nernst planck poisson based model used to interpret the multidimensional laboratory experiments in a two dimensional homogeneous domain representing a plan view of an electrode doublet we considered the same three tracers as in the laboratory experiments representing amendments with different aqueous diffusivity and charge and we assessed their transport and delivery in the domain under an applied constant voltage of 300 v between the two electrodes fig 10 shows the geometry of the setup the evolution of a permanganate plume at different times of 3 6 9 and 12 days for an injection in sodium bicarbonate groundwater with same composition as scenario 1 panels a d the computed electric potential and streamlines panel e and the electric potential gradient panel f the results show a good coverage of the domain by the injected amendments which is a key feature of electrokinetic delivery in fact ek transport ensures efficient distribution and thus the treatment of wide portions of contaminated porous media in comparison natural transport processes such as advection diffusion and hydrodynamic dispersion would only allow distributing the reactant in a considerably smaller portion of the domain sprocati et al 2020 the evolution of the permanganate plume shows its transport from the cathode towards the anode with an average velocity of 40 cm day also at this larger scale the plume shows an asymmetric mass distribution in the longitudinal direction similar to the experimental observations with a smooth front reaching the anode already at 9 days whereas the higher concentrations travel slower and arrive at the positively charged electrode only after 12 days we also evaluated different scenarios exploring the impact of the compound specific properties of the injected amendments and background groundwater composition for the former we considered species with same diffusivities and valences as the permanganate allura red and new coccine tracers studied in the laboratory experiments and with an initial concentration of the injection solution in the range 0 5 10 mm as a background electrolyte we considered groundwater with sodium as major cation and bicarbonate as major anion the concentration of these background groundwater ions were changed to obtain values for the sum of the anions or cations in the pore water γ 0 5 i 1 n c i of 3 and 10 mm respectively the results of the simulations are presented in fig 11 as breakthrough curves at a monitoring point in the middle of the domain fig 10a fig 11a shows the results for permanganate and illustrates that lower injected concentrations of the tracer plumes results in longer breakthrough times whereas higher injected concentrations yields a faster breakthrough of the tracer at the observation point such effects are more pronounced in presence of higher concentrations of the background electrolyte in the pore water fig 11d a similar behavior was also observed for the multivalent tracers where besides the distinct retardation at the distinct concentration levels of the injected tracers it is also apparent the impact of the valence on the maximum concentration values that can be injected in the domain fig 11b c e f the outcomes of this simplified modeling scenarios are of interest for applications since they highlight the macroscopic impact on ek transport of compound specific diffusivity and electrostatic interactions without considering these effects the risk would be to attribute the different behavior to only physical properties such as tortuosity which should be fitted and changed even in the same porous medium to capture the distinct solute breakthrough at the observation point 5 conclusions through the series of experiments performed in this study we have provided experimental evidence of the effects of compound specific properties such as the aqueous diffusivity and the charge of ionic species on electromigration in multidimensional porous media the outcomes of the investigation show that such microscopic properties have an important macroscopic impact on the evolution of injected plumes leading to distinct mass distribution average displacement velocities longitudinal and lateral spreading patterns of plume fronts and tails as well as different dilution of the injected solutes such dissimilar behaviors occurring during the displacement of charged species by electromigration are ultimately dependent on the intrinsic mobility and charge of the ionic species their coulombic interactions and the fulfillment of the neutrality condition of the pore water solution numerical modeling was performed with the code np phreeqc ek sprocati et al 2019 and was based on the solution of the nernst planck poisson equations and aqueous speciation reactions in the pore water the simulations allowed us to capture the plume behavior and the evolution patterns observed in the electrokinetic transport experiments the modeling was instrumental to integrate the different physical chemical and electrostatic processes governing the transport of charged species under the applied electric field and leading to the distinct behavior observed in the investigated experimental scenarios we also performed larger scale simulations to illustrate the effects of diffusivity and electrostatic properties of ionic species in a simplified scenario of electrokinetic application with the delivery of charged amendments in a field scale electrode doublet setup besides illuminating the coupling and the effects of the different fundamental mechanisms of mass transfer and coulombic interactions on macroscopic transport by electromigration the outcomes of this study have also important implications for practical applications for instance the results show that the selection of charged amendments the composition and concentration of the injected solutions as well as the hydrochemical characterization of the background groundwater are of key importance in determining the evolution spreading and mixing of the injected plumes therefore the evaluation of such effects will be beneficial to optimize delivery performances times and overall degradation efficiencies for in situ application of electrokinetic remediation technologies to this end the developed simulation approach can be used to guide the design and to select appropriate operational conditions for electrokinetic remediation at contaminated sites field applications can entail more complex hydrogeological and geochemical conditions than those investigated in this work e g presence of spatially variable and possibly evolving permeability distributions as well as complex chemistry induced by unbuffered reactions at the electrodes perturbing the surrounding porous medium the impact of such conditions should be addressed in future investigation it is envisioned that the process based understanding and the tools developed in this study will be helpful not only for ek applications in low permeability porous media but also to conceive and apply new approaches in permeable formations in which electrokinetics offer largely unexplored possibilities of mixing enhancement between delivered reactants and resident contaminants
