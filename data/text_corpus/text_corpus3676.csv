18380,glycosaminoglycans gags are linear heteropolysaccharides containing a derivative of an amino sugar the possibility of the presence of gags in aerobic granular sludge was studied by combining sds page with alcian blue staining at ph 2 5 and 1 ftir mammalian hyaluronic acid and sulfated gag analysis kits enzymatic digestion and specific in situ visualization by heparin red and lectin staining gags including hyaluronic acid like and sulfated gags like polymers were found in aerobic granular sludge the sulfated gags like polymers contained chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate heparin based on their sensitivity to the digestion by chondroitinase abc and heparinase i iii heparin red and lectin staining demonstrated that the sulfated gags like polymers were not only present in the extracellular matrix but also filled in the space between the cells inside the microcolonies the gags like polymers in aerobic granules were different from those produced by pathogenic bacteria but resemble those produced by vertebrates findings reported here and in previous studies on granular sludge described in literature indicate that gags like polymers might be widespread in granular sludge biofilm and contribute to the stability of these systems the extracellular polymeric substances eps in granular sludge biofilm are far more complicated than they are currently appreciated integrated and multidisciplinary analyses are significantly required to study the eps graphical abstract image 1 keywords glycosaminoglycans sulfation hyaluronic acid extracellular polymeric substances aerobic granular sludge biofilm 1 introduction the aerobic granular sludge process is a wastewater treatment process which gained increasing popularity as an alternative to the conventional flocculent sludge processes pronk et al 2015 the sludge granules consist of bacteria embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps lin et al 2010 seviour et al 2009 the eps not only provide a structural matrix in which cells can be embedded but also have various compositions and properties flemming and wingender 2010 recent studies on eps composition revealed that not only proteins and polysaccharides are the components of eps but complex glycoconjugates are present as well e g a highly abundant glycoprotein carrying a heterogeneous o glycan structure was identified in the eps of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox granular sludge enriched with ca brocadia sapporoensis boleij et al 2018 glycoproteins were hypothesized to be strongly involved in the structure of anammox granules having a similar role as glycans in the extracellular matrix ecm of multicellular organisms like vertebrates boleij et al 2018 varki 2017 in seawater adapted aerobic granular sludge sialic acids present as sialoglycoproteins were widely distributed in the eps sialic acids were covering the penultimate galactose unit by this providing stability of the sugar chain de graaff et al 2019 glycoconjugates have also been found in saline anaerobic granular sludge the major sugar monomers reported were mannose and n acetyl galactosamine gagliano et al 2018 the amino sugars galactosamine and glucosamine the uronic acids glucuronic acid and galacturonic acid and several neutral sugars were identified as monomers in the structural eps of aerobic granular sludge felz et al 2019 the presence of amino sugars and glucuronic acid as well as the highly negative charge of structural eps and their gel forming ability felz et al 2016 indicate that glycosaminoglycans gags might be another type of glycoconjugates in the eps of granular sludge gags are heteropolysaccharides that contain a hexosamine either glucosamine or galactosamine generally n acetylated and a uronic acid glucuronic iduronic acid or galactose as part of their repeating unit esko and lindahl 2001 silbert and sugumaran 2002 gags are building blocks of the ecm in mammalian cells and can be covalently bound to proteins forming a large and negatively charged proteoglycan lindahl et al 2017 williams 1998 by attracting cations and water molecules these macromolecules form a hydrated gel proteoglycans are an important constituent of the connective tissue forming the ground substance which facilitates structural support and enables the diffusion of soluble compounds e g nutrients or signaling molecules and cell migration within the ecm williams 1998 it is interesting to investigate if there are similar macromolecules present in the eps of granular sludge due to the fact that amino sugars e g hexosamines do not react with phenol sulfuric acid assay felz et al 2019 manzi and esko 1995 the presence of gags might be overlooked by the commonly used colorimetric methods thus it is significantly necessary to establish appropriate methodologies to investigate the possible existence of gags in granular sludge or biofilms in the current research it is assumed that there are various gags e g hyaluronic acid chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate heparin in the eps of aerobic granular sludge which are similar to the polymers forming the ecm in higher organisms their possible presence was evaluated by commercial extracellular matrix assays for use with mammalian cells tissues and fluids specific enzymatic digestion and ftir the location of highly negatively charged macromolecules e g sulfated gags in granular sludge was visualized by heparin red staining 2 material and methods the analysis of gags like polymers including hyaluronic acid like and sulfated gags like polymers in aerobic granular sludge was summarized in fig 1 2 1 aerobic granular sludge collection aerobic granular sludge was collected from the municipal wastewater treatment plant dinxperlo in the netherlands which is operated according to the nereda technology collected granular sludge was sieved washed with demi water frozen at 80 c and lyophilized 2 2 extraction of structural eps from

sludge and structural eps was measured by following the protocol of the blyscan glycosaminoglycan assay provided by biocolor uk in brief the sample 1 5 mg dry weight was digested by papain extraction reagent overnight at 65 c after centrifugation at 10 000 g for 10 min the supernatant was collected total sulfated gags were quantified by using the blyscan dye reagent containing 1 9 dimethyl methylene blue dmmb with bovine tracheal chondroitin 4 sulfate as the standard in addition the ratio of o and n sulfated gags within the test samples was determined by following the nitrous acid cleavage method nitrous acid reacts with the n sulfated d glucosamine and cleaves the n sulfated site bienkowski and conrad 1985 after this reaction the amount of o sulfated gags was measured again using the blyscan protocol the difference between the total sulfated gags and the amount of o sulfated gags gave the amount of n sulfated gags in animal tissue hyaluronic acid is a non sulfated gag and is not covalently bound to proteins in contrast the other gags are sulfated and are covalently bound to a protein backbone to form proteoglycans lindahl et al 2017 in order to study if the sulfated gags in granular sludge are also covalently bound to proteins proteinase digestion was performed on structural eps to remove proteins which are not covalently bound to gags 2 4 1 proteinase digestion of structural eps structural eps were digested with papain and proteinase k in sequence papain digestion was performed as described in the blyscan protocol biocolor uk lyophilized structural eps 200 mg was digested in 100 ml papain extraction reagent containing 5 mg papain at 65 c for 24 h 5 mg papain was added afterwards and the mixture was incubated at 65 c for another 24 h the mixture

further digested by proteinase k according to the manufacturer s instructions with modifications 5 mg proteinase k in 50 mm tris ph 8 4 mm calcium chloride and 10 mm sodium chloride at 37 c for 24 h with gentle mixing after 24 h another 5 mg of proteinase k were added and the digestion continued for 24 h when the digestion was finished the mixture was heated to 100 c for 5 min to deactivate the enzyme and dialyzed overnight against demineralized water in a dialysis bag mwco 3 5 kda consequently the content inside the dialysis bag was centrifuged at 4 000 g for 20 min and the supernatant was collected and lyophilized 2 4 2 enrichment of sulfated gags containing polypeptides by ion exchange chromatography lyophilized protease digested structural eps were dissolved in 7 m urea containing 30

nm which were eluted at sodium chloride concentrations of 0 8 1 m were combined supplemental material 1 dialyzed against demineralized water in a dialysis bag with 3 5 kda mwco frozen at 80 c and lyophilized the reason of collecting these specific fractions is as follows 1 there is still a signal of the peptide bond which indicates the presence of polypeptides 2 at the same time the sodium chloride concentration mainly cl is high enough to exchange compounds that contain highly negatively charged groups e g sulfated gags containing o sulfate groups and n sulfate groups sulfated gags content of the combined fraction was quantified by the blyscan kit biocolor uk 2 4 3 monosaccharide and amino acid analysis of the enriched sulfated gags containing polypeptides fraction

gerstel mÃ¼hlheim germany straight glass liners with glass wool were utilized agilent ms was operated in selected ion monitoring mode and the quantification of the amino acids was performed by isotope dilution mass spectrometry 2 4 4 enzymatic digestion of the enriched sulfated gags containing polypeptides with chondroitinase abc and heparinase i iii in order to understand if there were chondroitin sulfate and or heparan sulfate including heparin in the enriched sulfate gags chondroitinase abc from proteus vulgaris sigma aldrich and a blend of heparinase i iii from flavobacterium heparinum sigma aldrich were used respectively for digestion sigma aldrich 2007 the specificity of the enzymes is described in supplemental material 2 samples 1 mg ml were digested according to manufacturer s instructions with chondroitinase abc 0 1 mg ml at 37 c and ph 8 in 0 01 w v bovine serum albumin bsa 50 mm tris and 60 mm sodium acetate for 24 h in parallel samples 1 mg ml were digested with

granular sludge highly negatively charged macromolecules e g heparan sulfate heparin were localized in the granular matrix by staining with the fluorescent probe heparin red redprobes mÃ¼nster germany staining using heparin red was done according to the supplier s data sheet briefly 8 8 Î¼l heparin red and 1 ml enhancer solution were mixed and added to the granules for 1 h other glycoconjugates were examined on the basis of fluorescence lectin bar coding with subsequent fluorescence lectin binding analysis neu and kuhlicke 2017 for this purpose all commercially available lectins fitc fluorescein alexa488 were screened and individually tested for binding granules were stained with lectins 0 1 mg ml for 20 min at room temperature in the dark and washed 3 times in order to remove the unbound probe for both stainings the granules were washed with tap water and mounted in coverwell chambers thermofisher with various spacers 1 1 7 2 mm to keep the original shape of the granule the samples were examined at a leica sp5x instrument leica germany equipped with an upright microscope and a super continuum light source the microscope was controlled by the las af software version 2 4 1 confocal images were recorded as single scan or serial scan step size 1 or 0 5 Î¼m using a 25x na 0 95 or a 63x na 1 2 water immersion lens laser excitation was at 480 nm and 567 nm emission was from

granular sludge and analysis the structural eps extracted from aerobic granular sludge represented 253 14 mg g volatile content of the sludge the glycoconjugates in the extracted eps were further characterized using sds page in combination with different staining protocols following coomassie blue staining a smear was observed with the molecular weight range from 50 kda to 10 kda fig 2 lane 1 no clear bands could be seen alcian blue staining was applied with ph 2 5 and ph 1 0 fig 2 lane 2 and 3 at ph 2 5 both carboxyl rich glycoconjugates coo and sulfated glycoconjugates so3 were stained while with ph 1 0 only the sulfated glycoconjugates were stained shori et al 2001 a smear appeared at the high molecular weight range above 235 kda with decreasing intensity until 70 kda at both ph 2 5 and ph 1 with the intensity of the smear at ph 2 5 higher than that at ph 1 implying there are both carboxyl rich glycoconjugates and sulfated glycoconjugates in the structural eps in addition part of the structural eps were retained in the wells it was strongly stained by coomassie blue pas and alcian blue both at ph 2 5 and 1 indicating that it contained proteins polypeptides carboxyl rich glycoconjugates and sulfated glycoconjugates as well 3 2 hyaluronic acid content in aerobic granular sludge and extracted structural eps the lyophilized granular sludge as well as the extracted structural eps was treated according to the protocol provided in the commercial kit for hyaluronic acid ha extraction the extracted polymers turned purple when reacted with 3 3 diethyl 9 methyl 4 5 4 5 dibenzothia carbocyanine bromide which is the standard stain to indicate the presence of ha based on the calibration curve with the commercial ha standard provided in the kit the ha content in aerobic granular sludge was determined as 294 22 Î¼g g in structural eps the ha content was much lower with 15 6 Î¼g g in addition the ftir spectra of the extracted ha from granular sludge ha extracted from eps was not analyzed by ftir due to its low amount and the commercial standard were compared as shown in fig 3 they were similar in the peak at 3447 cm 1 and 3150 cm 1 are attributed to nh and oh stretching region the peak at 2925 cm 1 can be attributed to stretching vibration of ch the peak at about 1580 cm 1 corresponds to the amide carbonyl of amino sugar and the peak at 1420 cm 1 is the stretching of coo which refers to the acid group of ha the peak at 1028 cm 1 is attributed to the linkage stretching of c oh de oliveira et al 2017 the peaks at around 3800 cm 1 and 2750 cm 1 which only present in the spectrum of the polymer extracted from granular sludge are probably due to impurities therefore based on the chemical reaction and the ftir spectrum it is confirmed that there is hyaluronic acid like polymer in aerobic granular sludge hyaluronic acid contains glucuronic acid and n acetyl glucosamine as repeating units de oliveira et al 2017 it is reported to be synthesized as an extracellular capsule by a few pathogenic bacteria e g lancefield group a and c streptococci chong et al 2005 the yield of hyaluronic acid through fermentation of group c streptococci can reach to 0 3 g g dry weight chong et al 2005 in comparison the amount of hyaluronic acid in human extracellular matrix is variable approximately 15 150 Î¼g g in lung tissue 500 2500 Î¼g g in articular cartilage and 300 500 Î¼g g in skin cowman et al 2015 kuo 2006 piehl aulin et al 2017 the amount of hyaluronic acid like polymer in aerobic granular sludge is comparable with that in the human skin 3 3 sulfated gags content in aerobic granular sludge and extracted structural eps based on the reaction with the dye 1 9 dimethylmethyene blue dmmb the total sulfated gags in aerobic granular sludge was determined as 31 5 mg g in aerobic granular sludge and 87 6 mg g in structural eps chondroitin 4 sulfate as the standard if the yield of structural eps 253 14 mg g is considered the extracted structural eps contains the major part approximately 71 of the total sulfated gags in aerobic granular sludge it is known that there are five different kinds of sulfated gags in mammals chondroitin sulfate keratan sulfate and dermatan sulfate which contain o sulfated hexosamines heparin and heparan sulfate which contain n sulfated hexosamines thus by determining the ratio between o and n sulfated gags within test samples it is possible to detect the presence of heparin and heparan sulfate the ratio between o and n sulfated gags in granular sludge and in the extracted structural eps is listed in table 1 it seems that the major fraction is o sulfated gags with roughly 10 n sulfated gags in both aerobic granular sludge and the extracted structural eps similar with hyaluronic acid chondroitin and heparosan also called unsulfated heparin can be produced by a few pathogenic bacteria e coli k4 e coli k5 pasteurella multoccida type f and type d avibacterium paragallinarum deangelis 2012 however those microbial chondroitin and heparosan are not sulfated moreover neither of them are covalently bound to proteins in comparison the chondroitin and heparin in mammals are sulfated and are covalently bound to proteins deangelis 2012 aerobic granular sludge and the structural eps contain sulfated gags which are different from the gags produced by pathogenic bacteria reported in literatures to further understand if these sulfated gags are covalently bound to proteins two different proteases were applied to digest the proteins in the extracted structural eps in sequence nevertheless after such intense protease digestion there was still absorbance at both 215 nm and 280 nm in the ion exchange chromatogram supplemental material 1 absorbance at both 215 nm and 280 nm are considered as the absorbance of carboxylate groups and aromatic amino acids respectively this indicates that there are still polypeptides in the sample even in those fractions that were eluted out with high concentration of sodium chloride 0 8 1 m in fact these fractions were supposed to be highly negatively charged compounds such as sulfated gags to investigate if the sulfated gags are bound to polypeptides the fractions which were eluted out at sodium chloride concentration of 0 8 1 m were collected and combined as one fraction its total sulfated gags content was determined as 264 5 mg g with 77 of o sulfated gags and 24 of n sulfated gags as shown in table 1 therefore this fraction was considered as enriched sulfated gags containing polypeptides further analysis of the sugar monomers and amino acids provided details of the monosaccharides and amino acids of the enriched sulfated gags containing polypeptides the detected monosaccharides were fucose galactose glucose mannose rhamnose xylose galactosamine glucosamine galacturonic acid and glucuronic acid the detected amino acids were alanine glycine isoleucine leucine phenylalanine proline valine serine threonine tyrosine aspartate glutamate lysine and histidine interestingly the weight percentage of the total amino acids decreased from 22 7 w w in structural eps to 1 5 w w in the enriched polypeptides fraction but amino acids could not be entirely removed by the intense protease digestion apparently with both complex sugar monomers and amino acids existing together the enriched sulfated gags containing polypeptides are glycopolypeptides therefore different from the gags produced by pathogenic bacteria the gags except for hyaluronic acid like polymers in aerobic granular sludge were both sulfated and covalently bound to polypeptides 3 4 enzymatic digestion of the enriched sulfated gags containing polypeptides fraction in order to study if there was chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate heparin in the enriched sulfated gags containing polypeptide fraction the sample was digested with heparinase i iii and chondroitinase abc after enzymatic digestion the amount of total sulfated gags was decreased by 54 and 43 respectively indicating the enriched fraction was sensitive to the digestion with heparinase i iii and chondroitinase abc unfortunately disaccharides were not detected by the follow up hilic ms analysis data not shown after the enzymatic digestion which was different from the property of the chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate heparin from mammals the reason could be there are hydrolysis sites which can be recognized by those enzymes recognition sites of these two enzymes are provided in supplemental material 2 but disaccharides may not be the final product of the enzymatic digestion of the enriched glycopolypeptides fraction therefore there were sulfated gags like polymers such as chondroitin sulfate like and heparan sulfate heparin like polymers in aerobic granular sludge 3 5 visualization of the location of sulfated gags like polymers and other glycoconjugates in aerobic granular sludge the location of the sulfated gags like polymers in the granules was of interest in order to illustrate their spatial distribution and to understand their function the visualization was conducted by heparin red staining of the whole granule fig 4 heparin red is a fluorescent molecular probe it is used for direct detection of heparins in blood plasma heparin red is a polycationic probe once there are polyanionic macromolecules e g heparin the heparin red probe forms supramolecular complex aggregation at the polyanionic template fig 4 in this way it is possible to visualize the location of the polyanionic macromolecules based on the fluorescence of the probe moreover it is important to note that the fluorescence intensity of heparin red probe is quenched once it forms stable aggregates on the polyanionic chains thus opposite to the normal fluorescence stains using heparin red a low signal intensity demonstrates a strong binding of the probe warttinger et al 2016a as shown in fig 5 the distribution of negatively charged polymers in aerobic granular sludge can be mapped by heparin red staining the heparin red hr images are presented using a look up table in which the pixel intensities are color coded as very low pixel intensities in blue no binding of hr high pixel intensities in red binding of hr and intermediate pixel intensities in green strong binding of hr due to quenching according to literature the fluorescent signal of heparin red is quenched when the negative charge density of the polyanionic macromolecules is higher than 0 81 per monosaccharide warttinger et al 2016a 2016b above this threshold the higher the negative charge intensity the lower the fluorescent intensity for example the charge density of chondroitin sulfate in bloodplasma is 0 70 per monosaccharide while the charge density of heparin is 1 7 per monosaccharide and heparan sulfate 1 per monosaccharide da costa et al 2017 warttinger et al 2016a heparin red does not bind chondroitin sulfate in bloodplasma but heparin and heparan sulfate with heparin resulting in the lower fluorescent intensity warttinger et al 2016b therefore the green colour region in fig 5 is where the charge density of the polyanionic macromolucles is higher than 0 81 per monosaccharide the lower the fluorescent intensity the higher the charge density it was observed that the negatively charged macromolecules were not only present in the microcolonies where the typical globular structures with the size around 10 20 Î¼m can be identified red but at the outer boundary of the microcolonies and also in the extracellular matrix in between the colonies green fig 5 a b and c in the microcolonies the bacterial cells are not visible indicating heparin red rather stained the capsular region or the space in between capsules fig 5 c and d on top of that since the lower the intensity of the signal is the higher the negative charge density is the differences in brightness indicated various negative charge levels of the macromolecules fig 5d was representative for areas showing microcolonies with a high degree of quenching green as a result signal intensity and resolution appeared to be rather low but indicated a strong binding of the heparin red probe and a high level of negative charge density furthermore as gags contain a hexosamine either n acetyl glucosamine or n acetyl galactosamine as part of their repeating structure the locations of glycoconjugates with n acetyl glucosamine or n acetyl galactosamine were visualized by staining with different lectins fig 6 it was observed that the hexosamine containing glycoconjugates were located in the microcolonies fig 6a and 6e as well as in the extracellular matrix fig 6d and 6f in the microcolonies the bacterial cells were not visible indicating those hexosamine containing glycoconjugates rather stay in the capsular region or the space in between capsules which is in line with the result from heparin red staining fig 5d 4 discussion 4 1 gags like polymers in aerobic granular sludge in the current research it was confirmed that there were gags like polymers in aerobic granular sludge such as hyaluronic acid like chondroitin sulfate like and heparan sulfate heparin like polymers different from those produced by pathogenic bacteria the chondroitin and heparan heparin like polymers in aerobic granules were sulfated and covalently bound to polypeptides sulfated glycoconjugates were reported in a few eps related studies in different granular sludge in anaerobic granular sludge high molecular weight proteoglycan like and sulfated proteoglycan like substance were found in the bound eps bourven et al 2015 in the extracted structural eps of anammox granular sludge a glycoprotein with the molecular weight at around 12 kda contained neutral sugar carboxyl and sulfated glycoconjugates boleij et al 2018 in aerobic granular sludge enriched with ammonium oxidizing bacteria there were glycosylated amyloid like proteins which have glycocconjugates of neutral sugar carboxyl groups and sulfate groups in the structural eps lin et al 2018 the presence of both carboxyl and sulfate groups in those epss implies the possible existence of sulfated gags like polymers moreover all those reported glycoconjugates were linked with proteins thus one could reasonably assume that the existence of sulfated gags like polymers e g chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate heparin covalently bound to proteins might be a common phenomenon in granular sludge biofilms 4 2 potential role of gags like polymers in granular sludge it is interesting to look at the distribution of gags in nature the microbial production of gags has only been studied in certain pathogenic bacteria the gags produced by streptococcus escherichia and pasteurella are similar or identical to the backbone of vertebrate polymers thus the immune system of higher organisms fails to recognize the capsules from those pathogens as a foreign entity and consequently no antibodies are formed to kill the microbes whitfield and robert 1999 basically the gags containing capsule is a camouflage the gags produced by those pathogenic bacteria are neither sulfated nor covalently bound to proteins deangelis 2002 fresh water and land plants do not contain any sulfated glycoconjugates extracellularly marine macroalgae produce gag mimetics sulfated polysaccharides consist of only neutral sugars instead of hexosamine and uronic acids these gag mimetics are not covalently bound to proteins vasconcelos and pomin 2017 invertebrates generally produce the same types of gags as vertebrates except that hyaluronic acid is not present and the chondroitin chains tend to be non sulfated lindahl et al 2017 in comparison vertebrate cells produce gags and secrete them into the ecm or incorporate them into the plasma membrane alberts and johnson 2002 gags are crucial for the pericellular space in which they can define physical properties of tissues or adjust biological functions of cells da costa et al 2017 within the properties of gags the negative charge essential to all gags is paramount in general the negative charge of gags is linked to the sulfate groups the only exception is hyaluronic acid here the negative charge is only originating from glucuronic acid da costa et al 2017 the gags in the ecm of animals are able to attract cations and to bind water molecules prydz 2015 hydrated gag gels have long been known to play an important role in the absorption of pressure changes in joints and tissues proteoglycans with its sulfated gags in the extracellular matrix were discovered to influence cellular signaling largely through electrostatic interactions with charged proteins such as growth factor morphogens and other chemokines acting as a molecular sponge to embed those proteins gandhi and mancera 2008 lim and temenoff 2013 prydz 2015 looking at the evolution of gags it seems that the gags like polymers in aerobic granular sludge resemble vertebrates gags due to the presence of hyaluronic acid like polymers the sulfation and the covalent bond with proteins at this point it is logical to speculate that the function of gags like polymers in granules is similar as that in vertebrates such as attracting cations forming a hydrogel binding proteins and signaling in biological processes further research should focus on finding out the important functions of gags like polymers in granular sludge biofilm 4 3 development of proper methodologies to analyze gags like polymers in granular sludge biofilm gags are one of the major components in mammalian extracellular matrix gags like polymers were found in aerobic granular sludge by combining various analytical approaches sds page with alcian blue staining at ph 2 5 and 1 ftir commercial extracellular matrix assays for use with mammalian cells monosaccharide and amino acid analysis enzymatic digestion and specific in situ visualization by heparin red fluorescent probe and lectin staining fig 1 the resemblance to vertebrate gags implies that the eps in granular sludge biofilm is far more complicated than it is currently appreciated thus appropriate methodologies are needed aiming at studying eps components based on their important functions rather than superficially measuring the relative amount of proteins and polysaccharides on top of that as it is gradually clear that protein glycosylation is a widespread phenomenon in eps the complexity of glycoconjugates imparts eps not only various functions but also complicates in the analysis for example sulfated gags can have variable sulfation patterns possible structural variations of sulfated gags result in gags being one of the most complex groups of macromolecules discovered in nature zamfir et al 2011 it is reported that gags activity is dictated by sulfation patterns gama et al 2006 tully et al 2004 thus obtaining the detailed molecular structure and the sulfation pattern of the gags like polymers in granular sludge biofilm will facilitate the understanding of eps functionality and stability at this aspect integrated and multi disciplinary analyses such as ms nmr and metagenomic analysis seviour et al 2019 are significantly required 5 conclusion besides pathogenic bacteria microorganisms in aerobic granular sludge produce hyaluronic acid like and sulfated gags like polymers in the extracellular matrix the gags like polymers in aerobic granules are different from those produced by pathogenic bacteria but resemble those produced by vertebrates there are both hyaluronic acid like polymers and sulfated gags like polymers further the sulfated gags like polymers are bound to proteins the eps in granular sludge biofilm is far more complicated than it is

18380,glycosaminoglycans gags are linear heteropolysaccharides containing a derivative of an amino sugar the possibility of the presence of gags in aerobic granular sludge was studied by combining sds page with alcian blue staining at ph 2 5 and 1 ftir mammalian hyaluronic acid and sulfated gag analysis kits enzymatic digestion and specific in situ visualization by heparin red and lectin staining gags including hyaluronic acid like and sulfated gags like polymers were found in aerobic granular sludge the sulfated gags like polymers contained chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate heparin based on their sensitivity to the digestion by chondroitinase abc and heparinase i iii heparin red and lectin staining demonstrated that the sulfated gags like polymers were not only present in the extracellular matrix but also filled in the space between the cells inside the microcolonies the gags like polymers in aerobic granules were different from those produced by pathogenic bacteria but resemble those produced by vertebrates findings reported here and in previous studies on granular sludge described in literature indicate that gags like polymers might be widespread in granular sludge biofilm and contribute to the stability of these systems the extracellular polymeric substances eps in granular sludge biofilm are far more complicated than they are currently appreciated integrated and multidisciplinary analyses are significantly required to study the eps graphical abstract image 1 keywords glycosaminoglycans sulfation hyaluronic acid extracellular polymeric substances aerobic granular sludge biofilm 1 introduction the aerobic granular sludge process is a wastewater treatment process which gained increasing popularity as an alternative to the conventional flocculent sludge processes pronk et al 2015 the sludge granules consist of bacteria embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps lin et al 2010 seviour et al 2009 the eps not only provide a structural matrix in which cells can be embedded but also have various compositions and properties flemming and wingender 2010 recent studies on eps composition revealed that not only proteins and polysaccharides are the components of eps but complex glycoconjugates are present as well e g a highly abundant glycoprotein carrying a heterogeneous o glycan structure was identified in the eps of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox granular sludge enriched with ca brocadia sapporoensis boleij et al 2018 glycoproteins were hypothesized to be strongly involved in the structure of anammox granules having a similar role as glycans in the extracellular matrix ecm of multicellular organisms like vertebrates boleij et al 2018 varki 2017 in seawater adapted aerobic granular sludge sialic acids present as sialoglycoproteins were widely distributed in the eps sialic acids were covering the penultimate galactose unit by this providing stability of the sugar chain de graaff et al 2019 glycoconjugates have also been found in saline anaerobic granular sludge the major sugar monomers reported were mannose and n acetyl galactosamine gagliano et al 2018 the amino sugars galactosamine and glucosamine the uronic acids glucuronic acid and galacturonic acid and several neutral sugars were identified as monomers in the structural eps of aerobic granular sludge felz et al 2019 the presence of amino sugars and glucuronic acid as well as the highly negative charge of structural eps and their gel forming ability felz et al 2016 indicate that glycosaminoglycans gags might be another type of glycoconjugates in the eps of granular sludge gags are heteropolysaccharides that contain a hexosamine either glucosamine or galactosamine generally n acetylated and a uronic acid glucuronic iduronic acid or galactose as part of their repeating unit esko and lindahl 2001 silbert and sugumaran 2002 gags are building blocks of the ecm in mammalian cells and can be covalently bound to proteins forming a large and negatively charged proteoglycan lindahl et al 2017 williams 1998 by attracting cations and water molecules these macromolecules form a hydrated gel proteoglycans are an important constituent of the connective tissue forming the ground substance which facilitates structural support and enables the diffusion of soluble compounds e g nutrients or signaling molecules and cell migration within the ecm williams 1998 it is interesting to investigate if there are similar macromolecules present in the eps of granular sludge due to the fact that amino sugars e g hexosamines do not react with phenol sulfuric acid assay felz et al 2019 manzi and esko 1995 the presence of gags might be overlooked by the commonly used colorimetric methods thus it is significantly necessary to establish appropriate methodologies to investigate the possible existence of gags in granular sludge or biofilms in the current research it is assumed that there are various gags e g hyaluronic acid chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate heparin in the eps of aerobic granular sludge which are similar to the polymers forming the ecm in higher organisms their possible presence was evaluated by commercial extracellular matrix assays for use with mammalian cells tissues and fluids specific enzymatic digestion and ftir the location of highly negatively charged macromolecules e g sulfated gags in granular sludge was visualized by heparin red staining 2 material and methods the analysis of gags like polymers including hyaluronic acid like and sulfated gags like polymers in aerobic granular sludge was summarized in fig 1 2 1 aerobic granular sludge collection aerobic granular sludge was collected from the municipal wastewater treatment plant dinxperlo in the netherlands which is operated according to the nereda technology collected granular sludge was sieved washed with demi water frozen at 80 c and lyophilized 2 2 extraction of structural eps from

lyophilized the organic and ash fractions were quantified according to the standard methods apha 1998 structural eps were analyzed by sds page as described in boleij et al 2018 using nupage novex 4 12 bis tris gels invitrogen the gels were stained by following three different staining protocols proteins were visualized with coomassie blue staining colloidal blue staining kit invitrogen according to manufacturer s instructions glycoprotein staining was performed based on the periodic acid schiff pas method using the thermo scientific piercie glycoproteins staining kit which is specific for glycans containing vicinal hydroxyl groups for staining of carboxyl and sulfate groups shori et al 2001 alcian blue staining at ph 2 5 carboxyl rich glycoconjugates and or sulfated glycoconjugates and ph 1 0 sulfated glycoconjugates were performed separately 2 3 analysis of hyaluronic acid content in aerobic granular sludge and the structural eps the hyaluronic acid content in both lyophilized aerobic granular sludge and isolated structural eps was measured by following the protocol of the purple jelley hyaluronan assay provided by biocolor uk in brief the sample 15 mg dry weight was digested by proteinase k 0 5 mg ml overnight at 55 c after centrifugation at 12 000 g for 10 min the supernatant was collected hyaluronic acid in the supernatant was recovered by a sequence of precipitation steps using ethanol saturated with sodium acetate and cetylpyridinium chloride containing sodium chloride afterwards hyaluronic acid was precipitated by ethanol 98 and fully hydrated with 100 Î¼l of water the extracted hyaluronic acid gel was quantified by using 3 3 diethyl 9 methyl 4 5 4 5 dibenzothia carbocyanine bromide supplied in 55 solution of dimethyl sulfoxide the fourier transform infra red ftir spectrum of the recovered hyaluronic acid and the hyaluronic acid standard extracted from rooster comb was recorded on a ftir spectrometer perkin elmer shelton usa at room temperature with a wavenumber range from 600 cm 1 4000 cm 1 2 4 analysis of sulfated gags in aerobic granular sludge and structural eps the sulfated gags content in both lyophilized aerobic granular sludge and structural eps was measured by following the protocol of the blyscan glycosaminoglycan assay provided by biocolor uk in brief the sample 1 5 mg dry weight was digested by papain extraction reagent overnight at 65 c after centrifugation at 10 000 g for 10 min the supernatant was collected total sulfated gags were quantified by using the blyscan dye reagent containing 1 9 dimethyl methylene blue dmmb with bovine tracheal chondroitin 4 sulfate as the standard in addition the ratio of o and n sulfated gags within the test samples was determined by following the nitrous acid cleavage method nitrous acid reacts with the n sulfated d glucosamine and cleaves the n sulfated site bienkowski and conrad 1985 after this reaction the amount of o sulfated gags was measured again using the blyscan protocol the difference between the total sulfated gags and the amount of o sulfated gags gave the amount of n sulfated gags in animal tissue hyaluronic acid is a non sulfated gag and is not covalently bound to proteins in contrast the other gags are sulfated and are covalently bound to a protein backbone to form proteoglycans lindahl et al 2017 in order to study if the sulfated gags in granular sludge are also covalently bound to proteins proteinase digestion was performed on structural eps to remove proteins which are not covalently bound to gags 2 4 1 proteinase digestion of structural eps structural eps were digested with papain and proteinase k in sequence papain digestion was performed as described in the blyscan protocol biocolor uk lyophilized structural eps 200 mg was digested in 100 ml papain extraction reagent containing 5 mg papain at 65 c for 24 h 5 mg papain was added afterwards and the mixture was incubated at 65 c for another 24 h the mixture was heated to 100 c for 5 min to deactivate the enzyme and dialyzed overnight against demineralized water in a dialysis bag molecular weight cut off mwco 3 5 kda subsequently the dialyzed mixture was further digested by proteinase k according to the manufacturer s instructions with modifications 5 mg proteinase k in 50 mm tris ph 8 4 mm calcium chloride and 10 mm sodium chloride at 37 c for 24 h with gentle mixing after 24 h another 5 mg of proteinase k were added and the digestion continued for 24 h when the digestion was finished the mixture was heated to 100 c for 5 min to deactivate the enzyme and dialyzed overnight against demineralized water in a dialysis bag mwco 3 5 kda consequently the content inside the dialysis bag was centrifuged at 4 000 g for 20 min and the supernatant was collected and lyophilized 2 4 2 enrichment of sulfated gags containing polypeptides by ion exchange chromatography lyophilized protease digested structural eps were dissolved in 7 m urea containing 30

nm which were eluted at sodium chloride concentrations of 0 8 1 m were combined supplemental material 1 dialyzed against demineralized water in a dialysis bag with 3 5 kda mwco frozen at 80 c and lyophilized the reason of collecting these specific fractions is as follows 1 there is still a signal of the peptide bond which indicates the presence of polypeptides 2 at the same time the sodium chloride concentration mainly cl is high enough to exchange compounds that contain highly negatively charged groups e g sulfated gags containing o sulfate groups and n sulfate groups sulfated gags content of the combined fraction was quantified by the blyscan kit biocolor uk 2 4 3 monosaccharide and amino acid analysis of the enriched sulfated gags containing polypeptides fraction

gerstel mÃ¼hlheim germany straight glass liners with glass wool were utilized agilent ms was operated in selected ion monitoring mode and the quantification of the amino acids was performed by isotope dilution mass spectrometry 2 4 4 enzymatic digestion of the enriched sulfated gags containing polypeptides with chondroitinase abc and heparinase i iii in order to understand if there were chondroitin sulfate and or heparan sulfate including heparin in the enriched sulfate gags chondroitinase abc from proteus vulgaris sigma aldrich and a blend of heparinase i iii from flavobacterium heparinum sigma aldrich were used respectively for digestion sigma aldrich 2007 the specificity of the enzymes is described in supplemental material 2 samples 1 mg ml were digested according to manufacturer s

staining using heparin red was done according to the supplier s data sheet briefly 8 8 Î¼l heparin red and 1 ml enhancer solution were mixed and added to the granules for 1 h other glycoconjugates were examined on the basis of fluorescence lectin bar coding with subsequent fluorescence lectin binding analysis neu and kuhlicke 2017 for this purpose all commercially available lectins fitc fluorescein alexa488 were screened and individually tested for binding granules were stained with lectins 0 1 mg ml for 20 min at room temperature in the dark and washed 3 times in order to remove the unbound probe for both stainings the granules were washed with tap water and mounted in coverwell chambers thermofisher with various spacers 1 1 7 2 mm to keep the original shape of the granule the samples were examined at a leica sp5x instrument leica germany equipped with an upright microscope and a super continuum light source the microscope was controlled by the las af software version 2 4 1 confocal images were recorded as single scan or serial scan step size 1 or 0 5 Î¼m using a 25x na 0 95 or a 63x na 1 2 water immersion lens laser excitation was at 480 nm and 567 nm emission was from

granular sludge and analysis the structural eps extracted from aerobic granular sludge represented 253 14 mg g volatile content of the sludge the glycoconjugates in the extracted eps were further characterized using sds page in combination with different staining protocols following coomassie blue staining a smear was observed with the molecular weight range from 50 kda to 10 kda fig 2 lane 1 no clear bands could be seen alcian blue staining was applied with ph 2 5 and ph 1 0 fig 2 lane 2 and 3 at ph 2 5 both carboxyl rich glycoconjugates coo and sulfated glycoconjugates so3 were stained while with ph 1 0 only the sulfated glycoconjugates were stained shori et al 2001 a smear appeared at the high molecular weight range above 235 kda with decreasing intensity until 70 kda at both ph 2 5 and ph 1 with the intensity of the smear at ph 2 5 higher than that at ph 1 implying there are both carboxyl rich glycoconjugates and sulfated glycoconjugates in the structural eps in addition part of the structural eps were retained in the wells it was strongly stained by coomassie blue pas and alcian blue both at ph 2 5 and 1 indicating that it contained proteins polypeptides carboxyl rich glycoconjugates and sulfated glycoconjugates as well 3 2 hyaluronic acid content in aerobic granular sludge and extracted structural eps the lyophilized granular sludge as well as the extracted structural eps was treated according to the protocol provided in the commercial kit for hyaluronic acid ha extraction the extracted polymers turned purple when reacted with 3 3 diethyl 9 methyl 4 5 4 5 dibenzothia carbocyanine bromide which is the standard stain to indicate the presence of ha based on the calibration curve with the commercial ha standard provided in the kit the ha content in aerobic granular sludge was determined as 294 22 Î¼g g in structural eps the ha content was much lower with 15 6 Î¼g g in addition the ftir spectra of the extracted ha from granular sludge ha extracted from eps was not analyzed by ftir due to its low amount and the commercial standard were compared as shown in fig 3 they were similar in the peak at 3447 cm 1 and 3150 cm 1 are attributed to nh and oh stretching region the peak at 2925 cm 1 can be attributed to stretching vibration of ch the peak at about 1580 cm 1 corresponds to the amide carbonyl of amino sugar and the peak at 1420 cm 1 is the stretching of coo which refers to the acid group of ha the peak at 1028 cm 1 is attributed to the linkage stretching of c oh de oliveira et al 2017 the peaks at around 3800 cm 1 and 2750 cm 1 which only present in the spectrum of the polymer extracted from granular sludge are probably due to impurities therefore based on the chemical reaction and the ftir spectrum it is confirmed that there is hyaluronic acid like polymer in aerobic granular sludge hyaluronic acid contains glucuronic acid and n acetyl glucosamine as repeating units de oliveira et al 2017 it is reported to be synthesized as an extracellular capsule by a few pathogenic bacteria e g lancefield group a and c streptococci chong et al 2005 the yield of hyaluronic acid through fermentation of group c streptococci can reach to 0 3 g g dry weight chong et al 2005 in comparison the amount of hyaluronic acid in human extracellular matrix is variable approximately 15 150 Î¼g g in lung tissue 500 2500 Î¼g g in articular cartilage and 300 500 Î¼g g in skin cowman et al 2015 kuo 2006 piehl aulin et al 2017 the amount of hyaluronic acid like polymer in aerobic granular sludge is comparable with that in the human skin 3 3 sulfated gags content in aerobic granular sludge and extracted structural eps based on the reaction with the dye 1 9 dimethylmethyene blue dmmb the total sulfated gags in aerobic granular sludge was determined as 31 5 mg g in aerobic granular sludge and 87 6 mg g in structural eps chondroitin 4 sulfate as the standard if the yield of structural eps 253 14 mg g is considered the extracted structural eps contains the major part approximately 71 of the total sulfated gags in aerobic granular sludge it is known that there are five different kinds of sulfated gags in mammals chondroitin sulfate keratan sulfate and dermatan sulfate which contain o sulfated hexosamines heparin and heparan sulfate which contain n sulfated hexosamines thus by determining the ratio between o and n sulfated gags within test samples it is possible to detect the presence of heparin and heparan sulfate the ratio between o and n sulfated gags in granular sludge and in the extracted structural eps is listed in table 1 it seems that the major fraction is o sulfated gags with roughly 10 n sulfated gags in both aerobic granular sludge and the extracted structural eps similar with hyaluronic acid chondroitin and heparosan also called unsulfated heparin can be produced by a few pathogenic bacteria e coli k4 e coli k5 pasteurella multoccida type f and type d avibacterium paragallinarum deangelis 2012 however those microbial chondroitin and heparosan are not sulfated moreover neither of them are covalently bound to proteins in comparison the chondroitin and heparin in mammals are sulfated and are covalently bound to proteins deangelis 2012 aerobic granular sludge and the structural eps contain sulfated gags which are different from the gags produced by pathogenic bacteria reported in literatures to further understand if these sulfated gags are covalently bound to proteins two different proteases were applied to digest the proteins in the extracted structural eps in sequence nevertheless after such intense protease digestion there was still absorbance at both 215 nm and 280 nm in the ion exchange chromatogram supplemental material 1 absorbance at both 215 nm and 280 nm are considered as the absorbance of carboxylate groups and aromatic amino acids respectively this indicates that there are still polypeptides in the sample even in those fractions that were eluted out with high concentration of sodium chloride 0 8 1 m in fact these fractions were supposed to be highly negatively charged compounds such as sulfated gags to investigate if the sulfated gags are bound to polypeptides the fractions which were eluted out at sodium chloride concentration of 0 8 1 m were collected and combined as one fraction its total sulfated gags content was determined as 264 5 mg g with 77 of o sulfated gags and 24 of n sulfated gags as shown in table 1 therefore this fraction was considered as enriched sulfated gags containing polypeptides further analysis of the sugar monomers and amino acids provided details of the monosaccharides and amino acids of the enriched sulfated gags containing polypeptides the detected monosaccharides were fucose galactose glucose mannose rhamnose xylose galactosamine glucosamine galacturonic acid and glucuronic acid the detected amino acids were alanine glycine isoleucine leucine phenylalanine proline valine serine threonine tyrosine aspartate glutamate lysine and histidine interestingly the weight percentage of the total amino acids decreased from 22 7 w w in structural eps to 1 5 w w in the enriched polypeptides fraction but amino acids could not be entirely removed by the intense protease digestion apparently with both complex sugar monomers and amino acids existing together the enriched sulfated gags containing polypeptides are glycopolypeptides therefore different from the gags produced by pathogenic bacteria the gags except for hyaluronic acid like polymers in aerobic granular sludge were both sulfated and covalently bound to polypeptides 3 4 enzymatic digestion of the enriched sulfated gags containing polypeptides fraction in order to study if there was chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate heparin in the enriched sulfated gags containing polypeptide fraction the sample was digested with heparinase i iii and chondroitinase abc after enzymatic digestion the amount of total sulfated gags was decreased by 54 and 43 respectively indicating the enriched fraction was sensitive to the digestion with heparinase i iii and chondroitinase abc unfortunately disaccharides were not detected by the follow up hilic ms analysis data not shown after the enzymatic digestion which was different from the property of the chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate heparin from mammals the reason could be there are hydrolysis sites which can be recognized by those enzymes recognition sites of these two enzymes are provided in supplemental material 2 but disaccharides may not be the final product of the enzymatic digestion of the enriched glycopolypeptides fraction therefore there were sulfated gags like polymers such as chondroitin sulfate like and heparan sulfate heparin like polymers in aerobic granular sludge 3 5 visualization of the location of sulfated gags like polymers and other glycoconjugates in aerobic granular sludge the location of the sulfated gags like polymers in the granules was of interest in order to illustrate their spatial distribution and to understand their function the visualization was conducted by heparin red staining of the whole granule fig 4 heparin red is a fluorescent molecular probe it is used for direct detection of heparins in blood plasma heparin red is a polycationic probe once there are polyanionic macromolecules e g heparin the heparin red probe forms supramolecular complex aggregation at the polyanionic template fig 4 in this way it is possible to visualize the location of the polyanionic macromolecules based on the fluorescence of the probe moreover it is important to note that the fluorescence intensity of heparin red probe is quenched once it forms stable aggregates on the polyanionic chains thus opposite to the normal fluorescence stains using heparin red a low signal intensity demonstrates a strong binding of the probe warttinger et al 2016a as shown in fig 5 the distribution of negatively charged polymers in aerobic granular sludge can be mapped by heparin red staining the heparin red hr images are presented using a look up table in which the pixel intensities are color coded as very low pixel intensities in blue no binding of hr high pixel intensities in red binding of hr and intermediate pixel intensities in green strong binding of hr due to quenching according to literature the fluorescent signal of heparin red is quenched when the negative charge density of the polyanionic macromolecules is higher than 0 81 per monosaccharide warttinger et al 2016a 2016b above this threshold the higher the negative charge intensity the lower the fluorescent intensity for example the charge density of chondroitin sulfate in bloodplasma is 0 70 per monosaccharide while the charge density of heparin is 1 7 per monosaccharide and heparan sulfate 1 per monosaccharide da costa et al 2017 warttinger et al 2016a heparin red does not bind chondroitin sulfate in bloodplasma but heparin and heparan sulfate with heparin resulting in the lower fluorescent intensity warttinger et al 2016b therefore the green colour region in fig 5 is where the charge density of the polyanionic macromolucles is higher than 0 81 per monosaccharide the lower the fluorescent intensity the higher the charge density it was observed that the negatively charged macromolecules were not only present in the microcolonies where the typical globular structures with the size around 10 20 Î¼m can be identified red but at the outer boundary of the microcolonies and also in the extracellular matrix in between the colonies green fig 5 a b and c in the microcolonies the bacterial cells are not visible indicating heparin red rather stained the capsular region or the space in between capsules fig 5 c and d on top of that since the lower the intensity of the signal is the higher the negative charge density is the differences in brightness indicated various negative charge levels of the macromolecules fig 5d was representative for areas showing microcolonies with a high degree of quenching green as a result signal intensity and resolution appeared to be rather low but indicated a strong binding of the heparin red probe and a high level of negative charge density furthermore as gags contain a hexosamine either n acetyl glucosamine or n acetyl galactosamine as part of their repeating structure the locations of glycoconjugates with n acetyl glucosamine or n acetyl galactosamine were visualized by staining with different lectins fig 6 it was observed that the hexosamine containing glycoconjugates were located in the microcolonies fig 6a and 6e as well as in the extracellular matrix fig 6d and 6f in the microcolonies the bacterial cells were not visible indicating those hexosamine containing glycoconjugates rather stay in the capsular region or the space in between capsules which is in line with the result from heparin red staining fig 5d 4 discussion 4 1 gags like polymers in aerobic granular sludge in the current research it was confirmed that there were gags like polymers in aerobic granular sludge such as hyaluronic acid like chondroitin sulfate like and heparan sulfate heparin like polymers different from those produced by pathogenic bacteria the chondroitin and heparan heparin like polymers in aerobic granules were sulfated and covalently bound to polypeptides sulfated glycoconjugates were reported in a few eps related studies in different granular sludge in anaerobic granular sludge high molecular weight proteoglycan like and sulfated proteoglycan like substance were found in the bound eps bourven et al 2015 in the extracted structural eps of anammox granular sludge a glycoprotein with the molecular weight at around 12 kda contained neutral sugar carboxyl and sulfated glycoconjugates boleij et al 2018 in aerobic granular sludge enriched with ammonium oxidizing bacteria there were glycosylated amyloid like proteins which have glycocconjugates of neutral sugar carboxyl groups and sulfate groups in the structural eps lin et al 2018 the presence of both carboxyl and sulfate groups in those epss implies the possible existence of sulfated gags like polymers moreover all those reported glycoconjugates were linked with proteins thus one could reasonably assume that the existence of sulfated gags like polymers e g chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate heparin covalently bound to proteins might be a common phenomenon in granular sludge biofilms 4 2 potential role of gags like polymers in granular sludge it is interesting to look at the distribution of gags in nature the microbial production of gags has only been studied in certain pathogenic bacteria the gags produced by streptococcus escherichia and pasteurella are similar or identical to the backbone of vertebrate polymers thus the immune system of higher organisms fails to recognize the capsules from those pathogens as a foreign entity and consequently no antibodies are formed to kill the microbes whitfield and robert 1999 basically the gags containing capsule is a camouflage the gags produced by those pathogenic bacteria are neither sulfated nor covalently bound to proteins deangelis 2002 fresh water and land plants do not contain any sulfated glycoconjugates extracellularly marine macroalgae produce gag mimetics sulfated polysaccharides consist of only neutral sugars instead of hexosamine and uronic acids these gag mimetics are not covalently bound to proteins vasconcelos and pomin 2017 invertebrates generally produce the same types of gags as vertebrates except that hyaluronic acid is not present and the chondroitin chains tend to be non sulfated lindahl et al 2017 in comparison vertebrate cells produce gags and secrete them into the ecm or incorporate them into the plasma membrane alberts and johnson 2002 gags are crucial for the pericellular space in which they can define physical properties of tissues or adjust biological functions of cells da costa et al 2017 within the properties of gags the negative charge essential to all gags is paramount in general the negative charge of gags is linked to the sulfate groups the only exception is hyaluronic acid here the negative charge is only originating from glucuronic acid da costa et al 2017 the gags in the ecm of animals are able to attract cations and to bind water molecules prydz 2015 hydrated gag gels have long been known to play an important role in the absorption of pressure changes in joints and tissues proteoglycans with its sulfated gags in the extracellular matrix were discovered to influence cellular signaling largely through electrostatic interactions with charged proteins such as growth factor morphogens and other chemokines acting as a molecular sponge to embed those proteins gandhi and mancera 2008 lim and temenoff 2013 prydz 2015 looking at the evolution of gags it seems that the gags like polymers in aerobic granular sludge resemble vertebrates gags due to the presence of hyaluronic acid like polymers the sulfation and the covalent bond with proteins at this point it is logical to speculate that the function of gags like polymers in granules is similar as that in vertebrates such as attracting cations forming a hydrogel binding proteins and signaling in biological processes further research should focus on finding out the important functions of gags like polymers in granular sludge biofilm 4 3 development of proper methodologies to analyze gags like polymers in granular sludge biofilm gags are one of the major components in mammalian extracellular matrix gags like polymers were found in aerobic granular sludge by combining various analytical approaches sds page with alcian blue staining at ph 2 5 and 1 ftir commercial extracellular matrix assays for use with mammalian cells monosaccharide and amino acid analysis enzymatic digestion and specific in situ visualization by heparin red fluorescent probe and lectin staining fig 1 the resemblance to vertebrate gags implies that the eps in granular sludge biofilm is far more complicated than it is currently appreciated thus appropriate methodologies are needed aiming at studying eps components based on their important functions rather than superficially measuring the relative amount of proteins and polysaccharides on top of that as it is gradually clear that protein glycosylation is a widespread phenomenon in eps the complexity of glycoconjugates imparts eps not only various functions but also complicates in the analysis for example sulfated gags can have variable sulfation patterns possible structural variations of sulfated gags result in gags being one of the most complex groups of macromolecules discovered in nature zamfir et al 2011 it is reported that gags activity is dictated by sulfation patterns gama et al 2006 tully et al 2004 thus obtaining the detailed molecular structure and the sulfation pattern of the gags like polymers in granular sludge biofilm will facilitate the understanding of eps functionality and stability at this aspect integrated and multi disciplinary analyses such as ms nmr and metagenomic analysis seviour et al 2019 are significantly required 5 conclusion besides pathogenic bacteria microorganisms in aerobic granular sludge produce hyaluronic acid like and sulfated gags like polymers in the extracellular matrix the gags like polymers in aerobic granules are different from those produced by pathogenic bacteria but resemble those produced by vertebrates there are both hyaluronic acid like polymers and sulfated gags like polymers further the sulfated gags like polymers are bound to proteins the eps in granular sludge biofilm is far more complicated than it is

rapidly maturing deep uv leds will undoubtedly play a role in future embodiments as their compact form and instant on off ability enables more flexible and efficient designs abdelwaheb et al 2015 this early stage of uv led device evolution is an opportune time to tailor new design concepts toward specific applications in ways that mercury lamp reactors cannot accommodate at present no formal evaluations of the ability of actual uv showerheads to inactivate obps in shower water or reduce infection rates have been published based on the language used in literature mentioning the concept it appears that the viability of the approach has been theorized using assumed parallels to standard uv disinfection both full scale reactors and commercial point of use uv sterilizers are designed to provide doses that achieve 3 5 log inactivation of planktonic bacteria protozoa and viruses unfortunately these same doses are likely inadequate to treat many obps to the same extent under realistic conditions this is due to their intercalation into complex biological matrices capable of shielding from uvc photons including biofilm exopolymer particles priscilla 2010 protozoan hosts brieland et al 1997 cirillo et al 1997 1999 steinert et al 1998 thomas et al 2004 and expelled vacuoles and vesicles from the latter berk et al 1998 chen et al 2004 currently there is a need for more detailed study of bacterial uv dose responses in these matrices particularly for legionella and mycobacteria additionally the effect of continuous sublethal uvc irradiation on obps and biofilm communities within premise plumbing has not been evaluated 3 dose response considerations for the one pass approach there are two possible design paradigms for uv equipped showerheads shown in fig 1 1 those which act as small uv disinfection reactors to inactivate obps in the flowing tap water thereby eliminating the pathogen burden in emitted shower aerosols one pass approach and 2 targeting of the interior showerhead surfaces with lower intensity continuous or periodic irradiation to prevent biofilms from becoming established in the first place the one pass approach is simplest but presents several challenges with the abovementioned shielding matrices being the most glaring table 1 shows literature values for uv dose responses of l pneumophila in planktonic form to monochromatic 253 7 nm radiation low pressure mercury lamp also shown are results of cervero aragÃ³ et al which included irradiation of legionella infected amoebae followed by lysing and viability assay of the bacteria contained within cervero aragÃ³ et al 2014 legionella associated with free living amoebae required 1 5 2 times the uv dose for the same level of inactivation both legionella spp and mycobacteria spp are widely known to infect biofilm grazing protozoa declerck et al 2007 delafont et al 2014 thomas et al 2004 moreover infected amoebae have been found to be an important source of human legionellosis and ntm infections and enhance the virulence of these obps in infecting human monocytes brieland et al 1997 cirillo et al 1997 1999 exocytosis of vesicles bundling hundreds of legionella cells is also carried out by the infected protozoa with unknown consequences to uv susceptibility berk et al 1998 lau and ashbolt 2009 overall the dose requirements shown in table 1 do not indicate any extreme uv resistance but do indicate the planktonic form dose responses would not be useful for precise device design detached biofilm flocs may be an even greater concern with respect to uvc shielding when compared to obps contained within vesicles or free living amoebae while the size of such particles will vary depending on the detachment conditions one may presume that uv photons would need to first penetrate several microns of the attenuating polysaccharides lipopolysaccharides and free nucleic acids that make up biofilm extracellular polymeric substances eps prior to reaching obp cells brown et al 1969 sloughing of biofilms occurs mainly due to hydrodynamic shear which could be especially dramatic during the sudden flushing of showerheads after periods of stagnation presumably the size and quality of detached biofilm flocs varies widely and in the case of l pneuomophila shen et al found that biofilms grown under low residual disinfectant concentrations were more fragile and released more bacteria contained within protective exopolymer particles shen et al 2017 given the depletion of disinfectant residuals in hot water systems brazeau and edwards 2013 biofilms within showerheads may fit this description to our knowledge no studies have quantified the uvc dose response of obps within detached biofilm particles though similar scenarios have been examined analysis of escherichia coli inactivation in discrete secondary wastewater treatment flocs by azimi et al found that per log dose requirements increased by a factor of 6 in some cases with biofilm derived flocs showing a greater shielding effect than those derived from suspended growth azimi et al 2017 bohrerova and linden also showed that the uvc susceptibility of mycobacterium terrae decreased significantly when the cells were aggregated into clumps bohrerova and linden 2006 experiments involving irradiation of pre established biofilms with uvc have revealed shielding effects by the eps gora et al found that 5 times greater dose from 265 nm leds was required for p aeruginosa within biofilms compared to planktonic cells gora et al 2019 legionella also associate with floating biofilms at air water interfaces of air pockets within stagnant plumbing declerck et al 2007 which when disturbed by turbulence may result in particles with properties differing from those of substrate associated origins numerous additional nuances of showerhead irradiation effectiveness might be considered such as reactivation of cells in viable but not culturable states following uv exposure grossi et al 2018 and dose responses of bacteria within amoebae which themselves are within biofilm particles engineering of uv showerheads for a one pass approach must therefore involve consideration of the dose requirements for obps in several matrices that are not typically considered in conventional uv disinfection this is especially true if compact showerhead designs are desired which will rely on small intense irradiation zones for delivering a target dose within short residence times we calculated the mean hydraulic residence times of the showerheads shown in fig 2 a and b to be 0 72 and 0 08 s respectively based on the largest interior chamber volumes and a flow rate of 2 5 gal min such fast exposure would require high power leds to deliver effective doses and performance could be easily impacted by non ideal flow paths and while a given design may deliver sufficient reduction equivalent dose for inactivation of planktonic bacteria the same combinations of uv intensity profile and residence time distribution profile may prove ineffective for obps in realistic matrices 4 continuous irradiation for biofilm prevention the second option for obp control using uv irradiation is via minimization or elimination of biofilm growth on the interior surfaces of showerheads rather than integrating one high intensity irradiation zone targeting disinfection range dose delivery to the bulk water stream numerous smaller uv leds would continuously irradiate the interior surfaces through either direct line of sight or reflections scattering fig 1 advantages of this strategy include 1 potential for greater efficacy in preventing obp infections if biofilms are successfully minimized 2 lower uv intensities would be required since the residence times of surface adhered bacteria are virtually infinite and in turn cooling of the leds may be less challenging and 3 periodic stagnation and water quality fluctuations would have little impact on efficacy when biofilm detachment is not a concern there are of course challenges as well including 1 geometrical difficulties in irradiating all internal surfaces of functional showerheads as is seen in fig 2b 2 continuous or periodic irradiation would likely be required even during stagnation adding to energy consumption 3 bacteria released from upstream premise plumbing may not receive lethal doses and 4 low intensity sub lethal dosing of indirectly irradiated surfaces might result in enhanced biofilm activity by bacteria as a stress response costa et al 2010 while literature exists on the effects of irradiating pre established biofilms argyraki et al 2016 bak et al 2009 li et al 2010 and of uv disinfection pretreatment on subsequent biofilm formation behavior bak et al 2010 lakretz et al 2011 said et al 2011 the intensity range required to prevent biofilm formation on continuously irradiated surfaces is presently unknown 5 form and geometry considerations whether design emphasis is placed on one pass dosing or on surface irradiation we also must consider the primary function of a showerhead which is bathing consumer models can have complex interiors containing valves flow constrictors aerators retainer assemblies and rubber jets all in contact with the water complex designs such as that in fig 2b will hinder obp prevention as intricate internal surfaces would result in line of sight problems for continuous irradiation in the case of a one pass approach some surfaces may be situated in between the irradiation zone and the water outlet over time these areas could eventually foster biofilms even if the led reactor achieves high log inactivation simpler designs with fewer pressure and pulsation settings are likely required for compatibility with an effective uv irradiation component 6 research needs as none of the challenges highlighted herein are insurmountable addressing key knowledge gaps at this stage will advance effective uv showerheads based on rational design first greater statistical understanding of the distribution of common obps in real shower waters among planktonic intra protozoan and biofilm intercalated forms is needed since the nature of this distribution could influence the required dose delivery in one pass systems by orders of magnitudes such data is indispensable next more detailed knowledge of the uv dose responses of obps within each of these matrices is needed experimentally this objective could be challenging as it requires some type of viability assay for obps like l pneumophila and mycobacteria within multispecies consortia log inactivation of all bacteria by uv in a sample is not of great interest and the inactivation of a target obp must be isolated most studies of obps within natural biofilms rely on detection of the organisms presence among other species via qpcr but this technique is not sensitive to viability more innovative methods for determining viability of individual species have been demonstrated using combinations of green fluorescent protein modified organisms fluorescent staining flow cytometry and so called viability qpcr wherein simultaneous species tagging and live dead determination are possible delgado viscogliosi et al 2009 lehtinen et al 2004 we note however that these methods are only able to discern between bacteria with intact or ruptured membranes uvc however works via mutagenesis and does not directly cause membrane rupture log inactivation of irradiated bacteria would thus be underestimated for l pneumophila fairly selective growth media for spread plate assays have been identified in the form of buffered charcoal yeast extracts supplemented with antibiotics feeley et al 1979 veenendaal et al 2017 and may be the best option currently in the case of biofilm prevention through continuous irradiation by uv leds methods for determining the minimum surface uv intensities that prevent biofilm establishment are needed it is unlikely that entire showerhead surfaces can be targeted with direct line of sight irradiation therefore such an approach may rely heavily on lower intensities associated with scattered photons penetrating into shaded regions this task is also challenging as the minimum intensity is likely variable and dependent on the propensity for a given showerhead to harbor biofilms in the first place thus a more biofilm friendly interior will require a higher rate of uv dosing biofilm growth potential of a surface environment is a function of many factors such as the dissolved nutrient content planktonic obp loading surface material properties and hydrodynamic conditions for example proctor et al found that polymer composition of shower hoses determined how much dissolved organic carbon leached into the water which influenced biofilm growth rates proctor et al 2016 7 conclusions the conceptual division of uv showerhead designs herein into one pass and surface irradiation approaches is intended mainly to guide future laboratory experiments successful real world products however are likely to employ a hybrid of the two we also note that uv may be similarly used to prevent obp exposure from known sources other than showerheads such as sinks used for washing surgical tools and supermarket produce misters mahoney et al 1992 vijayaraghavan et al 2006 in conclusion innovative uv led systems that combine minimization of biofilm growth within plumbing fixtures and uv disinfection of flowing shower water are likely to provide the most robust deterrence against obps firmer recognition of the exposure routes relating to complex biological matrices containing obps and dose response determination of obps within these matrices will be invaluable to the design and implementation of showerhead devices healthcare professionals should be consulted in

fluorescent protein modified organisms fluorescent staining flow cytometry and so called viability qpcr wherein simultaneous species tagging and live dead determination are possible delgado viscogliosi et al 2009 lehtinen et al 2004 we note however that these methods are only able to discern between bacteria with intact or ruptured membranes uvc however works via mutagenesis and does not directly cause membrane rupture log inactivation of irradiated bacteria would thus be underestimated for l pneumophila fairly selective growth media for spread plate assays have been identified in the form of buffered charcoal yeast extracts supplemented with antibiotics feeley et al 1979 veenendaal et al 2017 and may be the best option currently in the case of biofilm prevention through continuous irradiation by uv leds methods for determining the minimum surface uv intensities that prevent biofilm establishment are needed it is unlikely that entire showerhead surfaces can be targeted with direct line of sight irradiation therefore such an approach may rely heavily on lower intensities associated with scattered photons penetrating into shaded regions this task is also challenging as the minimum intensity is likely variable and dependent on the propensity for a given showerhead to harbor biofilms in the first place thus a more biofilm friendly interior will require a higher rate of uv dosing biofilm growth potential of a surface environment is a function of many factors such as the dissolved nutrient content planktonic obp loading surface material properties and hydrodynamic conditions for example proctor et al found that polymer composition of shower hoses determined how much dissolved organic carbon leached into the water which influenced biofilm growth rates proctor et al 2016 7 conclusions the conceptual division of uv showerhead designs herein into one pass and surface irradiation approaches is intended mainly to guide future laboratory experiments successful real world products however are likely to employ a hybrid of the two we also note that uv may be similarly used to prevent obp exposure from known sources other than showerheads such as sinks used for washing surgical tools and supermarket produce misters mahoney et al 1992 vijayaraghavan et al 2006 in conclusion innovative uv led systems that combine minimization of biofilm growth within plumbing fixtures and uv disinfection of flowing shower water are likely to provide the most robust deterrence against obps firmer recognition of the exposure routes relating to complex biological matrices containing obps and dose response determination of obps within these matrices will be invaluable to the design and implementation of showerhead devices healthcare professionals should be consulted in

its increasing applications there have been no previous theoretical studies that explain the experimental results based on its molecular behavior in this context this work used calculations based on the density functional theory dft combined with experimental results to elucidate the decomposition mechanisms of paa for predicting its stability and the possible products generated from its decomposition the results obtained showed that the protonation of paa promoted its spontaneous decomposition in acetic acid and molecular oxygen the hydrolysis mechanism of paa in acidic medium indicated that the low energy difference involved in the mechanism s stages is responsible for the equilibrium between paa and h2o2 the structural and electronic comparison of paa with h2o2 showed that the o o bond length of paa is longer than that of h2o2 and is also weaker therefore may demonstrate greater efficiency in advanced oxidative processes by photocatalysis graphical abstract image 1

of effluents from different sources koivunen et al 2005b west et al 2016 studies using mathematical models were also developed to optimize the disinfection process manoli et al 2019 in addition to its

2007 xue et al 2017 and ecotoxicity henao et al 2018 macedo et al 2019 are the most evaluated factors in relation to paa in the environment these studies have contributed significantly to the consolidation of paa as a promising substitute for chlorinated disinfectants although experimental studies are very important for the safe application of paa the understanding of its mechanism of action is directly related to its molecular structure bond lengths and other intrinsic molecular characteristics which can be estimated by theoretical studies theoretical studies are intended to explain and prove experimental behavior or to provide information that may promote or invalidate forms of compound application morgon 2007 there are a few theoretical studies on paa reported in the literature such as the study of peracids by langley and noe 2004 which evaluated the most stable paa conformation and showed the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond described from ab initio methods there are several computational methods for theoretical calculations such as ab initio semi empirical methods and density functional theory dft the dft is currently one of the most used tools in theoretical chemistry because it allows for the study of small medium and relatively large molecular systems with high accuracy and low computational time alfredsson and hermansson 1999 morgon 2007 in this context considering the increasing use of paa in the environment and the advances referring to the computational tools that can contribute to explaining and deepening the experimental information the objective of the present work was to conduct theoretical studies on the possible mechanisms of decomposition of peracetic acid and to confront them to the results of the experimental oxygen release study and to also compare the electronic and structural properties of paa and hydrogen peroxide in order to obtain insights for environmentally relevant applications 2 methods and materials 2 1 computational simulations theoretical calculations for the decomposition of paa were performed using the density functional theory dft with the hybrid functional b3lyp the 6 31 g d p ditchfield et al 1971 hehre et al 1972 hariharan and pople 1973 basis set was used for all the calculations to confirm that the optimized structures were at their minimum energy frequency calculations were employed and no imaginary frequency was found some water molecules and hydronium ions were used to simulate the solvent to correct the error associated with the harmonic frequencies related to the method the scale factor 0 952 was used d3 dispersion effect grimme et al 2010 was employed in all the calculations all the calculations were performed using the gaussian 09 program frisch et al 2009 to characterize the chemical bonding of paa hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and also to understand the nature of their bonds quantum theory of atoms in molecules qtaim analyzes were performed bader and essen 1984 balder 1990 the topological analyses of the molecules were performed using the qtaim at the b3lyp 6 31 g d p level in a qtaim analysis we can describe the nature of the bond or the interaction through some parameters such as electronic density Ï r laplacian of electronic density 2Ï r kinetic energy g r potential energy v r and total electronic energy h r that is h r g r v r according to qtaim when two atoms interact with each other a bond path bp is formed the formation of these density gradient trajectories originate from a point located between two atoms known as the bond critical point bcp the properties analyzed in these points provide us with information regarding the characteristics of the bond bader and essen 1984 bader 1990 negative values of 2Ï r indicate covalent bonds while positive values indicate intermolecular interactions keith et al 1996 popelier 1999 furthermore the ratio of the kinetic energy g r and the potential energy v r in the bcp is used to characterize the nature of the interaction keith et al 1996 popelier 1999 kumar et al 2016 the aimall package was used to perform the qtaim analyses aimall 2017 2 2 evaluation of paa decomposition by the quantification of dissolved oxygen the decomposition analysis of paa was performed by quantifying dissolved oxygen do in a solution of paa 15 proxitane 15121 with a concentration of 1 mg l 1 as a function of time the experiment was carried out using a digimed oximeter model dm 4 by 4500 o g method apha 1998 the paa concentration used was selected such that the dissolved oxygen concentration did not exceed the saturation value of the oxygen in the water the paa solution was placed in a 300 ml bod biochemical oxygen demand bottle so that there was no interference from the atmospheric oxygen the readings were performed at 10 min intervals totalizing to 520 min of evaluation the assays were performed in triplicate in ph 5 2 0 1 with monitoring of the temperature and the paa concentration by using dpd n n dietil p fenileno diamina method with read in Î» 515 nm and hydrogen peroxide by the iron thiocyanate method in Î» 470 nm both were detected by visible spectrophotometry using chemetrics vacu vials reagents 3 results and discussion 3 1 conformational analysis conformational analysis represents an important aspect in different fields which are closely related to highly important problems in chemistry biology biochemistry pereira et al 2014 for the paa study three dihedrals were calculated fig 1 a the torsion angle range between 0 and 360 with intervals of 10 the dihedral torsion results showed that for dihedral i fig 1b the methyl rotor presented energy minima at 60 and 180 with maxima at 0 and 120 the energy difference from the eclipsed to the alternating conformation was small 0 4 kcal mol 1 which showed that the rotation was free at room temperature in this dihedral rt 0 6 kcal mol 1 dihedral ii was calculated through the oc oo bonds fig 1c the results indicate two energy minima at 0 and 180 with maxima at 90 and 270 the rotational barriers observed were 15 60 kcal mol 1 0 to 90 9 72 kcal mol 1 90 180 12 62 kcal mol 1 180 270 and 18 46 kcal mol 1 270 360 in dihedral iii fig 1d minimum energy values were observed at angles of 0 and 360 and maximum energy values were observed at 180 the most stable conformation was observed when the rotation angles of the dihedral iii co oh presented a proximity of the hydrogen of hydroxyl oh with the oxygen of the carbonyl co due to the intramolecular hydrogen bond that forms in paa the maximum energy was observed when the dihedral co oh is in 180 and the height of the rotational barrier was 4 48 kcal mol 1 the results found were similar to those theoretically evidenced by langley and noe 2004 however all peracetic acid dihedrals were studied in the present study it is important to highlight that the rotational barriers were estimated only with rigid geometries the conformational study of paa described important information that consolidates the geometry of the paa molecule and justifies the weak acid behavior due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding according to the studies of ando 1992 the pka of peracetic acid is 8 2 and the same author also evidenced the probability of hydrogen bond formation which was verified by the conformational analysis study the weak acid behavior of paa is important for the oxidation disinfection process as it avoids the need for ph adjustment after its application experimental studies performed by stampi et al 2001 cavallini et al 2013 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005b also demonstrated a small reduction in the ph of the sanitary effluent after using paa for disinfection this behavior can be justified by the conformation of the paa molecule 3 2 mechanism i spontaneous decomposition by protonation three mechanisms of paa zhao et al 2007 were studied theoretically mechanism i is described in fig 2 and can be divided into three steps protonation formation of an active intermediate and formation of the final product the first step is the protonation of the paa molecule and was evaluated for the three possibilities a b and c fig 2 step 1 the first hypothesis a indicated that the structure was stable and that protonation occurred the second hypothesis b demonstrated the breakdown of the paa molecule into two fragments and the third hypothesis c showed that the proton h migrated to the carbonyl oxygen it was concluded that of the three hypotheses concerning the protonation of paa only step a can describe the protonation of the peracetic acid the result of the protonation of the peracids follows the same trend as that of protonation of carboxylic acids carey 2011 the structure formed after protonation reorganizes to form a carbocation on the central carbon of the molecule which will act as a lewis acid in the mechanism the 2nd step represents the attack of the paa to the carbocation resulting in the formation of an active intermediate and consequently the release of protons step 2 in the last step there is the formation of the final products of the spontaneous decomposition in which two molecules of acetic acid and one molecule of oxygen were formed step 3 the relative energy graphs steps 2 and 3 were evaluated as described in the mechanism fig 2 and the results for the mechanism are represented in fig 3 the starting point of the mechanism refers to the sum of the energies of the molecules considering that there were no interactions between them that is they are apart from each other isolated molecules the sum of the energy values of the isolated molecules presented the highest energy and was used to determine the stability of the others where Î´e was calculated as eisolated molecules eother steps the representation of the second stage is defined as an attack of the paa molecule on the carbocation and the results showed that there was a lower energy compared to that of the initial point because of the interaction that occurred between the molecules then the formation of an active intermediate with energy higher than that of the reagents occurred owing to the need for structural reorganization finally the formation of the final products 2ch3cooh o2 which corresponds to the lower energy structure of the mechanism and consequently the more stable structure the energy difference between the product and the attack step is 22 42 kcal mol 1 which showed that the paa spontaneously decomposes into acetic acid and o2 the formation of acetic acid from the decomposition of paa justifies the increase in chemical oxygen demand cod or toc after its application even after the total decomposition of the disinfectant chen and pavlostathis 2019 evaluated the decomposition in poultry processing effluents and observed that their decomposition resulted in the equimolar production of acetic acid confirming the theoretical mechanism described as for the bod parameter no increase is expected as soon as o2 has been released and thus the quantification of do consumption by the bacteria is underestimated this behavior was observed by baldry et al 1995 and cavallini et al 2013 which describes the reduction of bod as a function of the increase of paa concentration applied in secondary effluent in concentrations above 30 mg l 1 bod values below zero were observed due to the high o2 generation demonstrating that this parameter does not adequately represent the estimation of biodegradable organic matter in these conditions thus after the application of paa the bod parameter is not recommended for the monitoring of biodegradable organic matter in water or wastewater as an example stampi et al 2001 did not observe an increase in bod after the application of paa 1 5 2 mg l 1 while lazarova et al 1998 measured the total organic carbon toc and the total biodegradable organic carbon and observed an increase in both after paa application the do parameter is relevant for evaluating the final quality of the treated effluent however at high concentrations the oxygen saturation in the liquid medium is rapidly reached and the gas is released into the atmosphere with the use of paa supersaturation of the water can also be observed 3 3 mechanism ii spontaneous decomposition in the ph range of 5 5 10 2 the second mechanism presents the spontaneous decomposition of paa in the ph between 5 5 and 10 2 fig 4 according to koubek 1963 the reaction rate at 25 c reached a maximum at ph 8 2 which was equal to the pka of paa this mechanism consists of two steps step 1 is the attack of peracetic anion on paa and formation of the active intermediate the step 2 is the decomposition of the active intermediate and formation of acetic anions o2 and h products this mechanism was studied by koubek 1963 yuan and van heiningen 1997 and zhao et al 2007 and according to zhao et al 2007 depending on the concentration of h in solution paa will be present in the molecular form and there will be no formation of the peracetic anion higher ph or formation of hydrogen peroxide lower ph fig 4 shows that an anionic paa molecule attacks a paa neutral molecule forming the active intermediate which decomposes to generate the acetate anion oxygen and h all steps of the mechanism were simulated and the results of the energies involved in each step are represented in fig 5 the mechanism ii follows the same route as that of mechanism i for obtaining the products step 1 indicated the anion attack on paa entailing in a significant energetic decrease when compared to the first point the active intermediate had a higher Î´e than did the reactants and finally the active intermediate decomposes to form the final product according to the relative energy values obtained the energy difference between the final reactants and products was 28 85 kcal mol 1 demonstrating that the paa decomposition was spontaneous as mentioned by zhao et al 2007 both the paracetic anion and the acetic anion may not be in the anionic but in the molecular form from the theoretical calculations using h2o molecules as solvent and hydronium ions to represent the acidic medium the structures after optimization presented the molecular form ratifying the information of zhao et al 2007 these results help in understanding the work described by chen and pavlostathis 2019 and pedersen et al 2009 which observed that the higher the initial paa concentration applied to the treatment of effluents the greater is its rate of decomposition this is because a higher concentration of paa molecules favors the occurrence of mechanism 2 which predicts the decomposition when its molecules react with each other and promote the formation of oxygen and acetic acid this being the spontaneous reaction at ph 5 5 to 8 2 mechanism ii explains an interesting behavior regarding the residual paa because at low concentrations its decomposition will be slow which contributes to the occurrence of residual concentrations in the liquid medium which contributes to the inhibition of microbial growth koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005a highlighted the presence of residual concentrations of paa in the treatment of sanitary effluent and also describe it as an advantage comparable to the behavior of chlorine 3 4 mechanism iii decomposition by hydrolysis mechanism iii corresponds to the study of the decomposition of paa by hydrolysis in acidic medium and has as final product the formation of acetic acid and h2o2 zhao et al 2007 fig 6 this mechanism consists of five steps initially protonation on the carbonyl oxygen of the paa molecule occurs step 1 followed by a structural resonance resulting in the formation of a carbocation which is attacked by a molecule of water step 2 subsequently there are three attacks of the reaction medium steps 3 4 and 5 resulting in equilibrium forming a molecule of acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide the simulations of the steps were performed and the results are presented in fig 7 step 0 in fig 7 refers to the isolated molecules step 1 represents the protonation of the paa molecule when the molecules approached each other steps 2 and 3 presented higher energies than that of the initial step step 1 due to the attacks and consequently due to the reorganization of the molecules the simulations showed that in step 4 the intermediate decomposes to form h2o2 and acetic acid and the last step is not necessary from the results obtained it was possible to infer after comparing step 1 with step 4 that the energy difference was 1 66 kcal mol 1 thus the acidic paa molecule favors the displacement of the reaction toward the formation of acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide but due to the low energy difference between steps 1 and 4 an equilibrium is established corresponding to the stability of the compound these results are consistent with the commercial composition of paa in which paa is present as a quaternary equilibrium composed of h2o 46 paa 15 h2o2 23 and acetic acid 16 as shown in the reaction 1 1 ch3coooh h2o ch3cooh h2o2 regarding the stability of the compound in its quaternary form it was possible to conclude that commercial paa allows the exploitation of the properties of both paa and hydrogen peroxide without interference between the two chemical species and thus the oxidative or disinfection processes can be more effective since it deals with the combined performance of two strong oxidants it is worth mentioning that aslari et al 1992 lubello et al 2002 kitis 2004 and du et al 2018 described the superiority of the disinfection oxidation potential of paa in relation to hydrogen peroxide thus in acid ph ph 5 5 the efficiency of paa would be negatively affected due the decomposition by hydrolysis and formation hydrogen peroxide 3 5 evaluation of paa decomposition by the release of o2 the quantification of the dissolved oxygen do in a solution of paa and the monitoring of the paa and h2o2 concentrations allowed for the confirmation of the theoretical results regarding its decomposition and the generation of molecular oxygen acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide by the mechanisms under study in fig 8 the formation of dissolved oxygen ln do with respect to time can be observed which can be represented by first order kinetics the linearity of the data can be best represented by dividing the curve into two steps the fast step and slow step fig 8 the transition point of the steps was verified in the time of 150 min during which the paa concentration remained practically constant for more than 6 h in the fast step the initial paa concentration 1 mg l 1 decreased to 0 41 mg l 1 in the first 150 min corresponding to the formation of 0 87 mg l 1 of o2 in the slow step the paa concentration after 300 min was 0 37 mg l 1 and remained at that concentration until the end of the study 520 min in this interval there was the formation of 0 1 mg l 1 of o2 the study at ph 5 2 allowed the formation of h2o2 by hydrolysis of paa initially the sample had a h2o2 concentration of 1 5 mg l 1 after 150 min the concentration increased to 1 8 mg l 1 and remained constant until the end of the study thus it was possible to observe the equilibrium establishment and the coexistence of both oxidants du et al 2018 even at low concentrations which is justified by the energies described in fig 7 observing the results obtained in fig 8 it can be confirmed that in the reactions between molecules of paa in the reaction medium h2o due to the higher concentration of disinfectant the was a higher paa decomposition rate this fact occurs because there is a greater probability of shock to the molecules mechanisms i and ii at the start of the reaction a significant increase in the release of dissolved oxygen was observed and as the paa decomposed the oxygen release occurred more slowly the results obtained experimentally also corroborate the studies by zhao et al 2007 who also describe an paa decomposition in acid medium by first order reaction in fig 8 it was also possible to observe that the data do not fit perfectly with a first order reaction r2 0 75206 however when the data were divided into two steps it was possible to observe the linearity of the decomposition at a faster stage r2 0 9341 k obs 0 0045 min 1 and a slower one r2 0 9646 k obs 0 0006 min 1 the persistence of the paa residual concentration also reinforces the information obtained in the mechanisms 3 6 theoretical comparison between paa and hydrogen peroxide for applicative purposes in this simulation the structural property related to bond length and the electronic properties based on qtaim were evaluated for paa and hydrogen peroxide a comparison between the chemical species was carried out to obtain information that could contribute to understanding the effectiveness of the products because both are strong oxidants the bonds lengths values of the species studied are shown in fig 9 comparing the two molecules it was observed that the o o bond length of the paa molecule was slightly longer than that of the h2o2 molecule this behavior explains the results obtained by bianchini et al 2002 who described the necessary energies to break the o oh bond of paa 38 kcal mol 1 and h2o2 51 kcal mol 1 the study by bach et al 1996 describes the value of 48 kcal mol 1 for breaking the o oh bond of paa which would be even more consistent with the theoretical results of this work as the length of the bonds are very close paa 1 427 Ã¥ and h2o2 1 443 Ã¥ the same occurred for the o h bonds with the information on the species it is possible to estimate that paa follows the same mechanism of h2o2 radical generation the electronic properties of ch3coooh and h2o2 were evaluated using the quantum theory of atoms and molecules qtaim balder and essen 1984 bader 1990 keith et al 1996 popelier 1999 kumar et al 2016 this model is useful in computational chemistry to visualize possible interactions of the atoms of a molecule as well as to understand the nature of chemical bonds or interactions fig 10 represents the molecules of paa and hydrogen peroxide respectively in fig 10 it is possible to visualize the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond in paa and also a ring critical point the bond critical points bcps and topological parameter values for the species studied are presented in table 1 for the systems three topological properties were analyzed i electron density Ï r which represents the interaction bond force at the bcp and the higher the density value Ï r the stronger the interaction bond ii laplacian of the electronic density 2Ï r that indicates whether the bonds are covalent or not with values of 2Ï r 0 suggestive of covalent bonds and values 0 of non covalent bonds iii elipicity Îµ r which shows whether the bonds have Ï or Ï character where Îµ 0 denotes characteristics of Ï bonds and Îµ 0 denotes predominantly Ï bond characteristics from the results of Ï r table 1 it was possible to observe that the c5 o6 bond of paa was the strongest bond double bond the electron density of the o7 o8 bond of paa presented a value of Ï r 0 284922 au this value being lower than that of the o1 o3 bond of h2o2 which presented a value of 0 2797995 au this fact indicates that the o o bond of h2o2 was stronger than that of paa reconfirming the results of bianchini et al 2002 and bach et al 1996 according to the values of 2Ï r the bonds o6 h9 and c5 o6 were characterized as being non covalent and both involved in the intramolecular hydrogen bonding of paa the other bonds of paa and h2o2 molecules have values lower than 0 and are covalent the bond densities of the paa molecule when compared to the hydrogen peroxide molecule indicate that the formation of hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals may occur with lower energy demand and this information is of paramount importance for advanced oxidative processes by photocatalysis thus the time of exposure to radiation or even the exposure to radiation with a longer wavelength such as solar radiation could be sufficient for the formation of hydroxyl radicals by paa corroborating the theoretical results obtained regarding the possible formation of hydroxyl radicals in the process with radiation paa cai et al 2017 evaluated the removal of drugs by the uv paa process and attributed the process efficiency to the radicals ho ch3c o o and or ch3c o o2 and also observed that the uv paa process contributed more to the degradation of the drugs than the uv h2o2 process bianchini et al 2002 caretti et al 2003 souza et al 2015 and rizzo et al 2019 also reported the contribution of the hydroxyl radicals formed during the paa uv process 4 conclusions the studies carried out in this work proved the possible routes of peracetic acid decomposition which helped to understand its stability in the effluent treatment processes mechanism i made it possible to identify the steps involved in the spontaneous decomposition of paa into oxygen and acetic acid due to its protonation which can be observed experimentally in the paa decomposition assays by do quantification the mechanism ii that occurs in the ph range between 5 5 and 10 2 showed that the paa decomposition depends on its concentration and therefore tends to present spontaneous residual concentrations mechanism iii indicated that the low energy difference between steps 1 and 4 promoted an equilibrium between the paa and h2o2 molecules in acid medium conferring stability to the compound conformational analysis demonstrated the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond in paa and the comparison of the bond lengths and qtaim analyzes between the paa and h2o2 molecules suggest that paa possibly exhibits the same hydrogen peroxide radical generation mechanism then the studies developed in this work contribute to the elucidation of paa decomposition mechanisms providing information about its molecular structure which justifies its behavior in real systems and helps in the in depth understanding of its stability and reactivity in comparison with peroxide of

methods there are several computational methods for theoretical calculations such as ab initio semi empirical methods and density functional theory dft the dft is currently one of the most used tools in theoretical chemistry because it allows for the study of small medium and relatively large molecular systems with high accuracy and low computational time alfredsson and hermansson 1999 morgon 2007 in this context considering the increasing use of paa in the environment and the advances referring to the computational tools that can contribute to explaining and deepening the experimental information the objective of the present work was to conduct theoretical studies on the possible mechanisms of decomposition of peracetic acid and to confront them to the results of the experimental oxygen release study and to also compare the electronic and structural properties of paa and hydrogen peroxide in order to obtain insights for environmentally relevant applications 2 methods and materials 2 1 computational simulations theoretical calculations for the decomposition of paa were performed using the density functional theory dft with the hybrid functional b3lyp the 6 31 g d p ditchfield et al 1971 hehre et al 1972 hariharan and pople 1973 basis set was used for all the calculations to confirm that the optimized structures were at their minimum energy frequency calculations were employed and no imaginary frequency was found some water molecules and hydronium ions were used to simulate the solvent to correct the error associated with the harmonic frequencies related to the method the scale factor 0 952 was used d3 dispersion effect grimme et al 2010 was employed in all the calculations all the calculations were performed using the gaussian 09 program frisch et al 2009 to characterize the chemical bonding of paa hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and also to understand the nature of their bonds quantum theory of atoms in molecules qtaim analyzes were performed bader and essen 1984 balder 1990 the topological analyses of the molecules were performed using the qtaim at the b3lyp 6 31 g d p level in a qtaim analysis we can describe the nature of the bond or the interaction through some parameters such as electronic density Ï r laplacian of electronic density 2Ï r kinetic energy g r potential energy v r and total electronic energy h r that is h r g r v r according to qtaim when two atoms interact with each other a bond path bp is formed the formation of these density gradient trajectories originate from a point located between two atoms known as the bond critical point bcp the properties analyzed in these points provide us with information regarding the characteristics of the bond bader and essen 1984 bader 1990 negative values of 2Ï r indicate covalent bonds while positive values indicate intermolecular interactions keith et al 1996 popelier 1999 furthermore the ratio of the kinetic energy g r and the potential energy v r in the bcp is used to characterize the nature of the interaction keith et al 1996 popelier 1999 kumar et al 2016 the aimall package was used to perform the qtaim analyses aimall 2017 2 2 evaluation of paa decomposition by the quantification of dissolved oxygen the decomposition analysis of paa was performed by quantifying dissolved oxygen do in a solution of paa 15 proxitane 15121 with a concentration of 1 mg l 1 as a function of time the experiment was carried out using a digimed oximeter model dm 4 by 4500 o g method apha 1998 the paa concentration used was selected such that the dissolved oxygen concentration did not exceed the saturation value of the oxygen in the water the paa solution was placed in a 300 ml bod biochemical oxygen demand bottle so that there was no interference from the atmospheric oxygen the readings were performed at 10 min intervals totalizing to 520 min of evaluation the assays were performed in triplicate in ph 5 2 0 1 with monitoring of the temperature and the paa concentration by using dpd n n dietil p fenileno diamina method with read in Î» 515 nm and hydrogen peroxide by the iron thiocyanate method in Î» 470 nm both were detected by visible spectrophotometry using chemetrics vacu vials reagents 3 results and discussion 3 1 conformational analysis conformational analysis represents an important aspect in different fields which are closely related to highly important problems in chemistry biology biochemistry pereira et al 2014 for the paa study three dihedrals were calculated fig 1 a the torsion angle range between 0 and 360 with intervals of 10 the dihedral torsion results showed that for dihedral i fig 1b the methyl rotor presented energy minima at 60 and 180 with maxima at 0 and 120 the energy difference from the eclipsed to the alternating conformation was small 0 4 kcal mol 1 which showed that the rotation was free at room temperature in this dihedral rt 0 6 kcal mol 1 dihedral ii was calculated through the oc oo bonds fig 1c the results indicate two energy minima at 0 and 180 with maxima at 90 and 270 the rotational barriers observed were 15 60 kcal mol 1 0 to 90 9 72 kcal mol 1 90 180 12 62 kcal mol 1 180 270 and 18 46 kcal mol 1 270 360 in dihedral iii fig 1d minimum energy values were observed at angles of 0 and 360 and maximum energy values were observed at 180 the most stable conformation was observed when the rotation angles of the dihedral iii co oh presented a proximity of the hydrogen of hydroxyl oh with the oxygen of the carbonyl co due to the intramolecular hydrogen bond that forms in paa the maximum energy was observed when the dihedral co oh is in 180 and the height of the rotational barrier was 4 48 kcal mol 1 the results found were similar to those theoretically evidenced by langley and noe 2004 however all peracetic acid dihedrals were studied in the present study it is important to highlight that the rotational barriers were estimated only with rigid geometries the conformational study of paa described important information that consolidates the geometry of the paa molecule and justifies the weak acid behavior due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding according to the studies of ando 1992 the pka of peracetic acid is 8 2 and the same author also evidenced the probability of hydrogen bond formation which was verified by the conformational analysis study the weak acid behavior of paa is important for the oxidation disinfection process as it avoids the need for ph adjustment after its application experimental studies performed by stampi et al 2001 cavallini et al 2013 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005b also demonstrated a small reduction in the ph of the sanitary effluent after using paa for disinfection this behavior can be justified by the conformation of the paa molecule 3 2 mechanism i spontaneous decomposition by protonation three mechanisms of paa zhao et al 2007 were studied theoretically mechanism i is described in fig 2 and can be divided into three steps protonation formation of an active intermediate and formation of the final product the first step is the protonation of the paa molecule and was evaluated for the three possibilities a b and c fig 2 step 1 the first hypothesis a indicated that the structure was stable and that protonation occurred the second hypothesis b demonstrated the breakdown of the paa molecule into two fragments and the third hypothesis c showed that the proton h migrated to the carbonyl oxygen it was concluded that of the three hypotheses concerning the protonation of paa only step a can describe the protonation of the peracetic acid the result of the protonation of the peracids follows the same trend as that of protonation of carboxylic acids carey 2011 the structure formed after protonation reorganizes to form a carbocation on the central carbon of the molecule which will act as a lewis acid in the mechanism the 2nd step represents the attack of the paa to the carbocation resulting in the formation of an active intermediate and consequently the release of protons step 2 in the last step there is the formation of the final products of the spontaneous decomposition in which two molecules of acetic acid and one molecule of oxygen were formed step 3 the relative energy graphs steps 2 and 3 were evaluated as described in the mechanism fig 2 and the results for the mechanism are represented in fig 3 the starting point of the mechanism refers to the sum of the energies of the molecules considering that there were no interactions between them that is they are apart from each other isolated molecules the sum of the energy values of the isolated molecules presented the highest energy and was used to determine the stability of the others where Î´e was calculated as eisolated molecules eother steps the representation of the second stage is defined as an attack of the paa molecule on the carbocation and the results showed that there was a lower energy compared to that of the initial point because of the interaction that occurred between the molecules then the formation of an active intermediate with energy higher than that of the reagents occurred owing to the need for structural reorganization finally the formation of the final products 2ch3cooh o2 which corresponds to the lower energy structure of the mechanism and consequently the more stable structure the energy difference between the product and the attack step is 22 42 kcal mol 1 which showed that the paa spontaneously decomposes into acetic acid and o2 the formation of acetic acid from the decomposition of paa justifies the increase in chemical oxygen demand cod or toc after its application even after the total decomposition of the disinfectant chen and pavlostathis 2019 evaluated the decomposition in poultry processing effluents and observed that their decomposition resulted in the equimolar production of acetic acid confirming the theoretical mechanism described as for the bod parameter no increase is expected as soon as o2 has been released and thus the quantification of do consumption by the bacteria is underestimated this behavior was observed by baldry et al 1995 and cavallini et al 2013 which describes the reduction of bod as a function of the increase of paa concentration applied in secondary effluent in concentrations above 30 mg l 1 bod values below zero were observed due to the high o2 generation demonstrating that this parameter does not adequately represent the estimation of biodegradable organic matter in these conditions thus after the application of paa the bod parameter is not recommended for the monitoring of biodegradable organic matter in water or wastewater as an example stampi et al 2001 did not observe an increase in bod after the application of paa 1 5 2 mg l 1 while lazarova et al 1998 measured the total organic carbon toc and the total biodegradable organic carbon and observed an increase in both after paa application the do parameter is relevant for evaluating the final quality of the treated effluent however at high concentrations the oxygen saturation in the liquid medium is rapidly reached and the gas is released into the atmosphere with the use of paa supersaturation of the water can also be observed 3 3 mechanism ii spontaneous decomposition in the ph range of 5 5 10 2 the second mechanism presents the spontaneous decomposition of paa in the ph between 5 5 and 10 2 fig 4 according to koubek 1963 the reaction rate at 25 c reached a maximum at ph 8 2 which was equal to the pka of paa this mechanism consists of two steps step 1 is the attack of peracetic anion on paa and formation of the active intermediate the step 2 is the decomposition of the active intermediate and formation of acetic anions o2 and h products this mechanism was studied by koubek 1963 yuan and van heiningen 1997 and zhao et al 2007 and according to zhao et al 2007 depending on the concentration of h in solution paa will be present in the molecular form and there will be no formation of the peracetic anion higher ph or formation of hydrogen peroxide lower ph fig 4 shows that an anionic paa molecule attacks a paa neutral molecule forming the active intermediate which decomposes to generate the acetate anion oxygen and h all steps of the mechanism were simulated and the results of the energies involved in each step are represented in fig 5 the mechanism ii follows the same route as that of mechanism i for obtaining the products step 1 indicated the anion attack on paa entailing in a significant energetic decrease when compared to the first point the active intermediate had a higher Î´e than did the reactants and finally the active intermediate decomposes to form the final product according to the relative energy values obtained the energy difference between the final reactants and products was 28 85 kcal mol 1 demonstrating that the paa decomposition was spontaneous as mentioned by zhao et al 2007 both the paracetic anion and the acetic anion may not be in the anionic but in the molecular form from the theoretical calculations using h2o molecules as solvent and hydronium ions to represent the acidic medium the structures after optimization presented the molecular form ratifying the information of zhao et al 2007 these results help in understanding the work described by chen and pavlostathis 2019 and pedersen et al 2009 which observed that the higher the initial paa concentration applied to the treatment of effluents the greater is its rate of decomposition this is because a higher concentration of paa molecules favors the occurrence of mechanism 2 which predicts the decomposition when its molecules react with each other and promote the formation of oxygen and acetic acid this being the spontaneous reaction at ph 5 5 to 8 2 mechanism ii explains an interesting behavior regarding the residual paa because at low concentrations its decomposition will be slow which contributes to the occurrence of residual concentrations in the liquid medium which contributes to the inhibition of microbial growth koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005a highlighted the presence of residual concentrations of paa in the treatment of sanitary effluent and also describe it as an advantage comparable to the behavior of chlorine 3 4 mechanism iii decomposition by hydrolysis mechanism iii corresponds to the study of the decomposition of paa by hydrolysis in acidic medium and has as final product the formation of acetic acid and h2o2 zhao et al 2007 fig 6 this mechanism consists of five steps initially protonation on the carbonyl oxygen of the paa molecule occurs step 1 followed by a structural resonance resulting in the formation of a carbocation which is attacked by a molecule of water step 2 subsequently there are three attacks of the reaction medium steps 3 4 and 5 resulting in equilibrium forming a molecule of acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide the simulations of the steps were performed and the results are presented in fig 7 step 0 in fig 7 refers to the isolated molecules step 1 represents the protonation of the paa molecule when the molecules approached each other steps 2 and 3 presented higher energies than that of the initial step step 1 due to the attacks and consequently due to the reorganization of the molecules the simulations showed that in step 4 the intermediate decomposes to form h2o2 and acetic acid and the last step is not necessary from the results obtained it was possible to infer after comparing step 1 with step 4 that the energy difference was 1 66 kcal mol 1 thus the acidic paa molecule favors the displacement of the reaction toward the formation of acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide but due to the low energy difference between steps 1 and 4 an equilibrium is established corresponding to the stability of the compound these results are consistent with the commercial composition of paa in which paa is present as a quaternary equilibrium composed of h2o 46 paa 15 h2o2 23 and acetic acid 16 as shown in the reaction 1 1 ch3coooh h2o ch3cooh h2o2 regarding the stability of the compound in its quaternary form it was possible to conclude that commercial paa allows the exploitation of the properties of both paa and hydrogen peroxide without interference between the two chemical species and thus the oxidative or disinfection processes can be more effective since it deals with the combined performance of two strong oxidants it is worth mentioning that aslari et al 1992 lubello et al 2002 kitis 2004 and du et al 2018 described the superiority of the disinfection oxidation potential of paa in relation to hydrogen peroxide thus in acid ph ph 5 5 the efficiency of paa would be negatively affected due the decomposition by hydrolysis and formation hydrogen peroxide 3 5 evaluation of paa decomposition by the release of o2 the quantification of the dissolved oxygen do in a solution of paa and the monitoring of the paa and h2o2 concentrations allowed for the confirmation of the theoretical results regarding its decomposition and the generation of molecular oxygen acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide by the mechanisms under study in fig 8 the formation of dissolved oxygen ln do with respect to time can be observed which can be represented by first order kinetics the linearity of the data can be best represented by dividing the curve into two steps the fast step and slow step fig 8 the transition point of the steps was verified in the time of 150 min during which the paa concentration remained practically constant for more than 6 h in the fast step the initial paa concentration 1 mg l 1 decreased to 0 41 mg l 1 in the first 150 min corresponding to the formation of 0 87 mg l 1 of o2 in the slow step the paa concentration after 300 min was 0 37 mg l 1 and remained at that concentration until the end of the study 520 min in this interval there was the formation of 0 1 mg l 1 of o2 the study at ph 5 2 allowed the formation of h2o2 by hydrolysis of paa initially the sample had a h2o2 concentration of 1 5 mg l 1 after 150 min the concentration increased to 1 8 mg l 1 and remained constant until the end of the study thus it was possible to observe the equilibrium establishment and the coexistence of both oxidants du et al 2018 even at low concentrations which is justified by the energies described in fig 7 observing the results obtained in fig 8 it can be confirmed that in the reactions between molecules of paa in the reaction medium h2o due to the higher concentration of disinfectant the was a higher paa decomposition rate this fact occurs because there is a greater probability of shock to the molecules mechanisms i and ii at the start of the reaction a significant increase in the release of dissolved oxygen was observed and as the paa decomposed the oxygen release occurred more slowly the results obtained experimentally also corroborate the studies by zhao et al 2007 who also describe an paa decomposition in acid medium by first order reaction in fig 8 it was also possible to observe that the data do not fit perfectly with a first order reaction r2 0 75206 however when the data were divided into two steps it was possible to observe the linearity of the decomposition at a faster stage r2 0 9341 k obs 0 0045 min 1 and a slower one r2 0 9646 k obs 0 0006 min 1 the persistence of the paa residual concentration also reinforces the information obtained in the mechanisms 3 6 theoretical comparison between paa and hydrogen peroxide for applicative purposes in this simulation the structural property related to bond length and the electronic properties based on qtaim were evaluated for paa and hydrogen peroxide a comparison between the chemical species was carried out to obtain information that could contribute to understanding the effectiveness of the products because both are strong oxidants the bonds lengths values of the species studied are shown in fig 9 comparing the two molecules it was observed that the o o bond length of the paa molecule was slightly longer than that of the h2o2 molecule this behavior explains the results obtained by bianchini et al 2002 who described the necessary energies to break the o oh bond of paa 38 kcal mol 1 and h2o2 51 kcal mol 1 the study by bach et al 1996 describes the value of 48 kcal mol 1 for breaking the o oh bond of paa which would be even more consistent with the theoretical results of this work as the length of the bonds are very close paa 1 427 Ã¥ and h2o2 1 443 Ã¥ the same occurred for the o h bonds with the information on the species it is possible to estimate that paa follows the same mechanism of h2o2 radical generation the electronic properties of ch3coooh and h2o2 were evaluated using the quantum theory of atoms and molecules qtaim balder and essen 1984 bader 1990 keith et al 1996 popelier 1999 kumar et al 2016 this model is useful in computational chemistry to visualize possible interactions of the atoms of a molecule as well as to understand the nature of chemical bonds or interactions fig 10 represents the molecules of paa and hydrogen peroxide respectively in fig 10 it is possible to visualize the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond in paa and also a ring critical point the bond critical points bcps and topological parameter values for the species studied are presented in table 1 for the systems three topological properties were analyzed i electron density Ï r which represents the interaction bond force at the bcp and the higher the density value Ï r the stronger the interaction bond ii laplacian of the electronic density 2Ï r that indicates whether the bonds are covalent or not with values of 2Ï r 0 suggestive of covalent bonds and values 0 of non covalent bonds iii elipicity Îµ r which shows whether the bonds have Ï or Ï character where Îµ 0 denotes characteristics of Ï bonds and Îµ 0 denotes predominantly Ï bond characteristics from the results of Ï r table 1 it was possible to observe that the c5 o6 bond of paa was the strongest bond double bond the electron density of the o7 o8 bond of paa presented a value of Ï r 0 284922 au this value being lower than that of the o1 o3 bond of h2o2 which presented a value of 0 2797995 au this fact indicates that the o o bond of h2o2 was stronger than that of paa reconfirming the results of bianchini et al 2002 and bach et al 1996 according to the values of 2Ï r the bonds o6 h9 and c5 o6 were characterized as being non covalent and both involved in the intramolecular hydrogen bonding of paa the other bonds of paa and h2o2 molecules have values lower than 0 and are covalent the bond densities of the paa molecule when compared to the hydrogen peroxide molecule indicate that the formation of hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals may occur with lower energy demand and this information is of paramount importance for advanced oxidative processes by photocatalysis thus the time of exposure to radiation or even the exposure to radiation with a longer wavelength such as solar radiation could be sufficient for the formation of hydroxyl radicals by paa corroborating the theoretical results obtained regarding the possible formation of hydroxyl radicals in the process with radiation paa cai et al 2017 evaluated the removal of drugs by the uv paa process and attributed the process efficiency to the radicals ho ch3c o o and or ch3c o o2 and also observed that the uv paa process contributed more to the degradation of the drugs than the uv h2o2 process bianchini et al 2002 caretti et al 2003 souza et al 2015 and rizzo et al 2019 also reported the contribution of the hydroxyl radicals formed during the paa uv process 4 conclusions the studies carried out in this work proved the possible routes of peracetic acid decomposition which helped to understand its stability in the effluent treatment processes mechanism i made it possible to identify the steps involved in the spontaneous decomposition of paa into oxygen and acetic acid due to its protonation which can be observed experimentally in the paa decomposition assays by do quantification the mechanism ii that occurs in the ph range between 5 5 and 10 2 showed that the paa decomposition depends on its concentration and therefore tends to present spontaneous residual concentrations mechanism iii indicated that the low energy difference between steps 1 and 4 promoted an equilibrium between the paa and h2o2 molecules in acid medium conferring stability to the compound conformational analysis demonstrated the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond in paa and the comparison of the bond lengths and qtaim analyzes between the paa and h2o2 molecules suggest that paa possibly exhibits the same hydrogen peroxide radical generation mechanism then the studies developed in this work contribute to the elucidation of paa decomposition mechanisms providing information about its molecular structure which justifies its behavior in real systems and helps in the in depth understanding of its stability and reactivity in comparison with peroxide of

18383,in this study next generation sequencing was used to explore the virome in 20l up to 10 000l water from different purification steps at two swedish drinking water treatment plants dwtps and in tap water one dwtp used ultrafiltration uf with 20 nm pores the other uv light treatment after conventional treatment of the water viruses belonging to 26 different families were detected in raw water in which 6 9 times more sequence reads were found for phages than for known environmental plant or vertebrate viruses the total number of viral reads was reduced more than 4 log10 after uf and 3 log10 over uv treatment however for some viruses the reduction was 3 5 log10 after uf as for hepatitis e virus hev which was also detected in tap water with sequences similar to those in raw water and after treatment this indicates that hev had passed through the treatment and entered into the supply network however the viability of the viruses is unknown in tap water 10 130 international units of hev rna ml were identified which is a comparable low amount of virus the risk of getting infected through consumption of tap water is probably negligible but needs to be investigated the hev strains in the waters belonged to subtypes hev3a and hev3c i which is associated with unknown source of infection in humans infected in sweden none of these subtypes are common among pigs or wild boar the major reservoirs for hev indicating that water may play a role in transmitting this virus the results indicate that monitoring small fecal oral transmitted viruses in dwtps may be considered especially

of these subtypes is still unknown this study was performed to investigate the virome in different waters by metagenomics sequencing and to evaluate the efficacy of removing viruses during the purification process from raw to drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection sites gothenburg is located at the estuary of the river gÃ¶ta Ã¤lv on the west coast of sweden it is the second largest swedish city with about 550 000 inhabitants in the urban area the raw water from the river gÃ¶ta Ã¤lv serves as the main source for drinking water which is produced at two major dwtps alelyckan and lackarebÃ¤ck alelyckan supplies water mainly to northeast gothenburg as well as to central and eastern hisingen an island north of central gothenburg lackarebÃ¤ck supplies water mainly to southern and south eastern gothenburg the central city and western hisingen are supplied from both dwtps the raw water is treated through chemical flocculation sedimentation and activated carbon filtration followed by inactivation by chlorine and chlorine dioxide at both dwtps the choice of raw water is based on quality criteria during periods of actual or suspected faecal contamination raw water from the reservoir lake delsjÃ¶n is used instead from the river directly at alelyckan dwtp the treated water is disinfected by ultraviolet light uv light with a uv dose of 40 mj cm2 the microbiological barriers are followed up with removal of micro algae and on line turbidity chemical inactivation is controlled to achieve enough ct values for virus inactivation ct is the disinfectant concentration multiplied by the contact time and checked with live cell staining as well as bacterial indicators there is certification of virus inactivation for the type of uv equipment based on seeding test with uv resistant micro organisms but the monitoring during operation relies on in direct measurements of uv254 transmittance and light intensity in lackarebÃ¤ck uf membranes are added as an extra microbial barrier instead of uv disinfection the pores of the membranes have a nominal size of 20 nm which is less than the size of most target pathogens pore size typically gets smaller by fouling scaling during operation when coagulation is applied before uf most viruses are believed to adsorb to larger flocs before uf or on flocs accumulating on the membrane surface bratby 2006 before installation of full scale modules removal of small particles was tested on selected membranes from different batches of membranes ms2 phages and virus like particles vlps met the criteria of more than 4 log10 removal the integrity control of the uf membranes is performed daily by pressurizing the membranes with air and the ability to retain air is recorded to check for single defect fibres failure to meet these requirements automatically leads to removal of the unit low range on line particle counters are also used to monitor for major damage and changes in pore size distribution removal of fluorescent vlps are analysed by fluorescence microscopy these tests showed more than 4 log10 removal of vlps larger than 20 nm by the uf membranes all measured parameters of the waters during the sampling period are given in a1 1 table s1 before pumping the water into the supply network chlorine and chlorine dioxide are added at alelyckan as part of the multiple microbial barriers and at lackarebÃ¤ck mainly to inhibit bacterial growth and to control lake related odour the ct value for chlorination at alelyckan dwtp was approximately 35 min mg l and 18 min mg l at lackarebÃ¤ck dwtp the ph is thereafter adjusted to 8 0 8 1 and alkalinity to 1 0 1 1 mmol l the water passes through a 176 km long water supply network to 13 water towers around the city s heights and 68 drinking water pump stations before being distributed to the consumers the distribution to the tap water sampling point in this study is shown in b1 1 fig s1 the transport time from lackarebÃ¤ck dwtp is estimated to have been 8 h and from alelyckan dwtp 12 h some water may have prolonged retention time due to the drinking water storage in the same pressure zone as the sampling point 2 2 sample

downloaded from ncbi genbank to build a local genomic viral database and the contigs and unassembled singleton reads longer than 100 bp were blasted against this local viral database using blastn the reads with a cut off for e value 10 5 and hsp lengths 100 bp were considered as possible viral hits these hits were used for a second blast against all genomes in the ncbi genbank non redundant

table s2 and reaction conditions as previous described roth et al 2016 2 5 sequence analysis the amplified and sequenced 357 nucleotides of the vp1 of gokushovirus and 820 nucleotides of the junction region of orf1 orf2 orf3 of the hev consensus sequences from the metagenomics analysis were analysed in the program seqman in the dnastar program package version 10 1 2 dna star inc madison wi 53705 usa for the phylogenetic analysis of partial vp1 of gokushovirus a total of 204 sequences from viruses belonging to the microviridae family in genbank were aligned with sequences obtained from the water samples in this study for hev the corresponding region of 133 hev3 sequences and two hev1 sequences obtained from ncbi database were aligned with the hev sequences obtained in this study phylogenetic analysis was carried out with the phylip package version 3 65 felsenstein 1996 the evolutionary distances were calculated using hasegaw kishino yano hky algorithm in dnadist program in the phylip package and phylogenetic trees were constructed using unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages upgma and neighbor joining nj methods in the phylip package the trees were visualized with the program treeview version 1 6 6 page 2002 all sequences obtained from this study are deposited in genbank with accession numbers mn51833 mn518340 3 results 3 1 number of virus reads identified by ngs a total of 8 5 106 to 31 106 raw reads were obtained for the samples sequenced table 2 after trimming and reassembling the sequences were analysed for homology by blast first to all viral sequences in genbank thereafter the sequences obtained were investigated by a second blast for homology to all sequences available in genbank the non redundant nucleotide database table 2 this resulted in 7 5 103 to 435 103 reads or contigs classified as viral reads 0 02 3 54 of all reads all reads similar to viral sequences were between 110 bp and 900 bp the highest number of reads corresponding to viral sequences per l sample was in the raw water for lackarebÃ¤ck dwtp table 2 the number of viral reads per l water was substantially reduced 2 2 to 2 7 log10 after carbon filtration treatment at lackarebÃ¤ck dwtps table 2 in alelyckan dwtp additional uv disinfection lowered the viral number of reads 3 2 log10 and in lackarebÃ¤ck dwtp the passage through uf membranes lowered the number 4 3 log10 in tap water sampled for three consecutive days the number of viral sequence reads varied between 540 and 2 211 per litre corresponding to 0 02 0 11 of the total reads in these samples table 2 sequences found homologous to viruses belonged to 12 28 known viral families and to about 650 non classified viruses in the eight different samples table 2 a1 2 tables s3 s4 the most abundant sequences were homologous to bacteriophages classified into the family microviridae and accounted for 57 of the viral reads in water after carbon filtration at lackarebÃ¤ck dwtp followed by myoviridae and siphoviridae sequenced homologous to protist viruses as mimiviridae and phycodnaviridae were also abundant and the most common viruses infecting vertebrates belonged to the hepeviridae parvoviridae and circoviridae families a1 2 table s3 the number of viral reads was substantially higher in raw water than in tap water for some phages the number increased after carbon filtration at the dwtps but decreased considerably after uf for mimiviridae a group of giant viruses the viral reads found in raw water was reduced by 40 45 after carbon filtration in the two dwtps and to undetectable levels after uf and by 90 after uv a1 2 table s3 for some other viruses belonging to the viral family virgaviridae a family of small viruses infecting plants the viral reads were relatively stable with 80 240 reads in all samples except in one tap water sample where it was missing a1 2 table s3 it is noteworthy that a virus identified the water samples in this study pepper mild mottle virus pmmov in the virgaviridae family was recently proposed as a potential indicator of human fecal contamination of environmental waters shirasaki et al 2017 3 2 detection and phylogenetic analysis of hev in water samples there were 1 103 to 33 103 viral reads of hepeviridae sequences identified in all eight water samples the number of reads of hev sequences per l water was reduced with about 3 log10 and 3 6 log10 after uv or uf treatment in the dwtps a1 2 table s3 the number of reads of hev sequences in tap water varied from 1 900 to 27 600 the presence of hev sequences in the waters was confirmed by qpcr which also was used to quantify the hev genomes hev rna could be quantified in all except two samples the raw water and before uv treatment a1 4 table s5 the water samples contained between 6 and 130 iu hev rna ml with the effluent from uf having the lowest amount and one tap water the highest a1 4 table s5 this calculation shown in table s5 is based on the ct values of the water samples and on the regression line obtained from log10 dilution and ct values of the who standard assuming a 10 20 recovery of viruses during concentration by nano ceram filtration as shown previously wang et al 2018 phylogenetic analysis of consensus sequences of 820 nucleotides in the junction region of orf1 orf2 orf3 revealed that seven of the hev sequences belonged to subtype hev3c i and one to hev3a the hev3c i sequences were found in tap water three strains in water treated after carbon filtration two strains and one strain each was in raw water and in water after uf at lackarebÃ¤ck dwtp fig 1 six of these strains formed one separate clade on the hev3c i branch in the phylogenetic tree another hev3c i strain from raw water was similar to a strain from a swedish blood donor fig 1 the hev strain from water after carbon filtration treatment in alelyckan dwtp was on the branch formed by hev3a strains which are often found in asia and the usa fig 1 and was similar to a strain from a canadian swine none of these strains were similar to the hev3f or 3e strains which are usually isolated from swedish pigs and wild boar 3 3 phylogenetic analysis of bacteriophages from microviridae identified in water samples to validate the ngs results and to understand the phylogenetic relationships between viruses identified in the different types of waters a semi nested pcr was developed for detection and sequencing of gokushovirus within the microviridae family strains in seven samples could be amplified and sequenced in the vp1 region b1 1 fig s2 phylogenetic analysis revealed that all gokushovirus strains belonged to the subfamily gokushovirinae in the microviridae family fig 2 the strains from raw and treated water in both dwtps were similar and formed one clade in the phylogenetic tree they were on the same branch as strains in fresh water from france the strain identified in a tap water sample was divergent and found in another clade with strains isolated from freshwater fish in the usa 4 discussion this study showed a substantial removal of most viruses from raw water treated with conventional methods and additional barriers at two swedish dwtps larger viruses were efficiently removed by uf however genomes of some smaller viruses as hev and some bacteriophages and plant viruses were detected after uf and uv treatment although uv has been shown to reduce the infectivity on recombinant hev1 hev3 virus adapted to cell cultures guerrero latorre et al 2016 the inactivation efficiency for wild type hev is not known fenaux et al 2019 the hev strains in this study could enter the water supply network despite that all standards were fulfilled for routine monitoring of small particles in the outlet water at the dwtps the pores in the uf membranes used are smaller than those recommended by the swedish authorities which have stated that membranes with pore size 100 nm can be a used microbial barrier and the norwegian guide for barrier analyses recommend 40 nm nominal pore size for uf svenskt vatten 2015 these larger pore sizes would probably not remove smaller viruses as efficiently as the membranes in this study common human viruses with fecal oral spread that may not have been removed by larger pores are e g norovirus 38 40 nm rotavirus 45 nm and adenovirus 90 100 nm several other viruses with fecal oral spread are as smaller as hev about 30 nm in diameter and may pass through the membranes as those belonging to the picornaviridae family for example hepatitis a virus enterovirus aichivirus and parechovirus this should be considered during outbreaks of these viruses in the community however the retention of viruses by uf may not only depend on virus size but also on other physiochemical factors of the viral capsid influencing on the flocculation of the virus during purification at the dwtps the results from this study indicate that the current methods are sensitive for reducing almost all larger viruses and most of the smaller size viruses in water although hev was found in treated water before disinfection at the dwtps and in tap water the amount per l tap water was comparable low therefore the risk of infection by consumption of the drinking water is probably negligible however further studies on viral infectivity and lowest infectious dose are needed the decrease of number of viral reads with more than 3 log10 by conventional treatment of raw water indicate that the treatment has high virus removal the findings of viruses including hev in water leaving the dwtps should be of concern to drinking water producers that do not practice the multibarrier approach recommended by the world health organization it should be noted that the analysing methods used in this study do not separate between active and inactivated viruses the viability of the viruses needs to be further studied it was somewhat surprising to find from 10 to 130 iu hev3 sequences per ml raw treated and tap water in this study it is well known that hev1 and hev2 cause waterborne outbreaks in developing countries in asia and africa chen et al 2016 hazam et al 2010 naik et al 1992 rab et al 1997 however in europe hev3 is the most common genotype and has mainly zoonotic spread through consumption of contaminated meat hev3 has been detected in shellfish grown in coastal waters in europe showing that hev is prevalent in the water and that consumption of shellfish may also be a potential route for hev transmission crossan et al 2012 mesquita et al 2016 said et al 2009 the role of drinking water for its spreading is not well understood only one recent study from france has shown that infections with hev3 may be associated with drinking tap water mansuy et al 2016 the microbial quality of drinking water in developed countries is usually well monitored but some studies have shown the presence of adenovirus enteroviruses and norovirus in tap water cho et al 2000 haramoto et al 2004 one study in korea showed that enterovirus and adenovirus identified in tap water were still viable lee and kim 2002 it is not known if hev at low levels in the drinking water is infectious since the human infectious dose for hev is not known for macaques it has shown to be more than 104 5 particles for oral infection tsarev et al 1994 which would correspond to consumption of more than 1 l of the tap water with the highest amount of hev in this study even if the viability of the virus is not known it is shown that viruses are viable for longer periods in purified waters rzezutka and cook 2004 the finding of hev3 in tap water indicates that the route of waterborne hev3 infections should be considered also in developed countries and the presence of this virus in the waters may be monitored if outbreaks are suspected phylogenetic analysis of the hev sequences showed that the strains belonged to subtype hev3c i this subtype is not found in swedish pigs or wild boars which are infected with subtypes hev3f or 3e roth et al 2016 wang et al 2019 hev3c i often causes chronic hev infection with prolonged excretion by the carrier norder et al 2018 it has been isolated from humans with unknown source of infection in sweden although imported food items have been suspected norder et al 2018 the results in this study indicate that water may also be a source for hev3c i infections the reason for the high prevalence of this subtype in water needs further investigation different hev3 subtypes may have different sensitivity to treatment or hev3c i may spread into the waters more often than other subtypes hev3 has also been found at low levels in sewage samples in the gothenburg area hellmer et al 2014 but the genetic relations between hev strains in sewage and raw and treated water is still unclear and further investigations of their possible transmission routes are needed apart from hev a high diversity of other viruses was found in the waters before and after treatments as well as in tap water many viruses were bacteriophages and plant viruses this is in agreement with another study on the virome in reclaimed and potable water in the us rosario et al 2009 some bacteriophages could originate from normal growth of their bacterial hosts in the water the identification of abundant bacteriophages is promising for development of techniques for monitoring removal or intrusion of viruses at dwtps when the number of pathogenic viruses is low the current monitoring of microbiota in the waters at the swedish dwtps is mainly based on faecal indicator bacteria as e coli and enterococci and in gothenburg also clostridium and coliphages however the commonly used surrogate bacteriophages were not found in the water samples in this study the use of another widely distributed surrogate phage present in both natural aquatic environments and in treated water could be helpful to better understand the removal processes and efficiency one of the most common sequences identified in this study were homologous to gokushoviruses this virus has also been found in abundance in different waters globally and from sewage treatment plants also in sweden diemer and stedman 2016 labonte and suttle 2013 wang et al 2018 zhong et al 2015 further studies will explore the possible use of this virus for monitoring the quality of drinking water this study identified numerous sequences homologous to viruses that could not be classified into a known viral family most could not be cultured by current techniques this shows that metagenomics is useful for identification of both known and unknown viruses in environmental samples although it cannot distinguish between viable and non infectious viruses other drawbacks of this technique are the sensitivity of the pcr used for amplifying the sequences before ngs and the workflow used for sequence analysis these methods may underestimate the viral diversity as has been shown in sewage samples in which viruses could be identified by qpcr but not by ngs cantalupo et al 2011 wang et al 2018 the analysis of the sequences may also overestimate the number of identified viruses since the assembled sequences may give false hits when they are used for blast against a database bibby et al 2019 rosseel et al 2014 to reduce the possible false positive viral reads the assembled sequences were used at two blast occasions in this study first against a database with viral sequences and the hits obtained were searched against the whole nucleotide database in genbank this optimized workflow reduced the number of viral sequences classified into different viral families from 62 to 28 and accelerated the process however both false negative and positive results could be obtained by ngs subsequent confirmations by specific qpcr sanger sequencing and phylogenetic analyses are needed to provide robust classification of the viral genomes identified which was performed for hev and gokushkovirus in this study 5 conclusion this study showed that even if the number of viruses were reduced 3 4 log10 at the two dwtps there were sequences representing many different virus families including hev in the effluent after uf and in tap water the total number of viral reads in tap water was about 0 1 of that in raw water but for hev it was 2 2 despite this the risk for getting infected by viruses in these concentrations in the drinking water is probably negligible however there may be a risk of transmission during outbreaks with large number of infected persons excreting high concentrations of small fecal oral transmitted viruses the virome and reduction of many different small rna and dna viruses in water could be monitored using an indicator virus as gokushovirus which was found in all water samples further studies are necessary to investigate the viability of the viruses identified in water to achieve better understanding of the efficiency of virus removal and inactivation there may be a need for routine monitoring for viral indicators in waters at the dwtps and in the distribution network this knowledge will help tracking possible transmissions of viruses from raw water to tap water and thereby ultimately reduce potential risks of viral infections from drinking tap water during outbreaks declaration of competing interest the authors declare

18383,in this study next generation sequencing was used to explore the virome in 20l up to 10 000l water from different purification steps at two swedish drinking water treatment plants dwtps and in tap water one dwtp used ultrafiltration uf with 20 nm pores the other uv light treatment after conventional treatment of the water viruses belonging to 26 different families were detected in raw water in which 6 9 times more sequence reads were found for phages than for known environmental plant or vertebrate viruses the total number of viral reads was reduced more than 4 log10 after uf and 3 log10 over uv treatment however for some viruses the reduction was 3 5 log10 after uf as for hepatitis e virus hev which was also detected in tap water with sequences similar to those in raw water and after treatment this indicates that hev had passed through the treatment and entered into the supply network however the viability of the viruses is unknown in tap water 10 130 international units of hev rna ml were identified which is a comparable low amount of virus the risk of getting infected through consumption of tap water is probably negligible but needs to be investigated the hev strains in the waters belonged to subtypes hev3a and hev3c i which is associated with unknown source of infection in humans infected in sweden none of these subtypes are common among pigs or wild boar the major reservoirs for hev indicating that water may play a role in transmitting this virus the results indicate that monitoring small fecal oral transmitted viruses in dwtps may be considered especially

drinking water are a global problem for public health in drinking water treatment plants dwtps stringent regulations for monitoring the water quality by bacterial indicators are implemented in order to supply safe reliable drinking water to the communities the bacteria used as fecal indicators in the processes for monitoring the purification from microorganisms are often escherichia coli and enterococci figueras and borrego 2010 however bacteria have been questioned as indicators for removal and inactivation of viruses and protozoa cysts gerba et al 1979 harwood et al 2005 the world health organization who recommends multi barrier approaches to prevent distribution of contaminated drinking water and reduce the contaminations to levels not hazardous for health who 2017 in many dwtps the raw water is treated with coagulation flocculation sedimentation rapid filtration and additional chlorine and or uv disinfection before the water is distributed concerns about by products from chlorine have arisen and consequently less or no chlorine treatment is the trend for current disinfection of the water kim et al 2003 li and mitch 2018 richardson 2003 instead alternative disinfection and removal technologies have been developed and are now implemented as nanofiltration ultrafiltration uf and ozonation which can be applied together with conventional treatment boleda et al 2011 lopes et al 2013 meunier et al 2006 shin and sobsey 2003 xia et al 2004 the survival rate of viruses in environmental waters is affected by various conditions as temperature and ph many viruses are stable and can survive for long periods in groundwater or drinking water as hepatitis a virus for which 99 inactivation takes about 56 days rzezutka and cook 2004 for adenovirus type 41 it is up to 304 days at 4 c in water enriquez et al 1995 rzezutka and cook 2004 in addition some viruses like adenovirus are resistant to uv disinfection which is commonly used in drinking water treatment plants linden et al 2007 silva et al 2011 the bacteriophages ms2 and qÎ² are often used as surrogate viruses in studies of removal and inactivation of viruses during water treatment since they have similar size composition morphology and structure with human enteric viruses and also share similar persistence in multiple water environments arraj et al 2005 nasser et al 1995 other bacteriophages as gokushoviruses are more abundant in many different waters globally as in seas rivers and oceans labonte et al 2015 these viruses were the most common virus found in the water at a local sewage treatment plant in sweden wang et al 2018 considering their high abundance in aquatic environment and specific geographical distribution these viruses may be used as a model indicator for the presence of and purification efficiency from viruses in treated water at local level hepatitis e virus hev is a small rna virus associated with numerous outbreaks linked to contaminated water supplies in asia and africa where genotypes hev1 and hev2 are prevalent rab et al 1997 sailaja et al 2009 swain et al 2010 currently five genotypes infect humans hev1 4 and hev7 purdy et al 2017 sridhar et al 2017 hev3 and hev4 are zoonotic and have wild boar and domestic pigs as the major reservoirs hammerschmidt et al 2017 roth et al 2016 rutjes et al 2010 the role of water for transmission of these subtypes is still unknown this study was performed to investigate the virome in different waters by metagenomics sequencing and to evaluate the efficacy of removing viruses during the purification process from raw to drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection sites gothenburg is located at the estuary of the river gÃ¶ta Ã¤lv on the west coast of sweden it is the second largest swedish city with about 550 000 inhabitants in the urban area the raw water from the river gÃ¶ta Ã¤lv serves as the main source for drinking water which is produced at two major dwtps alelyckan and lackarebÃ¤ck alelyckan supplies water mainly to northeast gothenburg as well as to central and eastern hisingen an island north of central gothenburg lackarebÃ¤ck supplies water mainly to southern and south eastern gothenburg the central city and western hisingen are supplied from both dwtps the raw water is treated through chemical flocculation sedimentation and activated carbon filtration followed by inactivation by chlorine and chlorine dioxide at both dwtps the choice of raw water is based on quality criteria during periods of actual or suspected faecal contamination raw water from the reservoir lake delsjÃ¶n is used instead from the river directly at alelyckan dwtp the treated water is disinfected by ultraviolet light uv light with a uv dose of 40 mj cm2 the microbiological barriers are followed up with removal of micro algae and on line turbidity chemical inactivation is controlled to achieve enough ct values for virus inactivation ct is the disinfectant concentration multiplied by the contact time and checked with live cell staining as well as bacterial indicators there is certification of virus inactivation for the type of uv equipment based on seeding test with uv resistant micro organisms but the monitoring during operation relies on in direct measurements of uv254 transmittance and light intensity in lackarebÃ¤ck uf membranes are added as an extra microbial barrier instead of uv disinfection the pores of the membranes have a nominal size of 20 nm which is less than the size of most target pathogens pore size typically gets smaller by fouling scaling during operation when coagulation is applied before uf most viruses are believed to adsorb to larger flocs before uf or on flocs accumulating on the membrane surface bratby 2006 before installation of full scale modules removal of small particles was tested on selected membranes from different batches of membranes ms2 phages and virus like particles vlps met the criteria of more than 4 log10 removal the integrity control of the uf membranes is performed daily by pressurizing the membranes with air and the ability to retain air is recorded to check for single defect fibres failure to meet these requirements automatically leads to removal of the unit low range on line particle counters are also used to monitor for major damage and changes in pore size distribution removal of fluorescent vlps are analysed by fluorescence microscopy these tests showed more than 4 log10 removal of vlps larger than 20 nm by the uf membranes all measured parameters of the waters during the sampling period are given in a1 1 table s1 before pumping the water into the supply network chlorine and chlorine dioxide are added at alelyckan as part of the multiple microbial barriers

longer than 50 bp were accepted the reads were de novo assembled using the built in clc de novo assembler with a word size of 20 and an automatic bubble size of 50 bp all viral sequences were downloaded from ncbi genbank to build a local genomic viral database and the contigs and unassembled singleton reads longer than 100 bp were blasted against this local viral database using blastn the reads with a cut off for e value 10 5 and hsp lengths 100 bp were considered as possible viral hits these hits were used for a second blast against all genomes in the ncbi genbank non redundant

table s2 and reaction conditions as previous described roth et al 2016 2 5 sequence analysis the amplified and sequenced 357 nucleotides of the vp1 of gokushovirus and 820 nucleotides of the junction region of orf1 orf2 orf3 of the hev consensus sequences from the metagenomics analysis were analysed in the program seqman in the dnastar program package version 10 1 2 dna star inc madison wi 53705 usa for the phylogenetic analysis of partial vp1 of gokushovirus a total of 204 sequences from viruses belonging to the microviridae family in genbank were aligned with sequences obtained from the water samples in this study for hev the corresponding region of 133 hev3 sequences and two hev1 sequences obtained from ncbi database were aligned with the hev sequences obtained in this study phylogenetic analysis was carried out with the phylip package version 3 65 felsenstein 1996 the evolutionary distances were calculated using hasegaw kishino yano hky algorithm in dnadist program in the phylip package and phylogenetic trees were constructed using unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages upgma and neighbor joining nj methods in the phylip package the trees were visualized with the program treeview version 1 6 6 page 2002 all sequences obtained from this study are deposited in genbank with accession numbers mn51833 mn518340 3 results 3 1 number of virus reads identified by ngs a total of 8 5 106 to 31 106 raw reads were obtained for the samples sequenced table 2 after trimming and reassembling the sequences were analysed for homology by blast first to all viral sequences in genbank thereafter the sequences obtained were investigated by a second blast for homology to all sequences available in genbank the non redundant nucleotide database table 2 this resulted in 7 5 103 to 435 103 reads or contigs classified as viral reads 0 02 3 54 of all reads all reads similar to viral sequences were between 110 bp and 900 bp the highest number of reads corresponding to viral sequences per l sample was in the raw water for lackarebÃ¤ck dwtp table 2 the number of viral reads per l water was substantially reduced 2 2 to 2 7 log10 after carbon filtration treatment at lackarebÃ¤ck dwtps table 2 in alelyckan dwtp additional uv disinfection lowered the viral number of reads 3 2 log10 and in lackarebÃ¤ck dwtp the passage through uf membranes lowered the number 4 3 log10 in tap water sampled for three consecutive days the number of viral sequence reads varied between 540 and 2 211 per litre corresponding to 0 02 0 11 of the total reads in these samples table 2 sequences found homologous to viruses belonged to 12 28 known viral families and to about 650 non classified viruses in the eight different samples table 2 a1 2 tables s3 s4 the most abundant sequences were homologous to bacteriophages classified into the family microviridae and accounted for 57 of the viral reads in water after carbon filtration at lackarebÃ¤ck dwtp followed by myoviridae and siphoviridae sequenced homologous to protist viruses as mimiviridae and phycodnaviridae were also abundant and the most common viruses infecting vertebrates belonged to the hepeviridae parvoviridae and circoviridae families a1 2 table s3 the number of viral reads was substantially higher in raw water than in tap water for some phages the number increased after carbon filtration at the dwtps but decreased considerably after uf for mimiviridae a group of giant viruses the viral reads found in raw water was reduced by 40 45 after carbon filtration in the two dwtps and to undetectable levels after uf and by 90 after uv a1 2 table s3 for some other viruses belonging to the viral family virgaviridae a family of small viruses infecting plants the viral reads were relatively stable with 80 240 reads in all samples except in one tap water sample where it was missing a1 2 table s3 it is noteworthy that a virus identified the water samples in this study pepper mild mottle virus pmmov in the virgaviridae family was recently proposed as a potential indicator of human fecal contamination of environmental waters shirasaki et al 2017 3 2 detection and phylogenetic analysis of hev in water samples there were 1 103 to 33 103 viral reads of hepeviridae sequences identified in all eight water samples the number of reads of hev sequences per l water was reduced with about 3 log10 and 3 6 log10 after uv or uf treatment in the dwtps a1 2 table s3 the number of reads of hev sequences in tap water varied from 1 900 to 27 600 the presence of hev sequences in the waters was confirmed by qpcr which also was used to quantify the hev genomes hev rna could be quantified in all except two samples the raw water and before uv treatment a1 4 table s5 the water samples contained between 6 and 130 iu hev rna ml with the effluent from uf having the lowest amount and one tap water the highest a1 4 table s5 this calculation shown in table s5 is based on the ct values of the water samples and on the regression line obtained from log10 dilution and ct values of the who standard assuming a 10 20 recovery of viruses during concentration by nano ceram filtration as shown previously wang et al 2018 phylogenetic analysis of consensus sequences of 820 nucleotides in the junction region of orf1 orf2 orf3 revealed that seven of the hev sequences belonged to subtype hev3c i and one to hev3a the hev3c i sequences were found in tap water three strains in water treated after carbon filtration two strains and one strain each was in raw water and in water after uf at lackarebÃ¤ck dwtp fig 1 six of these strains formed one separate clade on the hev3c i branch in the phylogenetic tree another hev3c i strain from raw water was similar to a strain from a swedish blood donor fig 1 the hev strain from water after carbon filtration treatment in alelyckan dwtp was on the branch formed by hev3a strains which are often found in asia and the usa fig 1 and was similar to a strain from a canadian swine none of these strains were similar to the hev3f or 3e strains which are usually isolated from swedish pigs and wild boar 3 3 phylogenetic analysis of bacteriophages from microviridae identified in water samples to validate the ngs results and to understand the phylogenetic relationships between viruses identified in the different types of waters a semi nested pcr was developed for detection and sequencing of gokushovirus within the microviridae family strains in seven samples could be amplified and sequenced in the vp1 region b1 1 fig s2 phylogenetic analysis revealed that all gokushovirus strains belonged to the subfamily gokushovirinae in the microviridae family fig 2 the strains from raw and treated water in both dwtps were similar and formed one clade in the phylogenetic tree they were on the same branch as strains in fresh water from france the strain identified in a tap water sample was divergent and found in another clade with strains isolated from freshwater fish in the usa 4 discussion this study showed a substantial removal of most viruses from raw water treated with conventional methods and additional barriers at two swedish dwtps larger viruses were efficiently removed by uf however genomes of some smaller viruses as hev and some bacteriophages and plant viruses were detected after uf and uv treatment although uv has been shown to reduce the infectivity on recombinant hev1 hev3 virus adapted to cell cultures guerrero latorre et al 2016 the inactivation efficiency for wild type hev is not known fenaux et al 2019 the hev strains in this study could enter the water supply network despite that all standards were fulfilled for routine monitoring of small particles in the outlet water at the dwtps the pores in the uf membranes used are smaller than those recommended by the swedish authorities which have stated that membranes with pore size 100 nm can be a used microbial barrier and the norwegian guide for barrier analyses recommend 40 nm nominal pore size for uf svenskt vatten 2015 these larger pore sizes would probably not remove smaller viruses as efficiently as the membranes in this study common human viruses with fecal oral spread that may not have been removed by larger pores are e g norovirus 38 40 nm rotavirus 45 nm and adenovirus 90 100 nm several other viruses with fecal oral spread are as smaller as hev about 30 nm in diameter and may pass through the membranes as those belonging to the picornaviridae family for example hepatitis a virus enterovirus aichivirus and parechovirus this should be considered during outbreaks of these viruses in the community however the retention of viruses by uf may not only depend on virus size but also on other physiochemical factors of the viral capsid influencing on the flocculation of the virus during purification at the dwtps the results from this study indicate that the current methods are sensitive for reducing almost all larger viruses and most of the smaller size viruses in water although hev was found in treated water before disinfection at the dwtps and in tap water the amount per l tap water was comparable low therefore the risk of infection by consumption of the drinking water is probably negligible however further studies on viral infectivity and lowest infectious dose are needed the decrease of number of viral reads with more than 3 log10 by conventional treatment of raw water indicate that the treatment has high virus removal the findings of viruses including hev in water leaving the dwtps should be of concern to drinking water producers that do not practice the multibarrier approach recommended by the world health organization it should be noted that the analysing methods used in this study do not separate between active and inactivated viruses the viability of the viruses needs to be further studied it was somewhat surprising to find from 10 to 130 iu hev3 sequences per ml raw treated and tap water in this study it is well known that hev1 and hev2 cause waterborne outbreaks in developing countries in asia and africa chen et al 2016 hazam et al 2010 naik et al 1992 rab et al 1997 however in europe hev3 is the most common genotype and has mainly zoonotic spread through consumption of contaminated meat hev3 has been detected in shellfish grown in coastal waters in europe showing that hev is prevalent in the water and that consumption of shellfish may also be a potential route for hev transmission crossan et al 2012 mesquita et al 2016 said et al 2009 the role of drinking water for its spreading is not well understood only one recent study from france has shown that infections with hev3 may be associated with drinking tap water mansuy et al 2016 the microbial quality of drinking water in developed countries is usually well monitored but some studies have shown the presence of adenovirus enteroviruses and norovirus in tap water cho et al 2000 haramoto et al 2004 one study in korea showed that enterovirus and adenovirus identified in tap water were still viable lee and kim 2002 it is not known if hev at low levels in the drinking water is infectious since the human infectious dose for hev is not known for macaques it has shown to be more than 104 5 particles for oral infection tsarev et al 1994 which would correspond to consumption of more than 1 l of the tap water with the highest amount of hev in this study even if the viability of the virus is not known it is shown that viruses are viable for longer periods in purified waters rzezutka and cook 2004 the finding of hev3 in tap water indicates that the route of waterborne hev3 infections should be considered also in developed countries and the presence of this virus in the waters may be monitored if outbreaks are suspected phylogenetic analysis of the hev sequences showed that the strains belonged to subtype hev3c i this subtype is not found in swedish pigs or wild boars which are infected with subtypes hev3f or 3e roth et al 2016 wang et al 2019 hev3c i often causes chronic hev infection with prolonged excretion by the carrier norder et al 2018 it has been isolated from humans with unknown source of infection in sweden although imported food items have been suspected norder et al 2018 the results in this study indicate that water may also be a source for hev3c i infections the reason for the high prevalence of this subtype in water needs further investigation different hev3 subtypes may have different sensitivity to treatment or hev3c i may spread into the waters more often than other subtypes hev3 has also been found at low levels in sewage samples in the gothenburg area hellmer et al 2014 but the genetic relations between hev strains in sewage and raw and treated water is still unclear and further investigations of their possible transmission routes are needed apart from hev a high diversity of other viruses was found in the waters before and after treatments as well as in tap water many viruses were bacteriophages and plant viruses this is in agreement with another study on the virome in reclaimed and potable water in the us rosario et al 2009 some bacteriophages could originate from normal growth of their bacterial hosts in the water the identification of abundant bacteriophages is promising for development of techniques for monitoring removal or intrusion of viruses at dwtps when the number of pathogenic viruses is low the current monitoring of microbiota in the waters at the swedish dwtps is mainly based on faecal indicator bacteria as e coli and enterococci and in gothenburg also clostridium and coliphages however the commonly used surrogate bacteriophages were not found in the water samples in this study the use of another widely distributed surrogate phage present in both natural aquatic environments and in treated water could be helpful to better understand the removal processes and efficiency one of the most common sequences identified in this study were homologous to gokushoviruses this virus has also been found in abundance in different waters globally and from sewage treatment plants also in sweden diemer and stedman 2016 labonte and suttle 2013 wang et al 2018 zhong et al 2015 further studies will explore the possible use of this virus for monitoring the quality of drinking water this study identified numerous sequences homologous to viruses that could not be classified into a known viral family most could not be cultured by current techniques this shows that metagenomics is useful for identification of both known and unknown viruses in environmental samples although it cannot distinguish between viable and non infectious viruses other drawbacks of this technique are the sensitivity of the pcr used for amplifying the sequences before ngs and the workflow used for sequence analysis these methods may underestimate the viral diversity as has been shown in sewage samples in which viruses could be identified by qpcr but not by ngs cantalupo et al 2011 wang et al 2018 the analysis of the sequences may also overestimate the number of identified viruses since the assembled sequences may give false hits when they are used for blast against a database bibby et al 2019 rosseel et al 2014 to reduce the possible false positive viral reads the assembled sequences were used at two blast occasions in this study first against a database with viral sequences and the hits obtained were searched against the whole nucleotide database in genbank this optimized workflow reduced the number of viral sequences classified into different viral families from 62 to 28 and accelerated the process however both false negative and positive results could be obtained by ngs subsequent confirmations by specific qpcr sanger sequencing and phylogenetic analyses are needed to provide robust classification of the viral genomes identified which was performed for hev and gokushkovirus in this study 5 conclusion this study showed that even if the number of viruses were reduced 3 4 log10 at the two dwtps there were sequences representing many different virus families including hev in the effluent after uf and in tap water the total number of viral reads in tap water was about 0 1 of that in raw water but for hev it was 2 2 despite this the risk for getting infected by viruses in these concentrations in the drinking water is probably negligible however there may be a risk of transmission during outbreaks with large number of infected persons excreting high concentrations of small fecal oral transmitted viruses the virome and reduction of many different small rna and dna viruses in water could be monitored using an indicator virus as gokushovirus which was found in all water samples further studies are necessary to investigate the viability of the viruses identified in water to achieve better understanding of the efficiency of virus removal and inactivation there may be a need for routine monitoring for viral indicators in waters at the dwtps and in the distribution network this knowledge will help tracking possible transmissions of viruses from raw water to tap water and thereby ultimately reduce potential risks of viral infections from drinking tap water during outbreaks declaration of competing interest the authors declare

18384,dissolved organic matter dom plays important roles in the aquatic biogeochemical cycle and the global carbon cycle however it is highly spatially and temporally varied due to complex sources from the catchment allochthonous and from within the system autochthonous satellite remote sensing provides the ability to monitor dom and identify the spatio temporal variations in lakes on a global or regional scale in this study field work was conducted in 55 lakes in august 2012 along the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river mlr yr where most lakes were characterized by eutrophication due to intense human activities the results showed that both colored dom cdom and total dom differed significantly by and were linearly related to the human induced trophic state index tsi with r 2 0 41 and 0 61 respectively autochthonous substances by phytoplankton contributed to 38 5 of cdom and 35 2 of dom and allochthonous terrestrial substance indexed by land cover change and aquaculture contributed to almost half with 49 7 of cdom and 49 8 of dom in total human activities explained as much as 81 7 and 87 5 of the variations in cdom and dom respectively finally a flowchart for estimating dom from satellite derived tsi was proposed this study has great significance for synchronously monitoring and managing aquatic environment quality in regional eutrophic lakes around the world graphical abstract image 1 keywords optical properties dissolved organic matter lake eutrophication yangtze river human activities 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom usually expressed by dissolved organic carbon doc mg c l is a broad classification used to refer to organic molecules of various origin and composition such as sugars fatty acids and alkanes and complex polymeric molecules within aquatic systems hirtle and rencz 2003 manahan and crisp 1982 this material plays important roles in the aquatic biogeochemical cycle and the global carbon cycle with an area that is only 0 7 that of oceans global lakes bury nearly half of organic carbon as that of the world s oceans dean and gorham 1998 in fact there are many published studies about dom in lakes ackefors and enell 1994 mendonca et al 2017 stedmon et al 2006 yao et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 2010 these studies reveal that dom varies greatly in terms of the spatial and temporal scales of lakes and this variation is impacted by human induced eutrophication or external dom from the drainage basin there are two dom sources autochthonous and allochthonous autochthonous dom mainly comes from phytoplankton production aquatic phytoplankton can release extracellular dom baines and pace 1991 and their degradation also produces dom zhang et al 2009 for global open oceans dom is greatly related to phytoplankton density morel and gentili 2009 tiwari and shanmugam 2011 allochthonous dom from the drainage basin is also an important dom source resulting from the decomposition processes of dead organisms such as plants allochthonous dom is greatly impacted by external inputs because a considerable amount of dom is transported into lakes from domestic and industrial sewage liu et al 2015 stedmon et al 2006 in these cases the dom in lakes was often differed with tempo spatially varied human activities jiang et al 2013 kutser 2012 sun et al 2011 satellite remote sensing is an alternative choice for dynamically monitoring dom in lakes generally total dom is divided into two parts optically active and non active components the optically active dom namely the colored dom cdom has been widely studied using satellite data chen et al 2017a fichot and benner 2011 fichot et al 2015 morel and gentili 2009 siegel et al 2002 many empirical and semi analytical remote sensing algorithms have been developed to estimate cdom not only for oceanic waters castillo and miller 2008 morel and gentili 2009 swan et al 2013 tiwari and shanmugam 2011 but also for inland waters chen et al 2017b jiang et al 2013 kutser 2012 in contrast few algorithms have specifically focused on the optically non active or total dom that is usually quantified by doc hirtle and rencz 2003 liu et al 2018 in fact total dom has been generally estimated from cdom based on statistical correlation between both concentrations with average r 2 of 0 84 castillo and miller 2008 fichot and benner 2011 fichot et al 2015 jiang et al 2012 liu et al 2018 but most of these studies have been conducted for oceans with little attention given to inland lakes to remotely monitor cdom and or dom in regional lakes it is important to understand their optical properties moreover knowledge of dom variations with environmental factors is a prerequisite for the refinement of remote sensing algorithms oubelkheir et al 2005 lake eutrophication is a global problem wang et al 2018 reported that 63 1 of lakes with surface area 25 km2 were in eutrophication globally the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river mlr yr is one representative region containing 696 lakes that are larger than 1 km2 ma et al 2010 moreover most lakes along the mlr yr are significantly characterized by human induced eutrophication duan et al 2014 ma et al 2010 zhang et al 2007 to the best of our knowledge no study has systematically analyzed the optical properties of dom in these lakes nor has remote sensing monitoring been used in this study we describe the optical properties of dom trophic state and correlations between different variables in the lakes along the mlr yr the impact factors and composition of dom are then discussed based on our findings the implications for remote sensing monitoring dom are also addressed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area with a length of 6300 km the yangtze river locally called the changjiang river is the longest river in china and the third longest river in the world wang et al 2012 according to the geology climate and geomorphology the yangtze river is divided into the upper middle and lower reaches chen et al 2001 the mlr yr starts from yichang city is 1880 km in length and has a low gradient basin with a coverage area of 785 000 km2 with 696 lakes larger than 1 km2 ma et al 2010 the mlr yr basin is a representative for the region with dense lakes lakes along the mlr yr are shown in fig 1 the mlr yr basin is in the east asian monsoon climate zone with high temperature and heavy precipitation in summer but opposite conditions in winter guo et al 2014 a large amount of terrestrial dom is flushed into lakes in summer with high runoff and lakes receive effluent discharges from agricultural activities as well as from small villages or mega urban areas duan et al 2014 2 2 field data collection in august summer 2012 55 lakes along the mlr

the ship s shaded side using a 25 cm diameter disk painted in black white quarters surface water within a 0 30 cm water depth was collected using a standard 2 liter polyethylene water sampler all in situ water samples were stored in brown bottles and on ice for approximately 4 h before filtration 2 2 1 constituent concentrations the same in situ raw water was used for the total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and chemical oxygen demand cod samples in situ water samples were also filtered through satorius cellulose acetate filters 0 45 Î¼m pore size Ï47 mm and the filter membrane with particle was used as the chlorophyll a chl a sample the tn and tp concentrations were determined by spectrophotometric analysis after persulfate digestion apha 1995 the cod was determined using the potassium permanganate boiling method apha 1995 the chl a sample was first soaked in 90 ethanol in the dark for 24 h and heated to 80 90 c for 3 5 min the light absorbance of the extracting solution was then measured at 630 a 630 645 a 645 663 a 663 and 750 nm a 750 using a uv2401 spectrophotometer finally the chl a concentration was calculated using eq 1 knap et al 1996 1 chl a 11 64 a 663 a 750

et al 1996 2 2 2 cdom absorption and fluorescence the dom sample was further filtered through a pre rinsed millipore polycarbonate filter 0 22 Î¼m pore size Ï47 mm to collect the cdom sample in the lab the cdom absorption coefficient spectrum was measured from 250 nm to 800 nm with an interval of 1 nm using a shimadzu uv2600 spectrophotometer mueller et al 2003 the cdom absorption coefficient exponentially decreases with increasing wavelength tiwari and shanmugam 2011 zhang et al 2010 with a known cdom absorption coefficient at wavelength Î»0 a cdom Î»0 and its spectral slope s cdom nm 1 the absorption coefficient at any wavelength Î» a cdom Î» can be calculated using eq 2 2 a cdom Î» a cdom Î» 0 exp s cdom Î» Î» 0 for the cdom samples from stations located at the lake centers three dimensional excitation emission spectra eems were also measured by a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer with a 700 voltage xenon lamp hitachi high technologies japan ranges of 200 450 nm for excitation 5 nm intervals and 250 600 nm for emission 1 nm intervals were scanned after raman scattering elimination excitation and emission calibration inner filter effect elimination and fluorescence intensity normalization to quinine sulfate units qsu the eems were decomposed into individual fluorescent components by parallel factor analysis parafac and the split half validation procedure in matlab r2008a with domfluor toolbox zhang et al 2010 2 3 lake watershed datasets similar to mendonca et al 2017 the watershed extent of each lake was identified through the wwf hydrobasins tool provided by the usgs www hydrosheds org in the lake watershed extent definition the hydrosheds dataset was processed with a user friendly graphical interface the lake watershed extent was used to extract the land cover in 2010 table s1 the land cover data were derived from the land cover atlas of the people s republic of china with 30 m resolution which contained six land cover types forest grassland wetland cropland artificial surface and others and were made available by the institute of remote sensing application chinese academy of sciences cas www chinageoss org the mean gross domestic product gdp 104rmb km2 population density pop person km2 and topsoil organic content soil toc weight in each lake watershed were also calculated both the gdp and the population in 2010 were gridded reanalysis data and downloaded from the global change research data publishing repository website www geodoi ac cn the soil toc data were extracted from the harmonized world soil database based on the national soil survey of china in 1995 shangguan et al 2012 2 4 trophic state index there are many mathematical methods for assessing lake eutrophication among them the simple and feasible trophic state index tsi is commonly used aizaki et al 1981 carlson 1977 zhang et al 2010 the original tsi tsio was developed upon sdd as relative indicator of algal biomass carlson 1977 however sdd is partially influenced by other factors like sediment resuspension which is independent of algal biomass aizaki et al 1981 wang et al 2002 to make up for this deficiency a modified tsi tsim was developed using chl a concentration as the indicator of algal biomass aizaki et al 1981 along the mlr yr most lakes are characterized by shallow waters and sdd is greatly impacted by sediment resuspension duan et al 2014 shi et al 2015 xue et al 2019 therefore tsim was chosen in this study note that tsim may get different results with different inputs in this case the weighted arithmetic mean of tsim calculated from tn tp chl a cod and sdd was usually used to evaluate eutrophication of chinese lakes wang et al 2002 zhang et al 2006 2010 in this study we also used the weighted arithmetic tsim tsi for convenience defined as eq 3 zhang et al 2006 3 tsi j 1 m w j tsi j w j r j 2 j 1 m r j 2 tsi tn 10 5 453 1 694 ln tn tsi tp 10 9 436 1 624 ln tp tsi chl a 10 2 5 1 086 ln chl a tsi cod 10 0 109 2 66 ln cod tsi sdd 10 5 118 1 94 ln sd where tn tp chl a cod and sdd are used m 5 the weighted tsi also uses chl a as the basis the pearson s r j of tn tp chl a cod and sdd to chl a are used to calculate the weight w j respectively the trophic levels are defined using tsi with tsi 30 being oligotrophic 30 tsi 50 being mesotrophic 50 tsi 60 being lightly eutrophic 60 tsi 70 being moderately eutrophic and 70 tsi being highly eutrophic wang et al 2002 zhang et al 2006 2 5 multiple general linear model to quantify the relative contribution of each explanatory variable to the spatial variations of the cdom and dom concentrations correlation analyses and multiple general linear model glm were used tong et al 2017 dom is affected not only by natural lake attributes but also by human activities in a lake s watershed zhang et al 2010 therefore the explanatory variables included not only the area water depth and tsi in a lake but also the mean soil toc gdp pop and percent area of artificial surface and cropland in the lake watershed acinlw the lake area water depth and soil toc represented natural variability and the other variables represented human induced disturbance intensity notably p value for each variable was also output and p 0 05 indicated a statistically significant contribution 3 results 3 1 general characteristics all tn tp chl a cod and sdd spanned wide ranges in lakes along the mlr yr table 2 the maximum values of these variables were 7 13 37 5 36 64 4 57 and 15 4 times those of the minimum values respectively table 2 both tn and tp accelerated phytoplankton production and were significantly positively correlated with chl a with pearson s r 0 61 and 0 6 respectively fig 2 a the cod was also significantly positively related to chl a with r 0 76 and p 0 01 fig 2b note that the increased phytoplankton significantly decreased the sdd with r 0 36 and p 0 01 fig 2b with significant relations to chl a the tsi values at all stations were calculated by eq 3 and the arithmetic mean was further calculated for each lake table 1 lakes along the mlr yr were characterized by serious eutrophication for the 55 lakes investigated none were oligotrophic 4 were mesotrophic 18 were lightly eutrophic 20 were moderately eutrophic and as many as 13 were highly eutrophic table 1 lake eutrophication was spatially varied and eutrophication in hubei province was generally more serious than that in the other provinces figs 1 and s1a the mean tsi values were 64 4 9 14 52 23 7 25 57 73 6 01 and 59 13 5 98 in the hubei jiangxi anhui and jiangsu provinces respectively fig s2 in the supplementary material file it is also worth noting that 12 of the 13 highly eutrophic lakes were located in hubei province fig 1 3 2 optical properties of dom the dom concentrations in lakes along the mlr yr were largely spatially varied for different lakes the dom ranged from 1 91 to 8 42 mg c l with a mean std of 4 58 1 38 mg c l table 2 the dom was generally high in hubei province and decreased from upstream to downstream with increasing longitude figs 3a and s1b similar to zhang et al 2010 we used the cdom absorption coefficient at 280 nm a cdom 280 to denote the cdom concentration the maximum a cdom 280 was 4 64 times the minimum value with a mean std of 15 37 4 77 m 1 table 2 however the a cdom 280 did not show significantly high values in lakes in hubei province like those found for the dom figs 3 and s1c with r 2 0 46 for the linear relationship between a cdom 280 and dom the a cdom 280 only explained 46 of the variation in the dom fig 2d four fluorescent components were identified by eems parafac analyses fig 4 component 1 c1 had excitation 275 nm and emission 308 nm characteristics which were similar to those of autochthonous tyrosine like dom coble 1996 component 2 c2 displayed two excitation maxima 250 and 310 nm and a single emission maximum 392 nm similar to autochthonous marine humic like dom caused by phytoplankton degradation coble 1996 component 3 c3 had excitation 250 nm and 285 nm and emission 340 nm features similar to autochthonous tryptophan like dom coble 1996 component 4 c4 displayed excitation 245 and 355 nm and emission 468 nm characteristics similar to those of allochthonous terrestrial humic like dom coble 1996 all optical properties of dom differed with tsi both a cdom 280 and dom were significantly linearly positively related to tsi with r 2 0 41 and 0 61 respectively fig 2c for dom the mean std was 2 59 0 53 mg c l 3 8 0 78 mg c l 4 42 0 78 mg c l and 6 28 0 99 mg c l for the mesotrophic lightly eutrophic moderately eutrophic and highly eutrophic lakes respectively fig 3 c for a cdom 280 the mean std was 8 18 0 91 m 1 13 77 3 3 m 1 15 32 3 17 m 1 and 18 59 3 83 m 1 respectively fig 3c all cdom fluorescent components also increased with increasing trophic levels especially for c2 c3 and c4 fig 3d 3 3 impact factors for dom variations the lake environment variables were greatly varied along the mlr yr for different lakes mean std of water depth area and tsi were 3 29 1 56 m 3 36 1 58 km2 and 62 16 8 77 respectively tables 1 and 2 for different lake watersheds mean std of gdp population density soil toc and acinlw were 1149 58 1541 52 104 rmb km2 523 28 267 56 person km2 1 05 0 26 and 66 67 17 72 respectively table 2 from upstream to downstream with increasing longitude the mean gdp and soil toc significantly increased p 0 05 however the acinlw in the lake watershed significantly decreased fig s3 in the supplementary material file there were significant linear relationships between the lake environment variables and the optical properties of dom the lake area water depth and soil toc were significantly negatively related to a cdom 280 dom c2 c3 and c4 table 3 the acinlw and tsi showed significant positive relationships with the a cdom 280 dom c2 c3 and c4 table 3 however the population density was only significantly positively correlated with c3 and gdp did not show a significant relation to any optical properties of dom table 3 these relationships denoted the impacts of environmental variables on dom composition 4 discussion 4 1 human induced dom variations for lakes distributed worldwide sobek et al 2007 reported that the possible dom range for a specific region was set by climatic and topographic features for a specific lake however the lake watershed properties could also regulate the dom sobek et al 2007 all lakes along the mlr yr were affected by the east asian monsoon climate with high precipitation in summer guo et al 2014 however the mlr yr region is one of the most developed regions in china with a high population density yue et al 2005 being influenced by intense human activities bennett et al 2001 qin 2002 the dom in lakes along the mlr yr was spatially varied with human induced eutrophication fig 3 the lake area water depth and soil toc in a lake watershed were used to describe the natural impacts on the spatial variations in dom the mean dom in different lakes along the mlr yr was 4 58 1 38 mg c l table 2 but the mean dom in precipitation was only 1 5 mg c l in the mlr yr region safieddine and heald 2017 therefore precipitation would dilute the dom in lakes for the yangtze river the dom decreased with increasing water discharge namely precipitation liu et al 2015 negative relations between lake area water depth and dom composition also denoted the dilution impacts by precipitation table 3 for lake watersheds with high soil toc much of the terrestrial dom could be flushed into rivers or lakes ludwig and probst 1996 if so we supposed a positive relation between soil toc and dom composition but the opposite occurred table 3 it might due to the negative relationship between soil toc and acinlw r 0 48 p 0 05 and the positive relationship between acinlw and dom composition table 3 these indicated the insignificant impact of soil toc on dom the acinlw gdp pop and tsi were used to describe the human impacts on spatial variations in dom land cover had impacts on watershed dom output with a high value for cropland correll et al 2001 for lakes along the mlr yr the cropland area percent in watershed also showed positive relations to dom composition with r 0 fig 5 a in addition industrial and domestic sewage from human activities in a lake catchment would increase the riverine input of dom stedmon et al 2006 xia and zhang 2011 all the artificial surface area percent gdp and pop could indicate human activity intensity in lake watershed and showed increase effects on dom composition fig 5b table 3 for a specific lake watershed because cropland area percent and artificial surface area percent were like a seesaw r 0 5 p 0 01 so we combined them into acinlw the results showed that acinlw was significantly positively related to dom composition section 3 3 with increasing tsi increased nitrogen and phosphorus from the basin elevated the nutrition available for potential phytoplankton growth bennett et al 2001 seitzinger et al 2005 xia and zhang 2011 and much dom would be produced during phytoplankton degradation zhang et al 2009 2010 the cdom in lakes of the yungui plateau china also differed with tsi zhang et al 2010 contributions of different impact factors on dom variations were quantitatively estimated by multiple glm due to the unexpected relationship between soil toc and dom composition table 3 soil toc was excluded in the multiple glm analysis the tsi significantly explained 65 7 74 3 33 3 51 4 26 2 and 61 9 of the variations in the a cdom 280 dom c1 c2 c3 and c4 respectively fig 5c in total human activities explained as much as 81 7 87 5 64 4 70 5 71 2 and 78 7 of variations in the a cdom 280 dom c1 c2 c3 and c4 respectively fig 5c overall human activities dominated the spatial variations of dom components in lakes along the mlr yr 4 2 dom composition multiple glm was also used to quantify the relative contributions of different components on dom composition variations allochthonous terrestrial humic like substance c4 contributed almost half with 49 7 of cdom and 49 8 of dom fig 5d autochthonous marine humic like substance c2 contributed 20 of cdom and 15 7 of dom autochthonous tyrosine like c1 and tryptophan like c3 substances contributed 18 5 of cdom and 19 5 of dom respectively fig 5d overall autochthonous substances contributed to 38 5 of cdom and 35 2 of dom in lakes along the mlr yr intense human activities increased the allochthonous terrestrial dom input on the one hand human activities increased terrigenous dom inputs to lakes by rivers with a dom stock of only 0 13 tg c lake taihu received as much as 0 24 tg c yr of terrestrial dom from the input rivers hu et al 2015 compared with humic like dom protein like dom from human activities was characterized by lower percent aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 zhang et al 2010 suva254 defined as the ratio of the cdom absorption coefficient at 254 nm a cdom 254 to the dom denotes the dom percent aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 the increased suva254 and percent aromaticity with increasing tsi indicated dom contributions from human activities fig s4 on the other hand lake aquaculture also increased allochthonous dom for nordic countries ackefors and enell 1994 reported that approximately 80 of the organic matter in fish feed accumulated in waters along the mlr yr human activity intensity denoted by acinlw was most strong in the hubei province and decreased from upstream to downstream fig s3c moreover aquaculture yield was equivalent to 5 41 4 87 3 15 and 5 45 tons per hectare in the hubei jiangxi anhui and jiangsu provinces in 2012 respectively www stats gov cn these together resulted in the high values of eutrophication levels and dom composition in the hubei province figs 3 and s1 phytoplankton production was an important autochthonous source of dom phytoplankton can release extracellular dom baines and pace 1991 and their degradation can also produce dom zhang et al 2009 for eutrophic lake taihu fig 1 phytoplankton production and decomposition are important contributors to cdom yao et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 the ratio of the cdom absorption coefficient at 254 nm to that at 436 nm a cdom 254 a cdom 436 indicates the cdom source with low values of 4 37 11 34 for allochthonous cdom and higher values for autochthonous cdom battin 1998 a mean a cdom 254 a cdom 436 of 25 94 7 58 indicated phytoplankton s important contribution to cdom with r 2 0 31 and p 0 01 the significant positive relationship between a cdom 280 and chl a also verified phytoplankton s contribution to cdom fig s5 not only for cdom was phytoplankton production also an important source of total dom with r 2 0 42 and p 0 01 the significant positive relationship between dom and chl a verified phytoplankton s contribution to dom fig s5 for lakes located in the sierra nevada mountains spain phytoplankton intensity was also reported as one driver of the dom pattern mladenov et al 2008 4 3 implications for remotely monitoring dom for lakes along the mlr yr it is unfeasible to calculate dom from satellite derived cdom first it is difficult to derive cdom from space due to eutrophication sediment resuspension and terrestrial material input cdom absorption often accounts for a small proportion of total light absorption in inland waters for lakes along the mlr yr fig 1 cdom absorption contributed around 20 xue et al 2019 moreover light absorption was dominated by non algal particles which had similar light absorption features as those of cdom xue et al 2019 second there was a strong correlation between cdom and dom at the ultraviolet band fig 6 a but the atmospheric absorption at the ultraviolet band was strong and resulted in a weak signal to the satellite deluisi 1997 moreover because of no available ultraviolet satellite data previous studies on cdom retrieval usually used visible bands chen et al 2017a siegel et al 2002 sun et al 2011 at visible wavelengths with wavelength larger than 400 nm however the dom was weakly related to the cdom in lakes along the mlr yr fig 6a alternatively we could calculate the cdom and dom from the satellite derived tsi human activities dominated dom variations in lakes along the mlr yr section 4 1 and the tsi was significantly linearly related to both cdom and dom fig 2c moreover the tsi was significantly linearly related to the tsi chl a with r 2 0 86 and p 0 01 for chl a in complex inland waters many remote sensing algorithms have been proposed feng et al 2014 shi et al 2015 for the largest freshwater lake poyang in the mlr yr fig 1 feng et al 2014 proposed the normalized green red difference index using 560 nm and 681 nm therefore cdom and dom could be estimated using satellite data by following the flowchart in fig 6b using the in situ chl a the uncertainty analyses of cdom and dom estimation are shown as fig 6c and d respectively with chl a estimation error of 50 50 mean absolute error mae and mean relative error mre of cdom estimation were 21 6 23 2 and 12 8 9 4 respectively fig 6c mae and mre of dom estimation were 17 9 23 1 and 19 1 10 2 respectively fig 6d it is noteworthy that a high spatial resolution of satellite data is needed on the one hand high spatial variability often occurs in lake water environments duan et al 2015 jiang et al 2013 li et al 2017 on the other hand as shown in table 1 many lakes along the mlr yr are small ma et al 2010 we recommend olci sentinel 3 satellite data with a full spatial resolution of 300 m 300 m https earth esa int moreover sentinel 3a and sentinel 3b form a two satellite monitoring network that performs observations of the earth s surface once every 1 5 days therefore the high temporal spatial resolution of the olci sentinel 3 data have unique strengths in monitoring highly temporal spatially varied lakes along the mlr yr or other eutrophic lakes globally using the semi analytical algorithms proposed by xue et al 2019 we estimated chl a from olci sentinel 3a in summer 2018 and further calculated a cdom 280 and dom using the recommended flowchart fig 6b the spatial distributions were consistent with the in situ values in 2012 with high values for lakes in the hubei province figs 3 and s6 in sum we believed that the recommended flowchart was feasible for estimating a cdom 280 and dom in lakes along the mlr yr 5 conclusions lakes along the mlr yr were characterized by seriously eutrophic conditions for all 55 lakes surveyed no lake was characterized as oligotrophic and lake eutrophication was correlated with local economic development under these conditions the optical properties of dom differed by tsi and a significantly linear relationship was found between them human activities such as domestic and industrial sewage discharge land cover change and aquaculture also had significant effects on increasing allochthonous dom allochthonous terrestrial humic like substance c4 contributed almost half with 49 7 of cdom and 49 8 of dom phytoplankton production was also an important dom source overall autochthonous substances produced by phytoplankton contributed to 38 5 of cdom and 35 2 of dom in total human activities explained as much as 81 7 and 87 5 of the variations in a cdom 280 and dom respectively based on the above findings we recommended a flowchart to calculate the dom in lakes along the mlr yr from satellite derived tsi using olci sentinel 3 satellite data declaration of

18384,dissolved organic matter dom plays important roles in the aquatic biogeochemical cycle and the global carbon cycle however it is highly spatially and temporally varied due to complex sources from the catchment allochthonous and from within the system autochthonous satellite remote sensing provides the ability to monitor dom and identify the spatio temporal variations in lakes on a global or regional scale in this study field work was conducted in 55 lakes in august 2012 along the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river mlr yr where most lakes were characterized by eutrophication due to intense human activities the results showed that both colored dom cdom and total dom differed significantly by and were linearly related to the human induced trophic state index tsi with r 2 0 41 and 0 61 respectively autochthonous substances by phytoplankton contributed to 38 5 of cdom and 35 2 of dom and allochthonous terrestrial substance indexed by land cover change and aquaculture contributed to almost half with 49 7 of cdom and 49 8 of dom in total human activities explained as much as 81 7 and 87 5 of the variations in cdom and dom respectively finally a flowchart for estimating dom from satellite derived tsi was proposed this study has great significance for synchronously monitoring and managing aquatic environment quality in regional eutrophic lakes around the world graphical abstract image 1 keywords optical properties dissolved organic matter lake eutrophication yangtze river human activities 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom usually expressed by dissolved organic carbon doc mg c l is a broad classification used to refer to organic molecules of various origin and composition such as sugars fatty acids and alkanes and complex polymeric molecules within aquatic systems hirtle and rencz 2003 manahan and crisp 1982 this material plays important roles in the aquatic biogeochemical cycle and the global carbon cycle with an area that is only 0 7 that of oceans global lakes bury nearly half of organic carbon as that of the world s oceans dean and gorham 1998 in fact there are many published studies about dom in lakes ackefors and enell 1994 mendonca et al 2017 stedmon et al 2006 yao et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 2010 these studies reveal that dom varies greatly in terms of the spatial and temporal scales of lakes and this variation is impacted by human induced eutrophication or external dom from the drainage basin there are two dom sources autochthonous and allochthonous autochthonous dom mainly comes from phytoplankton production aquatic phytoplankton can release extracellular dom baines and pace 1991 and their degradation also produces dom zhang et al 2009 for global open oceans dom is greatly related to phytoplankton density morel and gentili 2009 tiwari and shanmugam 2011 allochthonous dom from the drainage basin is also an important dom source resulting from the decomposition processes of dead organisms such as plants allochthonous dom is greatly impacted by external inputs because a considerable amount of dom is transported into lakes from domestic and industrial sewage liu et al 2015 stedmon et al 2006 in these cases the dom in lakes was often differed with tempo spatially varied human activities jiang et al 2013 kutser 2012 sun et al 2011 satellite remote sensing is an alternative choice for dynamically monitoring dom in lakes generally total dom is divided into two parts optically active and non active components the optically active dom namely the colored dom cdom has been widely studied using satellite data chen et al 2017a fichot and benner 2011 fichot et al 2015 morel and gentili 2009 siegel et al 2002 many empirical and semi analytical remote sensing algorithms have been developed to estimate cdom not only for oceanic waters castillo and miller 2008 morel and gentili 2009 swan et al 2013 tiwari and shanmugam 2011 but also for inland waters chen et al 2017b jiang et al 2013 kutser 2012 in contrast few algorithms have specifically focused on the optically non active or total dom that is usually quantified by doc hirtle and rencz 2003 liu et al 2018 in fact total dom has been generally estimated from cdom based on statistical correlation between both concentrations with average r 2 of 0 84 castillo and miller 2008 fichot and benner 2011 fichot et al 2015 jiang et al 2012 liu et al 2018 but most of these studies have been conducted for oceans with little attention given to inland lakes to remotely monitor cdom and or dom in regional lakes it is important to understand their optical properties moreover knowledge of dom variations with environmental factors is a prerequisite for the refinement of remote sensing algorithms oubelkheir et al 2005 lake eutrophication is a global problem wang et al 2018 reported that 63 1 of lakes with surface area 25 km2 were in eutrophication globally the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river mlr yr is one representative region containing 696 lakes that are larger than 1 km2 ma et al 2010 moreover most lakes along the mlr yr are significantly characterized by human induced eutrophication duan et al 2014 ma et al 2010 zhang et al 2007 to the best of our knowledge no study has systematically analyzed the optical properties of dom in these lakes nor has remote sensing monitoring been used in this study we describe the optical properties of dom trophic state and correlations between different variables in the lakes along the mlr yr the impact factors and composition of dom are then discussed based on our findings the implications for remote sensing monitoring dom are also addressed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area with a length of 6300 km the yangtze river locally called the changjiang river is the longest river in china and the third longest river in the world wang et al 2012 according to the geology climate and geomorphology the yangtze river is divided into the upper middle and lower reaches chen et al 2001 the mlr yr starts from yichang city is 1880 km in length and has a low gradient basin with a coverage area of 785 000 km2 with 696 lakes larger than 1 km2 ma et al 2010 the mlr yr basin is a representative for the region with dense lakes lakes along the mlr yr are shown in fig 1 the mlr yr basin is in the east asian monsoon climate zone with high temperature and heavy precipitation in summer but opposite conditions in winter guo et al 2014 a large amount of terrestrial dom is flushed into lakes in summer with high runoff and lakes receive effluent discharges from agricultural activities as well as from small villages or mega urban areas duan et al 2014 2 2 field data collection in august summer 2012 55 lakes along the mlr yr were investigated fig 1 table 1 shows the name area and water depth of each lake in total there were 161 sampled stations table 1 in each fieldwork episode the secchi disk depth sdd was measured at the ship s shaded side using a 25 cm diameter disk painted in black white quarters surface water within a 0 30 cm water depth was collected using a standard 2 liter polyethylene water sampler all in situ water samples were stored in brown bottles and on ice for approximately 4 h before filtration 2 2 1 constituent concentrations the same in situ raw water was used for the total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and chemical oxygen demand cod samples in situ water samples were also filtered through satorius cellulose acetate filters 0 45 Î¼m pore size Ï47 mm and the filter membrane with particle was used as the chlorophyll a chl a sample the tn and tp concentrations were determined by spectrophotometric analysis after persulfate digestion apha 1995 the cod was determined using the potassium permanganate boiling method apha 1995 the chl a sample was first soaked in 90 ethanol in the dark for 24 h and heated to 80 90 c for 3 5 min the light absorbance of the extracting solution

et al 1996 2 2 2 cdom absorption and fluorescence the dom sample was further filtered through a pre rinsed millipore polycarbonate filter 0 22 Î¼m pore size Ï47 mm to collect the cdom sample in the lab the cdom absorption coefficient spectrum was measured from 250 nm to 800 nm with an interval of 1 nm using a shimadzu uv2600 spectrophotometer mueller et al 2003 the cdom absorption coefficient exponentially decreases with increasing wavelength tiwari and shanmugam 2011 zhang et al 2010 with a known cdom absorption coefficient at wavelength Î»0 a cdom Î»0 and its spectral slope s cdom nm 1 the absorption coefficient at any wavelength Î» a cdom Î» can be calculated using eq 2 2 a cdom Î» a cdom Î» 0 exp s cdom Î» Î» 0 for the cdom samples from stations located at the lake centers three dimensional excitation emission spectra eems were also measured by a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer with a 700 voltage xenon lamp hitachi high technologies japan ranges of 200 450 nm for excitation 5 nm intervals and 250 600 nm for emission 1 nm intervals were scanned after raman scattering elimination excitation and emission calibration inner filter effect elimination and fluorescence intensity normalization to quinine sulfate units qsu the eems were decomposed into individual fluorescent components by parallel factor analysis parafac and the split half validation procedure in matlab r2008a with domfluor toolbox zhang et al 2010 2 3 lake watershed datasets similar to mendonca et al 2017 the watershed extent of each lake was identified through the wwf hydrobasins tool provided by the usgs www hydrosheds org in the lake watershed extent definition the hydrosheds dataset was processed with a user friendly graphical interface the lake watershed extent was used to extract the land cover in 2010 table s1 the land cover data were derived from the land cover atlas of the people s republic of china with 30 m resolution which contained six land cover types forest grassland wetland cropland artificial surface and others and were made available by the institute of remote sensing application chinese academy of sciences cas www chinageoss org the mean gross domestic product gdp 104rmb km2 population density pop person km2 and topsoil organic content soil toc weight in each lake watershed were also calculated both the gdp and the population in 2010 were gridded reanalysis data and downloaded from the global change research data publishing repository website www geodoi ac cn the soil toc data were extracted from the harmonized world soil database based on the national soil survey of china in 1995 shangguan et al 2012 2 4 trophic state index there are many mathematical methods for assessing lake eutrophication among them the simple and feasible trophic state index tsi is commonly used aizaki et al 1981 carlson 1977 zhang et al 2010 the original tsi tsio was developed upon sdd as relative indicator of algal biomass carlson 1977 however sdd is partially influenced by other factors like sediment resuspension which is independent of algal biomass aizaki et al 1981 wang et al 2002 to make up for this deficiency a modified tsi tsim was developed using chl a concentration as the indicator of algal biomass aizaki et al 1981 along the mlr yr most lakes are characterized by shallow waters and sdd is greatly impacted by sediment resuspension duan et al 2014 shi et al 2015 xue et al 2019 therefore tsim was chosen in this study note that tsim may get different results with different inputs in this case the weighted arithmetic mean of tsim calculated from tn tp chl a cod and sdd was usually used to evaluate eutrophication of chinese lakes wang et al 2002 zhang et al 2006 2010 in this study we also used the weighted arithmetic tsim tsi for convenience defined as eq 3 zhang et al 2006 3 tsi j 1 m w j tsi j w j r j 2 j 1 m r j 2 tsi tn 10 5 453 1 694 ln tn tsi tp 10 9 436 1 624 ln tp tsi chl a 10 2 5 1 086 ln chl a tsi cod 10 0 109 2 66 ln cod tsi sdd 10 5 118 1 94 ln sd where tn tp chl a cod and sdd are used m 5 the weighted tsi also uses chl a as the basis the pearson s r j of tn tp chl a cod and sdd to chl a are used to calculate the weight w j respectively the trophic levels are defined using tsi with tsi 30 being oligotrophic 30 tsi 50 being mesotrophic 50 tsi 60 being lightly eutrophic 60 tsi 70 being moderately eutrophic and 70 tsi being highly eutrophic wang et al 2002 zhang et al 2006 2 5 multiple general linear model to quantify the relative contribution of each explanatory variable to the spatial variations of the cdom and dom concentrations correlation analyses and multiple general linear model glm were used tong et al 2017 dom is affected not only by natural lake attributes but also by human activities in a lake s watershed zhang et al 2010 therefore the explanatory variables included not only the area water depth and tsi in a lake but also the mean soil toc gdp pop and percent area of artificial surface and cropland in the lake watershed acinlw the lake area water depth and soil toc represented natural variability and the other variables represented human induced disturbance intensity notably p value for each variable was also output and p 0 05 indicated a statistically significant contribution 3 results 3 1 general characteristics all tn tp chl a cod and sdd spanned wide ranges in lakes along the mlr yr table 2 the maximum values of these variables were 7 13 37 5 36 64 4 57 and 15 4 times those of the minimum values respectively table 2 both tn and tp accelerated phytoplankton production and were significantly positively correlated with chl a with pearson s r 0 61 and 0 6 respectively fig 2 a the cod was also significantly positively related to chl a with r 0 76 and p 0 01 fig 2b note that the increased phytoplankton significantly decreased the sdd with r 0 36 and p 0 01 fig 2b with significant relations to chl a the tsi values at all stations were calculated by eq 3 and the arithmetic mean was further calculated for each lake table 1 lakes along the mlr yr were characterized by serious eutrophication for the 55 lakes investigated none were oligotrophic 4 were mesotrophic 18 were lightly eutrophic 20 were moderately eutrophic and as many as 13 were highly eutrophic table 1 lake eutrophication was spatially varied and eutrophication in hubei province was generally more serious than that in the other provinces figs 1 and s1a the mean tsi values were 64 4 9 14 52 23 7 25 57 73 6 01 and 59 13 5 98 in the hubei jiangxi anhui and jiangsu provinces respectively fig s2 in the supplementary material file it is also worth noting that 12 of the 13 highly eutrophic lakes were located in hubei province fig 1 3 2 optical properties of dom the dom concentrations in lakes along the mlr yr were largely spatially varied for different lakes the dom ranged from 1 91 to 8 42 mg c l with a mean std of 4 58 1 38 mg c l table 2 the dom was generally high in hubei province and decreased from upstream to downstream with increasing longitude figs 3a and s1b similar to zhang et al 2010 we used the cdom absorption coefficient at 280 nm a cdom 280 to denote the cdom concentration the maximum a cdom 280 was 4 64 times the minimum value with a mean std of 15 37 4 77 m 1 table 2 however the a cdom 280 did not show significantly high values in lakes in hubei province like those found for the dom figs 3 and s1c with r 2 0 46 for the linear relationship between a cdom 280 and dom the a cdom 280 only explained 46 of the variation in the dom fig 2d four fluorescent components were identified by eems parafac analyses fig 4 component 1 c1 had excitation 275 nm and emission 308 nm characteristics which were similar to those of autochthonous tyrosine like dom coble 1996 component 2 c2 displayed two excitation maxima 250 and 310 nm and a single emission maximum 392 nm similar to autochthonous marine humic like dom caused by phytoplankton degradation coble 1996 component 3 c3 had excitation 250 nm and 285 nm and emission 340 nm features similar to autochthonous tryptophan like dom coble 1996 component 4 c4 displayed excitation 245 and 355 nm and emission 468 nm characteristics similar to those of allochthonous terrestrial humic like dom coble 1996 all optical properties of dom differed with tsi both a cdom 280 and dom were significantly linearly positively related to tsi with r 2 0 41 and 0 61 respectively fig 2c for dom the mean std was 2 59 0 53 mg c l 3 8 0 78 mg c l 4 42 0 78 mg c l and 6 28 0 99 mg c l for the mesotrophic lightly eutrophic moderately eutrophic and highly eutrophic lakes respectively fig 3 c for a cdom 280 the mean std was 8 18 0 91 m 1 13 77 3 3 m 1 15 32 3 17 m 1 and 18 59 3 83 m 1 respectively fig 3c all cdom fluorescent components also increased with increasing trophic levels especially for c2 c3 and c4 fig 3d 3 3 impact factors for dom variations the lake environment variables were greatly varied along the mlr yr for different lakes mean std of water depth area and tsi were 3 29 1 56 m 3 36 1 58 km2 and 62 16 8 77 respectively tables 1 and 2 for different lake watersheds mean std of gdp population density soil toc and acinlw were 1149 58 1541 52 104 rmb km2 523 28 267 56 person km2 1 05 0 26 and 66 67 17 72 respectively table 2 from upstream to downstream with increasing longitude the mean gdp and soil toc significantly increased p 0 05 however the acinlw in the lake watershed significantly decreased fig s3 in the supplementary material file there were significant linear relationships between the lake environment variables and the optical properties of dom the lake area water depth and soil toc were significantly negatively related to a cdom 280 dom c2 c3 and c4 table 3 the acinlw and tsi showed significant positive relationships with the a cdom 280 dom c2 c3 and c4 table 3 however the population density was only significantly positively correlated with c3 and gdp did not show a significant relation to any optical properties of dom table 3 these relationships denoted the impacts of environmental variables on dom composition 4 discussion 4 1 human induced dom variations for lakes distributed worldwide sobek et al 2007 reported that the possible dom range for a specific region was set by climatic and topographic features for a specific lake however the lake watershed properties could also regulate the dom sobek et al 2007 all lakes along the mlr yr were affected by the east asian monsoon climate with high precipitation in summer guo et al 2014 however the mlr yr region is one of the most developed regions in china with a high population density yue et al 2005 being influenced by intense human activities bennett et al 2001 qin 2002 the dom in lakes along the mlr yr was spatially varied with human induced eutrophication fig 3 the lake area water depth and soil toc in a lake watershed were used to describe the natural impacts on the spatial variations in dom the mean dom in different lakes along the mlr yr was 4 58 1 38 mg c l table 2 but the mean dom in precipitation was only 1 5 mg c l in the mlr yr region safieddine and heald 2017 therefore precipitation would dilute the dom in lakes for the yangtze river the dom decreased with increasing water discharge namely precipitation liu et al 2015 negative relations between lake area water depth and dom composition also denoted the dilution impacts by precipitation table 3 for lake watersheds with high soil toc much of the terrestrial dom could be flushed into rivers or lakes ludwig and probst 1996 if so we supposed a positive relation between soil toc and dom composition but the opposite occurred table 3 it might due to the negative relationship between soil toc and acinlw r 0 48 p 0 05 and the positive relationship between acinlw and dom composition table 3 these indicated the insignificant impact of soil toc on dom the acinlw gdp pop and tsi were used to describe the human impacts on spatial variations in dom land cover had impacts on watershed dom output with a high value for cropland correll et al 2001 for lakes along the mlr yr the cropland area percent in watershed also showed positive relations to dom composition with r 0 fig 5 a in addition industrial and domestic sewage from human activities in a lake catchment would increase the riverine input of dom stedmon et al 2006 xia and zhang 2011 all the artificial surface area percent gdp and pop could indicate human activity intensity in lake watershed and showed increase effects on dom composition fig 5b table 3 for a specific lake watershed because cropland area percent and artificial surface area percent were like a seesaw r 0 5 p 0 01 so we combined them into acinlw the results showed that acinlw was significantly positively related to dom composition section 3 3 with increasing tsi increased nitrogen and phosphorus from the basin elevated the nutrition available for potential phytoplankton growth bennett et al 2001 seitzinger et al 2005 xia and zhang 2011 and much dom would be produced during phytoplankton degradation zhang et al 2009 2010 the cdom in lakes of the yungui plateau china also differed with tsi zhang et al 2010 contributions of different impact factors on dom variations were quantitatively estimated by multiple glm due to the unexpected relationship between soil toc and dom composition table 3 soil toc was excluded in the multiple glm analysis the tsi significantly explained 65 7 74 3 33 3 51 4 26 2 and 61 9 of the variations in the a cdom 280 dom c1 c2 c3 and c4 respectively fig 5c in total human activities explained as much as 81 7 87 5 64 4 70 5 71 2 and 78 7 of variations in the a cdom 280 dom c1 c2 c3 and c4 respectively fig 5c overall human activities dominated the spatial variations of dom components in lakes along the mlr yr 4 2 dom composition multiple glm was also used to quantify the relative contributions of different components on dom composition variations allochthonous terrestrial humic like substance c4 contributed almost half with 49 7 of cdom and 49 8 of dom fig 5d autochthonous marine humic like substance c2 contributed 20 of cdom and 15 7 of dom autochthonous tyrosine like c1 and tryptophan like c3 substances contributed 18 5 of cdom and 19 5 of dom respectively fig 5d overall autochthonous substances contributed to 38 5 of cdom and 35 2 of dom in lakes along the mlr yr intense human activities increased the allochthonous terrestrial dom input on the one hand human activities increased terrigenous dom inputs to lakes by rivers with a dom stock of only 0 13 tg c lake taihu received as much as 0 24 tg c yr of terrestrial dom from the input rivers hu et al 2015 compared with humic like dom protein like dom from human activities was characterized by lower percent aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 zhang et al 2010 suva254 defined as the ratio of the cdom absorption coefficient at 254 nm a cdom 254 to the dom denotes the dom percent aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 the increased suva254 and percent aromaticity with increasing tsi indicated dom contributions from human activities fig s4 on the other hand lake aquaculture also increased allochthonous dom for nordic countries ackefors and enell 1994 reported that approximately 80 of the organic matter in fish feed accumulated in waters along the mlr yr human activity intensity denoted by acinlw was most strong in the hubei province and decreased from upstream to downstream fig s3c moreover aquaculture yield was equivalent to 5 41 4 87 3 15 and 5 45 tons per hectare in the hubei jiangxi anhui and jiangsu provinces in 2012 respectively www stats gov cn these together resulted in the high values of eutrophication levels and dom composition in the hubei province figs 3 and s1 phytoplankton production was an important autochthonous source of dom phytoplankton can release extracellular dom baines and pace 1991 and their degradation can also produce dom zhang et al 2009 for eutrophic lake taihu fig 1 phytoplankton production and decomposition are important contributors to cdom yao et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 the ratio of the cdom absorption coefficient at 254 nm to that at 436 nm a cdom 254 a cdom 436 indicates the cdom source with low values of 4 37 11 34 for allochthonous cdom and higher values for autochthonous cdom battin 1998 a mean a cdom 254 a cdom 436 of 25 94 7 58 indicated phytoplankton s important contribution to cdom with r 2 0 31 and p 0 01 the significant positive relationship between a cdom 280 and chl a also verified phytoplankton s contribution to cdom fig s5 not only for cdom was phytoplankton production also an important source of total dom with r 2 0 42 and p 0 01 the significant positive relationship between dom and chl a verified phytoplankton s contribution to dom fig s5 for lakes located in the sierra nevada mountains spain phytoplankton intensity was also reported as one driver of the dom pattern mladenov et al 2008 4 3 implications for remotely monitoring dom for lakes along the mlr yr it is unfeasible to calculate dom from satellite derived cdom first it is difficult to derive cdom from space due to eutrophication sediment resuspension and terrestrial material input cdom absorption often accounts for a small proportion of total light absorption in inland waters for lakes along the mlr yr fig 1 cdom absorption contributed around 20 xue et al 2019 moreover light absorption was dominated by non algal particles which had similar light absorption features as those of cdom xue et al 2019 second there was a strong correlation between cdom and dom at the ultraviolet band fig 6 a but the atmospheric absorption at the ultraviolet band was strong and resulted in a weak signal to the satellite deluisi 1997 moreover because of no available ultraviolet satellite data previous studies on cdom retrieval usually used visible bands chen et al 2017a siegel et al 2002 sun et al 2011 at visible wavelengths with wavelength larger than 400 nm however the dom was weakly related to the cdom in lakes along the mlr yr fig 6a alternatively we could calculate the cdom and dom from the satellite derived tsi human activities dominated dom variations in lakes along the mlr yr section 4 1 and the tsi was significantly linearly related to both cdom and dom fig 2c moreover the tsi was significantly linearly related to the tsi chl a with r 2 0 86 and p 0 01 for chl a in complex inland waters many remote sensing algorithms have been proposed feng et al 2014 shi et al 2015 for the largest freshwater lake poyang in the mlr yr fig 1 feng et al 2014 proposed the normalized green red difference index using 560 nm and 681 nm therefore cdom and dom could be estimated using satellite data by following the flowchart in fig 6b using the in situ chl a the uncertainty analyses of cdom and dom estimation are shown as fig 6c and d respectively with chl a estimation error of 50 50 mean absolute error mae and mean relative error mre of cdom estimation were 21 6 23 2 and 12 8 9 4 respectively fig 6c mae and mre of dom estimation were 17 9 23 1 and 19 1 10 2 respectively fig 6d it is noteworthy that a high spatial resolution of satellite data is needed on the one hand high spatial variability often occurs in lake water environments duan et al 2015 jiang et al 2013 li et al 2017 on the other hand as shown in table 1 many lakes along the mlr yr are small ma et al 2010 we recommend olci sentinel 3 satellite data with a full spatial resolution of 300 m 300 m https earth esa int moreover sentinel 3a and sentinel 3b form a two satellite monitoring network that performs observations of the earth s surface once every 1 5 days therefore the high temporal spatial resolution of the olci sentinel 3 data have unique strengths in monitoring highly temporal spatially varied lakes along the mlr yr or other eutrophic lakes globally using the semi analytical algorithms proposed by xue et al 2019 we estimated chl a from olci sentinel 3a in summer 2018 and further calculated a cdom 280 and dom using the recommended flowchart fig 6b the spatial distributions were consistent with the in situ values in 2012 with high values for lakes in the hubei province figs 3 and s6 in sum we believed that the recommended flowchart was feasible for estimating a cdom 280 and dom in lakes along the mlr yr 5 conclusions lakes along the mlr yr were characterized by seriously eutrophic conditions for all 55 lakes surveyed no lake was characterized as oligotrophic and lake eutrophication was correlated with local economic development under these conditions the optical properties of dom differed by tsi and a significantly linear relationship was found between them human activities such as domestic and industrial sewage discharge land cover change and aquaculture also had significant effects on increasing allochthonous dom allochthonous terrestrial humic like substance c4 contributed almost half with 49 7 of cdom and 49 8 of dom phytoplankton production was also an important dom source overall autochthonous substances produced by phytoplankton contributed to 38 5 of cdom and 35 2 of dom in total human activities explained as much as 81 7 and 87 5 of the variations in a cdom 280 and dom respectively based on the above findings we recommended a flowchart to calculate the dom in lakes along the mlr yr from satellite derived tsi using olci sentinel 3 satellite data declaration of
