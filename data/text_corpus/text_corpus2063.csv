10315,as a fiber crop and oil crop cotton plays an important role in the economic development of northwest china but the lack of appropriate field water and fertilizer management strategies has restricted the harmonious development of cotton industry and environment field experiments were implemented to explore the coupling effects of various drip irrigation and fertilizer levels on the dry matter yield water and fertilizer use efficiency of cotton the three drip irrigation levels included 1 0 etc full irrigation 0 8 etc 20 deficit and 0 6 etc 40 deficit where etc is the crop evapotranspiration the five fertilizer n p k levels were f1 150 26 2 24 9 kg ha 1 f2 200 34 9 33 2 kg ha 1 f3 250 43 7 41 5 kg ha 1 f4 300 52 4 49 8 kg ha 1 and f5 350 61 1 58 1 kg ha 1 the results revealed that the seed cotton yield and lint yield showed increasing trends as the irrigation water amount increased at the same fertilizer level during 2012 2014 when full irrigation 1 0 etc was applied the dry matter accumulation seed cotton yield n p and k accumulation in plants and water productivity were the highest under f4 300 52 4 49 8 kg ha 1 in 2012 and 2014 however the lint yield was highest in 2012 and 2013 under f3 250 43 7 41 5 kg ha 1 at the same irrigation level n p and k use efficiencies were higher at low fertilization rates than those at high fertilization rates in 2012 and 2013 deficit irrigation and fertilization levels led to a severe decrease in cotton yield n p and k use efficiencies were low under f4 comprehensively considering cotton yield n p and k uptake and use efficiency the application of irrigation amount of 1 0 etc and n p k rate of 250 43 7 41 5 kg ha 1 was the best drip fertigation strategy for cotton production in arid regions of northwest china keywords drip fertigation cotton yield root to shoot ratio fertilizer absorption and use efficiency 1 introduction cotton is an important economic crop which plays an important part in the agricultural and industrial economic structure of china qian et al 2014 li et al 2019 china s cotton production ranks first around the world and the annual production of cotton lint has increased from 4 34 to 6 18 million tons between 1994 and 2014 fao 2018 the xinjiang autonomous region located in northwest china is the main producing area of cotton in china as a result of abundant light and heat resources zhang et al 2016a however the limited water resources in this region largely restrict the local agricultural development although drip irrigation under plastic mulching has been widely used in arid regions of china li et al 2015b yan et al 2019 qi et al 2020 shi et al 2020 local farmers still lack proper field water and fertilizer management strategies the conventional excessive irrigation and fertilization can lead to low water and fertilizer use efficiency waste of water and contamination of water resources wang et al 2018 wang et al 2019 water is one of the important factors limiting cotton growth drought stress can thus significantly reduce the biological yield of cotton and hinder the absorption and accumulation of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium hu et al 2002 many researchers have revealed that both deficit and excessive irrigation reduced seed cotton yields detar 2008 ünlü et al 2011 papastylianou and argyrokastritis 2014 in addition zhang et al 2016b found that irrigation can significantly increase the nitrogen accumulation and nitrogen use efficiency and the deficit irrigation 60 etc where etc is the crop evapotranspiration inhibited the absorption of nitrogen n however some researchers believe that reasonable deficit irrigation can not only save water and keep reasonable proportions of crop vegetative and reproductive growth but also promote root growth and improve root absorption in cotton du et al 2007 hassanli et al 2009 in addition irrigation method also has a great impact on the growth and development of cotton tang et al 2005 suggested that the alternate drip irrigation could be applied in arid areas to save irrigation water rajak et al 2006 found that drip irrigation lead to a higher cotton yield and water use efficiency compared with furrow irrigation wang et al 2012a also showed that drip irrigation significantly increased seed cotton yield plant n uptake and n use efficiency and decreased no3 n in the leakage water overall cotton yield and fertilizer use efficiency can be enhanced by appropriate irrigation amounts and methods reasonable fertilization can also increase cotton growth yield and fiber quality wu et al 2014 geng et al 2016 high yield of cotton is directly affected by the amount of nitrogen absorbed and the duration of absorption gong et al 2015 when the application amount of nitrogen was 375 kg ha 1 the highest fiber yield and agronomic n use efficiency were obtained by chen et al 2016 applying n at the beginning of an irrigation cycle was useful for enhancing cotton yield and fertilizer use efficiency hou et al 2009 the lack of n p and k can significantly affect cotton growth the fiber length and strength of cotton will be reduced when lack of n k deficiency had adverse effects on reproductive growth and increased the soluble sugar to free amino acid ratio and c n ratio read et al 2006 hu et al 2017 higher biomass yield nitrogen phosphorus and potassium nutrient use efficiency can be obtained when using combined n p and k fertilizer xin et al 2010 in addition other researchers have studied the effects of fertilizer ratio or added regulators on enhancing the fertilizer use efficiency of cotton yang et al 2014 observed that applying plant growth regulators could improve the partial factor productivity and agronomic k use efficiency in short the reasonable application of n p and k is beneficial to the growth of cotton and improves the fertilizer use efficiency in recent years many researchers have investigated the influences of various irrigation and n application rates on cotton growth yield water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency nue under drip fertigation conditions it was found that cotton yield increased with the increasing nitrogen and irrigation amounts but the wue and nue decreased significantly in high water and high n treatments aujla et al 2005 thind et al 2008 jayakumar et al 2015 janat 2008 reported that relative to the maximum n rates applied in furrow irrigation 100 150 kg ha 1 n was sufficient for lint yield nitrogen uptake and recovery of cotton under drip irrigation in addition wang et al 2010 found that seed cotton yield first increased and then declined as the water and phosphorus p amount increased reasonable irrigation and n p and k ratios can ensure crop yield avoid both water and fertilizer waste and reduce the environmental impact of excessive fertilizer application li et al 2009 improper drip fertigation was more likely to exacerbate salt loss or accumulation in the root zone compared with the conventional fertilization methods wu et al 2014 appropriate irrigation and fertilization can promote the coordinated growth of cotton root crowns and shape a reasonable canopy structure which is conducive to the accumulation of above ground biomass and lays a foundation for high yields deng et al 2015 it is clear from the above review that previous studies have focused largely on the effects of single irrigation and fertilization or the interacting effects of water and n on cotton growth and lint yield studies on the influences of various irrigation amounts as along with n p and k rates and ratios on the dry matter accumulation yield nutrient absorption and fertilizer use efficiency of drip fertigated cotton are still lacking therefore the objectives of the present study were to 1 explore the coupling influences of various irrigation and fertilization levels on the dry matter accumulation and nutrient uptake of cotton and 2 determine an appropriate irrigation and fertilization regime to maximize cotton yield and fertilizer use efficiency this study is expected to provide scientific basis for optimal water and fertilization management of drip fertigated cotton in arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description field experiments were carried out from 2012 to 2014 at the irrigation station of xinjiang academy of land

lowest proportion of total dry matter under the same fertilizer level the cumulative amount of dry matter in bolls increased as the irrigation amount increased during the three years when the same water amount was applied the dry matter in bolls increased first and then decreased as the fertilizer amount increased the drought resistance of cotton can be improved by properly increasing the amount of fertilizer under water deficit when the irrigation level 1 0 etc and fertilizer level f4 were applied the total dry matter accumulation achieved the highest value in 2012 and 2014 table 3 the root to shoot ratio is mainly used to characterize the distribution characteristics of photosynthetic products in plants and is also a key parameter for measuring the plant nutrition index the

the fertilizer level f1 was higher than that in the other four fertilizer levels a low fertilizer amount can t improve the accumulation of dry matter in the shoots under the irrigation level 0 6 etc f4 decreased dry matter of root and increased dry matter accumulation in shoot thus when the irrigation level 0 6 etc was applied the root to shoot ratio in the fertilizer level f4 was the lowest water and year water fertilization also had significant effect on the root to shoot ratio p 0 05 under the fertilizer levels f1 and f2 the root to shoot ratio of the irrigation level 1 0 etc was lower

there was no significant difference in the root to shoot ratio between the irrigation levels 1 0 etc and 0 6 etc in 2012 and 2013 low irrigation level 0 6 etc caused a similar degree of reduction in

water fertilization had significant effects on seed cotton yield p 0 05 table 5 under a given designed irrigation level seed cotton yield first increased with the increasing fertilization rate but it then decreased when the fertilizer application rate was beyond a certain range a quadratic negative correlation existed between fertilizer application and seed cotton yield fig 2a c the effects of fertilization water and year water were significant p 0 05 the seed cotton yield was enhanced by the increase of water amount during 2012 2014 the seed cotton yield in the irrigation level 1 0 etc was significantly greater than that of the two deficit irrigation levels 0 8 etc and 0 6 etc compared to 1 0 etc the average seed cotton yield of 0 8 etc and 0 6 etc was decreased by 4 1 and 25 1 in 2012 6 9 and 22 2 in 2013 and 6 9 and 19 5 in 2014 fig 2a c respectively the effects of year water fertilization year water year fertilization water fertilization and year water fertilization on lint yield were significant during 2012 2014 p 0 05 table 5 the lint yield and wp first increased and then reduced with the increase of fertilization rate fig 2d i when the fertilizer rate was f3 250 43 7 41 5 kg ha 1 the lint yield and wp achieved the highest value in 2013 however when the amount of fertilizer applied was f4 300 52 4 49 8 kg ha 1 the greatest lint yield and wp were achieved in 2012 and 2014 the greater lint yield was found in treatments under full irrigation 1 0 etc however the wp of irrigation level 0 8 etc was higher than that of the other two irrigation levels 1 0 etc and 0 6 etc

irrigation levels 1 0 etc and 0 8 etc were applied the n use efficiency of fertilizer level f1 was significantly greater than those of f2 f3 f4 and f5 in 2012 when the irrigation level 0 6 etc was applied there was no difference in n use efficiency between the fertilizer levels f1 and f2 but the n use efficiency was greater than that of the other three fertilizer levels in 2012 table 6 the n use efficiency of fertilizer level f1 was also significantly higher than that of f3 f4 and f5 when the same irrigation amounts were applied in 2013 however there was no difference in n use efficiency between the fertilizer levels f1 and f2 when the irrigation levels were 1 0 etc and 0 8 etc table 6 in 2014 the n use efficiency of treatment f1 was greater than that of f2 f3 f4 and f5 under 1 0 etc but the n use efficiency of f5 was largest when the irrigation level 0 8 etc was used table 6 the maximum n use efficiency occurred when the irrigation level was 0 6 etc during 2012 2014 although high irrigation amounts could obtain high seed cotton yield and total n accumulation the n use efficiency was not high which may be due to the accumulation of nitrogen mainly in the vegetative organs of cotton under high water conditions water and year water also had significant p 0 05 effects on n use efficiency compared to 1 0 etc the average n use efficiency of 0 8 etc and 0 6 etc was improved by 2 and 7 2 in 2012 10 7 and 8 1 in 2013 and 1 8 and 7 1 in 2014 respectively the effects of fertilization year fertilization water fertilization and the three way interaction on p use efficiency were significant p 0 05 table 6 when the irrigation level 1 0 etc was applied the p use efficiency of fertilizer level f2 was significantly greater than those of f1 f3 f4 and f5 in 2012 however the p use efficiency of fertilizer level f3 was greatest at the deficit irrigation levels table 6 in 2013 when the irrigation amount was 1 0 etc the p use efficiency showed a decreasing trend as the fertilizer application rate increased there was no difference in p use efficiency between the fertilizer levels f1 and f2 when the deficit irrigation levels were applied but the p use efficiency of these two fertilization levels was significantly greater than that of the other three fertilizer levels table 6 however the p use efficiency of fertilizer level f2 was lowest under irrigation levels 1 0 etc and 0 8 etc in 2014 table 6 the effects of water and year water on p use efficiency were significant p 0 05 compared to 1 0 etc the average p use efficiency of 0 8 etc and 0 6 etc was improved by 0 8 and 1 1 in 2012 15 7 and 8 9 in 2013 and 3 1 and 8 5 in 2014 respectively effects of fertilization and the interaction of year water with fertilization on k use efficiency were significant p 0 05 table 6 when full irrigation 1 0 etc and medium irrigation 0 8 etc levels were applied the k use efficiency of fertilizer level f1 was significantly greater than those of f2 f3 f4 and f5 in 2012 table 6 in 2013 the k use efficiency of fertilizer level f1 was also significantly higher than that of f3 f4 and f5 under the same irrigation amounts and the k use efficiency of fertilizer level f4 was lowest table 6 in 2014 the trend of k use efficiency was the same as that of p use efficiency under the irrigation levels 1 0 etc and 0 8 etc the k use efficiency of fertilizer level f2 was significantly lower than those of f1 f3 f4 and f5 table 6 the maximum k use efficiency occurred at deficit irrigation levels during 2012 2014 the effects of water and year water on k use efficiency were also significant p 0 05 compared to 1 0 etc the average k use efficiency of 0 8 etc and 0 6 etc was improved by 2 5 and 6 6 in 2012 7 2 and 4 9 in 2013 and 2 5 and 4 5 in 2014 respectively 3 5 correlation analysis of seed cotton yield root to shoot ratio and n p and k accumulation correlation analysis showed that highly positive correlation of total n p and k accumulation nutrient uptake in different organs with seed cotton yield p 0 01 compared to the nutrient uptake in roots leaves and stems the nutrient uptake in bolls had the highest positive correlation coefficient with yield however the correlation between root to shoot ratio and seed cotton yield was significantly negative p 0 01 table 7 higher n p and k absorption and nutrient uptake in reproductive organ can significantly increase cotton yield 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation and fertilizer management on dry matter accumulation dry matter was the basis of cotton yield and a higher reproductive organ biomass could obtain a higher yield fang et al 2009 yang et al 2011 2013 results showed that the dry matter of vegetative organs accounted for the smallest proportion in the total dry matter and the proportion of reproductive organs was largest yan et al 2009 but the dry matter of cotton is restricted by many factors including the application of irrigation and fertilization yazar et al 2002 reported that the largest cotton dry matter was gotten by the well irrigated treatment yan et al 2009 found both the water deficit and excess affected the accumulation and distribution of dry matter in different organs and different growth stages the most appropriate irrigation amount was 360 mm shi et al 2018 reported that under the same fertilization level the dry matter of insufficient irrigation 280 mm was less than conventional irrigation 380 mm and the dry matter of medium to upper fertilization level n 300 kg ha 1 was higher when the same irrigation levels were applied our findings were consistent with previous studies and we found the effect of fertilization and water fertilization on dry matter of stems and leaves wasn t significant p 0 05 however the water fertilization and the interaction of water with fertilization showed significant p 0 05 effects on dry matter of roots and bolls the dry matter accumulation reduced with the decrease of irrigation amount but it first increased and then decreased with increasing fertilization rates results showed that when water was sufficient high fertilizer made the nutrient concentration of soil solution too high which caused the senescence of root system and the decreased of nutrient absorption efficiency finally led to the decline in biomass xie and tian 2011 yan et al 2009 and li and zhang 2011 found the root to shoot ratio decreased with increasing irrigation amount we found that no significant effect of water on the root to shoot ratio existed in 2012 while a significant effect existed in 2013 and 2014 the reason for this difference may be due to less rainfall in 2012 than in 2013 and 2014 and more evaporation in 2012 than in 2013 and 2014 the irrigation in 2012 was larger than in 2013 and 2014 the root to shoot ratio reflects the distribution and coordination of dry biomass in above ground and underground as the amount of irrigation increased the distribution of increased photosynthates to the aboveground and underground parts was more uniform in 2012 however as the amount of irrigation increased more photosynthates were transported to the aboveground part in 2013 and 2014 min et al 2014 found that the application of nitrogen reduced the cotton root to shoot ratio compared to treatments without nitrogen fertilizer we also found when the irrigation was applied at 1 0 etc and 0 8 etc root to shoot ratio of fertilizer level f1 was higher than that of the other four fertilizer levels as the amount of fertilization increased more photosynthesis products were transported to the reproductive organs 4 2 effects of irrigation and fertilizer management on n p and k uptake nutrient absorption is the basis for the formation and accumulation of dry matter and the accumulation of dry matter and nutrients is the prerequisite for the formation of yield studies have shown that a higher yield could be obtained by an adequate n p and k acquisition xin et al 2010 khan et al 2017 this study also found that the total n p and k accumulation had a highly positive correlation with seed cotton yield at maturity with the senescence and shedding of leaves n p and k were transported to cotton bolls fang et al 2009 hu et al 2010 jiang et al 2011 yang et al 2013 indicated that fertilizer 15n was found in the greatest amounts in the reproductive part of all organs and the proportion of total n accumulated in plants enhanced with n application rates our findings were consistent with previous studies compared to the nutrient uptake in roots leaves and stems the nutrient uptake in bolls had a higher positive correlation with yield increasing the absorption of n p and k especially the nutrient uptake of reproductive organs is conducive to the increase of yield tariq et al 2018 revealed that the k concentration in vegetative and boll components was enhanced as the k application rate increased li et al 2018 found that the accumulation of n p and k nutrients in cotton plants was increased gradually when more n was applied we found the water fertilization and the interaction of year water with fertilization had significant p 0 05 effects on total n total p and total k accumulation in plants when full irrigation level 1 0 etc was applied in 2012 2013 and 2014 the value of total n total p and total k accumulation in plants increased with the increase of fertilization rate within a certain fertilization threshold f1 f4 but beyond this threshold the total n total p and total k accumulation decreased the fertilizer accumulation in plants of fertilizer level f4 was significantly greater than those in f1 f2 f3 and f5 the reason for this difference may be that when the amount of fertilizer was too high the cotton field was too gloomy and the transmittance was poor which affected the accumulation of nutrients in reproductive organs and led to yield reduction in agricultural production the application of n p and k in a certain proportion can not only balance the supply of nutrients but also give full play to the role of various nutrient elements to increase yield and improve the fertilizer use efficiency finding out the proportion of nutrients absorbed by crops is of great significance for guiding rational fertilization mullins and burmester 1990 pointed out that the n p and k required was 19 9 2 5 and 15 3 kg to produce 100 kg lint respectively however unruh and silvertooth 1996 found that the requirements of n p k were 15 2 3 19 kg and 21 3 3 23 kg to produce 100 kg lint upland cotton and pima cotton respectively fang et al 2009 revealed that when the lint yield of hybrid cotton was 1778 23 kg ha 1 the uptake amounts of n p2o5 and k2o were 242 92 82 12 and 247 76 kg ha 1 respectively and the absorption ratios of n p2o5 and k2o were 1 0 34 1 02 dong et al 2010 determined that the values of n p k for producing 100 kg lint in low and high fertility fields were 1 0 365 0 728 and 1 0 364 0 884 respectively we found that effects of water fertilization and two way interaction on the uptake of n p and k in 100 kg lint were remarkably significant in 2012 2014 for producing 100 kg lint cotton the required amounts of n p and k were 8 77 14 98 kg 2 29 3 45 kg and 11 33 17 19 kg respectively in 2012 2014 the uptake ratio of n p and k in 100 kg lint ranged from 1 0 22 0 28 1 11 1 33 across all treatments during the three years with the average n p k ratio of 1 0 25 1 22 this difference can be largely attributed to the difference in variety of cotton soil texture fertilization rates or irrigation amounts the proportion of n p and k uptake in 100 kg lint was highest when the irrigation level 0 6 etc and fertilizer rate f1 were applied the reasons for this result may be due to the fact that the ratio of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium in this experiment was 1 0 175 0 166 where the amount of phosphorus applied was sufficient and the potassium content in the soil was very high 150 mg kg 1 although the nitrogen application rate of fertilizer level f1 was only 150 kg ha 1 the crop may have ingested a large proportion of nitrogen from the soil 4 3 effects of irrigation and fertilizer levels on cotton yield and wp proper water and fertilizer inputs could result in a higher yield zheng et al 2001 wu et al 2014 the effect of water was significant p 0 05 increasing irrigation amount could enhance the seed cotton yield and lint yield in three years the findings agree with previous studies which reported that yields were enhanced with increasing irrigation amount yang et al 2015 shareef et al 2018 cotton yield showed an increasing trend with the increasing fertilizer application rate but excessive fertilization did not increase yield li et al 2010 wang et al 2012b similar conclusions were also obtained by us year fertilization and year water fertilization showed significant p 0 05 effects on seed cotton yield the yield first increased and then decreased with the increasing fertilization rate the highest lint yield was obtained when the irrigation level was 1 0 etc and the fertilizer amount was f3 in 2012 and 2013 when the irrigation at 1 0 etc level was applied the seed cotton yield of f4 was the maximum in 2012 and 2014 and there is no significant difference in seed cotton yield between f3 and f4 in 2012 and 2013 the reason for this difference in three years may be due to the different climates during the cotton growing season the precipitation was 62 mm in 2012 113 mm in 2013 and 102 mm in 2014 respectively the total precipitation was relatively small in 2012 and 2014 and most of the precipitation was ineffective 5 mm which affected the absorption of nutrients and the distribution of photosynthetic products in crops wp is negatively correlated with irrigation amounts but positively correlated with fertilization amounts xing et al 2015 increasing the application of fertilizer was conducive to improving the wp of crops li et al 2015a similar results were gained by us in addition we found there was a quadratic negative correlation between fertilizer application and wp which was consistent with the findings of liu et al 2014 and gu et al 2017 for maize and winter rapeseed respectively 4 4 effects of various irrigation and fertilizer amounts on n p and k use efficiency the rational application of n fertilizer is extremely important to improve yield and n use efficiency zhang et al 2012 n p and k use efficiency decreased as the amount of n p and k applied increased respectively hu et al 2010 li et al 2010 jiang et al 2011 wang et al 2012b when the application rates of phosphate and potassium fertilizer were the same the application of nitrogen fertilizer can enhance the phosphorus and potassium use efficiency but the nitrogen use efficiency decreased as the application of nitrogen increased li et al 2018 we also came to a conclusion similar to previous studies when the amount of irrigation was the same n p and k use efficiency of low fertilizer levels was higher than that of high fertilizer levels in 2012 and 2013 the highest n p and k use efficiency occurred in the deficit irrigation levels in 2012 2014 the increased n p and k accumulation in plants of full irrigation were mainly observed in vegetative organs compared to deficit irrigation levels this result is similar to that of shi et al 2018 who reported that the n production efficiency of insufficient irrigation was greater than that of conventional irrigation when the fertilization levels were same we found the seed cotton yield economic benefits and water use efficiency achieved 90 of their maximum values simultaneously when the irrigation interval was 362 3 462 5 mm and the fertilizer n p2o5 k2o interval was 212 5 85 42 5 to 367 5 147 73 5 kg ha 1 wang et al 2018 in this study comprehensively considering from the perspective of the seed cotton yield lint yield the n p and k absorption and use efficiency as well as the environment the irrigation level of 1 0 etc and n p2o5 k2o rate of 250 43 7 41 5 kg ha 1 was the best drip fertigation strategy this irrigation and fertilization level was included in the above interval 5 conclusions the dry matter accumulation seed cotton yield and lint yield showed an increasing trend with increasing irrigation amount under the same fertilizer level during 2012 2014 although the highest wp n p and k use efficiency occurred at deficit irrigation levels deficit irrigation resulted in a severe decrease in cotton yield total n p and k accumulation had a highly positive correlation with seed cotton yield increasing the absorption of n p and k especially the nutrient uptake in reproductive organs could enhance the seed cotton yield under full irrigation 1 0 etc the total dry matter accumulation seed cotton yield n p and k accumulation in plants in the fertilizer level f4 300 52 4 49 8 kg ha 1 were significantly greater than those of the other four fertilizer levels during 2012 and 2014 however when the irrigation amount was 1 0 etc and fertilizer amount was f3 250 43 7 41 5 kg ha 1 the seed cotton yield and lint yield were highest in 2013 when the amount of irrigation was the same the n p and k use efficiencies of low fertilizer levels were higher than that of high fertilizer levels in 2012 and 2013 comprehensively considering the cotton yield as well as the n p and k absorption and use efficiency the irrigation level of 1 0 etc and n p k rate of 250 43 7 41 5 kg ha 1 was the best drip fertigation strategy in northwestern china the uptake ratio of n p and k in 100 kg lint was about 1 0 25 1 22 which is of great significance for guiding rational fertilization declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

10315,as a fiber crop and oil crop cotton plays an important role in the economic development of northwest china but the lack of appropriate field water and fertilizer management strategies has restricted the harmonious development of cotton industry and environment field experiments were implemented to explore the coupling effects of various drip irrigation and fertilizer levels on the dry matter yield water and fertilizer use efficiency of cotton the three drip irrigation levels included 1 0 etc full irrigation 0 8 etc 20 deficit and 0 6 etc 40 deficit where etc is the crop evapotranspiration the five fertilizer n p k levels were f1 150 26 2 24 9 kg ha 1 f2 200 34 9 33 2 kg ha 1 f3 250 43 7 41 5 kg ha 1 f4 300 52 4 49 8 kg ha 1 and f5 350 61 1 58 1 kg ha 1 the results revealed that the seed cotton yield and lint yield showed increasing trends as the irrigation water amount increased at the same fertilizer level during 2012 2014 when full irrigation 1 0 etc was applied the dry matter accumulation seed cotton yield n p and k accumulation in plants and water productivity were the highest under f4 300 52 4 49 8 kg ha 1 in 2012 and 2014 however the lint yield was highest in 2012 and 2013 under f3 250 43 7 41 5 kg ha 1 at the same irrigation level n p and k use efficiencies were higher at low fertilization rates than those at high fertilization rates in 2012 and 2013 deficit irrigation and fertilization levels led to a severe decrease in cotton yield n p and k use efficiencies were low under f4 comprehensively considering cotton yield n p and k uptake and use efficiency the application of irrigation amount of 1 0 etc and n p k rate of 250 43 7 41 5 kg ha 1 was the best drip fertigation strategy for cotton production in arid regions of northwest china keywords drip fertigation cotton yield root to shoot ratio fertilizer absorption and use efficiency 1 introduction cotton is an important economic crop which plays an important part in the agricultural and industrial economic structure of china qian et al 2014 li et al 2019 china s cotton production ranks first around the world and the annual production of cotton lint has increased from 4 34 to 6 18 million tons between 1994 and 2014 fao 2018 the xinjiang autonomous region located in northwest china is the main producing area of cotton in china as a result of abundant light and heat resources zhang et al 2016a however the limited water resources in this region largely restrict the local agricultural development although drip irrigation under plastic mulching has been widely used in arid regions of china li et al 2015b yan et al 2019 qi et al 2020 shi et al 2020 local farmers still lack proper field water and fertilizer management strategies the conventional excessive irrigation and fertilization can lead to low water and fertilizer use efficiency waste of water and contamination of water resources wang et al 2018 wang et al 2019 water is one of the important factors limiting cotton growth drought stress can thus significantly reduce the biological yield of cotton and hinder the absorption and accumulation of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium hu et al 2002 many researchers have revealed that both deficit and excessive irrigation reduced seed cotton yields detar 2008 ünlü et al 2011 papastylianou and argyrokastritis 2014 in addition zhang et al 2016b found that irrigation can significantly increase the nitrogen accumulation and nitrogen use efficiency and the deficit irrigation 60 etc where etc is the crop evapotranspiration inhibited the absorption of nitrogen n however some researchers believe that reasonable deficit irrigation can not only save water and keep reasonable proportions of crop vegetative and reproductive growth but also promote root growth and improve root absorption in cotton du et al 2007 hassanli et al 2009 in addition irrigation method also has a great impact on the growth and development of cotton tang et al 2005 suggested that the alternate drip irrigation could be applied in arid areas to save irrigation water rajak et al 2006 found that drip irrigation lead to a higher cotton yield and water use efficiency compared with furrow irrigation wang et al 2012a also showed that drip irrigation significantly increased seed cotton yield plant n uptake and n use efficiency and decreased no3 n in the leakage water overall cotton yield and fertilizer use efficiency can be enhanced by appropriate irrigation amounts and methods reasonable fertilization can also increase cotton growth yield and fiber quality wu et al 2014 geng et al 2016 high yield of cotton is directly affected by the amount of nitrogen absorbed and the duration of absorption gong et al 2015 when the application amount of nitrogen was 375 kg ha 1 the highest fiber yield and agronomic n use efficiency were obtained by chen et al 2016 applying n at the beginning of an irrigation cycle was useful for enhancing cotton yield and fertilizer use efficiency hou et al 2009 the lack of n p and k can significantly affect cotton growth the fiber length and strength of cotton will be reduced when lack of n k deficiency had adverse effects on reproductive growth and increased the soluble sugar to free amino acid ratio and c n ratio read et al 2006 hu et al 2017 higher biomass yield nitrogen phosphorus and potassium nutrient use efficiency can be obtained when using combined n p and k fertilizer xin et al 2010 in addition other researchers have studied the effects of fertilizer ratio or added regulators on enhancing the fertilizer use efficiency of cotton yang et al 2014 observed that applying plant growth regulators could improve the partial factor productivity and agronomic k use efficiency in short the reasonable application of n p and k is beneficial to the growth of cotton and improves the fertilizer use efficiency in recent years many researchers have investigated the influences of various irrigation and n application rates on cotton growth yield water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency nue under drip fertigation conditions it was found that cotton yield increased with the increasing nitrogen and irrigation amounts but the wue and nue decreased significantly in high water and high n treatments aujla et al 2005 thind et al 2008 jayakumar et al 2015 janat 2008 reported that relative to the maximum n rates applied in furrow irrigation 100 150 kg ha 1 n was sufficient for lint yield nitrogen uptake and recovery of cotton under drip irrigation in addition wang et al 2010 found that seed cotton yield first increased and then declined as the water and phosphorus p amount increased reasonable irrigation and n p and k ratios can ensure crop yield avoid both water and fertilizer waste and reduce the environmental impact of excessive fertilizer application li et al 2009 improper drip fertigation was more likely to exacerbate salt loss or accumulation in the root zone compared with the conventional fertilization methods wu et al 2014 appropriate irrigation and fertilization can promote the coordinated growth of cotton root crowns and shape a reasonable canopy structure which is conducive to the accumulation of above ground biomass and lays a foundation for high yields deng et al 2015 it is clear from the above review that previous studies have focused largely on the effects of single irrigation and fertilization or the interacting effects of water and n on cotton growth and lint yield studies on the influences of various irrigation amounts as along with n p and k rates and ratios on the dry matter accumulation yield nutrient absorption and fertilizer use efficiency of drip fertigated cotton are still lacking therefore the objectives of the present study were to 1 explore the coupling influences of various irrigation and fertilization levels on the dry matter accumulation and nutrient uptake of cotton and 2 determine an appropriate irrigation and fertilization regime to maximize cotton yield and fertilizer use efficiency this study is expected to provide scientific basis for optimal water and fertilization management of drip fertigated cotton in arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description field experiments were carried out from 2012 to 2014 at the irrigation station of xinjiang academy of land

lowest proportion of total dry matter under the same fertilizer level the cumulative amount of dry matter in bolls increased as the irrigation amount increased during the three years when the same water amount was applied the dry matter in bolls increased first and then decreased as the fertilizer amount increased the drought resistance of cotton can be improved by properly increasing the amount of fertilizer under water deficit when the irrigation level 1 0 etc and fertilizer level f4 were applied the total dry matter accumulation achieved the highest value in 2012 and 2014 table 3 the root to shoot ratio is mainly used to characterize the distribution characteristics of photosynthetic products in plants and is also a key parameter for measuring the plant nutrition index the

the fertilizer level f1 was higher than that in the other four fertilizer levels a low fertilizer amount can t improve the accumulation of dry matter in the shoots under the irrigation level 0 6 etc f4 decreased dry matter of root and increased dry matter accumulation in shoot thus when the irrigation level 0 6 etc was applied the root to shoot ratio in the fertilizer level f4 was the lowest

there was no significant difference in the root to shoot ratio between the irrigation levels 1 0 etc and 0 6 etc in 2012 and 2013 low irrigation level 0 6 etc caused a similar degree of reduction in

the total p accumulation in plants in the fertilizer level f4 was highest in 2014 total p accumulation decreased with declining irrigation amount in 2013 and 2014 fig 1d f the effects of water

kg lint were significant p 0 05 table 4 for producing 100 kg lint cotton the required amounts of n p and k were 8 77 14 98 kg 2 29 3 45 kg and 11 33 17 19 kg respectively in 2012 2014 table 4 the uptake of n p and k in 100 kg lint across all treatments ranged from 1 0 22 0 28 1 11 1 33 during the three years with the average n p k ratio of 1 0 25 1 22 the proportion of n p and k uptake in 100 kg lint was highest when the irrigation level 0 6 etc and fertilizer rate f1 were applied table 4 3 3 seed cotton yield lint yield and water productivity fertilization water fertilization and year water fertilization had significant effects on seed cotton yield p 0 05 table 5 under a given designed irrigation level seed cotton yield first increased with the increasing fertilization rate but it then decreased when the fertilizer application rate was beyond a certain range a quadratic negative correlation existed between fertilizer application and seed cotton yield fig 2a c the effects of fertilization water and year water were significant p 0 05 the seed cotton yield was enhanced by the increase of water amount during 2012 2014 the seed cotton yield in the irrigation level 1 0 etc was significantly greater than that of the two deficit irrigation levels 0 8 etc and 0 6 etc compared to 1 0 etc the average seed cotton yield of 0 8 etc and 0 6 etc was decreased by 4 1 and 25 1 in 2012 6 9 and 22 2 in 2013 and 6 9 and 19 5 in 2014 fig 2a c respectively the effects of year water fertilization year water year fertilization water fertilization and year water fertilization on lint yield were significant during 2012 2014 p 0 05 table 5 the lint yield and wp first increased and then reduced with the increase of fertilization rate fig 2d i when the fertilizer rate was f3 250 43 7 41 5 kg ha 1 the lint yield and wp achieved the highest value in 2013 however when the amount of fertilizer applied was f4 300 52 4 49 8 kg ha 1 the greatest lint yield and wp were achieved in 2012 and 2014 the greater lint yield was found in treatments under full irrigation 1 0 etc however the wp of irrigation level 0 8 etc was higher than that of the other two irrigation levels 1 0 etc and 0 6 etc in 2012 and 2013 3 4 n p and k use efficiency fertilization year fertilization water fertilization and year water fertilization had significant p 0 05 effects on n use efficiency table 6 when the irrigation levels 1 0 etc and 0 8 etc were applied the n use efficiency of fertilizer level f1 was significantly greater than those of f2 f3 f4 and f5 in 2012 when the irrigation level 0 6 etc was applied there was no difference in n use efficiency between the fertilizer levels f1 and f2 but the n use efficiency was greater than that of the other three fertilizer levels in 2012 table 6 the n use efficiency of fertilizer level f1 was also significantly higher than that of f3 f4 and f5 when the same irrigation amounts were applied in 2013 however there was no difference in n use efficiency between the fertilizer levels f1 and f2 when the irrigation levels were 1 0 etc and 0 8 etc table 6 in 2014 the n use efficiency of treatment f1 was greater than that of f2 f3 f4 and f5 under 1 0 etc but the n use efficiency of f5 was largest when the irrigation level 0 8 etc was used table 6 the maximum n use efficiency occurred when the irrigation level was 0 6 etc during 2012 2014 although high irrigation amounts could obtain high seed cotton yield and total n accumulation the n use efficiency was not high which may be due to the accumulation of nitrogen mainly in the vegetative organs of cotton under high water conditions water and year water also had significant p 0 05 effects on n use efficiency compared to 1 0 etc the average n use efficiency of 0 8 etc and 0 6 etc was improved by 2 and 7 2 in 2012 10 7 and 8 1 in 2013 and 1 8 and 7 1 in 2014 respectively the effects of fertilization year fertilization water fertilization and the three way interaction on p use efficiency were significant p 0 05 table 6 when the irrigation level 1 0 etc was applied the p use efficiency of fertilizer level f2 was significantly greater than those of f1 f3 f4 and f5 in 2012 however the p use efficiency of fertilizer level f3 was greatest at the deficit irrigation levels table 6 in 2013 when the irrigation amount was 1 0 etc the p use efficiency showed a decreasing trend as the fertilizer application rate increased there was no difference in p use efficiency between the fertilizer levels f1 and f2 when the deficit irrigation levels were applied but the p use efficiency of these two fertilization levels was significantly greater than that of the other three fertilizer levels table 6 however the p use efficiency of fertilizer level f2 was lowest under irrigation levels 1 0 etc and 0 8 etc in 2014 table 6 the effects of water and year water on p use efficiency were significant p 0 05 compared to 1 0 etc the average p use efficiency of 0 8 etc and 0 6 etc was improved by 0 8 and 1 1 in 2012 15 7 and 8 9 in 2013 and 3 1 and 8 5 in 2014 respectively effects of fertilization and the interaction of year water with fertilization on k use efficiency were significant p 0 05 table 6 when full irrigation 1 0 etc and medium irrigation 0 8 etc levels were applied the k use efficiency of fertilizer level f1 was significantly greater than those of f2 f3 f4 and f5 in 2012 table 6 in 2013 the k use efficiency of fertilizer level f1 was also significantly higher than that of f3 f4 and f5 under the same irrigation amounts and the k use efficiency of fertilizer level f4 was lowest table 6 in 2014 the trend of k use efficiency was the same as that of p use efficiency under the irrigation levels 1 0 etc and 0 8 etc the k use efficiency of fertilizer level f2 was significantly lower than those of f1 f3 f4 and f5 table 6 the maximum k use efficiency occurred at deficit irrigation levels during 2012 2014 the effects of water and year water on k use efficiency were also significant p 0 05 compared to 1 0 etc the average k use efficiency of 0 8 etc and 0 6 etc was improved by 2 5 and 6 6 in 2012 7 2 and 4 9 in 2013 and 2 5 and 4 5 in 2014 respectively 3 5 correlation analysis of seed cotton yield root to shoot ratio and n p and k accumulation correlation analysis showed that highly positive correlation of total n p and k accumulation nutrient uptake in different organs with seed cotton yield p 0 01 compared to the nutrient uptake in roots leaves and stems the nutrient uptake in bolls had the highest positive correlation coefficient with yield however the correlation between root to shoot ratio and seed cotton yield was significantly negative p 0 01 table 7 higher n p and k absorption and nutrient uptake in reproductive organ can significantly increase cotton yield 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation and fertilizer management on dry matter accumulation dry matter was the basis of cotton yield and a higher reproductive organ biomass could obtain a higher yield fang et al 2009 yang et al 2011 2013 results showed that the dry matter of vegetative organs accounted for the smallest proportion in the total dry matter and the proportion of reproductive organs was largest yan et al 2009 but the dry matter of cotton is restricted by many factors including the application of irrigation and fertilization yazar et al 2002 reported that the largest cotton dry matter was gotten by the well irrigated treatment yan et al 2009 found both the water deficit and excess affected the accumulation and distribution of dry matter in different organs and different growth stages the most appropriate irrigation amount was 360 mm shi et al 2018 reported that under the same fertilization level the dry matter of insufficient irrigation 280 mm was less than conventional irrigation 380 mm and the dry matter of medium to upper fertilization level n 300 kg ha 1 was higher when the same irrigation levels were applied our findings were consistent with previous studies and we found the effect of fertilization and water fertilization on dry matter of stems and leaves wasn t significant p 0 05 however the water fertilization and the interaction of water with fertilization showed significant p 0 05 effects on dry matter of roots and bolls the dry matter accumulation reduced with the decrease of irrigation amount but it first increased and then decreased with increasing fertilization rates results showed that when water was sufficient high fertilizer made the nutrient concentration of soil solution too high which caused the senescence of root system and the decreased of nutrient absorption efficiency finally led to the decline in biomass xie and tian 2011 yan et al 2009 and li and zhang 2011 found the root to shoot ratio decreased with increasing irrigation amount we found that no significant effect of water on the root to shoot ratio existed in 2012 while a significant effect existed in 2013 and 2014 the reason for this difference may be due to less rainfall in 2012 than in 2013 and 2014 and more evaporation in 2012 than in 2013 and 2014 the irrigation in 2012 was larger than in 2013 and 2014 the root to shoot ratio reflects the distribution and coordination of dry biomass in above ground and underground as the amount of irrigation increased the distribution of increased photosynthates to the aboveground and underground parts was more uniform in 2012 however as the amount of irrigation increased more photosynthates were transported to the aboveground part in 2013 and 2014 min et al 2014 found that the application of nitrogen reduced the cotton root to shoot ratio compared to treatments without nitrogen fertilizer we also found when the irrigation was applied at 1 0 etc and 0 8 etc root to shoot ratio of fertilizer level f1 was higher than that of the other four fertilizer levels as the amount of fertilization increased more photosynthesis products were transported to the reproductive organs 4 2 effects of irrigation and fertilizer management on n p and k uptake nutrient absorption is the basis for the formation and accumulation of dry matter and the accumulation of dry matter and nutrients is the prerequisite for the formation of yield studies have shown that a higher yield could be obtained by an adequate n p and k acquisition xin et al 2010 khan et al 2017 this study also found that the total n p and k accumulation had a highly positive correlation with seed cotton yield at maturity with the senescence and shedding of leaves n p and k were transported to cotton bolls fang et al 2009 hu et al 2010 jiang et al 2011 yang et al 2013 indicated that fertilizer 15n was found in the greatest amounts in the reproductive part of all organs and the proportion of total n accumulated in plants enhanced with n application rates our findings were consistent with previous studies compared to the nutrient uptake in roots leaves and stems the nutrient uptake in bolls had a higher positive correlation with yield increasing the absorption of n p and k especially the nutrient uptake of reproductive organs is conducive to the increase of yield tariq et al 2018 revealed that the k concentration in vegetative and boll components was enhanced as the k application rate increased li et al 2018 found that the accumulation of n p and k nutrients in cotton plants was increased gradually when more n was applied we found the water fertilization and the interaction of year water with fertilization had significant p 0 05 effects on total n total p and total k accumulation in plants when full irrigation level 1 0 etc was applied in 2012 2013 and 2014 the value of total n total p and total k accumulation in plants increased with the increase of fertilization rate within a certain fertilization threshold f1 f4 but beyond this threshold the total n total p and total k accumulation decreased the fertilizer accumulation in plants of fertilizer level f4 was significantly greater than those in f1 f2 f3 and f5 the reason for this difference may be that when the amount of fertilizer was too high the cotton field was too gloomy and the transmittance was poor which affected the accumulation of nutrients in reproductive organs and led to yield reduction in agricultural production the application of n p and k in a certain proportion can not only balance the supply of nutrients but also give full play to the role of various nutrient elements to increase yield and improve the fertilizer use efficiency finding out the proportion of nutrients absorbed by crops is of great significance for guiding rational fertilization mullins and burmester 1990 pointed out that the n p and k required was 19 9 2 5 and 15 3 kg to produce 100 kg lint respectively however unruh and silvertooth 1996 found that the requirements of n p k were 15 2 3 19 kg and 21 3 3 23 kg to produce 100 kg lint upland cotton and pima cotton respectively fang et al 2009 revealed that when the lint yield of hybrid cotton was 1778 23 kg ha 1 the uptake amounts of n p2o5 and k2o were 242 92 82 12 and 247 76 kg ha 1 respectively and the absorption ratios of n p2o5 and k2o were 1 0 34 1 02 dong et al 2010 determined that the values of n p k for producing 100 kg lint in low and high fertility fields were 1 0 365 0 728 and 1 0 364 0 884 respectively we found that effects of water fertilization and two way interaction on the uptake of n p and k in 100 kg lint were remarkably significant in 2012 2014 for producing 100 kg lint cotton the required amounts of n p and k were 8 77 14 98 kg 2 29 3 45 kg and 11 33 17 19 kg respectively in 2012 2014 the uptake ratio of n p and k in 100 kg lint ranged from 1 0 22 0 28 1 11 1 33 across all treatments during the three years with the average n p k ratio of 1 0 25 1 22 this difference can be largely attributed to the difference in variety of cotton soil texture fertilization rates or irrigation amounts the proportion of n p and k uptake in 100 kg lint was highest when the irrigation level 0 6 etc and fertilizer rate f1 were applied the reasons for this result may be due to the fact that the ratio of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium in this experiment was 1 0 175 0 166 where the amount of phosphorus applied was sufficient and the potassium content in the soil was very high 150 mg kg 1 although the nitrogen application rate of fertilizer level f1 was only 150 kg ha 1 the crop may have ingested a large proportion of nitrogen from the soil 4 3 effects of irrigation and fertilizer levels on cotton yield and wp proper water and fertilizer inputs could result in a higher yield zheng et al 2001 wu et al 2014 the effect of water was significant p 0 05 increasing irrigation amount could enhance the seed cotton yield and lint yield in three years the findings agree with previous studies which reported that yields were enhanced with increasing irrigation amount yang et al 2015 shareef et al 2018 cotton yield showed an increasing trend with the increasing fertilizer application rate but excessive fertilization did not increase yield li et al 2010 wang et al 2012b similar conclusions were also obtained by us year fertilization and year water fertilization showed significant p 0 05 effects on seed cotton yield the yield first increased and then decreased with the increasing fertilization rate the highest lint yield was obtained when the irrigation level was 1 0 etc and the fertilizer amount was f3 in 2012 and 2013 when the irrigation at 1 0 etc level was applied the seed cotton yield of f4 was the maximum in 2012 and 2014 and there is no significant difference in seed cotton yield between f3 and f4 in 2012 and 2013 the reason for this difference in three years may be due to the different climates during the cotton growing season the precipitation was 62 mm in 2012 113 mm in 2013 and 102 mm in 2014 respectively the total precipitation was relatively small in 2012 and 2014 and most of the precipitation was ineffective 5 mm which affected the absorption of nutrients and the distribution of photosynthetic products in crops wp is negatively correlated with irrigation amounts but positively correlated with fertilization amounts xing et al 2015 increasing the application of fertilizer was conducive to improving the wp of crops li et al 2015a similar results were gained by us in addition we found there was a quadratic negative correlation between fertilizer application and wp which was consistent with the findings of liu et al 2014 and gu et al 2017 for maize and winter rapeseed respectively 4 4 effects of various irrigation and fertilizer amounts on n p and k use efficiency the rational application of n fertilizer is extremely important to improve yield and n use efficiency zhang et al 2012 n p and k use efficiency decreased as the amount of n p and k applied increased respectively hu et al 2010 li et al 2010 jiang et al 2011 wang et al 2012b when the application rates of phosphate and potassium fertilizer were the same the application of nitrogen fertilizer can enhance the phosphorus and potassium use efficiency but the nitrogen use efficiency decreased as the application of nitrogen increased li et al 2018 we also came to a conclusion similar to previous studies when the amount of irrigation was the same n p and k use efficiency of low fertilizer levels was higher than that of high fertilizer levels in 2012 and 2013 the highest n p and k use efficiency occurred in the deficit irrigation levels in 2012 2014 the increased n p and k accumulation in plants of full irrigation were mainly observed in vegetative organs compared to deficit irrigation levels this result is similar to that of shi et al 2018 who reported that the n production efficiency of insufficient irrigation was greater than that of conventional irrigation when the fertilization levels were same we found the seed cotton yield economic benefits and water use efficiency achieved 90 of their maximum values simultaneously when the irrigation interval was 362 3 462 5 mm and the fertilizer n p2o5 k2o interval was 212 5 85 42 5 to 367 5 147 73 5 kg ha 1 wang et al 2018 in this study comprehensively considering from the perspective of the seed cotton yield lint yield the n p and k absorption and use efficiency as well as the environment the irrigation level of 1 0 etc and n p2o5 k2o rate of 250 43 7 41 5 kg ha 1 was the best drip fertigation strategy this irrigation and fertilization level was included in the above interval 5 conclusions the dry matter accumulation seed cotton yield and lint yield showed an increasing trend with increasing irrigation amount under the same fertilizer level during 2012 2014 although the highest wp n p and k use efficiency occurred at deficit irrigation levels deficit irrigation resulted in a severe decrease in cotton yield total n p and k accumulation had a highly positive correlation with seed cotton yield increasing the absorption of n p and k especially the nutrient uptake in reproductive organs could enhance the seed cotton yield under full irrigation 1 0 etc the total dry matter accumulation seed cotton yield n p and k accumulation in plants in the fertilizer level f4 300 52 4 49 8 kg ha 1 were significantly greater than those of the other four fertilizer levels during 2012 and 2014 however when the irrigation amount was 1 0 etc and fertilizer amount was f3 250 43 7 41 5 kg ha 1 the seed cotton yield and lint yield were highest in 2013 when the amount of irrigation was the same the n p and k use efficiencies of low fertilizer levels were higher than that of high fertilizer levels in 2012 and 2013 comprehensively considering the cotton yield as well as the n p and k absorption and use efficiency the irrigation level of 1 0 etc and n p k rate of 250 43 7 41 5 kg ha 1 was the best drip fertigation strategy in northwestern china the uptake ratio of n p and k in 100 kg lint was about 1

10316,the indus basin irrigation system ibis of pakistan is a major user of surface and groundwater and provides food and economic security for about 207 million people to assess the impact of agricultural development on water resources we developed surface water balances for its canal commands and examined trends from 1981 82 to 2012 13 in this semi arid environment crop water use is the major water balance term we estimated it by computing actual evapotranspiration eta from two different remote sensing methods etlook and cmrset to account for method uncertainty net groundwater use was a small component of the water balance in most canal commands particularly in the sindh province the measured or estimated known terms in the water balance did not result in its closure and a balance term of unaccounted outflows and inflows was required to close it measured and readily estimated components amounted to 80 90 of the water balance components with unaccounted inflows and outflows accounting for the remaining 10 20 of the measured water balance terms rainfall showed no statistically significant trend in any canal command whereas canal deliveries decreased significantly in many canal commands overall eta generally increased in punjab and decreased slightly in sindh the magnitude of the increases in eta differed between the etlook and cmrset estimates the historical trends in the balance term unaccounted outflows and inflows together with falling groundwater levels show that water use is becoming less sustainable in several canal commands especially in the punjab province the trend to a less sustainable position results particularly from water use in the dry rabi season keywords irrigation water use water accounting unaccounted outflows and inflows sustainable use trends remote sensing 1 introduction increasing withdrawals of water from rivers and associated groundwater systems has led to concerns about the sustainability of irrigated agriculture and environment around the world particularly in arid and semi arid regions time series distributed water accounting and water balance studies can provide critical information which can help evaluate the impact of historical water resources development and policies on irrigated agriculture and the environment and explore management options numerous water balance studies have been conducted at multiple temporal and spatial scales across the globe to quantify unknown water balance terms such as irrigation application droogers et al 2010 brocca et al 2018 groundwater use ruud et al 2004 ahmad et al 2005 martínez santos and martínez alfaro 2010 liu et al 2016 peña arancibia et al 2020a and explore water management and policy options sharma 1999 le roux et al 2017 immerzeel and bierkens 2012 conducted basin scale water balance analysis for large river basins in asia and identified broad concerns for sustainable water use and options to address a growing water scarcity this analysis highlighted the transboundary indus river basin as one of most vulnerable river basins in asia pakistan is the lower riparian country and holds the indus basin irrigation system ibis the largest contiguous irrigation system in the world and food bowl of the nation the water resources of the ibis are almost fully utilised with irrigation being the main use groundwater in particular is over committed with unsustainable use in parts of the upstream province of punjab briscoe and qamar 2005 ahmad et al 2007 archer et al 2010 qureshi et al 2010 kirby et al 2017 in this large irrigated system 160 000 km2 with complex water sharing rules brochmann 2012 sarfraz 2013 anwar and bhatti 2018 parts of the basin have different challenges on the use of groundwater and achieving sustainable water use ahmad et al 2014 basharat et al 2014 in the downstream province of sindh groundwater use is limited because of salinity and waterlogging is a major constraint to crop production in the upstream province of punjab particularly in the northernmost part rainfall is greater than in sindh and canal deliveries of irrigation water per unit area are correspondingly less where the groundwater is fresh it is heavily used and groundwater levels are falling implying unsustainable use and also risking saline water contamination from brackish groundwater pockets this is of concern because pakistan s increasing population will require more food implying the use of more water for irrigation which in the absence of other developments would require ever more unsustainable use of groundwater kirby et al 2017 motivated by the concerns for food security and sustainable water use in pakistan our aim is to examine regional differences in water availability and demand identify trends in the water balance and highlight canal commands on less sustainable trajectories from the canal command water balances we then build up a regional and national picture this paper focuses on the recent historic 1981 82 to 2012 13 agricultural development impacts on the water balance several studies have estimated water balances in the indus basin of pakistan many assessed the water balance of the whole basin in pakistan and did not separately identify water balances for provinces or finer scales such as canal commands or administrative districts whole of basin estimates include bastiaanssen et al 2012 cheema 2012 cheema et al 2014 hussain et al 2011 karimi et al 2013 and young et al 2019 and bastiaanssen et al 2003 for the ibis it is worth noting that all the estimates above were for a single year or an average year kirby et al 2017 assessed the trends from 1960 to 2010 of the main terms of a whole of basin water balance of the irrigated areas of the indus in pakistan azad et al 2003 assessed the water balance for an average year in the sindh province and zaidi et al 2019 made a comprehensive study of the water balance of sindh for the rabi seasons of 2017 18 and 2018 19 and the kharif season of 2018 basharat et al 2014 described groundwater levels and canal deliveries for many canal commands but did not give an overall water balance while basharat et al 2014 presented trends in groundwater levels the study did not give quantitative trend information for other aspects of the water balance simons et al 2020 described components of the water balance presented as annual averages including estimates of non consumptive use of irrigation water that is water which is recycled as a return flow for the canal commands of the indus basin in pakistan several studies assessed the water balance for selected canal commands or areas of particular interest often over several years hassan and bhutta 1995 kijne 1996 khan et al 1999 whole of basin remote sensing estimates of the spatial and temporal variation over a year of actual evapotranspiration one of the main components of the water balance have been assessed in several studies bastiaanssen et al 2012 cheema 2012 liaqat et al 2015 the estimates have been used to develop basin wide water balances e g karimi et al 2013 kirby et al 2017 but again apply only to a single year and therefore cannot assess trends no study that we know of has assessed long term trends in the water balance at a scale such as a canal command over the whole of the indus irrigation areas in pakistan in this paper we examine the historical annual and seasonal kharif and rabi seasons the wet summer season and the dry winter season water balances in the canal commands in the ibis below the two large 5 km3 storage multipurpose tarbela and mangla dams see fig 1 of pakistan from 1981 to 2012 the water balance comprises inflows in the form of rainfall and canal deliveries outflows mainly as actual evapotranspiration estimated by two different remote sensing methods with dissimilar conceptualisations see section 2 2 and changes to groundwater levels these components of the water balance are all directly measured or readily assessed from direct measurements focussing on the known components of the water balance leads to an assessment of unaccounted inflows and outflows kirby et al 2008a 2008b van dijk et al 2008 2009 and hence an assessment of the uncertainty in the water balance this approach is similar to the water balance closure approaches using remote sensed water balance components of oliveira et al 2014 who noted that while there is uncertainty in the estimates it is a useful way to evaluate trends over large regions in their case the also semi arid brazilian cerrado through the water balance approach we will show that the inflows generally do not match the outflows in any canal command for either set of actual evapotranspiration estimates implying uncertainty in the measured and estimated terms of the water balance we will further note that the uncertainty cannot be reconciled by water balance modelling we assess the residual unknown components unaccounted inflows and outflows of the water balance after the readily estimated components are accounted for notwithstanding the uncertainty in the water balance useful insights emerge from the assessment of the known components their variation amongst canal commands and provinces and their temporal trends for the kharif and rabi seasons we discuss the water balance in light of the trends in crop areas in the canal commands this study is as far as we know unique in presenting water balances and identifying trends in the water balances for all the canal commands of the main irrigated area of the ibis in the main paper we describe the analysis based on cmrset csiro modis rescaled evapotranspiration actual evapotranspiration estimates eta cmrset for the ibis peña arancibia et al 2020b in the supplementary information we give the main results for an analysis based on the etlook method bastiaanssen et al 2012 cheema 2012 of actual evapotranspiration estimates eta etlook the two different remote sensing methods resulted in different actual evapotranspiration estimates but led to the same overall conclusions regarding water balances and uncertainty 2 methods 2 1 study area the study area is shown in fig 1 and comprises the ibis canal commands of punjab and sindh plus the pat and desert canal commands of balochistan which receive water from barrages that supply other canal commands in sindh the climate of this region is semi arid and typically represents low lying interior of the indo pakistan sub continent rainfall and temperature show large seasonal fluctuations within the basin the summer is long and hot lasting from april through to september with maximum air temperature ranging from 21 c and 49 c winter lasts from december through to february with maximum air temperature ranging from 25 c to 27 c during the day and sometimes falling below zero at night the monsoon elapses from june to september and accounts for about 75 of annual rainfall coinciding with the peak river flows in a hydrological year i e 1st april 31st march mean annual rainfall varies from 76 mm in the rice canal command in central sindh to 875 mm in the upper jhelum canal command in north eastern punjab due to scanty and erratic rainfall year round agriculture is only possible through irrigation which is supplied through an intensive network of public two large supply dams tarbela capacity of 7 38 km3 in 2020 and mangla capacity of 9 08 km3 in 2018 a network of regulating infrastructure consisting of the small chashma dam capacity of 0 34 km3 and 15 head works 12 inter river link canals and 48 irrigation canals fig 1 based on time series inflow data from april 1976 to march 2020 the ibis in pakistan has a mean annual headwater inflow of about 167 km3 almost 71 of the mean annual flow of the river network is diverted for agricultural and domestic use purpose the indus and its tributaries supply about 60 of the total water used for irrigation indus river system authority irsa unpublished data from 2020 the rest is groundwater predominantly in the fresh groundwater quality regions of punjab and small isolated pockets of sindh province ahmad et al 2014 the prevailing temperature and rainfall patterns govern two distinct cropping seasons kharif april to september and rabi october to march wheat and fodder are the dominant crops during the dry rabi winter season among other crops cotton rice maize and fodder are produced during the wet kharif summer season whereas sugarcane is an annual crop 2 2 water balance assessment we used the surface water balance approach of ahmad 2002 and ahmad et al 2005 that quantifies net groundwater use using the canal command as a modelling unit in this approach the net groundwater use in an irrigation area i ngw could be computed as the deficit implied by a water balance of the land surface given by 1 i ngw et a p n i cw dw dt where et a is the water lost by evapotranspiration of crops and other vegetation p n is the water gained from precipitation considered as a net term after outflows to runoff i cw is the diversion of water into the area via canals and dw dt is the change in water stored in the area in the soil but also in other surface storages over the period being considered the advantage of the surface water balance approach is that it does not require detailed groundwater modelling or assessment and does not require information or assumptions about lateral groundwater flows ahmad et al 2005 applied the method to the rechna doab region of pakistan using spatially explicit estimates of et a derived from remotely sensed satellite data here we modify the idea slightly to look at a lumped canal command surface water balance given by supply and demand terms 2 0 et a p n i cw i ngw b where b is an unaccounted difference term equivalent to the depth of water required to set the right hand side of the equation to zero the equation is one dimensional and all terms are given as equivalent depths of water et a can be directly estimated from remote sensing observations p n and i cw can be directly measured i ngw is the net groundwater use we estimated i ngw as the change in groundwater storage which can be calculated directly from observed changes in groundwater levels and values of specific yield if the groundwater recharge and discharge is strictly one dimensional this calculation is correct though the estimates may nevertheless be subject to measurement error note that i ngw can be either a positive or negative term depending on whether the groundwater level decreases adding water to the land surface water balance i e net groundwater use or increases i e withdrawing water from the land surface water balance i e net groundwater recharge most recharge of the groundwater occurs through rainfall in the north of the basin and seepage from the distributed canal network and irrigated fields khan et al 2017 bonsor et al 2017 and so is largely one dimensional any subsurface lateral flows in the groundwater appear as an unaccounted outflow or gain in the balance term in the case of sustainable groundwater use i ngw would be zero over the long term and in such a case the groundwater use would equal recharge if the groundwater recharge and extraction is strictly one dimensional this calculation is correct subject to measurement error the difference or balance term is a composite term that includes unaccounted outflows and inflows such as surface runoff or lateral subsurface flows that contribute to the change in groundwater levels plus observation errors in all the other terms the smaller the balance terms across the canal commands are relative to other terms the higher the confidence in the estimate of the water balances in modifying eq 1 to derive eq 2 the soil water storage term dw dt is absent and is implicit in the difference or balance term b the water balances were assessed for each month and then aggregated to seasonal rabi and kharif and annual balances in an annual water balance over the long term dw dt is likely to be near zero 2 3 data sources we performed a monthly water balance assessment for 1981 to 2013 using the following datasets daily observed unpublished climate data was obtained from pakistan meteorological department and water and power development authority wapda the daily data were interpolated using anusplin hutchinson 1998 and aggregated to monthly seasonal kharif and rabi and annual totals for the ibis remotely sensed estimates of ten daily actual evapotranspiration by peña arancibia et al 2020b based on the cmrset method guerschman et al 2009 sampled and aggregated to seasonal and annual totals for the canal command areas of punjab and sindh eta cmrset the estimates are for 2000 to 2013 and were extrapolated to earlier years using the fitted regression line for 2000 to 2013 to project the trend to earlier years with the average monthly deviation from the trend superimposed in the main body of the paper we describe the analysis using eta cmrset because they have the longer period of observation and a shorter period of extrapolation than the eta etlook estimates described below besides an evaluation against both field and remotely sensed data conducted in the ibis context see peña arancibia et al 2020b cmrset has been positively evaluated in several water assessment modelling studies and for different climates van dijk et al 2011 paca et al 2019 peña arancibia et al 2016 2020a weerasinghe et al 2020 we repeated the analysis using a second set of remotely sensed estimates of daily actual evapotranspiration based on the etlook method bastiaanssen et al 2012 cheema 2012 cheema et al 2014 sampled and aggregated to seasonal and annual totals for ibis the repeated analysis is described in the supplementary information the estimates are for 2007 and were extrapolated to other years by ahmad et al 2019 the extrapolation method used for eta cmrset could not be used for eta etlook where only one year of observation was available therefore the extrapolation was based on the changes in irrigated areas see section 2 4 and changes in potential evapotranspiration the results of the analysis using eta etlook are described in the supplementary information canal deliveries for 1981 to 2013 are based on time series ten daily and monthly flow data for the barrages and canals of the indus basin irrigation system wapda wrmd 2014 additional daily flow data for 1990 to 2010 obtained from the punjab and the sindh irrigation departments was used to cross compare the ten daily data and disaggregate barrage level irrigation diversion data for sindh into the canal commands the canal deliveries were aggregated to seasonal and annual totals groundwater depths unpublished data were obtained from wapda and interpolated and spatially averaged for each canal command and then fitted with a regression line the groundwater level change is taken as that assessed from the trend over the period the change in the groundwater component of the water balance is the groundwater level change multiplied by the specific yield which accounts for the fact that groundwater occupies the pore space in the rocks which is a modest fraction of the overall volume more technically specific yield is the ratio of a unit depth withdrawal of water to the depth of groundwater level change the actual specific yield and its variation are not known for the canal commands and we used a default but reasonable value of 0 1 we shall discuss the specific yield assumption in the results 2 4 trends in cropped areas and water balance terms trends in cropped areas were performed by fitting a linear regression to the time series district data collated in ahmad et al 2019 remapped to canal commands using the method in kirby and ahmad 2016 trends in annual rainfall actual evapotranspiration and canal deliveries were estimated by fitting a linear regression of the annual totals as a function of time years the groundwater storage change is taken from the calculation referred to above of the regression of groundwater level change multiplied by specific yield 3 results 3 1 trends in cropped area the canal commands of the main irrigated areas in punjab balochistan and sindh differ in the mix of crops grown fig 2 all canal commands have a large proportion of their cropped area sown to winter cereals mainly wheat and nearly all have some rice though in some cases the area is small cotton is an important crop in many canal commands of the punjab and sindh but is virtually absent in canal commands such as upper chenab canal ucc in the punjab and north west nwc in sindh pulses are grown in nearly all districts but are particularly important in thal and greater thal gtc in the punjab whereas oilseeds are important in fuleli and pinyari in sindh fodder occupies large areas in many canal commands in the punjab particularly gugera gug jhang jhg lower bari doab canal lbdc and lower jhelum canal ljc the areas of different crops increased with similar proportions of crop types from 1981 82 to 2012 13 in most canal commands in the punjab except marala ravi mr int and brbd raya whereas the areas generally decreased in sindh fig 2 the overall increase in irrigated area over the period was about 15 in the punjab whereas sindh experienced about a 15 decline based on these data we will generally expect increases in evapotranspiration in most canal commands in the punjab but little change or slight decreases in the canal commands in sindh 3 2 annual average water balances in this section we present the overall water balances of the canal commands as the annual average of 1981 82 to 2012 13 in the following section we will present the trends in the annual water balances the annual average water balances are shown in fig 3 for eta cmrset and in fig s6 for eta etlook time series water balance components are presented in the supplementary information rainfall fig s1 canal deliveries fig s2 groundwater level fig s3 seasonal actual evapotranspiration s4 and s8 respectively for eta cmrset and eta etlook and seasonal balance terms figs s5 and s9 respectively associated with eta cmrset and eta etlook the actual evapotranspiration estimates from the two methods differ and as a consequence the balance term differs we will discuss the differences in the discussion section below the rainfall canal delivery and groundwater change terms are the same in fig 3 and s6 since these terms are independent of the evapotranspiration estimation method in fig 3 the net groundwater contribution to the surface water balance in most canal commands is too small to be visible at the scale of the graphs while the net groundwater use is small the gross amount of groundwater pumped is large in much of the ibis e g qureshi 2020 we will discuss this issue in the discussion below this is readily seen by considering as an example a fall in groundwater over a whole canal command of 10 m over the whole period which with a specific yield of 0 1 would equate to a removal of 1 m of water over 30 years this is equivalent to about 33 mm per year which is much smaller than the other terms in the canal command water balances generally even where there are local large reductions in groundwater level they are not seen over a whole canal command and annual average changes are therefore generally small this general result will not be changed by different plausible assumptions for the specific yield a small positive net groundwater contribution to the water balance is just visible for lower mailsi pakpattan lm lpc in punjab where net groundwater use contributes 3 9 of the total water supply a positive groundwater contribution indicates groundwater use and consequently declining groundwater levels this canal command has the greatest groundwater level decline equivalent to a groundwater supply to the surface i ngw of about 52 mm per year the next largest decline is in upc umc ubc upc in punjab and is equivalent to a supply to the surface of about 25 mm per year also just visible are small negative contributions i e net recharge for crbc in punjab equivalent to 2 2 of the total supply becoming net recharge and begari 1 5 net recharge desert 2 1 net recharge and pat feeder pfc 2 7 net recharge in sindh and balochistan begari is in sindh the other two in balochistan the rise in groundwater level in the desert canal command is equivalent to an outflow from the surface presumably by deep percolation i e net recharge of about 47 mm per year in all other canal command contributions net groundwater use is smaller mostly substantially smaller than those noted above in figs 3 and s6 the residual balance term plotted in red is a composite term comprising any errors in the other terms plus unaccounted outflows and inflows in the surface water balance such as surface runoff or lateral subsurface flows that contribute to the change in groundwater levels in most canal commands rainfall plus canal deliveries plus any contribution from groundwater exceed the estimated actual evapotranspiration leading to a negative balance term the magnitude of the balance term is generally less than the rainfall canal delivery or actual evapotranspiration terms in punjab though generally larger than the rainfall term in the drier province of sindh the balance term as a percentage of the sum of the absolute values of the measured terms is 7 1 in punjab and 12 7 in sindh for eta cmrset the corresponding values for eta etlook are 13 2 and 16 3 in punjab and sindh respectively 3 3 trends in water balances in this section based on time series trends in individual water balance components presented in the supplementary information we present the trends in the annual water balances fig 4 note that the groundwater contribution to the surface water balance is based on a regression of the changing groundwater levels over the period therefore it is a single constant and does not have a trend the average annual rainfall increased marginally over the study period in both punjab and sindh and balochistan by about 1 mm per year in punjab the increase was all in the kharif season fig s1a though some canal commands such as the upper jhelum canal ujc int experienced decreases in sindh and balochistan about half the increase about 0 5 mm per year was in the kharif season fig s1a again with small decreases in some canal commands such as fuleli in the rabi season the rainfall in punjab did not increase over the period fig s1b whereas in sindh and balochistan there was an increase similar to that in kharif however none of the regressions are significant at the 5 confidence level the annual canal deliveries decreased in punjab at a rate equivalent to about 1 9 mm per year across the canal commands of the province and also in sindh and balochistan at about 3 9 mm per year fig 4 the regressions are significant at the 5 confidence level the decrease in annual deliveries is mostly due to decreases in rabi canal deliveries in both punjab by an average of 2 3 mm per year over the area of the canal commands equivalent to 71 mm over the 31 year period which is a decrease of nearly one third and sindh and balochistan 2 7 mm per year equivalent to 84 mm or about one quarter fig s2b the regressions are significant at the 1 confidence level rabi canal deliveries are highly dependent on releases of stored water this decreasing trend in rabi is partly due to a reduction in available surface water storage within pakistan due to dam sedimentation and partly due to a reduction in basin inflows resulting from gradual upstream development outside of pakistan the canal deliveries decreased in some canal commands in both provinces 12 significant decreases in punjab 6 in sindh and balochistan and increased in a few 5 significant in punjab 2 in sindh and balochistan as shown in fig 4 some of the increases such as the pat feeder pfc in balochistan are due to a new canal command development as expected from the province level result described above the canal deliveries generally decreased more in the rabi season than in the kharif fig s2a and s2b the trends in annual eta cmrset shown in fig 4 and were not significant at the provincial level they were significant in only one canal command in punjab where gug had an increase in actual evapotranspiration in contrast 9 canal commands in sindh and balochistan had a significant trend 4 with an increase in actual evapotranspiration and 5 with a decrease annual eta etlook showed larger trends than cmrset at the province level punjab showed a statistically significant increase of 4 2 mm per year while the trend was not significant in sindh and balochistan on the other hand 24 canal commands in punjab had statistically significant increases 5 level or greater and none had decreases fig s4 in sindh and balochistan 3 canal commands showed a significant increase in annual eta etlook and 5 show a decrease 5 level or greater fig 4 the seasonal results follow the annual pattern with few statistically significant trends in eta cmrset fig s4 whereas in eta etlook there were 25 kharif and 20 rabi statistically significant increases 5 level or greater in punjab no canal command showed a significant decrease fig s8 in sindh and balochistan 2 canal commands had a significant increase in eta etlook in kharif and 2 showed a decrease 5 level or greater in rabi 1 showed an increase in kharif and 2 showed a decrease fig s8 punjab as a whole showed an increase of 2 7 mm per year in kharif in eta etlook and an increase of 1 5 mm per year in rabi both trends are significant at the 1 confidence level sindh and balochistan showed decreases in both kharif and rabi though neither trend was statistically significant the trends in the annual balance term b in eq 2 were not significant at the province level except for eta etlook in punjab which had a positive trend figs 4 and s7 at the canal command level the trends in b were generally significant when the trends in one or both of the canal deliveries and actual evapotranspiration were significant figs 4 and s7 b generally increased when canal deliveries decreased and vice versa and decreased when actual evapotranspiration decreased as expected from the larger actual evapotranspiration trends for eta etlook the trends in the balance term were also greater the seasonal trends were consistent with the annual trends being greater for eta etlook figs s5 and s9 4 discussion the water balance assessments made here are based on the surface water balance approach of ahmad 2002 and ahmad et al 2005 we extend their method to look at a long time series of the main surface water balance terms and hence estimate trends we also extend their method to explicitly determine a balance term which includes the unaccounted inflows and outflows as well as any errors in the terms which can be directly estimated we will discuss below that trends in the balance term are helpful in assessing sustainable water use the advantage of our method is that it uses directly observed water balance terms and does not rely on complex hydrological models simons et al 2020 also point out the benefits of direct approaches that avoid complex hydrological models however their approach nevertheless relies on some assumptions regarding the application of the budyko hypothesis in order to partition the water balance our approach avoids even these assumptions our approach can be applied to any irrigation area for which the main inflows and outflows to the surface water balance can be directly observed or readily estimated we will discuss below that information on rainfall canal deliveries actual evapotranspiration and net groundwater use may comprise most of the water balance in large irrigation areas on relatively flat land as is the case in the indus basin 4 1 trends in supply and demand notwithstanding the uncertainties in the water balance trends in individual water balance components provide useful insights see also oliveira et al 2014 rainfall increased slightly in most canal commands over the study period except in the rabi season in punjab but the trends were not statistically significant on the other hand except for increases associated with newly developed commands canal deliveries decreased in punjab in the rabi season and decreased in both kharif and rabi in sindh and balochistan groundwater levels declined in some canal commands of punjab representing a supply of water to the surface water balance as i ngw new canal commands saw increases in groundwater levels representing an outflow from the surface water balance as deep percolation i e negative i ngw indicating net recharge in sindh groundwater levels generally changed little the major water balance outflow component actual evapotranspiration increased in most canal commands of punjab and in punjab overall in line with increased areas of irrigated cropping this trend was less pronounced in the cmrset results which covered the later part of the period from 2000 to 2013 when areas of irrigated crops did not expand as much in many canal commands fig 2 in sindh canal commands the actual evapotranspiration changed little or decreased in line with the modest declines in the areas of irrigated crops note that there are extreme cases in which reported crop areas and remotely sensed actual evapotranspiration estimates may diverge this is because crop areas are reported using harvested acreage kirby and ahmad 2016 whereas remote sensing algorithms like cmrset would include all types of vegetative land cover to report actual evapotranspiration estimates for example floods can result in lower than average reported acreage due to crop damage but higher than average evapotranspiration due to the presence of standing water simons et al 2020 point out that about half on average across the canal commands of the water supplied by irrigation is not consumed as evapotranspiration much of that is a return flow to groundwater as shown also by ahmad et al 2005 karimi et al 2013 which is then available for re use simons et al 2020 in our water balance we consider the net groundwater use and thus do not show the large groundwater return flows 4 2 implications for sustainable water use unsustainable water use is often assessed on the basis of falling groundwater levels however zhou 2009 showed that falling groundwater levels are alone insufficient to determine whether the use is sustainable or unsustainable with increased pumping the groundwater level may be adjusting to some new sustainable equilibrium here we show that trends in the balance term may also provide additional evidence as noted above when the inflows from rainfall canal deliveries and any supply from groundwater exceed the outflows to estimated actual evapotranspiration a negative balance term in other words additional unaccounted outflow is required to balance the known inflows and the outflows a positive trend in the balance term from more negative to less negative is a trend from a larger excess of inflows over outflows to a smaller excess of inflows over outflows in other words a positive trend in the balance term can be viewed as a trend to a less sustainable position table 1 shows the canal commands in which the trends of both the groundwater levels and the balance term are statistically significant in these canal commands an interpretation of sustainable or unsustainable water use may be more reliable than an interpretation based on the changing groundwater level alone as shown in the table we may distinguish four possible cases but only three are represented amongst the canal commands a rising trend in groundwater levels and a falling trend in the balance term b indicating a trend to a greater excess of water is present in crbc p and pfc this situation if left unchecked potentially could lead to shallow water tables accompanied by waterlogging and salinity problems falling groundwater and falling b represented by haveli act in opposite directions the trend in b is to an excess of water which could counteract the falling groundwater levels the largest group with a number of canal commands in punjab has falling groundwater levels and a rising b indicating a trend to a greater deficit of water the situation in this group appears unsustainable as noted in the table three canal commands in this group muzaffargarh dadu and kec have statistically significant falling groundwater levels but the actual magnitude of decrease is too small to be of concern as shown in fig s3 punjab province overall also has falling groundwater levels and a rising b but again the magnitude of the fall in groundwater levels is small fig s3 eta etlook led to more canal commands being classified as potentially unsustainable than did eta cmrset a similar count of statistically significant trends for kharif and rabi with the balance term based on eta cmrset in fig s4 and eta etlook in fig 9 suggests that unsustainable trends are more pronounced in the rabi season than the kharif thus it appears reasonable to conclude that in a number of canal commands particularly in punjab the groundwater use is trending to an unsustainable position and that this generally results more from water use in the rabi season than the kharif this reinforces the conclusions of other studies such as briscoe and qamar 2005 archer et al 2010 qureshi et al 2010 ahmad et al 2014 kirby et al 2017 that point to a potential unsustainable water use in punjab however whereas the trend indicates whether water use in a canal command is becoming more or less unsustainable it does not indicate whether it is actually unsustainable at present the uncertainties in the water balances preclude such a definitive assessment as noted above the net groundwater use in most canal commands is quite small relative to rainfall and or canal deliveries it follows that a small change to one of the other water balance components could result in a large change to the net groundwater use hartmann et al 2017 thus small changes to water use or canal deliveries could result in large differences to the sustainability of groundwater use a practical conclusion from this finding is that modest reallocations of canal water amongst canal commands could substantially reduce the impact of local over use of groundwater 4 3 uncertainties in the overall water balance there are several sources of uncertainty in the canal command water balances including estimation errors in the rainfall canal deliveries groundwater change and evapotranspiration the uncertainties in and differences between the eta cmrset and eta etlook the method of extrapolating the actual evapotranspiration to years in which it was not directly estimated and in processes such as subsurface lateral flows that are not directly estimated eta cmrset and eta etlook were both directly estimated for 2007 in which year there are no extrapolation effects as shown in the supplementary information and fig s10 eta cmrset was 10 greater than eta etlook in punjab and 1 greater in sindh with more variation at the canal command level the unaccounted outflows and inflows resulting from processes not directly estimated plus the estimation errors are lumped together in the balance term which at the province level varies from 13 2 to 16 3 of the known terms in punjab and sindh for etlook and 7 1 and 12 7 for cmrset this suggests that we have information on perhaps 80 90 of the surface water balance terms this compares favourably to the 69 of measured or readily estimated water balance components for the rivers of the murray darling basin van dijk et al 2009 wang et al 2014 found the monthly water imbalance of 16 large drainage basins in canada was on average 30 of the corresponding monthly rainfall even in a small heavily instrumented watershed flerchinger and cooley 2000 found that water balance errors unaccounted outflows and inflows in the terminology used here amounted to about 10 of the rainfall within some individual canal commands however the balance term unaccounted components and errors is a much greater fraction of the water balance in some cases the large balance term may have a simple explanation the kalri canal command in sindh has a large unaccounted balance term however water from the kalri canal which supplies the canal command is also diverted to karachi city as noted also by simons et al 2020 this accounts for approximately one third of the unaccounted balance term in other cases large unaccounted balance terms have no obvious explanation 5 conclusions we conclude that 1 amongst the major components of the water balance rainfall shows no statistically significant trend from 1981 82 to 2012 13 in any canal command canal deliveries decreased significantly both statistically and in terms of proportionate decrease in many canal commands in the rabi season in punjab and in sindh and also in the kharif season in sindh deliveries increased in a few newer canal commands the actual evapotranspiration generally increased in punjab and decreased slightly in sindh the magnitude of the increases in actual evapotranspiration differed between the remotely sensed etlook and cmrset estimates the unaccounted outflows and inflows showed both positive and negative trends with positive trends more common using eta etlook 2 the assessment of trends in groundwater levels and in the balance term unaccounted outflows and inflows shows that the water use is becoming less sustainable in several canal commands especially in punjab the trend to a less sustainable position results particularly from water use in the rabi season the trend towards a less sustainable position however does not indicate the current sustainability status 3 the major components of the surface water balance are inflows of canal water in punjab and sindh plus rainfall in the northern parts of punjab and outflows of actual evapotranspiration the actual evapotranspiration estimate differed for the etlook and cmrset methods by about 10 in punjab and 1 in sindh for the year in which direct estimates are available from both methods changing groundwater storage is a small part of the water balance though it is nevertheless critical as a supply of water for irrigating crops at crucial times 4 measured and readily estimated components of the surface water balance in the canal commands of pakistan amount to between 80 and 90 of the water balance components with unaccounted inflows

10316,the indus basin irrigation system ibis of pakistan is a major user of surface and groundwater and provides food and economic security for about 207 million people to assess the impact of agricultural development on water resources we developed surface water balances for its canal commands and examined trends from 1981 82 to 2012 13 in this semi arid environment crop water use is the major water balance term we estimated it by computing actual evapotranspiration eta from two different remote sensing methods etlook and cmrset to account for method uncertainty net groundwater use was a small component of the water balance in most canal commands particularly in the sindh province the measured or estimated known terms in the water balance did not result in its closure and a balance term of unaccounted outflows and inflows was required to close it measured and readily estimated components amounted to 80 90 of the water balance components with unaccounted inflows and outflows accounting for the remaining 10 20 of the measured water balance terms rainfall showed no statistically significant trend in any canal command whereas canal deliveries decreased significantly in many canal commands overall eta generally increased in punjab and decreased slightly in sindh the magnitude of the increases in eta differed between the etlook and cmrset estimates the historical trends in the balance term unaccounted outflows and inflows together with falling groundwater levels show that water use is becoming less sustainable in several canal commands especially in the punjab province the trend to a less sustainable position results particularly from water use in the dry rabi season keywords irrigation water use water accounting unaccounted outflows and inflows sustainable use trends remote sensing 1 introduction increasing withdrawals of water from rivers and associated groundwater systems has led to concerns about the sustainability of irrigated agriculture and environment around the world particularly in arid and semi arid regions time series distributed water accounting and water balance studies can provide critical information which can help evaluate the impact of historical water resources development and policies on irrigated agriculture and the environment and explore management options numerous water balance studies have been conducted at multiple temporal and spatial scales across the globe to quantify unknown water balance terms such as irrigation application droogers et al 2010 brocca et al 2018 groundwater use ruud et al 2004 ahmad et al 2005 martínez santos and martínez alfaro 2010 liu et al 2016 peña arancibia et al 2020a and explore water management and policy options sharma 1999 le roux et al 2017 immerzeel and bierkens 2012 conducted basin scale water balance analysis for large river basins in asia and identified broad concerns for sustainable water use and options to address a growing water scarcity this analysis highlighted the transboundary indus river basin as one of most vulnerable river basins in asia pakistan is the lower riparian country and holds the indus basin irrigation system ibis the largest contiguous irrigation system in the world and food bowl of the nation the water resources of the ibis are almost fully utilised with irrigation being the main use groundwater in particular is over committed with unsustainable use in parts of the upstream province of punjab briscoe and qamar 2005 ahmad et al 2007 archer et al 2010 qureshi et al 2010 kirby et al 2017 in this large irrigated system 160 000 km2 with complex water sharing rules brochmann 2012 sarfraz 2013 anwar and bhatti 2018 parts of the basin have different challenges on the use of groundwater and achieving sustainable water use ahmad et al 2014 basharat et al 2014 in the downstream province of sindh groundwater use is limited because of salinity and waterlogging is a major constraint to crop production in the upstream province of punjab particularly in the northernmost part rainfall is greater than in sindh and canal deliveries of irrigation water per unit area are correspondingly less where the groundwater is fresh it is heavily used and groundwater levels are falling implying unsustainable use and also risking saline water contamination from brackish groundwater pockets this is of concern because pakistan s increasing population will require more food implying the use of more water for irrigation which in the absence of other developments would require ever more unsustainable use of groundwater kirby et al 2017 motivated by the concerns for food security and sustainable water use in pakistan our aim is to examine regional differences in water availability and demand identify trends in the water balance and highlight canal commands on less sustainable trajectories from the canal command water balances we then build up a regional and national picture this paper focuses on the recent historic 1981 82 to 2012 13 agricultural development impacts on the water balance several studies have estimated water balances in the indus basin of pakistan many assessed the water balance of the whole basin in pakistan and did not separately identify water balances for provinces or finer scales such as canal commands or administrative districts whole of basin estimates include bastiaanssen et al 2012 cheema 2012 cheema et al 2014 hussain et al 2011 karimi et al 2013 and young et al 2019 and bastiaanssen et al 2003 for the ibis it is worth noting that all the estimates above were for a single year or an average year kirby et al 2017 assessed the trends from 1960 to 2010 of the main terms of a whole of basin water balance of the irrigated areas of the indus in pakistan azad et al 2003 assessed the water balance for an average year in the sindh province and zaidi et al 2019 made a comprehensive study of the water balance of sindh for the rabi seasons of 2017 18 and 2018 19 and the kharif season of 2018 basharat et al 2014 described groundwater levels and canal deliveries for many canal commands but did not give an overall water balance while basharat et al 2014 presented trends in groundwater levels the study did not give quantitative trend information for other aspects of the water balance simons et al 2020 described components of the water balance presented as annual averages including estimates of non consumptive use of irrigation water that is water which is recycled as a return flow for the canal commands of the indus basin in pakistan several studies assessed the water balance for selected canal commands or areas of particular interest often over several years hassan and bhutta 1995 kijne 1996 khan et al 1999 whole of basin remote sensing estimates of the spatial and temporal variation over a year of actual evapotranspiration one of the main components of the water balance have been assessed in several studies bastiaanssen et al 2012 cheema 2012 liaqat et al 2015 the estimates have been used to develop basin wide water balances e g karimi et al 2013 kirby et al 2017 but again apply only to a single year and therefore cannot assess trends no study that we know of has assessed long term trends in the water balance at a scale such as a canal command over the whole of the indus irrigation areas in pakistan in this paper we examine the historical annual and seasonal kharif and rabi seasons the wet summer season and the dry winter season water balances in the canal commands in the ibis below the two large 5 km3 storage multipurpose tarbela and mangla dams see fig 1 of pakistan from 1981 to 2012 the water balance comprises inflows in the form of rainfall and canal deliveries outflows mainly as actual evapotranspiration estimated by two different remote sensing methods with dissimilar conceptualisations see section 2 2 and changes to groundwater levels these components of the water balance are all directly measured or readily assessed from direct measurements focussing on the known components of the water balance leads to an assessment of unaccounted inflows and outflows kirby et al 2008a 2008b van dijk et al 2008 2009 and hence an assessment of the uncertainty in the water balance this approach is similar to the water balance closure approaches using remote sensed water balance components of oliveira et al 2014 who noted that while there is uncertainty in the estimates it is a useful way to evaluate trends over large regions in their case the also semi arid brazilian cerrado through the water balance approach we will show that the inflows generally do not match the outflows in any canal command for either set of actual evapotranspiration estimates implying uncertainty in the measured and estimated terms of the water balance we will further note that the uncertainty cannot be reconciled by water balance modelling we assess the residual unknown components unaccounted inflows and outflows of the water balance after the readily estimated components are accounted for notwithstanding the uncertainty in the water balance useful insights emerge from the assessment of the known components their variation amongst canal commands and provinces and their temporal trends for the kharif and rabi seasons we discuss the water balance in light of the trends in crop areas in the canal commands this study is as far as we know unique in presenting water balances and identifying trends in the water balances for all the canal commands of the main irrigated area of the ibis in the main paper we describe the analysis based on cmrset csiro modis rescaled evapotranspiration actual evapotranspiration estimates eta cmrset for the ibis peña arancibia et al 2020b in the supplementary information we give the main results for an analysis based on the etlook method bastiaanssen et al 2012 cheema 2012 of actual evapotranspiration estimates eta etlook the two different remote sensing methods resulted in different actual evapotranspiration estimates but led to the same overall conclusions regarding water balances and uncertainty 2 methods 2 1 study area the study area is shown in fig 1 and comprises the ibis canal commands of punjab and sindh plus the pat and desert canal commands of balochistan which receive water from barrages that supply other canal commands in sindh the climate of this region is semi arid and typically represents low lying interior of the indo pakistan sub continent rainfall and temperature show large seasonal fluctuations within the basin the summer is long and hot lasting from april through to september with maximum air temperature ranging from 21 c and 49 c winter lasts from december through to february with maximum air temperature ranging from 25 c to 27 c during the day and sometimes falling below zero at night the monsoon elapses from june to september and accounts for about 75 of annual rainfall coinciding with the peak river flows in a hydrological year i e 1st april 31st march mean annual rainfall varies from 76 mm in the rice canal command in central sindh to 875 mm in the upper jhelum canal command in north eastern punjab due to scanty and erratic rainfall year round agriculture is only possible through irrigation which is supplied through an intensive network of public two large supply dams tarbela capacity of 7 38 km3 in 2020 and mangla capacity of 9 08 km3 in 2018 a network of regulating infrastructure consisting of the small chashma dam capacity of 0 34 km3 and 15 head works 12 inter river link canals and 48 irrigation canals fig 1 based on time series inflow data from april 1976 to march 2020 the ibis in pakistan has a mean annual headwater inflow of about 167 km3 almost 71 of the mean annual flow of the river network is diverted for agricultural and domestic use purpose the indus and its tributaries supply about 60 of the total water used for irrigation indus river system authority irsa unpublished data from 2020 the rest is groundwater predominantly in the fresh groundwater quality regions of punjab and small isolated pockets of sindh province ahmad et al 2014 the prevailing temperature and rainfall patterns govern two distinct cropping seasons kharif april to september and rabi october to march wheat and fodder are the dominant crops during the dry rabi winter season among other crops cotton rice maize and fodder are produced during the wet kharif summer season whereas sugarcane is an annual crop 2 2 water balance assessment we used the surface water balance approach of ahmad 2002 and ahmad et al 2005 that quantifies net groundwater use using the canal command as a modelling unit in this approach the net groundwater use in an irrigation area i ngw could be computed as the deficit implied by a water balance of the land surface given by 1 i ngw et a p n i cw dw dt where et a is the water lost by evapotranspiration of crops and other vegetation p n is the water gained from precipitation considered as a net term after outflows to runoff i cw is the diversion of water into the area via canals and dw dt is the change in water stored in the area in the soil but also in other surface storages over the period being considered the advantage of the surface water balance approach is that it does not require detailed groundwater modelling or assessment and does not require information or assumptions about lateral groundwater flows ahmad et al 2005 applied the method to the rechna doab region of pakistan using spatially explicit estimates of et a derived from remotely sensed satellite data here we modify the idea slightly to look at a lumped canal command surface water balance given by supply and demand terms 2 0 et a p n i cw i ngw b where b is an unaccounted difference term equivalent to the depth of water required to set the right hand side of the equation to zero the equation is one dimensional and all terms are given as equivalent depths of water et a can be directly estimated from remote sensing observations p n and i cw can be directly measured i ngw is the net groundwater use we estimated i ngw as the change in groundwater storage which can be calculated directly from observed changes in groundwater levels and values of specific yield if the groundwater recharge and discharge is strictly one dimensional this calculation is correct though the estimates may nevertheless be subject to measurement error note that i ngw can be either a positive or negative term depending on whether the groundwater level decreases adding water to the land surface water balance i e net groundwater use or increases i e withdrawing water from the land surface water balance i e net groundwater recharge most recharge of the groundwater occurs through rainfall in the north of the basin and seepage from the distributed canal network and irrigated fields khan et al 2017 bonsor et al 2017 and so is largely one dimensional any subsurface lateral flows in the groundwater appear as an unaccounted outflow or gain in the balance term in the case of sustainable groundwater use i ngw would be zero over the long term and in such a case the groundwater use would equal recharge if the groundwater recharge and extraction is strictly one dimensional this calculation is correct subject to measurement error the difference or balance term is a composite term that includes unaccounted outflows and inflows such as surface runoff or lateral subsurface flows that contribute to the change in groundwater levels plus observation errors in all the other terms the smaller the balance terms across the canal commands are relative to other terms the higher the confidence in the estimate of the water balances in modifying eq 1 to derive eq 2 the soil water storage term dw dt is absent and is implicit in the difference or balance term b the water balances were assessed for each month and then aggregated to seasonal rabi and kharif and annual balances in an annual water balance over the long term dw dt is likely to be near zero 2 3 data sources we performed a monthly water balance assessment for 1981 to 2013 using the following datasets daily observed unpublished climate data was obtained from pakistan meteorological department and water and power development authority wapda the daily data were interpolated using anusplin hutchinson 1998 and aggregated to monthly seasonal kharif and rabi and annual totals for the ibis remotely sensed estimates of ten daily actual evapotranspiration by peña arancibia et al 2020b based on the cmrset method guerschman et al 2009 sampled and aggregated to seasonal and annual totals for the canal command areas of punjab and sindh eta cmrset the estimates are for 2000 to 2013 and were extrapolated to earlier years using the fitted regression line for 2000 to 2013 to project the trend to earlier years with the average monthly deviation from the trend superimposed in the main body of the paper we describe the analysis using eta cmrset because they have the longer period of observation and a shorter period of extrapolation than the eta etlook estimates described below besides an evaluation against both field and remotely sensed data conducted in the ibis context see peña arancibia et al 2020b cmrset has been positively evaluated in several water assessment modelling studies and for different climates van dijk et al 2011 paca et al 2019 peña arancibia et al 2016 2020a weerasinghe et al 2020 we repeated the analysis using a second set of remotely sensed estimates of daily actual evapotranspiration based on the etlook method bastiaanssen et al 2012 cheema 2012 cheema et al 2014 sampled and aggregated to seasonal and annual totals for ibis the repeated analysis is described in the supplementary information the estimates are for 2007 and were extrapolated to other years by ahmad et al 2019 the extrapolation method used for eta cmrset could not be used for eta etlook where only one year of observation was available therefore the extrapolation was based on the changes in irrigated areas see section 2 4 and changes in potential evapotranspiration the results of the analysis using eta etlook are described in the supplementary information canal deliveries for 1981 to 2013 are based on time series ten daily and monthly flow data for the barrages and canals of the indus basin irrigation system wapda wrmd 2014 additional daily flow data for 1990 to 2010 obtained from the punjab and the sindh irrigation departments was used to cross compare the ten daily data and disaggregate barrage level irrigation diversion data for sindh into the canal commands the canal deliveries were aggregated to seasonal and annual totals groundwater depths unpublished data were obtained from wapda and interpolated and spatially averaged for each canal command and then fitted with a regression line the groundwater level change is taken as that assessed from the trend over the period the change in the groundwater component of the water balance is the groundwater level change multiplied by the specific yield which accounts for the fact that groundwater occupies the pore space in the rocks which is a modest fraction of the overall volume more technically specific yield is the ratio of a unit depth withdrawal of water to the depth of groundwater level change the actual specific yield and its variation are not known for the canal commands and we used a default but reasonable value of 0 1 we shall discuss the specific yield assumption in the results 2 4 trends in cropped areas and water balance terms trends in cropped areas were performed by fitting a linear regression to the time series district data collated in ahmad et al 2019 remapped to canal commands using the method in kirby and ahmad 2016 trends in annual rainfall actual evapotranspiration and canal deliveries were estimated by fitting a linear regression of the annual totals as a function of time years the groundwater storage change is taken from the calculation referred to above of the regression of groundwater level change multiplied by specific yield 3 results 3 1 trends in cropped area the canal commands of the main irrigated areas in punjab balochistan and sindh differ in the mix of crops grown fig 2 all canal commands have a large proportion of their cropped area sown to winter cereals mainly wheat and nearly all have some rice though in some cases the area is small cotton is an important crop in many canal commands of the punjab and sindh but is virtually absent in canal commands such as upper chenab canal ucc in the punjab and north west nwc in sindh pulses are grown in nearly all districts but are particularly important in thal and greater thal gtc in the punjab whereas oilseeds are important in fuleli and pinyari in sindh fodder occupies large areas in many canal commands in the punjab particularly gugera gug jhang jhg lower bari doab canal lbdc and lower jhelum canal ljc the areas of different crops increased with similar proportions of crop types from 1981 82 to 2012 13 in most canal commands in the punjab except marala ravi mr int and brbd raya whereas the areas generally decreased in sindh fig 2 the overall increase in irrigated area over the period was about 15 in the punjab whereas sindh experienced about a 15 decline based on these data we will generally expect increases in evapotranspiration in most canal commands in the punjab but little change or slight decreases in the canal commands in sindh 3 2 annual average water balances in this section we present the overall water balances of the canal commands as the annual average of 1981 82 to 2012 13 in the following section we will present the trends in the annual water balances the annual average water balances are shown in fig 3 for eta cmrset and in fig s6 for eta etlook time series water balance components are presented in the supplementary information rainfall fig s1 canal deliveries fig s2 groundwater level fig s3 seasonal actual evapotranspiration s4 and s8 respectively for eta cmrset and eta etlook and seasonal balance terms figs s5 and s9 respectively associated with eta cmrset and eta etlook the actual evapotranspiration estimates from the two methods differ and as a consequence the balance term differs we will discuss the differences in the discussion section below the rainfall canal delivery and groundwater change terms are the same in fig 3 and s6 since these terms are independent of the evapotranspiration estimation method in fig 3 the net groundwater contribution to the surface water balance in most canal commands is too small to be visible at the scale of the graphs while the net groundwater use is small the gross amount of groundwater pumped is large in much of the ibis e g qureshi 2020 we will discuss this issue in the discussion below this is readily seen by considering as an example a fall in groundwater over a whole canal command of 10 m over the whole period which with a specific yield of 0 1 would equate to a removal of 1 m of water over 30 years this is equivalent to about 33 mm per year which is much smaller than the other terms in the canal command water balances generally even where there are local large reductions in groundwater level they are not seen over a whole canal command and annual average changes are therefore generally small this general result will not be changed by different plausible assumptions for the specific yield a small positive net groundwater contribution to the water balance is just visible for lower mailsi pakpattan lm lpc in punjab where net groundwater use contributes 3 9 of the total water supply a positive groundwater contribution indicates groundwater use and consequently declining groundwater levels this canal command has the greatest groundwater level decline equivalent to a groundwater supply to the surface i ngw of about 52 mm per year the next largest decline is in upc umc ubc upc in punjab and is equivalent to a supply to the surface of about 25 mm per year also just visible are small negative contributions i e net recharge for crbc in punjab equivalent to 2 2 of the total supply becoming net recharge and begari 1 5 net recharge desert 2 1 net recharge and pat feeder pfc 2 7 net recharge in sindh and balochistan begari is in sindh the other two in balochistan the rise in groundwater level in the desert canal command is equivalent to an outflow from the surface presumably by deep percolation i e net recharge of about 47 mm per year in all other canal command contributions net groundwater use is smaller mostly substantially smaller than those noted above in figs 3 and s6 the residual balance term plotted in red is a composite term comprising any errors in the other terms plus unaccounted outflows and inflows in the surface water balance such as surface runoff or lateral subsurface flows that contribute to the change in groundwater levels in most canal commands rainfall plus canal deliveries plus any contribution from groundwater exceed the estimated actual evapotranspiration leading to a negative balance term the magnitude of the balance term is generally less than the rainfall canal delivery or actual evapotranspiration terms in punjab though generally larger than the rainfall term in the drier province of sindh the balance term as a percentage of the sum of the absolute values of the measured terms is 7 1 in punjab and 12 7 in sindh for eta cmrset the corresponding values for eta etlook are 13 2 and 16 3 in punjab and sindh respectively 3 3 trends in water balances in this section based on time series trends in individual water balance components presented in the supplementary information we present the trends in the annual water balances fig 4 note that the groundwater contribution to the surface water balance is based on a regression of the changing groundwater levels over the period therefore it is a single constant and does not have a trend the average annual rainfall increased marginally over the study period in both punjab and sindh and balochistan by about 1 mm per year in punjab the increase was all in the kharif season fig s1a though some canal commands such as the upper jhelum canal ujc int experienced decreases in sindh and balochistan about half the increase about 0 5 mm per year was in the kharif season fig s1a again with small decreases in some canal commands such as fuleli in the rabi season the rainfall in punjab did not increase over the period fig s1b whereas in sindh and balochistan there was an increase similar to that in kharif however none of the regressions are significant at the 5 confidence level the annual canal deliveries decreased in punjab at a rate equivalent to about 1 9 mm per year across the canal commands of the province and also in sindh and balochistan at about 3 9 mm per year fig 4 the regressions are significant at the 5 confidence level the decrease in annual deliveries is mostly due to decreases in rabi canal deliveries in both punjab by an average of 2 3 mm per year over the area of the canal commands equivalent to 71 mm over the 31 year period which is a decrease of nearly one third and sindh and balochistan 2 7 mm per year equivalent to 84 mm or about one quarter fig s2b the regressions are significant at the 1 confidence level rabi canal deliveries are highly dependent on releases of stored water this decreasing trend in rabi is partly due to a reduction in available surface water storage within pakistan due to dam sedimentation and partly due to a reduction in basin inflows resulting from gradual upstream development outside of pakistan the canal deliveries decreased in some canal commands in both provinces 12 significant decreases in punjab 6 in sindh and balochistan and increased in a few 5 significant in punjab 2 in sindh and balochistan as shown in fig 4 some of the increases such as the pat feeder pfc in balochistan are due to a new canal command development as expected from the province level result described above the canal deliveries generally decreased more in the rabi season than in the kharif fig s2a and s2b the trends in annual eta cmrset shown in fig 4 and were not significant at the provincial level they were significant in only one canal command in punjab where gug had an increase in actual evapotranspiration in contrast 9 canal commands in sindh and balochistan had a significant trend 4 with an increase in actual evapotranspiration and 5 with a decrease annual eta etlook showed larger trends than cmrset at the province level punjab showed a statistically significant increase of 4 2 mm per year while the trend was not significant in sindh and balochistan on the other hand 24 canal commands in punjab had statistically significant increases 5 level or greater and none had decreases fig s4 in sindh and balochistan 3 canal commands showed a significant increase in annual eta etlook and 5 show a decrease 5 level or greater fig 4 the seasonal results follow the annual pattern with few statistically significant trends in eta cmrset fig s4 whereas in eta etlook there were 25 kharif and 20 rabi statistically significant increases 5 level or greater in punjab no canal command showed a significant decrease fig s8 in sindh and balochistan 2 canal commands had a significant increase in eta etlook in kharif and 2 showed a decrease 5 level or greater in rabi 1 showed an increase in kharif and 2 showed a decrease fig s8 punjab as a whole showed an increase of 2 7 mm per year in kharif in eta etlook and an increase of 1 5 mm per year in rabi both trends are significant at the 1 confidence level sindh and balochistan showed decreases in both kharif and rabi though neither trend was statistically significant the trends in the annual balance term b in eq 2 were not significant at the province level except for eta etlook in punjab which had a positive trend figs 4 and s7 at the canal command level the trends in b were generally significant when the trends in one or both of the canal deliveries and actual evapotranspiration were significant figs 4 and s7 b generally increased when canal deliveries decreased and vice versa and decreased when actual evapotranspiration decreased as expected from the larger actual evapotranspiration trends for eta etlook the trends in the balance term were also greater the seasonal trends were consistent with the annual trends being greater for eta etlook figs s5 and s9 4 discussion the water balance assessments made here are based on the surface water balance approach of ahmad 2002 and ahmad et al 2005 we extend their method to look at a long time series of the main surface water balance terms and hence estimate trends we also extend their method to explicitly determine a balance term which includes the unaccounted inflows and outflows as well as any errors in the terms which can be directly estimated we will discuss below that trends in the balance term are helpful in assessing sustainable water use the advantage of our method is that it uses directly observed water balance terms and does not rely on complex hydrological models simons et al 2020 also point out the benefits of direct approaches that avoid complex hydrological models however their approach nevertheless relies on some assumptions regarding the application of the budyko hypothesis in order to partition the water balance our approach avoids even these assumptions our approach can be applied to any irrigation area for which the main inflows and outflows to the surface water balance can be directly observed or readily estimated we will discuss below that information on rainfall canal deliveries actual evapotranspiration and net groundwater use may comprise most of the water balance in large irrigation areas on relatively flat land as is the case in the indus basin 4 1 trends in supply and demand notwithstanding the uncertainties in the water balance trends in individual water balance components provide useful insights see also oliveira et al 2014 rainfall increased slightly in most canal commands over the study period except in the rabi season in punjab but the trends were not statistically significant on the other hand except for increases associated with newly developed commands canal deliveries decreased in punjab in the rabi season and decreased in both kharif and rabi in sindh and balochistan groundwater levels declined in some canal commands of punjab representing a supply of water to the surface water balance as i ngw new canal commands saw increases in groundwater levels representing an outflow from the surface water balance as deep percolation i e negative i ngw indicating net recharge in sindh groundwater levels generally changed little the major water balance outflow component actual evapotranspiration increased in most canal commands of punjab and in punjab overall in line with increased areas of irrigated cropping this trend was less pronounced in the cmrset results which covered the later part of the period from 2000 to 2013 when areas of irrigated crops did not expand as much in many canal commands fig 2 in sindh canal commands the actual evapotranspiration changed little or decreased in line with the modest declines in the areas of irrigated crops note that there are extreme cases in which reported crop areas and remotely sensed actual evapotranspiration estimates may diverge this is because crop areas are reported using harvested acreage kirby and ahmad 2016 whereas remote sensing algorithms like cmrset would include all types of vegetative land cover to report actual evapotranspiration estimates for example floods can result in lower than average reported acreage due to crop damage but higher than average evapotranspiration due to the presence of standing water simons et al 2020 point out that about half on average across the canal commands of the water supplied by irrigation is not consumed as evapotranspiration much of that is a return flow to groundwater as shown also by ahmad et al 2005 karimi et al 2013 which is then available for re use simons et al 2020 in our water balance we consider the net groundwater use and thus do not show the large groundwater return flows 4 2 implications for sustainable water use unsustainable water use is often assessed on the basis of falling groundwater levels however zhou 2009 showed that falling groundwater levels are alone insufficient to determine whether the use is sustainable or unsustainable with increased pumping the groundwater level may be adjusting to some new sustainable equilibrium here we show that trends in the balance term may also provide additional evidence as noted above when the inflows from rainfall canal deliveries and any supply from groundwater exceed the outflows to estimated actual evapotranspiration a negative balance term in other words additional unaccounted outflow is required to balance the known inflows and the outflows a positive trend in the balance term from more negative to less negative is a trend from a larger excess of inflows over outflows to a smaller excess of inflows over outflows in other words a positive trend in the balance term can be viewed as a trend to a less sustainable position table 1 shows the canal commands in which the trends of both the groundwater levels and the balance term are statistically significant in these canal commands an interpretation of sustainable or unsustainable water use may be more reliable than an interpretation based on the changing groundwater level alone as shown in the table we may distinguish four possible cases but only three are represented amongst the canal commands a rising trend in groundwater levels and a falling trend in the balance term b indicating a trend to a greater excess of water is present in crbc p and pfc this situation if left unchecked potentially could lead to shallow water tables accompanied by waterlogging and salinity problems falling groundwater and falling b represented by haveli act in opposite directions the trend in b is to an excess of water which could counteract the falling groundwater levels the largest group with a number of canal commands in punjab has falling groundwater levels and a rising b indicating a trend to a greater deficit of water the situation in this group appears unsustainable as noted in the table three canal commands in this group muzaffargarh dadu and kec have statistically significant falling groundwater levels but the actual magnitude of decrease is too small to be of concern as shown in fig s3 punjab province overall also has falling groundwater levels and a rising b but again the magnitude of the fall in groundwater levels is small fig s3 eta etlook led to more canal commands being classified as potentially unsustainable than did eta cmrset a similar count of statistically significant trends for kharif and rabi with the balance term based on eta cmrset in fig s4 and eta etlook in fig 9 suggests that unsustainable trends are more pronounced in the rabi season than the kharif thus it appears reasonable to conclude that in a number of canal commands particularly in punjab the groundwater use is trending to an unsustainable position and that this generally results more from water use in the rabi season than the kharif this reinforces the conclusions of other studies such as briscoe and qamar 2005 archer et al 2010 qureshi et al 2010 ahmad et al 2014 kirby et al 2017 that point to a potential unsustainable water use in punjab however whereas the trend indicates whether water use in a canal command is becoming more or less unsustainable it does not indicate whether it is actually unsustainable at present the uncertainties in the water balances preclude such a definitive assessment as noted above the net groundwater use in most canal commands is quite small relative to rainfall and or canal deliveries it follows that a small change to one of the other water balance components could result in a large change to the net groundwater use hartmann et al 2017 thus small changes to water use or canal deliveries could result in large differences to the sustainability of groundwater use a practical conclusion from this finding is that modest reallocations of canal water amongst canal commands could substantially reduce the impact of local over use of groundwater 4 3 uncertainties in the overall water balance there are several sources of uncertainty in the canal command water balances including estimation errors in the rainfall canal deliveries groundwater change and evapotranspiration the uncertainties in and differences between the eta cmrset and eta etlook the method of extrapolating the actual evapotranspiration to years in which it was not directly estimated and in processes such as subsurface lateral flows that are not directly estimated eta cmrset and eta etlook were both directly estimated for 2007 in which year there are no extrapolation effects as shown in the supplementary information and fig s10 eta cmrset was 10 greater than eta etlook in punjab and 1 greater in sindh with more variation at the canal command level the unaccounted outflows and inflows resulting from processes not directly estimated plus the estimation errors are lumped together in the balance term which at the province level varies from 13 2 to 16 3 of the known terms in punjab and sindh for etlook and 7 1 and 12 7 for cmrset this suggests that we have information on perhaps 80 90 of the surface water balance terms this compares favourably to the 69 of measured or readily estimated water balance components for the rivers of the murray darling basin van dijk et al 2009 wang et al 2014 found the monthly water imbalance of 16 large drainage basins in canada was on average 30 of the corresponding monthly rainfall even in a small heavily instrumented watershed flerchinger and cooley 2000 found that water balance errors unaccounted outflows and inflows in the terminology used here amounted to about 10 of the rainfall within some individual canal commands however the balance term unaccounted components and errors is a much greater fraction of the water balance in some cases the large balance term may have a simple explanation the kalri canal command in sindh has a large unaccounted balance term however water from the kalri canal which supplies the canal command is also diverted to karachi city as noted also by simons et al 2020 this accounts for approximately one third of the unaccounted balance term in other cases large unaccounted balance terms have no obvious explanation 5 conclusions we conclude that 1 amongst the major components of the water balance rainfall shows no statistically significant trend from 1981 82 to 2012 13 in any canal command canal deliveries decreased significantly both statistically and in terms of proportionate decrease in many canal commands in the rabi season in punjab and in sindh and also in the kharif season in sindh deliveries increased in a few newer canal commands the actual evapotranspiration generally increased in punjab and decreased slightly in sindh the magnitude of the increases in actual evapotranspiration differed between the remotely sensed etlook and cmrset estimates the unaccounted outflows and inflows showed both positive and negative trends with positive trends more common using eta etlook 2 the assessment of trends in groundwater levels and in the balance term unaccounted outflows and inflows shows that the water use is becoming less sustainable in several canal commands especially in punjab the trend to a less sustainable position results particularly from water use in the rabi season the trend towards a less sustainable position however does not indicate the current sustainability status 3 the major components of the surface water balance are inflows of canal water in punjab and sindh plus rainfall in the northern parts of punjab and outflows of actual evapotranspiration the actual evapotranspiration estimate differed for the etlook and cmrset methods by about 10 in punjab and 1 in sindh for the year in which direct estimates are available from both methods changing groundwater storage is a small part of the water balance though it is nevertheless critical as a supply of water for irrigating crops at crucial times 4 measured and readily estimated components of the surface water balance in the canal commands of pakistan amount to between 80 and 90 of the water balance components with unaccounted inflows and outflows accounting for the remaining 10 20 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

10317,climate change requires mediterranean farms to maintain adequate profitability while adapting to the increase in water needs of crops the growth of water demand for non agricultural users and the reduction of resource availability we use discrete stochastic programming models of three italian farming areas to simulate the adaptation paths of their farm types to changes in yields and irrigation needs of crops that climate change could generate at 2030 this is done in a context of progressive decrease of water availability we condense the adaptation choices attributed by the optimization process to the farm types by means of indicators of value produced per water cubic meter and per hectare we use those indicators in a quadratic regression analysis to explain the change in the hourly wages of family labour which represents the farm resources profitability the examination of the resulting elasticity indices outlines the adaptation paths impact on farm profitability this integrated analysis of optimization models and econometric regression shows that the core of italian cow milk production based on medium high intensity forage systems adapts better instead available technologies and structural features provide much narrower margins to livestock farms based on intensive forage production and conversely to more extensive livestock systems crop farms adapt by reducing labour use in less profitable activities which boosts family hourly wages but increases unemployment furthermore the surface of some crops can be expanded because their cycle takes place in months in which the availability of water decreases less and their irrigation requirement increases less however the low productivity of these crops does not allow to increase wages for family labour the results on farms overall profitability derive from an integrated analysis of changes in water resources productivity soil and labor mathematical programming outlines the adaptation paths that maximize farming incomes the econometric analysis indicates whether those paths support profitability favouring farm economic sustainability keywords farms adaptation paths to climate change irrigation water availability discrete stochastic programming econometric analysis farm family labor profitability 1 introduction an important body of scientific literature lionello and scarascia 2018 and garcía garizábal et al 2014 among others suggests that the pathways for adapting mediterranean agriculture to climate change cc should be assessed based on scenarios of reduced water availability and increased demand still evaluating the possible influence of cc on water availability is complex and requires analysing the hydrological balance and local interactions between the geophysical and climatic conditions 1 1 furthermore water supply often does not depend on the resource balance at the local level and the impact of the cc on it and this complicates the analysis for instance in many mediterranean areas due to local water scarcity the demand is met with notable water transfers between different river basins dono et al 2019 provide an overview of water exchanges between regions and river basins in southern italy showing that on different routes it exceeds the order of magnitude of hundreds of millions of cubic meters per year similarly the joint effect of climate forcing and institutional and technical constraints on the water demand of many users is complex to specify several research projects are developed in this context to analyze the possible impact of the cc on italian farming and identify adaptation options the agroscenari www agroscenari it macsur www macsur eu and department of excellence www unitus it projects among other activities have developed interdisciplinary research in three areas with very diverse productive patterns to represent many italian farming conditions the results of climatic agronomic and zootechnical studies were integrated into territorial economic models of mathematical programming mp to simulate the impact of the future climate and the adaptation options of the main farm types in these areas yet the results generated by this vast integration are to be considered partial because these projects budgets did not allow involving scientific skills on complex issues of change in the hydrological balance of the areas as well as in the non farming water demand in this analysis we treat these shortcomings by using the same models to simulate the impacts of a cc that progressively reduces water availability while increasing irrigation needs and modifying the yield of some widespread crops the various simulations modify the levels of production employment and income acting differently on the farm types in the three areas we study the adaptation paths of the farms by means of indicators that synthesize the production choices emerged in the various mp simulations and using their values in a regression analysis that explains the changes in income per unit of family labour in this way we identify the choices that support and those that depress the value of this profitability index we believe that the relationship between adaptation paths and profitability of family farm labour is crucial for long term economic and social sustainability since most italian farms are family owned and managed van vliet et al 2015 the steps forward over previous analyses dono et al 2016 cortignani et al 2018 are the extension of the study to multiple areas with very different production patterns and the use of a regression analysis to summarize the adaptive responses to the many mp simulations the next section reviews the recent scientific literature on the cc impact on water availability and demand in the mediterranean area as well as on farms adaptation paths a materials and methods section follows it first recovers the main legacies of the agroscenari project showing study areas productive conditions as well as approaches models and some results on agricultural responses to the cc impact second reports the cc simulations of the new analysis the indicators outlining farm management choices as well as the approach that used these indicators to identify strategies of adaptation to cc a results section describes the adaptation paths emerged from this analysis the last sections discuss the results and conclude the examination 2 literature overview various studies show that climate change should reduce and alter water availability regimes in the mediterranean basin according to garcía ruiz et al 2011 the natural variability of the climatic series in this area and in its specific sectors including italy already during the twentieth century shows long term trends of temperature increases and decreases in rainfall these trends linked to the greater drops in snowfall and snow cover and to the anticipation of the melting of snow reduce the water availability of river courses in spring and make it more irregular in winter increasing uncertainty about it mcmillan et al 2016 gobiet et al 2014 climate models confirm these trends for the 21 st century according to lionello and scarascia 2018 the annual warming rate of the mediterranean area could be 20 above the global average with peaks above 50 in summer and in the continental areas north of the basin the further decline in rainfall could further reduce the accumulation of winter water in the artificial reservoirs of the southern mediterranean the increased inter annual variability of summer may be associated with an increased presence of extreme weather events giorgi and lionello 2008 the adaptation to this context must be examined considering that all uses of water could increase in parallel zachariadis 2010 rochdane et al 2012 and berredjem and hani 2017 argue that non agricultural uses and global demand for the resource should increase in various areas of the mediterranean basin however their projections are mainly influenced by population growth rather than by the specific influence of the cc according to wang et al 2017 the change in the rain regime and the increase in temperature could increase the per capita water demand as emerges from evaluating the dynamics of a chinese river basin wang et al 2018 kenney et al 2008 polebitski et al 2011 lott et al 2013 and parandvash and chang 2016 come to similar conclusions on the contrary karamouz et al 2011 studying the use of domestic water in tehran do not foresee major impacts of the cc water uses for industrial cooling and thermoelectric power generation are expected to increase according to köberl et al 2016 albeit slightly on the contrary the demand for water to protect ecological systems should grow steadily piniewski et al 2014 barron et al 2012 spears et al 2013 in addition the cc would contribute to altering the water demand of some mediterranean areas reducing summer tourism and increasing spring and autumn tourism averyt et al 2011 finally studies on the use of water in mediterranean agriculture agree in predicting an appreciable increase garcía garizábal et al 2014 ouda et al 2015 valverde et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 dono et al 2016 according to saadi et al 2015 the anticipation and shortening of the cycle will reduce the irrigation needs of winter wheat and tomatoes in the mediterranean however the decline in rainfall and the increase in evapotranspiration in winter spring could make additional irrigation necessary even for crops fed by rain if water availability is reduced and the general demand for water resources increases it becomes important to define the possible adaptation paths for an important user of water such as agriculture to this end many studies apply mathematical programming models to the agricultural sector of various areas of the mediterranean basin or immediately behind it these studies integrate agronomic and economic models to simulate the impacts of the cc evaluate adaptation options and identify the agricultural systems most exposed to declines in income schönhart et al 2014 dono et al 2016 purola et al 2018 other results highlight the influence of economies of scale irrigation investments and diversification of cultivation schemes and practices varela ortega et al 2011 kahil et al 2015 harmanny and malek 2019 however only a few studies evaluate the impact of these actions on the profitability of agricultural resources and on the ability to remunerate the work of agricultural families at levels comparable to alternative sources which influence the sustainability of farms over time argilés 2001 hennessy et al 2008 smedzik ambrozy et al 2019 the most important study on the links between adaptation pathways and profitability remains reidsma et al 2010 which with an econometric approach assesses the influence of structural characteristics and the climatic and socio economic situation on the performance of farms in 1990 2003 its results show that adaptation to cc is highly influenced by crop rotations and input management as well as by the size of the farm and the intensity of land use our study is in this latter perspective and aims to identify and evaluate the short term adaptation strategies of a variety of types of italian farms in a condition of growing need for irrigation and changes in crop yields combined with a progressive decline in the availability of water this is done by combining optimization models and econometric approaches to evaluate the effects on net income and profitability in particular on the ability to pay for family farm work 3 materials and methods 3 1 basic characteristics of the study areas and data collection the oristano area 54 000 ha in the sardinian center west inea 2014 pp 133 135 140 is divided into two sub zones in the first a water user association wua supplies water from a large dam to potentially irrigate 36 000 ha the dam has a high storage capacity and is used only marginally for hydroelectric drinking industrial use and flood lamination water competition could grow with the building of pipelines to supply southern sardinian areas and the growth of civil and industrial uses due to tourism growth in adjacent areas the main irrigated crops are rice 2700 ha that soil conditions make the only cultivation possible in some sub zones silage maize 5700 ha mainly in succession to ryegrass 3500 ha alfalfa 1800 ha watermelon artichokes and tomatoes 6000 ha citrus fruits vineyards and olive groves 1300 ha durum wheat barley and other rain fed cereals 8000 ha the sardinian dairy cattle breeding largely localizes in this area with a well organized cooperative system for cow milk processing and marketing the second sub zone covers 18 000 ha where the lack of networks connecting the dam limits irrigation to the withdrawing from farm wells linked to the rainfall scarcity this generates a typical mediterranean landscape with most of the land used for pasture 10 000 ha and rain fed cereals 2400 ha dairy sheep farming is common in the zone and involves several small sheep milk processing plants the salerno area extends on 15 000 ha in the sele river catchment from which a wua withdraws the irrigation water inea 2014 pagg 106 108 119 most of sele water is collected at the source to meet the civil uses of puglia with the apulian aqueduct yet tributaries such as the tanagro noticeably increase its downstream flow the agricultural activities are carried out in the vicinity of major urban and touristic areas the area s farmers make also use of groundwater resources both during periods when the wua does not operate and when its water supplies are insufficient to meet irrigation needs mainly in dry summers and springs yet aquifers overexploitation contributes to groundwater salinization given the proximity to the tirreno sea the cropping activity is mainly devoted to vegetable open field 5100 ha and greenhouse 5500 ha fruit trees are also grown 2200 ha as well as forage which is important to feed the buffaloes of local farms whose milk is used to produce mozzarella cheese the cremona and piacenza provinces represent many of the dairy milk farms that produce the grana padano cheese inea 2014pagg 43 47 51 despite common traits of specialization and breeding intensity the cremona dairy milk farms are more intensive and larger based on herd size milk productivity and nutrition features fodder crops are grown in almost all the 68 000 ha studied mainly with long cycle silage corn hybrids 38 000 ha and alfalfa 14 000 ha 6500 ha are cultivated with grain feed crops both irrigated and rain fed the cremona farms are mainly served by a wua that covers 167 500 ha on the other hand piacenza farms obtain water mainly from private wells which limits the average intensity of irrigation and the incidence of irrigated crops on the total farming area compared to cremona yet all the water comes from the po river catchment area that bears a strong competition for drinking water hydroelectric industrial and ecological purposes due to the many activities that take place in the most anthropized and economically developed italian area the farm accountancy information network fadn and direct surveys in each area provided data on the main characteristics of farms oristano and salerno farms were grouped based on their productive specializations and weighted average of their characteristics in each group was assumed to represent the corresponding farm types in cremona piacenza attention was focused only on the dairy sector whose features were defined based on the records of all the individual fadn farms each considered representative of a group as a result 13 farm types hereinafter simply indicated as farms were assumed to represent oristano 9 of which served by the wua 7 farms represent salerno all inside the wua zone the cow s milk production of cremona piacenza is respectively represented by 14 and 9 farms based on the substantial financial resources of the agroscenari and macsur projects the production conditions in the three areas were defined with a very large number of direct interviews to farmers agronomists and leaders of agricultural cooperatives and regional administrations the farmers interviewed were chosen to represent the most common types of farm in the three areas the interviewed technicians were chosen among the most expert on local production conditions based on these interviews the labor water and chemical needs for the various production phases of the crops practiced in the three areas were specified as well as their crops yield in the same way feed requirements of the livestock were specified defining the feed rations actually used in the areas and the milk production these technical data were examined and validated by the members of the local research groups made up of researchers from the departments of agricultural sciences economists agronomists animal scientists and the national research council climatologists the production and input prices were identified using databases in particular the price monthly bulletins of the local chambers of commerce and of the institute of services for the agricultural food market ismea www ismeamercati it to understand the conditions of the local markets interviews were also conducted with local privileged witnesses managers of cooperatives traders and senior executives of the chambers of commerce the existing land labor and water constraints were determined on the basis of the sixth general italian agricultural census on the fadn database and on the general data and the registers of the water user associations of the associated farms 3 2 climate and production data analysis processing and impact of cc dono et al 2016 broadly described the building of the oristano territorial model that integrated climatic agronomic zootechnical statistical and economic analyzes to estimate the impacts of changes in climatic variables the same process was carried out in the cremona piacenza and salerno areas in brief probability distribution functions pdfs of uncertain variables crop and milk yields as well as water requirements were generated both under a scenario of current daily temperatures and rainfall representative of the 2000 2010 climate and under a scenario that applies daily temperature and rainfall estimates for the near future climate forecast in 2020 2030 these values were generated using a modeling chain that describes the potential climatic forcing of atmospheric variability in the study areas as well as the changes due to the expected future concentration of co2 this chain adopts a general circulation model to estimate the large scale atmospheric and oceanic response to the future sres a1b emission scenario this general model guides the regional atmospheric modelling system rams which is applied in the study areas to increase the physical description of the mechanisms on a local scale and therefore to better represent the local variability the results provide climatic scenarios in which albeit with differences among the three areas the increases in future minimum and maximum daily temperatures compared to the present are modest in spring and considerable in summer and autumn winter in addition the number of hot days and heat waves increases significantly in the summer the average rainfall decreases slightly in spring and much in autumn winter while their future variability increases compared to the current one in all seasons note that these differences between current and future conditions reflect the climate change trends of the past 30 years the different temperature and humidity values generate different current and future crop yields and water needs as estimated by the dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer v 4 6 jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2012 and epic environmental policy integrated climate v 0810 williams 1995 models the same applies to the quality and quantity of milk as well as to the mortality of the animals estimated with animal production models in current and future conditions summarized by the temperature and humidity index thindex the pdfs originating from these crop and milk yield values as well as irrigation needs were used to represent farmers expectations on climate variability used as drivers of their economic choice process represented by three discrete stochastic programming dsp models described in appendix a the activities that farmers can choose in our three dsp models imply the selection of the mix of crops varieties or cultivation techniques we attribute the different values of the production and economic variables in the two climatic scenarios to the impact of the cc dono et al 2016 for the purposes of this analysis it is interesting to focus on the main results of the epic and dssat agronomic models used to represent the impacts of the cc in particular table 1 reports the results of the agroscenari study and shows the percentage changes in crop yields and water requirements in the near future scenario over the present in the study areas the dssat model was used only in oristano for rice irrigated barley and durum wheat not irrigated the dotted lines separate its results from those obtained with the epic model used for all other crops also note that the table does not show the changes for the many horticultural and fruit crops which are mainly grown in salerno and oristano the estimation of those yields in the two climatic scenarios was prevented by the limits of the agronomic models used in particular by dssat and by the scarcity of data to calibrate them in addition agronomic models currently fail to determine the qualitative aspects that significantly affect the market price of those crops that s why we limited the analysis of those precious crops to changes in water demand due to temperature increases and rainfall reductions assuming that in the future farmers will continue to irrigate them by integrating evapotranspiration to keep the soil at field capacity therefore the impact of the cc on fruit and vegetable crops was simulated by estimating the pdfs of the etn in the two climatic scenarios calculating the relative variations in the future and proportionally modifying the irrigation needs of each of those crops the hypothesis is that these changes in irrigation requirements allow the yield of those crops to remain unchanged in the near future scenario note that the cc is estimated to have an uneven impact amongst crops and areas reflecting the specific sensitivity of crops and the pedoclimatic conditions of each area only rice crop increases yields more than irrigation needs the silage corn yields vary in different ways depending on the earliness of the hybrid the temperature rise led to a shortening of the growing cycle of the most common hybrids used nowadays fao 600 which resulted in a lower production because of the lower intercepted radiation over the crop cycle a different reaction is expected for the other maize hybrid fao 700 which although to a much lesser extent is also present in the area given the earliness of this hybrid the model predicts that its yield will increase albeit slightly due to a greater interception of radiation during the crop cycle which was simulated in optimal irrigation conditions yet this corresponds to appreciable percentage increases in irrigation needs on the other hand a yield decrease affects the shorter cycle corn hybrid which is widespread in piacenza and oristano yet in oristano this maize is grown in succession to the irrigated ryegrass and this latter shows a strong yield increase combined to a dramatic increase in irrigation needs the ryegrass maize cultivation system is also present to a very limited extent in cremona piacenza where yet the increase in ryegrass yield is much more limited since that crop is rain fed also in that case ryegrass is followed by maize in second harvest which reduces the yield the yield reduction is common to all the rain fed forage crops in oristano as clover and pasture which are relevant for sheep breeding annual average etn grows by 3 2 in oristano by 7 5 in cremona piacenza and by 17 7 in salerno yet these values result from different variations during the year for example a considerable gap was estimated in salerno between a dramatic increase in the etn in january june and a sharp reduction in july december with 60 mean peak increase in the three decades of march and 62 reduction in october as a result the impacts on water needs depend on the period in which crops are cultivated 3 3 the simulated scenarios we re performed the three territorial dsp models first under the current climate scenario then under six diverse future scenarios the latter differ from each other in terms of water availability instead they have the same future yields for herds and crops as well as irrigation needs more specifically the first future scenario cc corresponds to the agroscenari simulation in which the monthly availability of water is the same as the present therefore the use of water can increase in the months in which the greater irrigation needs of the future remain lower than current water availability in the second future scenario cc 0 the availability of water of each month is restricted to the level of use of the present therefore in some months the growing irrigation needs of the future outweigh the availability of water and farms must change the cropping systems four other future scenarios simulate a progressive reduction of water availability over the baseline use level from 5 to 20 cc 5 cc 10 cc 15 cc 20 these scenarios jointly reduce wua water and groundwater and in all single periods of the year in this way the first simulation indicates the response of the areas to the temperatures and rainfall of the future climate the other simulations indicate the response that occurs when progressive subtractions of the available water are added to those climatic conditions we discuss these scenarios impacts by examining the finger kreinin index fki value 2 2 fki is assumed to represent adaptation by changing the various crops weight values fki ranges from 100 with the same soil use to 0 for entirely different orderings finger and kreinin 1979 fki reductions i e declines in similarity between land use in each simulation and baseline signal changes to adapt the irrigated surfaces on the total the purchased fodder over self produced the use of family labor and external the gross income and the hourly return of the employed family labour 3 4 indicators of labour income and resources use and productivity the dsp models results are condensed by indicators built as ratios to standardize their information with respect to the dimensional differences among farms and areas for the same reason the indicators are computed as percentage variation with respect to the baseline rather than on their absolute value in each simulation table 2 shows the structure of the indicators the key indicator is the percentage variation over the baseline of family labour hourly return lhr computed with respect to labour actually used on farm 3 3 the family labour income is computed as residual of net income after remunerating net capital at 1 rate and family directive labour at 3 of gross farm production lhr changes indicate ability to support economic sustainability under cc conditions other things being equal on the non farm sector labour market this ability can be due to changes in total income as well as in the actual use of family labour on farm two indicators capture the effects of changes in cropping patterns on soil and water productivity csh is the percentage change of crops sale value per hectare over the baseline it is obtained by multiplying the yield y of each crop j by its hectares xj and market price pj summing all the crop values and dividing by the total cultivated area j x j csw is the percentage change over the baseline of irrigated crops sale value per cubic meter of used water it is obtained by multiplying the yield y of each irrigated crop k by its hectares xk and market price pk and dividing the sum of all the crop values by the total use of irrigation water tiw our models do not simulate changes in market prices due to changes in supply conditions therefore the crop sale values and the productivity of soil and water only vary due to changes in the cultivation patterns in turn due to the new conditions of yield irrigation needs and water availability 4 4 the cc worsens milk quality during the warmer months causing the loss of the relative price premium our farm management modelling does not provide mitigation actions on the income impact which is simply applied ex post other two indicators are the percentage variation of feed purchases per hectare fph which is only present in livestock farms and the percentage variation of family employment per hectare feh i e the ratio between the hours of family manual labor used on farm and the cultivated area the latter is important because abandoning some labour intensive crops can balance total income drop even increasing the lhr 3 5 regression analysis and income elasticity to the indicators simulations with discrete stochastic programming models make explicit the adaptation paths that allow maximizing the income of the study areas and their representative farms regression analysis evaluates these paths impact on the profitability of family labour employed on farms specifically a quadratic regression estimates the relationships between lhr and the regressors csh csw fph and feh using pooled data of all farms study areas and scenarios the regression estimates coefficients of these regressors for farms groupings as reported in appendix b the groups are constituted on the basis of specific structural characteristics that influence the possibility of adapting the various farms to the simulated changes in particular a first group includes all the fadn dairy cattle farms in cremona a second group the fadn dairy cattle farms in piacenza the dairy milk farms in cremona are much more intensive than those of piacenza as reported in paragraph 3 1 a group of dairy cattle and buffalo farms aggregates the related units in oristano and salerno 5 5 cremona piacenza and salerno dairy farms mainly base forage production on longer cycle maize hybrids oristano dairy farms base on the more intensive maize ryegrass succession which produces more metabolizable energy and dry matter per hectare however the huge analogies between salerno and oristano in the breeding intensity i e livestock units lu per hectare led us to group them a sheep farms group mainly producing non irrigated fodder with poor water resources includes the relative units which are only present in oristano non livestock farms are in oristano and salerno specialized rice farms operate in oristano and respect to the other farms are mainly limited in their adaptation possibilities by constraints associated to the soil nature other two groups of farms are mainly specialized in greenhouses and tree crops and are constrained as they cannot change the surface of these activities in the short term finally arable crop farms are not subject to specific structural constraints on cc adaptation the regression results are used to measure the reactivity of the lhr variation to each regressor variation based on classical elasticity indexes i e the relations between the percentage changes of the former and that of each of the latter 6 6 the elasticity of lhr over csw is εcsw δ l h r δ c s w δ l h r δ c s w c s w l h r where c s w l h r is computed at the average of the two variables δ l h r δ c s w is the slope of the tangent to the estimated quadratic function at the average of csw values given our formulation of variables elasticity measures the percentage change of a percentage change and indicates whether each regressor can accelerate or slow down the variation of family labour profitability in particular lhr elasticity over csw εcsw indicates whether allocating water to irrigated crops with the highest yield increases per cubic meter modifies the general labour productivity accelerating or slowing down lhr growth 7 7 and the opposite for lhr reductions lhr elasticity over csh εcsh shows whether expanding the crops with the highest yield increases per hectare can modify the labour productivity accelerating or slowing down lhr growth 8 8 and the opposite for lhr reductions the elasticity results are compared to the variable changes in the simulations to highlight the adaptation paths followed by the farms and their impacts on the resources profitability 4 results analysis 4 1 dsp simulations area level impacts table 3 reports the main cc impacts in the three areas under the various simulations the first row of each section reports the results for selected variables under current climate baseline b the subsequent rows report the results of the other simulations all these results are expressed in their direct value for the first three variables and as percentage variation over the value of the current climate for the next five variables the second group of rows in the table shows the changes in a future scenario cc in which water availability does not vary but the new temperature and rainfall regimes increase irrigation needs and change yields the three areas react with similar percentage drops in total income which however depend on rather different adaptive responses cremona piacenza and salerno reduce the weight of the irrigated area and change land use more fki is reduced more oristano keeps the weight of the irrigated area unchanged and changes the use of the soil less interesting differences concern the use of family labor since this reduces appreciably in salerno to the point of increasing lhr despite the drop in gross income instead the use of family labor does not reduce in oristano and cremona piacenza which transfers the fall in gross income to lhr the three areas also differently respond to the simulations that limit water availability first to the use level of the present cc 0 then progressively to 20 9 9 table 3 shows only the impacts of the 10 and 20 reduction in water the variations obtained by reducing the water by 5 and 15 are intermediate with respect to the former cremona piacenza tolerates better water reduction even at high levels and reduces less total income and per family labor unit in oristano the impact grows and becomes very strong in salerno where a reduction of 5 10 of the water doubles the economic impacts due to the modification of only temperatures and rainfall the use of labor also changes very differently in these simulations oristano and above all salerno drastically reduce the use of external wage labor while cremona piacenza modifies it very little the reduction in family labor is also very different it is modest in cremona piacenza and in oristano instead it is noteworthy in salerno where it is more than proportional to the reduction in income and this noticeably increases the lhr 4 2 regression analysis adaptation of farm types table 4 reports the results of the impacts of the adjustment paths on the family labour profitability the section on the left presents first the variables average values in the six simulations note that csh and csw are also examined by eliminating changes in yields cshy and in yields and irrigation needs cswyw to focus on the only changes in land use or in water distribution among crops lhrm is the labour profitability change net of the milk yield drop it shows the impact of changes in use of soil in livestock farms the right section of table 4 reports the lhr elasticity over each regressor based on the estimated coefficients reported in appendix b the elasticity reading must be based on the change of labour profitability for example if lhr decreases as in livestock farms a positive sign of ε indicates a variation that accelerates the decline a negative sign indicates a change that slows the decline the opposite is true for lhr increases we now examine the results for the various types of farm dairy cattle farms in cremona piacenza concentrate their land on fodder crops with higher value per hectare increasing cshy and the yields rise boosts the value of csh over cshy piacenza an originally less intensive farming system has the strongest changes the negative sign and the value of εcsh show that this adaptation path contrasts the lhr fall even if weakly the impact is a little bigger in piacenza still the expanded crops have higher requirements of labor which speeds up the drop of lhr as the positive signs of εcsw and εfeh show 10 10 those crops labour productivity is particularly low in piacenza farms as indicated by the high εfeh value these farms also concentrate water on crops with higher value per cubic meter which increases cswyw yet water needs grow more than yields csw reduces over cswyw that given the declining availability of water forces to reduce total cultivated area table 3 this causes the farms to increase feed purchases that counteracts the lhr decline this same strategy increases labour profitability in cremona whose lhrm increases while fails in piacenza whose lhrm decreases sheep and oristano salerno dairy farms adopt an opposite soil management expanding crops with a lower value rain fed or with less irrigation needs which reduces the cshy value and involves a labor expulsion this path has opposite impacts curbing the decline of lhr in the sheep farms εcsh negative and accelerating it in oristano salerno dairy farms εcsh positive conversely as in previous farms the management of irrigation expands crops with high value per cubic meter which increases cswyw the negative sign and value of εcsw show that this path has good potential to curb labor profitability drop in sheep farms yet this farm fails to exploit it with a tiny increase of cswyw and greatly suffers from the cc impact on yields which makes csw negative 11 11 in sheep and oristano salerno dairy farms only some irrigated crops increase the yield but less than water requirements table 2 the consequence is a remarkable increase of feed purchases these soil and water management strategies fail to increase labour profitability in both sheep and oristano salerno dairy farms as the lhrm decreases prove even greenhouses and fruit farms expand the cultivation of lower value crops as the decrease of csh and cshy shows 12 12 in these farms yields do not vary so csh and csh have the same value instead irrigation requirements increase which decreases csw over cswyw as in the oristano salerno dairy farms this change reduces profitability this time slowing down an increase in lhr as indicated by the negative sign of εcsh at the same time by using the available water to irrigate only the highest value crops the growth of the lhr is accelerated as shown by the positive sign of εcsw replacing less valuable irrigated crops with rain fed crops although of lesser value and concentrating the available water on the irrigation of the most valuable irrigated crops has the effect of reducing the use of family labor the value of εfeh indicates that this is the key to accelerating the lhr growth in fruit farms instead it has a lower impact on greenhouses farms where to concentrate the water on the most valuable crops farms have to abandon other crops that still contribute much to profitability as the high negative value of εcsh shows rice specialized farms are subject to soil quality constraints that prevent expanding other rich irrigated crops and force to react to water availability decline by adopting low value rain fed crops this greatly reduces csh and slows the lhr growth as negative sign and high value of εcsh show however rice yields are simulated to grow more than proportionally to water need which raises csw and accelerates the lhr growth as indicated by positive value of εcsw arable crops farms are not affected by specific structural constraints and respond to water availability decline by intensifying cultivation patterns i e expanding autumnal winter horticultural crops when the etn is reduced not shown in the tables 13 13 even in arnc crop yields do not change this expansion increases csh though slightly as winter vegetables are less valuable than summer ones yet it makes farming less susceptible to the raising water constraint and accelerates the lhr increase as the positive sign of εcsh shows on the other hand the high labor need of these crops increases feh slowing the lhr growth as shown by the negative sign and fairly high value of εfeh arable crops farms also divert the summer declining available water to spring summer crops of greater value which increases csw yet the huge water need growth of summer vegetables reduces their total cultivation and decelerates the lhr growth as the negative sign of εcsw shows 5 discussion in representing a wide range of production conditions in italian agriculture we choose very diverse areas from each other and therefore adaptive responses to cc scenarios also diverge the results of the simulated scenarios by the mp models highlight key differences in the modification of land use in particular the cattle farms in the cremona piacenza area increase their self production of forage even up to a 10 water availability drop the lower sensitivity to these restraints is due to the forage crop yields growth that balances the decrease of their cultivation due to the irrigation needs increase in the context of growing water scarcity table 1 on the other hand those farms income levels mainly reduce due to the impact of the cc on milk production which causes greater economic damage than in other areas conversely the salerno farms southern and mainly non livestock adapts basically cutting less profitable activities with higher workloads drastically reducing the employee but also the family labour yet the latter decrease outweighs the farm income drop raising the hourly family wages the oristano area where farms with diverse orientation operate many non irrigated is mid way it shows higher reaction of income and employment to the water availability decline as in the salerno but a certain stability of the cultivation area such as the cremona piacenza area by examining the adaptation paths of the various farm groups we can assess the ability to exploit the yield increase in certain crops or to modify the use of land and agricultural labour in activities that become less profitable in this regard the regression results show that the relationships amongst changes in yields and irrigation needs and changes in workload due to land use modifications is a key factor influencing farming profitability specifically cattle farms are mostly sensitive to cc impacts on fodder crops mainly on corn as table 1 shows the corn hybrids yields vary depending on the area location and the cultivation cycle length and the long cycle hybrid is supposed to benefit more from the greater interception of radiation during the crop cycle even if with large irrigation needs increases cattle farms in the cremona piacenza area manage their land by expanding long cycle maize much of this adaptation is carried out by dairy cattle farms in piacenza which exploit the yield growth of the longer cycle maize hybrid to innovate an originally less intensive system yet due to the labour need of this hybrid its expansion noticeably increases the family labour use and becomes the most accelerating factor in decreasing profitability of dairy cattle farms in piacenza as the high value of εfeh shows 14 14 in fact buying feed rather than producing on farm improves profitability albeit slightly due to the relative increase in purchase costs dairy cattle farms in cremona intensify less and with larger impact of the yield growth 15 15 csh and csh grow much less and csh is more than double of csh while the family labour use increases less in particular the cremona farms are adapting to the new climate and the reduction of water availability by replacing the alfalfa which increases the irrigation needs by 7 5 to maintain the current yield with rain fed ryegrass which increases the yield by 3 9 the surface of the alfalfa decreases by 76 3 that of the ryegrass increases by 289 with limited reductions in water availability the surface of the silage corn as main crop also increases as this crop increases the yield 2 2 although less than the irrigation requirement 6 with more marked reductions in the available water the surface of this corn decreases below the present levels this new use of soil enhances profitability as the increase of labour profitability net of the milk yield drop shows an alternative cultivation could be the ryegrass maize succession 16 16 in which ryegrass increases its yield table 1 the simulated scenarios do not expand the cultivation of the short cycle maize hybrid in the cremona piacenza area because of its yield reduction and its increase in irrigation requirements oristano dairy cattle farms already adopt this succession making more intensive use of land and with higher labor productivity however yield losses of the short cycle corn hybrid coupled to dramatic increases in ryegrass irrigation needs weakens the adaptability lacking irrigated alternatives those farms can respond to water availability decline only by growing lower value crops which reduces water economic productivity the sheep farms have the worst situation these farms are mainly based on rain fed forage crops whose yields drop dramatically this reduces their cultivation and increases the purchase costs of feed reducing the total farming income dedicating limited water available and soil to more productive crops and reducing the use of family labour has very limited effects changes in the use of family labour have marked opposite impacts in fruit greenhouse arable and horticultural farms as indicated by the profitability elasticity over labour use εfeh farms with minor adaptation constraints farms with arable crops alter the use of the soil by increasing irrigation in autumnal and winter periods with only limited increases in irrigation needs as well as slight water availability reductions this maintains or even increases the manpower use by expanding crops with lower labor productivity which slows the growth of farm profitability farms that are structurally constrained in changing land use farms with tree crops greenhouses and rice cultivation reduce the less profitable crops expelling family labour this increases profitability even if at different levels since some farms reduce activities with good levels of labor productivity those results are affected by the lack of simulations of crop yield variations in presence of such effects more significant impacts on income and complex competition dynamics for available water would be grafted into the oristano and salerno areas this is confirmed by the increase in income and labour profitability in the rice farms where the increase in rice yields over irrigation needs allows balancing the cultivated area decrease due to the reduced water availability these results are reflected in various studies findings debaeke and aboudrare 2004 claim that a key adaptation factor is the relationship between water availability and yield levels and crop irrigation needs the authors note that in the presence of severe water shortages shorter cycle hybrids work better due to lower irrigation needs instead longer cycle hybrids with higher irrigation needs work best at sub humid latitudes this difference is relevant in the climate change scenarios that we have simulated since even our largest reduction with 20 less water modifies the availability of water moderately and maintains the characteristics of sub humid areas in our areas this favors relatively longer cycle hybrids boutraa 2010 highlights the relevance of the balance between variations in yields and in irrigation needs highlighting the need to have at the same time higher yields and greater efficiency in water use our findings also confirm the results of soto garcía et al 2013 on water shortages in south eastern spain who associate farms adaptation to the concentration of available water on some highly productive crops the same applies for warnings that various adaptation paths may involve the need to reduce family employment as suggested by chebil et al 2019 for irrigated agriculture in tunisia and hamdan and salman 2005 for jordan 6 conclusions our study contributes to assessing the adaptation paths of farms to the cc analyzing how they can change the general productivity of water and soil resources and consequently the profitability of the family farm labor resource to this end we processed the outcomes of regional mp optimization models of three italian areas with an econometric analysis specific crops and herds sensitivity to climatic conditions generate different cc impacts on farming differences are reinforced when restrictions on water availability are imposed the simulated technologies and impacts allow better adaptation to the core of italian dairy cattle breeding that adopt medium high intensity fodder production systems which is based on longer cycle maize hybrids less adaptation potentials emerge in the systems that even for a context of less water availability manage the land more intensely with the succession of ryegrass and short cycle maize hybrids working to increase this system yield can improve the adaptability in a context of increasing water scarcity sheep milk pastoral systems mainly based on rain fed extensive soil management also suffer and the need to improve the productivity of pastures and dry fodder crops is evident this program is all the more central as the cc impact can increase international feed prices reducing the contribution of feed purchases to the adjustment paths we have shown clearly adapting strategies for dairy cattle farms must consider the cc impacts on milk production examining options that change the herd structure and in general the breeding technologies however these strategies could not be simulated and evaluated with the short term models used in this study arable land farms horticulture fruit and greenhouse mostly localized in southern italy mainly adapt by abandoning crops with lower labor productivity this will decrease family labour and worker employment which is a serious outcome in areas where unemployment rates are already high there is room for different paths i e changing land use by expanding autumnal and winter crops when climate models simulate limited rises in irrigation needs and only slight declines of water availability this strategy allows maintaining and even increasing the family labour use yet it implies a progressive decrease of this resource profitability that could prejudice the survival of these types over time to adapt to new climatic conditions while ensuring a non decreasing wage for family work it is important to combine the increase in crop irrigation needs with an increase in their productivity as far as we know the impact and adaptation to cc have so far been studied with econometric approaches on data observed in the past ricardian analysis or with mp models that simulate future scenarios our study aimed to contribute to the state of the art by using an econometric approach to evaluate the results of ex ante assessments based on mp models future studies could develop an econometric analysis based on functional forms more suitable to represent the impacts and adaptive pathways with the estimated coefficients it is essential to also improve the simulations carried out with mp models all the elements to be integrated into the analysis are the influence of cc on plant diseases and pests the technological development that acts on yields independently of cc as well as the market context for products and factors

cortignani and dono 2018 appendix b regression analysis a quadratic regression estimates the relationships between lhr and the regressors csh csw feh and fph using pooled data of all single farms in the study areas and scenarios the regression allows capturing the possible differences in the intercept coefficient as well as in the slopes coefficients by using variables dummy d the regression model expressed in matrix presentation is the following b 1 y x β d x δ x 2 γ d x 2 θ ε where y is a nx1 vector with n 258 observations 6 simulated scenarios for each of the 43 farms x is a nxk matrix with k 4 number of regressors the model considers four kx1 parameters β refers to the linear terms of the function intercept and slope and δ captures the possible differences of the farms typologies in the intercept and in the slopes coefficients γ refers to the quadratic term of the function slope and θ captures the possible differences of the farms typologies in the quadratic slope coefficients finally ε is the nx1 vector that represents the error term of the regression function the regression was performed using the software ihs eviews ver 7 data fitting was performed with the ordinary least squares method the low level of autocorrelation among the variables was checked trough a spearman s rank correlation test and reinforced the conditions for the regression analysis as mentioned in the paragraph 4 3 the regression analysis was developed by estimating coefficients for farms groupings a priori set up based on structural features that influence adaptation to the simulated changes the dummy variable system was immediately configured to have 8 groupings among the 43 individual farms based on their productive and structural features for these groupings the statistical significance of the difference between the coefficients of the respective intercepts and slopes was evaluated this allowed generating a restricted form of the regression model in which various groupings were further aggregated to present the same estimate value of the intercept and slope coefficients the dummy analysis and the aggregation of various coefficients was carried out based on the t test and on the p values of the single coefficients and using the f test statistic as developed by judge et al 1988 the regression estimates and the relative statistics obtained with aggregation process are reported in the following table b1 which shows how well the quadratic function fitted the data the significance of squared terms for all regressors confirms previous statements from wang et al 2009 who find the quadratic form necessary when dealing with climate related effects 
10317,climate change requires mediterranean farms to maintain adequate profitability while adapting to the increase in water needs of crops the growth of water demand for non agricultural users and the reduction of resource availability we use discrete stochastic programming models of three italian farming areas to simulate the adaptation paths of their farm types to changes in yields and irrigation needs of crops that climate change could generate at 2030 this is done in a context of progressive decrease of water availability we condense the adaptation choices attributed by the optimization process to the farm types by means of indicators of value produced per water cubic meter and per hectare we use those indicators in a quadratic regression analysis to explain the change in the hourly wages of family labour which represents the farm resources profitability the examination of the resulting elasticity indices outlines the adaptation paths impact on farm profitability this integrated analysis of optimization models and econometric regression shows that the core of italian cow milk production based on medium high intensity forage systems adapts better instead available technologies and structural features provide much narrower margins to livestock farms based on intensive forage production and conversely to more extensive livestock systems crop farms adapt by reducing labour use in less profitable activities which boosts family hourly wages but increases unemployment furthermore the surface of some crops can be expanded because their cycle takes place in months in which the availability of water decreases less and their irrigation requirement increases less however the low productivity of these crops does not allow to increase wages for family labour the results on farms overall profitability derive from an integrated analysis of changes in water resources productivity soil and labor mathematical programming outlines the adaptation paths that maximize farming incomes the econometric analysis indicates whether those paths support profitability favouring farm economic sustainability keywords farms adaptation paths to climate change irrigation water availability discrete stochastic programming econometric analysis farm family labor profitability 1 introduction an important body of scientific literature lionello and scarascia 2018 and garcía garizábal et al 2014 among others suggests that the pathways for adapting mediterranean agriculture to climate change cc should be assessed based on scenarios of reduced water availability and increased demand still evaluating the possible influence of cc on water availability is complex and requires analysing the hydrological balance and local interactions between the geophysical and climatic conditions 1 1 furthermore water supply often does not depend on the resource balance at the local level and the impact of the cc on it and this complicates the analysis for instance in many mediterranean areas due to local water scarcity the demand is met with notable water transfers between different river basins dono et al 2019 provide an overview of water exchanges between regions and river basins in southern italy showing that on different routes it exceeds the order of magnitude of hundreds of millions of cubic meters per year similarly the joint effect of climate forcing and institutional and technical constraints on the water demand of many users is complex to specify several research projects are developed in this context to analyze the possible impact of the cc on italian farming and identify adaptation options the agroscenari www agroscenari it macsur www macsur eu and department of excellence www unitus it projects among other activities have developed interdisciplinary research in three areas with very diverse productive patterns to represent many italian farming conditions the results of climatic agronomic and zootechnical studies were integrated into territorial economic models of mathematical programming mp to simulate the impact of the future climate and the adaptation options of the main farm types in these areas yet the results generated by this vast integration are to be considered partial because these projects budgets did not allow involving scientific skills on complex issues of change in the hydrological balance of the areas as well as in the non farming water demand in this analysis we treat these shortcomings by using the same models to simulate the impacts of a cc that progressively reduces water availability while increasing irrigation needs and modifying the yield of some widespread crops the various simulations modify the levels of production employment and income acting differently on the farm types in the three areas we study the adaptation paths of the farms by means of indicators that synthesize the production choices emerged in the various mp simulations and using their values in a regression analysis that explains the changes in income per unit of family labour in this way we identify the choices that support and those that depress the value of this profitability index we believe that the relationship between adaptation paths and profitability of family farm labour is crucial for long term economic and social sustainability since most italian farms are family owned and managed van vliet et al 2015 the steps forward over previous analyses dono et al 2016 cortignani et al 2018 are the extension of the study to multiple areas with very different production patterns and the use of a regression analysis to summarize the adaptive responses to the many mp simulations the next section reviews the recent scientific literature on the cc impact on water availability and demand in the mediterranean area as well as on farms adaptation paths a materials and methods section follows it first recovers the main legacies of the agroscenari project showing study areas productive conditions as well as approaches models and some results on agricultural responses to the cc impact second reports the cc simulations of the new analysis the indicators outlining farm management choices as well as the approach that used these indicators to identify strategies of adaptation to cc a results section describes the adaptation paths emerged from this analysis the last sections discuss the results and conclude the examination 2 literature overview various studies show that climate change should reduce and alter water availability regimes in the mediterranean basin according to garcía ruiz et al 2011 the natural variability of the climatic series in this area and in its specific sectors including italy already during the twentieth century shows long term trends of temperature increases and decreases in rainfall these trends linked to the greater drops in snowfall and snow cover and to the anticipation of the melting of snow reduce the water availability of river courses in spring and make it more irregular in winter increasing uncertainty about it mcmillan et al 2016 gobiet et al 2014 climate models confirm these trends for the 21 st century according to lionello and scarascia 2018 the annual warming rate of the mediterranean area could be 20 above the global average with peaks above 50 in summer and in the continental areas north of the basin the further decline in rainfall could further reduce the accumulation of winter water in the artificial reservoirs of the southern mediterranean the increased inter annual variability of summer may be associated with an increased presence of extreme weather events giorgi and lionello 2008 the adaptation to this context must be examined considering that all uses of water could increase in parallel zachariadis 2010 rochdane et al 2012 and berredjem and hani 2017 argue that non agricultural uses and global demand for the resource should increase in various areas of the mediterranean basin however their projections are mainly influenced by population growth rather than by the specific influence of the cc according to wang et al 2017 the change in the rain regime and the increase in temperature could increase the per capita water demand as emerges from evaluating the dynamics of a chinese river basin wang et al 2018 kenney et al 2008 polebitski et al 2011 lott et al 2013 and parandvash and chang 2016 come to similar conclusions on the contrary karamouz et al 2011 studying the use of domestic water in tehran do not foresee major impacts of the cc water uses for industrial cooling and thermoelectric power generation are expected to increase according to köberl et al 2016 albeit slightly on the contrary the demand for water to protect ecological systems should grow steadily piniewski et al 2014 barron et al 2012 spears et al 2013 in addition the cc would contribute to altering the water demand of some mediterranean areas reducing summer tourism and increasing spring and autumn tourism averyt et al 2011 finally studies on the use of water in mediterranean agriculture agree in predicting an appreciable increase garcía garizábal et al 2014 ouda et al 2015 valverde et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 dono et al 2016 according to saadi et al 2015 the anticipation and shortening of the cycle will reduce the irrigation needs of winter wheat and tomatoes in the mediterranean however the decline in rainfall and the increase in evapotranspiration in winter spring could make additional irrigation necessary even for crops fed by rain if water availability is reduced and the general demand for water resources increases it becomes important to define the possible adaptation paths for an important user of water such as agriculture to this end many studies apply mathematical programming models to the agricultural sector of various areas of the mediterranean basin or immediately behind it these studies integrate agronomic and economic models to simulate the impacts of the cc evaluate adaptation options and identify the agricultural systems most exposed to declines in income schönhart et al 2014 dono et al 2016 purola et al 2018 other results highlight the influence of economies of scale irrigation investments and diversification of cultivation schemes and practices varela ortega et al 2011 kahil et al 2015 harmanny and malek 2019 however only a few studies evaluate the impact of these actions on the profitability of agricultural resources and on the ability to remunerate the work of agricultural families at levels comparable to alternative sources which influence the sustainability of farms over time argilés 2001 hennessy et al 2008 smedzik ambrozy et al 2019 the most important study on the links between adaptation pathways and profitability remains reidsma et al 2010 which with an econometric approach assesses the influence of structural characteristics and the climatic and socio economic situation on the performance of farms in 1990 2003 its results show that adaptation to cc is highly influenced by crop rotations and input management as well as by the size of the farm and the intensity of land use our study is in this latter perspective and aims to identify and evaluate the short term adaptation strategies of a variety of types of italian farms in a condition of growing need for irrigation and changes in crop yields combined with a progressive decline in the availability of water this is done by combining optimization models and econometric approaches to evaluate the effects on net income and profitability in particular on the ability to pay for family farm work 3 materials and methods 3 1 basic characteristics of the study areas and data collection the oristano area 54 000 ha in the sardinian center west inea 2014 pp 133 135 140 is divided into two sub zones in the first a water user association wua supplies water from a large dam to potentially irrigate 36 000 ha the dam has a high storage capacity and is used only marginally for hydroelectric drinking industrial use and flood lamination water competition could grow with the building of pipelines to supply southern sardinian areas and the growth of civil and industrial uses due to tourism growth in adjacent areas the main irrigated crops are rice 2700 ha that soil conditions make the only cultivation possible in some sub zones silage maize 5700 ha mainly in succession to ryegrass 3500 ha alfalfa 1800 ha watermelon artichokes and tomatoes 6000 ha citrus fruits vineyards and olive groves 1300 ha durum wheat barley and other rain fed cereals 8000 ha the sardinian dairy cattle breeding largely localizes in this area with a well organized cooperative system for cow milk processing and marketing the second sub zone covers 18 000 ha where the lack of networks connecting the dam limits irrigation to the withdrawing from farm wells linked to the rainfall scarcity this generates a typical mediterranean landscape with most of the land used for pasture 10 000 ha and rain fed cereals 2400 ha dairy sheep farming is common in the zone and involves several small sheep milk processing plants the salerno area extends on 15 000 ha in the sele river catchment from which a wua withdraws the irrigation water inea 2014 pagg 106 108 119 most of sele water is collected at the source to meet the civil uses of puglia with the apulian aqueduct yet tributaries such as the tanagro noticeably increase its downstream flow the agricultural activities are carried out in the vicinity of major urban and touristic areas the area s farmers make also use of groundwater resources both during periods when the wua does not operate and when its water supplies are insufficient to meet irrigation needs mainly in dry summers and springs yet aquifers overexploitation contributes to groundwater salinization given the proximity to the tirreno sea the cropping activity is mainly devoted to vegetable open field 5100 ha and greenhouse 5500 ha fruit trees are also grown 2200 ha as well as forage which is important to feed the buffaloes of local farms whose milk is used to produce mozzarella cheese the cremona and piacenza provinces represent many of the dairy milk farms that produce the grana padano cheese inea 2014pagg 43 47 51 despite common traits of specialization and breeding intensity the cremona dairy milk farms are more intensive and larger based on herd size milk productivity and nutrition features fodder crops are grown in almost all the 68 000 ha studied mainly with long cycle silage corn hybrids 38 000 ha and alfalfa 14 000 ha 6500 ha are cultivated with grain feed crops both irrigated and rain fed the cremona farms are mainly served by a wua that covers 167 500 ha on the other hand piacenza farms obtain water mainly from private wells which limits the average intensity of irrigation and the incidence of irrigated crops on the total farming area compared to cremona yet all the water comes from the po river catchment area that bears a strong competition for drinking water hydroelectric industrial and ecological purposes due to the many activities that take place in the most anthropized and economically developed italian area the farm accountancy information network fadn and direct surveys in each area provided data on the main characteristics of farms oristano and salerno farms were grouped based on their productive specializations and weighted average of their characteristics in each group was assumed to represent the corresponding farm types in cremona piacenza attention was focused only on the dairy sector whose features were defined based on the records of all the individual fadn farms each considered representative of a group as a result 13 farm types hereinafter simply indicated as farms were assumed to represent oristano 9 of which served by the wua 7 farms represent salerno all inside the wua zone the cow s milk production of cremona piacenza is respectively represented by 14 and 9 farms based on the substantial financial resources of the agroscenari and macsur projects the production conditions in the three areas were defined with a very large number of direct interviews to farmers agronomists and leaders of agricultural cooperatives and regional administrations the farmers interviewed were chosen to represent the most common types of farm in the three areas the interviewed technicians were chosen among the most expert on local production conditions based on these interviews the labor water and chemical needs for the various production phases of the crops practiced in the three areas were specified as well as their crops yield in the same way feed requirements of the livestock were specified defining the feed rations actually used in the areas and the milk production these technical data were examined and validated by the members of the local research groups made up of researchers from the departments of agricultural sciences economists agronomists animal scientists and the national research council climatologists the production and input prices were identified using databases in particular the price monthly bulletins of the local chambers of commerce and of the institute of services for the agricultural food market ismea www ismeamercati it to understand the conditions of the local markets interviews were also conducted with local privileged witnesses managers of cooperatives traders and senior executives of the chambers of commerce the existing land labor and water constraints were determined on the basis of the sixth general italian agricultural census on the fadn database and on the general data and the registers of the water user associations of the associated farms 3 2 climate and production data analysis processing and impact of cc dono et al 2016 broadly described the building of the oristano territorial model that integrated climatic agronomic zootechnical statistical and economic analyzes to estimate the impacts of changes in climatic variables the same process was carried out in the cremona piacenza and salerno areas in brief probability distribution functions pdfs of uncertain variables crop and milk yields as well as water requirements were generated both under a scenario of current daily temperatures and rainfall representative of the 2000 2010 climate and under a scenario that applies daily temperature and rainfall estimates for the near future climate forecast in 2020 2030 these values were generated using a modeling chain that describes the potential climatic forcing of atmospheric variability in the study areas as well as the changes due to the expected future concentration of co2 this chain adopts a general circulation model to estimate the large scale atmospheric and oceanic response to the future sres a1b emission scenario this general model guides the regional atmospheric modelling system rams which is applied in the study areas to increase the physical description of the mechanisms on a local scale and therefore to better represent the local variability the results provide climatic scenarios in which albeit with differences among the three areas the increases in future minimum and maximum daily temperatures compared to the present are modest in spring and considerable in summer and autumn winter in addition the number of hot days and heat waves increases significantly in the summer the average rainfall decreases slightly in spring and much in autumn winter while their future variability increases compared to the current one in all seasons note that these differences between current and future conditions reflect the climate change trends of the past 30 years the different temperature and humidity values generate different current and future crop yields and water needs as estimated by the dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer v 4 6 jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2012 and epic environmental policy integrated climate v 0810 williams 1995 models the same applies to the quality and quantity of milk as well as to the mortality of the animals estimated with animal production models in current and future conditions summarized by the temperature and humidity index thindex the pdfs originating from these crop and milk yield values as well as irrigation needs were used to represent farmers expectations on climate variability used as drivers of their economic choice process represented by three discrete stochastic programming dsp models described in appendix a the activities that farmers can choose in our three dsp models imply the selection of the mix of crops varieties or cultivation techniques we attribute the different values of the production and economic variables in the two climatic scenarios to the impact of the cc dono et al 2016 for the purposes of this analysis it is interesting to focus on the main results of the epic and dssat agronomic models used to represent the impacts of the cc in particular table 1 reports the results of the agroscenari study and shows the percentage changes in crop yields and water requirements in the near future scenario over the present in the study areas the dssat model was used only in oristano for rice irrigated barley and durum wheat not irrigated the dotted lines separate its results from those obtained with the epic model used for all other crops also note that the table does not show the changes for the many horticultural and fruit crops which are mainly grown in salerno and oristano the estimation of those yields in the two climatic scenarios was prevented by the limits of the agronomic models used in particular by dssat and by the scarcity of data to calibrate them in addition agronomic models currently fail to determine the qualitative aspects that significantly affect the market price of those crops that s why we limited the analysis of those precious crops to changes in water demand due to temperature increases and rainfall reductions assuming that in the future farmers will continue to irrigate them by integrating evapotranspiration to keep the soil at field capacity therefore the impact of the cc on fruit and vegetable crops was simulated by estimating the pdfs of the etn in the two climatic scenarios calculating the relative variations in the future and proportionally modifying the irrigation needs of each of those crops the hypothesis is that these changes in irrigation requirements allow the yield of those crops to remain unchanged in the near future scenario note that the cc is estimated to have an uneven impact amongst crops and areas reflecting the specific sensitivity of crops and the pedoclimatic conditions of each area only rice crop increases yields more than irrigation needs the silage corn yields vary in different ways depending on the earliness of the hybrid the temperature rise led to a shortening of the growing cycle of the most common hybrids used nowadays fao 600 which resulted in a lower production because of the lower intercepted radiation over the crop cycle a different reaction is expected for the other maize hybrid fao 700 which although to a much lesser extent is also present in the area given the earliness of this hybrid the model predicts that its yield will increase albeit slightly due to a greater interception of radiation during the crop cycle which was simulated in optimal irrigation conditions yet this corresponds to appreciable percentage increases in irrigation needs on the other hand a yield decrease affects the shorter cycle corn hybrid which is widespread in piacenza and oristano yet in oristano this maize is grown in succession to the irrigated ryegrass and this latter shows a strong yield increase combined to a dramatic increase in irrigation needs the ryegrass maize cultivation system is also present to a very limited extent in cremona piacenza where yet the increase in ryegrass yield is much more limited since that crop is rain fed also in that case ryegrass is followed by maize in second harvest which reduces the yield the yield reduction is common to all the rain fed forage crops in oristano as clover and pasture which are relevant for sheep breeding annual average etn grows by 3 2 in oristano by 7 5 in cremona piacenza and by 17 7 in salerno yet these values result from different variations during the year for example a considerable gap was estimated in salerno between a dramatic increase in the etn in january june and a sharp reduction in july december with 60 mean peak increase in the three decades of march and 62 reduction in october as a result the impacts on water needs depend on the period in which crops are cultivated 3 3 the simulated scenarios we re performed the three territorial dsp models first under the current climate scenario then under six diverse future scenarios the latter differ from each other in terms of water availability instead they have the same future yields for herds and crops as well as irrigation needs more specifically the first future scenario cc corresponds to the agroscenari simulation in which the monthly availability of water is the same as the present therefore the use of water can increase in the months in which the greater irrigation needs of the future remain lower than current water availability in the second future scenario cc 0 the availability of water of each month is restricted to the level of use of the present therefore in some months the growing irrigation needs of the future outweigh the availability of water and farms must change the cropping systems four other future scenarios simulate a progressive reduction of water availability over the baseline use level from 5 to 20 cc 5 cc 10 cc 15 cc 20 these scenarios jointly reduce wua water and groundwater and in all single periods of the year in this way the first simulation indicates the response of the areas to the temperatures and rainfall of the future climate the other simulations indicate the response that occurs when progressive subtractions of the available water are added to those climatic conditions we discuss these scenarios impacts by examining the finger kreinin index fki value 2 2 fki is assumed to represent adaptation by changing the various crops weight values fki ranges from 100 with the same soil use to 0 for entirely different orderings finger and kreinin 1979 fki reductions i e declines in similarity between land use in each simulation and baseline signal changes to adapt the irrigated surfaces on the total the purchased fodder over self produced the use of family labor and external the gross income and the hourly return of the employed family labour 3 4 indicators of labour income and resources use and productivity the dsp models results are condensed by indicators built as ratios to standardize their information with respect to the dimensional differences among farms and areas for the same reason the indicators are computed as percentage variation with respect to the baseline rather than on their absolute value in each simulation table 2 shows the structure of the indicators the key indicator is the percentage variation over the baseline of family labour hourly return lhr computed with respect to labour actually used on farm 3 3 the family labour income is computed as residual of net income after remunerating net capital at 1 rate and family directive labour at 3 of gross farm production lhr changes indicate ability to support economic sustainability under cc conditions other things being equal on the non farm sector labour market this ability can be due to changes in total income as well as in the actual use of family labour on farm two indicators capture the effects of changes in cropping patterns on soil and water productivity csh is the percentage change of crops sale value per hectare over the baseline it is obtained by multiplying the yield y of each crop j by its hectares xj and market price pj summing all the crop values and dividing by the total cultivated area j x j csw is the percentage change over the baseline of irrigated crops sale value per cubic meter of used water it is obtained by multiplying the yield y of each irrigated crop k by its hectares xk and market price pk and dividing the sum of all the crop values by the total use of irrigation water tiw our models do not simulate changes in market prices due to changes in supply conditions therefore the crop sale values and the productivity of soil and water only vary due to changes in the cultivation patterns in turn due to the new conditions of yield irrigation needs and water availability 4 4 the cc worsens milk quality during the warmer months causing the loss of the relative price premium our farm management modelling does not provide mitigation actions on the income impact which is simply applied ex post other two indicators are the percentage variation of feed purchases per hectare fph which is only present in livestock farms and the percentage variation of family employment per hectare feh i e the ratio between the hours of family manual labor used on farm and the cultivated area the latter is important because abandoning some labour intensive crops can balance total income drop even increasing the lhr 3 5 regression analysis and income elasticity to the indicators simulations with discrete stochastic programming models make explicit the adaptation paths that allow maximizing the income of the study areas and their representative farms regression analysis evaluates these paths impact on the profitability of family labour employed on farms specifically a quadratic regression estimates the relationships between lhr and the regressors csh csw fph and feh using pooled data of all farms study areas and scenarios the regression estimates coefficients of these regressors for farms groupings as reported in appendix b the groups are constituted on the basis of specific structural characteristics that influence the possibility of adapting the various farms to the simulated changes in particular a first group includes all the fadn dairy cattle farms in cremona a second group the fadn dairy cattle farms in piacenza the dairy milk farms in cremona are much more intensive than those of piacenza as reported in paragraph 3 1 a group of dairy cattle and buffalo farms aggregates the related units in oristano and salerno 5 5 cremona piacenza and salerno dairy farms mainly base forage production on longer cycle maize hybrids oristano dairy farms base on the more intensive maize ryegrass succession which produces more metabolizable energy and dry matter per hectare however the huge analogies between salerno and oristano in the breeding intensity i e livestock units lu per hectare led us to group them a sheep farms group mainly producing non irrigated fodder with poor water resources includes the relative units which are only present in oristano non livestock farms are in oristano and salerno specialized rice farms operate in oristano and respect to the other farms are mainly limited in their adaptation possibilities by constraints associated to the soil nature other two groups of farms are mainly specialized in greenhouses and tree crops and are constrained as they cannot change the surface of these activities in the short term finally arable crop farms are not subject to specific structural constraints on cc adaptation the regression results are used to measure the reactivity of the lhr variation to each regressor variation based on classical elasticity indexes i e the relations between the percentage changes of the former and that of each of the latter 6 6 the elasticity of lhr over csw is εcsw δ l h r δ c s w δ l h r δ c s w c s w l h r where c s w l h r is computed at the average of the two variables δ l h r δ c s w is the slope of the tangent to the estimated quadratic function at the average of csw values given our formulation of variables elasticity measures the percentage change of a percentage change and indicates whether each regressor can accelerate or slow down the variation of family labour profitability in particular lhr elasticity over csw εcsw indicates whether allocating water to irrigated crops with the highest yield increases per cubic meter modifies the general labour productivity accelerating or slowing down lhr growth 7 7 and the opposite for lhr reductions lhr elasticity over csh εcsh shows whether expanding the crops with the highest yield increases per hectare can modify the labour productivity accelerating or slowing down lhr growth 8 8 and the opposite for lhr reductions the elasticity results are compared to the variable changes in the simulations to highlight the adaptation paths followed by the farms and their impacts on the resources profitability 4 results analysis 4 1 dsp simulations area level impacts table 3 reports the main cc impacts in the three areas under the various simulations the first row of each section reports the results for selected variables under current climate baseline b the subsequent rows report the results of the other simulations all these results are expressed in their direct value for the first three variables and as percentage variation over the value of the current climate for the next five variables the second group of rows in the table shows the changes in a future scenario cc in which water availability does not vary but the new temperature and rainfall regimes increase irrigation needs and change yields the three areas react with similar percentage drops in total income which however depend on rather different adaptive responses cremona piacenza and salerno reduce the weight of the irrigated area and change land use more fki is reduced more oristano keeps the weight of the irrigated area unchanged and changes the use of the soil less interesting differences concern the use of family labor since this reduces appreciably in salerno to the point of increasing lhr despite the drop in gross income instead the use of family labor does not reduce in oristano and cremona piacenza which transfers the fall in gross income to lhr the three areas also differently respond to the simulations that limit water availability first to the use level of the present cc 0 then progressively to 20 9 9 table 3 shows only the impacts of the 10 and 20 reduction in water the variations obtained by reducing the water by 5 and 15 are intermediate with respect to the former cremona piacenza tolerates better water reduction even at high levels and reduces less total income and per family labor unit in oristano the impact grows and becomes very strong in salerno where a reduction of 5 10 of the water doubles the economic impacts due to the modification of only temperatures and rainfall the use of labor also changes very differently in these simulations oristano and above all salerno drastically reduce the use of external wage labor while cremona piacenza modifies it very little the reduction in family labor is also very different it is modest in cremona piacenza and in oristano instead it is noteworthy in salerno where it is more than proportional to the reduction in income and this noticeably increases the lhr 4 2 regression analysis adaptation of farm types table 4 reports the results of the impacts of the adjustment paths on the family labour profitability the section on the left presents first the variables average values in the six simulations note that csh and csw are also examined by eliminating changes in yields cshy and in yields and irrigation needs cswyw to focus on the only changes in land use or in water distribution among crops lhrm is the labour profitability change net of the milk yield drop it shows the impact of changes in use of soil in livestock farms the right section of table 4 reports the lhr elasticity over each regressor based on the estimated coefficients reported in appendix b the elasticity reading must be based on the change of labour profitability for example if lhr decreases as in livestock farms a positive sign of ε indicates a variation that accelerates the decline a negative sign indicates a change that slows the decline the opposite is true for lhr increases we now examine the results for the various types of farm dairy cattle farms in cremona piacenza concentrate their land on fodder crops with higher value per hectare increasing cshy and the yields rise boosts the value of csh over cshy piacenza an originally less intensive farming system has the strongest changes the negative sign and the value of εcsh show that this adaptation path contrasts the lhr fall even if weakly the impact is a little bigger in piacenza still the expanded crops have higher requirements of labor which speeds up the drop of lhr as the positive signs of εcsw and εfeh show 10 10 those crops labour productivity is particularly low in piacenza farms as indicated by the high εfeh value these farms also concentrate water on crops with higher value per cubic meter which increases cswyw yet water needs grow more than yields csw reduces over cswyw that given the declining availability of water forces to reduce total cultivated area table 3 this causes the farms to increase feed purchases that counteracts the lhr decline this same strategy increases labour profitability in cremona whose lhrm increases while fails in piacenza whose lhrm decreases sheep and oristano salerno dairy farms adopt an opposite soil management expanding crops with a lower value rain fed or with less irrigation needs which reduces the cshy value and involves a labor expulsion this path has opposite impacts curbing the decline of lhr in the sheep farms εcsh negative and accelerating it in oristano salerno dairy farms εcsh positive conversely as in previous farms the management of irrigation expands crops with high value per cubic meter which increases cswyw the negative sign and value of εcsw show that this path has good potential to curb labor profitability drop in sheep farms yet this farm fails to exploit it with a tiny increase of cswyw and greatly suffers from the cc impact on yields which makes csw negative 11 11 in sheep and oristano salerno dairy farms only some irrigated crops increase the yield but less than water requirements table 2 the consequence is a remarkable increase of feed purchases these soil and water management strategies fail to increase labour profitability in both sheep and oristano salerno dairy farms as the lhrm decreases prove even greenhouses and fruit farms expand the cultivation of lower value crops as the decrease of csh and cshy shows 12 12 in these farms yields do not vary so csh and csh have the same value instead irrigation requirements increase which decreases csw over cswyw as in the oristano salerno dairy farms this change reduces profitability this time slowing down an increase in lhr as indicated by the negative sign of εcsh at the same time by using the available water to irrigate only the highest value crops the growth of the lhr is accelerated as shown by the positive sign of εcsw replacing less valuable irrigated crops with rain fed crops although of lesser value and concentrating the available water on the irrigation of the most valuable irrigated crops has the effect of reducing the use of family labor the value of εfeh indicates that this is the key to accelerating the lhr growth in fruit farms instead it has a lower impact on greenhouses farms where to concentrate the water on the most valuable crops farms have to abandon other crops that still contribute much to profitability as the high negative value of εcsh shows rice specialized farms are subject to soil quality constraints that prevent expanding other rich irrigated crops and force to react to water availability decline by adopting low value rain fed crops this greatly reduces csh and slows the lhr growth as negative sign and high value of εcsh show however rice yields are simulated to grow more than proportionally to water need which raises csw and accelerates the lhr growth as indicated by positive value of εcsw arable crops farms are not affected by specific structural constraints and respond to water availability decline by intensifying cultivation patterns i e expanding autumnal winter horticultural crops when the etn is reduced not shown in the tables 13 13 even in arnc crop yields do not change this expansion increases csh though slightly as winter vegetables are less valuable than summer ones yet it makes farming less susceptible to the raising water constraint and accelerates the lhr increase as the positive sign of εcsh shows on the other hand the high labor need of these crops increases feh slowing the lhr growth as shown by the negative sign and fairly high value of εfeh arable crops farms also divert the summer declining available water to spring summer crops of greater value which increases csw yet the huge water need growth of summer vegetables reduces their total cultivation and decelerates the lhr growth as the negative sign of εcsw shows 5 discussion in representing a wide range of production conditions in italian agriculture we choose very diverse areas from each other and therefore adaptive responses to cc scenarios also diverge the results of the simulated scenarios by the mp models highlight key differences in the modification of land use in particular the cattle farms in the cremona piacenza area increase their self production of forage even up to a 10 water availability drop the lower sensitivity to these restraints is due to the forage crop yields growth that balances the decrease of their cultivation due to the irrigation needs increase in the context of growing water scarcity table 1 on the other hand those farms income levels mainly reduce due to the impact of the cc on milk production which causes greater economic damage than in other areas conversely the salerno farms southern and mainly non livestock adapts basically cutting less profitable activities with higher workloads drastically reducing the employee but also the family labour yet the latter decrease outweighs the farm income drop raising the hourly family wages the oristano area where farms with diverse orientation operate many non irrigated is mid way it shows higher reaction of income and employment to the water availability decline as in the salerno but a certain stability of the cultivation area such as the cremona piacenza area by examining the adaptation paths of the various farm groups we can assess the ability to exploit the yield increase in certain crops or to modify the use of land and agricultural labour in activities that become less profitable in this regard the regression results show that the relationships amongst changes in yields and irrigation needs and changes in workload due to land use modifications is a key factor influencing farming profitability specifically cattle farms are mostly sensitive to cc impacts on fodder crops mainly on corn as table 1 shows the corn hybrids yields vary depending on the area location and the cultivation cycle length and the long cycle hybrid is supposed to benefit more from the greater interception of radiation during the crop cycle even if with large irrigation needs increases cattle farms in the cremona piacenza area manage their land by expanding long cycle maize much of this adaptation is carried out by dairy cattle farms in piacenza which exploit the yield growth of the longer cycle maize hybrid to innovate an originally less intensive system yet due to the labour need of this hybrid its expansion noticeably increases the family labour use and becomes the most accelerating factor in decreasing profitability of dairy cattle farms in piacenza as the high value of εfeh shows 14 14 in fact buying feed rather than producing on farm improves profitability albeit slightly due to the relative increase in purchase costs dairy cattle farms in cremona intensify less and with larger impact of the yield growth 15 15 csh and csh grow much less and csh is more than double of csh while the family labour use increases less in particular the cremona farms are adapting to the new climate and the reduction of water availability by replacing the alfalfa which increases the irrigation needs by 7 5 to maintain the current yield with rain fed ryegrass which increases the yield by 3 9 the surface of the alfalfa decreases by 76 3 that of the ryegrass increases by 289 with limited reductions in water availability the surface of the silage corn as main crop also increases as this crop increases the yield 2 2 although less than the irrigation requirement 6 with more marked reductions in the available water the surface of this corn decreases below the present levels this new use of soil enhances profitability as the increase of labour profitability net of the milk yield drop shows an alternative cultivation could be the ryegrass maize succession 16 16 in which ryegrass increases its yield table 1 the simulated scenarios do not expand the cultivation of the short cycle maize hybrid in the cremona piacenza area because of its yield reduction and its increase in irrigation requirements oristano dairy cattle farms already adopt this succession making more intensive use of land and with higher labor productivity however yield losses of the short cycle corn hybrid coupled to dramatic increases in ryegrass irrigation needs weakens the adaptability lacking irrigated alternatives those farms can respond to water availability decline only by growing lower value crops which reduces water economic productivity the sheep farms have the worst situation these farms are mainly based on rain fed forage crops whose yields drop dramatically this reduces their cultivation and increases the purchase costs of feed reducing the total farming income dedicating limited water available and soil to more productive crops and reducing the use of family labour has very limited effects changes in the use of family labour have marked opposite impacts in fruit greenhouse arable and horticultural farms as indicated by the profitability elasticity over labour use εfeh farms with minor adaptation constraints farms with arable crops alter the use of the soil by increasing irrigation in autumnal and winter periods with only limited increases in irrigation needs as well as slight water availability reductions this maintains or even increases the manpower use by expanding crops with lower labor productivity which slows the growth of farm profitability farms that are structurally constrained in changing land use farms with tree crops greenhouses and rice cultivation reduce the less profitable crops expelling family labour this increases profitability even if at different levels since some farms reduce activities with good levels of labor productivity those results are affected by the lack of simulations of crop yield variations in presence of such effects more significant impacts on income and complex competition dynamics for available water would be grafted into the oristano and salerno areas this is confirmed by the increase in income and labour profitability in the rice farms where the increase in rice yields over irrigation needs allows balancing the cultivated area decrease due to the reduced water availability these results are reflected in various studies findings debaeke and aboudrare 2004 claim that a key adaptation factor is the relationship between water availability and yield levels and crop irrigation needs the authors note that in the presence of severe water shortages shorter cycle hybrids work better due to lower irrigation needs instead longer cycle hybrids with higher irrigation needs work best at sub humid latitudes this difference is relevant in the climate change scenarios that we have simulated since even our largest reduction with 20 less water modifies the availability of water moderately and maintains the characteristics of sub humid areas in our areas this favors relatively longer cycle hybrids boutraa 2010 highlights the relevance of the balance between variations in yields and in irrigation needs highlighting the need to have at the same time higher yields and greater efficiency in water use our findings also confirm the results of soto garcía et al 2013 on water shortages in south eastern spain who associate farms adaptation to the concentration of available water on some highly productive crops the same applies for warnings that various adaptation paths may involve the need to reduce family employment as suggested by chebil et al 2019 for irrigated agriculture in tunisia and hamdan and salman 2005 for jordan 6 conclusions our study contributes to assessing the adaptation paths of farms to the cc analyzing how they can change the general productivity of water and soil resources and consequently the profitability of the family farm labor resource to this end we processed the outcomes of regional mp optimization models of three italian areas with an econometric analysis specific crops and herds sensitivity to climatic conditions generate different cc impacts on farming differences are reinforced when restrictions on water availability are imposed the simulated technologies and impacts allow better adaptation to the core of italian dairy cattle breeding that adopt medium high intensity fodder production systems which is based on longer cycle maize hybrids less adaptation potentials emerge in the systems that even for a context of less water availability manage the land more intensely with the succession of ryegrass and short cycle maize hybrids working to increase this system yield can improve the adaptability in a context of increasing water scarcity sheep milk pastoral systems mainly based on rain fed extensive soil management also suffer and the need to improve the productivity of pastures and dry fodder crops is evident this program is all the more central as the cc impact can increase international feed prices reducing the contribution of feed purchases to the adjustment paths we have shown clearly adapting strategies for dairy cattle farms must consider the cc impacts on milk production examining options that change the herd structure and in general the breeding technologies however these strategies could not be simulated and evaluated with the short term models used in this study arable land farms horticulture fruit and greenhouse mostly localized in southern italy mainly adapt by abandoning crops with lower labor productivity this will decrease family labour and worker employment which is a serious outcome in areas where unemployment rates are already high there is room for different paths i e changing land use by expanding autumnal and winter crops when climate models simulate limited rises in irrigation needs and only slight declines of water availability this strategy allows maintaining and even increasing the family labour use yet it implies a progressive decrease of this resource profitability that could prejudice the survival of these types over time to adapt to new climatic conditions while ensuring a non decreasing wage for family work it is important to combine the increase in crop irrigation needs with an increase in their productivity as far as we know the impact and adaptation to cc have so far been studied with econometric approaches on data observed in the past ricardian analysis or with mp models that simulate future scenarios our study aimed to contribute to the state of the art by using an econometric approach to evaluate the results of ex ante assessments based on mp models future studies could develop an econometric analysis based on functional forms more suitable to represent the impacts and adaptive pathways with the estimated coefficients it is essential to also improve the simulations carried out with mp models all the elements to be integrated into the analysis are the influence of cc on plant diseases and pests the technological development that acts on yields independently of cc as well as the market context for products and factors

cortignani and dono 2018 appendix b regression analysis a quadratic regression estimates the relationships between lhr and the regressors csh csw feh and fph using pooled data of all single farms in the study areas and scenarios the regression allows capturing the possible differences in the intercept coefficient as well as in the slopes coefficients by using variables dummy d the regression model expressed in matrix presentation is the following b 1 y x β d x δ x 2 γ d x 2 θ ε where y is a nx1 vector with n 258 observations 6 simulated scenarios for each of the 43 farms x is a nxk matrix with k 4 number of regressors the model considers four kx1 parameters β refers to the linear terms of the function intercept and slope and δ captures the possible differences of the farms typologies in the intercept and in the slopes coefficients γ refers to the quadratic term of the function slope and θ captures the possible differences of the farms typologies in the quadratic slope coefficients finally ε is the nx1 vector that represents the error term of the regression function the regression was performed using the software ihs eviews ver 7 data fitting was performed with the ordinary least squares method the low level of autocorrelation among the variables was checked trough a spearman s rank correlation test and reinforced the conditions for the regression analysis as mentioned in the paragraph 4 3 the regression analysis was developed by estimating coefficients for farms groupings a priori set up based on structural features that influence adaptation to the simulated changes the dummy variable system was immediately configured to have 8 groupings among the 43 individual farms based on their productive and structural features for these groupings the statistical significance of the difference between the coefficients of the respective intercepts and slopes was evaluated this allowed generating a restricted form of the regression model in which various groupings were further aggregated to present the same estimate value of the intercept and slope coefficients the dummy analysis and the aggregation of various coefficients was carried out based on the t test and on the p values of the single coefficients and using the f test statistic as developed by judge et al 1988 the regression estimates and the relative statistics obtained with aggregation process are reported in the following table b1 which shows how well the quadratic function fitted the data the significance of squared terms for all regressors confirms previous statements from wang et al 2009 who find the quadratic form necessary when dealing with climate related effects 
10318,water reclamation and reuse represent a promising approach to mitigate water related use conflicts especially in the agricultural sector where challenges with regard to water management are increasingly exacerbated by the effects of climate change however for the conceptualization and implementation of non potable water reuse projects for agricultural purposes a comprehensive understanding of the irrigation requirements is required but this information is frequently not readily available within the scope of this study modelling based on the approach implemented within the cropwat 8 0 software was applied in order to determine the irrigation requirements for an agricultural area in gochsheim lower franconia germany since locally recorded data were missing inconsistent or incomplete the model was validated not only by available locally recorded groundwater extraction rates for agricultural irrigation purposes but also by comparison with findings from the literature based thereon the annual and daily crop specific net irrigation requirements of ten commonly cultivated crops were computed those comprised celery lettuce onions potatoes cabbage and others the crops showed crop specific typical annual as well as daily net irrigation requirements e g celery with an annual and daily demand of 228 602 mm and 5 20 mm respectively particularly important for the planning of a water reuse project was the determination of the overall daily peak gross irrigation requirement the modelling approach revealed a value of 14 3 mm day for this area which represents the technically as well as economically most feasible benchmark and a good approximation to the historical recorded overall daily peak gross irrigation demand graphical abstract ga1 keywords non potable

communities across the world face water supply challenges due to increasing demand drought depletion and contamination of groundwater and dependence on single sources of supply miller 2006 wada et al 2012 in the context of increasing use conflicts in the water sector growing uncertainty regarding the availability of already constrained water resources as a consequence of climate change impacts

systems mantovani et al 2001 daigger 2009 maczulak 2010 despite a generally moderate climate even some regions in germany are characterized by increasing use conflicts in the water sector jacob et al 2008 lfu 2009 ruf 2010 these conflicts may arise when in the context of scarce surface and groundwater resources the simultaneous water demand for agricultural irrigation public drinking water supply urban landscape irrigation cooling water demand for energy production industrial and commercial requirements or the requirement to maintain minimum ecological flows exceed the water availability these conflicts occur often seasonally in the spring and summer for several weeks to several months when the water demand in the various sectors is disproportionately high in 2017 the german working group on water issues of the federal states and the federal government published a report on the effects of climate change on water management in germany lawa 2017 the impact of climate change on the flow regime of surface waters e g rivers and streams in a water scarce region such as lower franconia has also been extensively studied altmayer et al 2017 according to the findings of these two studies extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall that can lead to floods and long lasting droughts may occur more often in more severe extents and longer duration with an average annual precipitation of approximately 450 650 mm year the region around würzburg schweinfurt in lower franconia is one of the driest areas in bavaria germany dwd 2018c lfu 2018 especially in the region around the city of schweinfurt fig s1 supplemental information the limited water resources are causing increasing use conflicts in the water sector whereby particularly the local agriculture is affected it is representative for other regions in lower franconia other parts of bavaria but also other regions in germany with similar challenges ruf 2010 moreover the area is characterized by low groundwater recharge rates 25 mm year and by rivers with limited discharge in lower franconia special efforts have always been necessary to ensure the drinking water supply as far as possible from local and well protected groundwater resources in order to ensure an integrated and sustainable management of the locally overexploited groundwater by agriculture ruf 2010 the development of alternative options for the extraction distribution and potential use of stormwater and reclaimed water in particular for urban landscape and agricultural irrigation purposes are urgently needed this is especially important to secure groundwater as the prime source for drinking water supply options that have been neglected in these regions around schweinfurt to compensate for these conflicts are to expand the portfolio of available water resources with so far unused water resources and to replace high quality water resources such as groundwater through local semi decentralized multiple non potable water reuse strategies thereby keeping water in a region longer overall this could substantially reduce the pressure on constrained groundwater resources and is already practiced on large scale in other regions

the inclusion of water reuse in integrated water resources planning represents a promising approach for a sustainable water resource management miller 2006 alcalde sanz and gawlik 2014 however for proper planning of water reuse projects a reliable estimation of the respective demand is required asano and mills 1990 asano 1991 urkiaga et al 2008 thus for an adequate conceptualization and a proper design of the associated infrastructure for a non potable water reuse strategy for agricultural areas such as the region around schweinfurt besides the determination of the crop specific irrigation requirements it is of utmost importance to gain an understanding of the overall gross irrigation requirements in this context particularly the daily peak demand is an important parameter

supplemental information is obliged to record its respective irrigation quantities and to report to the local state agency however since the recorded data were partially incomplete were characterized by low temporal resolution recording of complete annual or monthly irrigation demand but not of daily peak demand and were lacking transparency with regard to the area specific requirement it was necessary to conduct modelling to determine temporal sufficiently resolved water demand data for agricultural irrigation this situation is a common shortcoming and other studies also have reported of lacking consistent information on irrigation water use and highlighted the importance of modelling to compensate for this uncertainty wriedt et al 2009 shen et al 2013 wu et al 2017 shi et al 2018

coefficients seidel et al 2019 the determination of overall daily peak gross irrigation requirements which are especially crucial for planning of non potable water reuse projects is not properly elaborated yet therefore within the scope of this study a modelling approach was developed to determine the crop specific net irrigation demands as well as the overall annual monthly and daily gross irrigation requirements for the local practice of agriculture using the town of gochsheim as a case study the analysis of the modelled data provided the basis for the development of a non potable

irrigation demand for a broader range of many different possible growing scenarios the method was based on the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 savva et al 2002 and is the recommended methodology for calculations of the required reference evapotranspiration if accurate meteorological data are available droogers and allen 2002 feng et al 2017 seidel et al 2019 for a more detailed description of the input data for the model refer to table s1 supplemental information details on the computational approach for the crop specific net irrigation requirements based on allen et al 1998 and savva et al 2002 in which i a also the effective rainfall is taken into account are given within the supplemental information details on computational approach for estimation of the crop specific irrigation requirements for the modelling of the crop specific irrigation demand some simplifications or assumptions were made namely since within the modelling approach the prevention of any water stress for the crops was intended irrigation took place as soon as the critical depletion was reached hence a water stress coefficient ks of 1 was chosen this represented a conservative approach for the determination of the irrigation requirements the full saturation of the soil with water at the beginning of the planting season was assumed this translated into an initial soil moisture depletion ρini of 0 water stored in the soil at the beginning of each period wb soil water content at full saturation field capacity of the soil paw 100 mm m since in the study area around gochsheim the mean groundwater table during the irrigation season april october was usually 1 5 4 m below ground surface fig s6 supplemental information it was assumed that capillary ascent of water into the effective rooting zone did not happen thus groundwater contribution from water table ge was neglected ge 0 leaching requirement was neglected lrmm 0 since based on reports by the local farmers irrigation is performed according to best management practices this is tantamount to the effort to prevent infiltration irrigation scheduling is also a determining factor effecting the irrigation demand in practice farmers irrigate their crops according to subjective assessment mainly based on their personal experience since it was not possible to account for the individual irrigation scheduling of the local farmers it was assumed for modelling that irrigation was performed when the soil water content reached the critical depletion consequently this approach represented an ideal irrigation with regard to crop yield preventing any water stress for the crop and thus preventing any water stress induced crop loss beside the irrigation scheduling also the exact amount of applied irrigation water depends on the subjective irrigation methodology of the local farmers however this could not be reflected in the model hence modelling of irrigation requirements was based on the assumption of full recharge of the field capacity of the soil the overall efficiency of the local irrigation system in gochsheim was estimated by farmers to be approximately 75 85 which was in accordance with the irrigation efficiency of the commonly used stationary irrigation systems sprinklers given in savva et al 2002 or lfl 2008 based thereon for modelling purposes an overall irrigation efficiency of 80 was assumed beside the computation of the crop specific net irrigation requirements also the overall gross irrigation requirements were determined being more specifically the intention was the estimation of the gross irrigation demand for the whole agricultural area in gochsheim for that purpose it was necessary to weight the respective crop specific gross irrigation requirements according to the respective shares of the fields cultivated with the corresponding crops in the total agricultural area in gochsheim in a specific year table s2 supplemental information finally the sum total of the weighted crop specific gross irrigation requirements was calculated 1 i r g o v e r a l l i k 1 n f i i r g k w i t h f i a r e a o f f i e l d i c u l t i v a t e d w i t h c r o p k t o t a l a g r i c u l t u r

meteorological service dwd at the climate station located in bad kissingen lower franconia germany were fed into the model for a representative as well as comprehensive estimation of the agricultural irrigation requirement dwd 2018b the climate station bad kissingen distance to the planning area approximately 28 km provided a comprehensive climate record precipitation temperature wind speed

determining factors influencing the agricultural irrigation demand savva et al 2002 gleysol and gleyic cambisol consisting of silt loam or clay but also stagnic luvisol pseudogley and cambisol pseudogley consisting of sand to loamy sand were predominant in the agricultural area of gochsheim fig s3 supplemental information the topsoil in the agricultural area of gochsheim consisted mainly of loamy sands as well as loamy clay bgr geoviewer 2020 fig s2 supplemental information based on the knowledge of the soil type the soil specific characteristics table 1 were deduced according to amelung et al 2018 the values in table 1 were in accordance with results regarding the effective rooting zone rze as well as the plant available water paw obtained from the bgr geoviewer 2020 fig s4 supplemental information with an average depth of rze of 0 9 m the paw ranged between 100 155 mm m table 1 and fig s4 supplemental information in order to make conservative and therefore not too optimistic assumptions with regard to paw and for the modelling of the irrigation requirements a paw of 100 mm m was used for further calculations with 73 3 mm the maximum daily precipitation in the planning area in the period from 1973 to 2019 was smaller than the assumed maximum rain infiltration rate of approximately 90 96 mm according to maniak 2016 for medium deep sandy soils loess or loamy sand soils fig s2 in supplemental information thus this parameter could be neglected for further calculations since the largest part of the agricultural area in gochsheim could be characterized by a maximum rooting depth rzmax of 2 m fig s5 supplemental information it was assumed that crop roots did not reach this depth and therefore crops were not limited in their physiological potential rooting depth with regard to the initial soil moisture no data were available however an initial soil moisture depletion ρini of 0 was assumed which is equivalent to a full saturation of the available field capacity of the soil this in turn meant that the initial available soil moisture pawini corresponded to total available soil moisture 2 5 crop data and parameters the bavarian state research center for agriculture bayerische landesanstalt für landwirtschaft provided information on area specific sectoral agricultural use in form of data extracted from the integrated administration and control system iacs from 2016 to 2019 various types of vegetables such as cabbage lettuce sugar beet onions potatoes and ornamental plants were grown prior to 2016 no distinction was made between the certain types of vegetables it was merely given that the agricultural land was mainly cultivated with vegetables however it was unknown which specific crops have been grouped together under the collective term vegetables sugar beets ornamental plants and potatoes were also cultivated and in the years before 2012 aromatic medicinal and culinary plants such as herbs for the period prior to the year 2005 no information was available regarding the agricultural land management thus based on iacs data assumptions had been made on the cultivated crops and their corresponding area fractions for a detailed overview of the cultivated crops and their respective area fractions for the period from 2005 to 2019 refer to table s2 in supplemental information the lengths of the growth stages of the different crops were inferred from savva et al 2002 for the region europe if data were specifically lacking for europe the most plausible data from other regions were chosen instead table s3 supplemental information most of the required crop coefficients kc were obtained from hochschule geisenheim 2019 or bbch 2001 where the respective data were missing the crop coefficients according to allen et al 1998 or savva et al 2002 were used the initial rooting depths of the various crops 0 25 m were also taken from allen et al 1998 or savva et al 2002 the maximum values of the rooting depths if available were obtained from information provided by the dwd 2018a otherwise also from the information given by allen et al 1998 or savva et al 2002 the values for the critical depletion ρcritical required for modelling were obtained from savva et al 2002 and blz 2017 table s3 supplemental information the intention of the applied modelling approach was the conservative estimation of agricultural irrigation demand therefore within the applied modelling approach ideal irrigation was assumed which is equivalent to no occurrence of any crop loss thus the yield response factor which accounts for reduction in crop yield when crop stress would be caused by shortage of soil water savva et al 2002 was neglected for model computations according to the local farmers in gochsheim the growing period in the region was from april to october no information was available on the individual planting and harvesting data of the individual crops cultivated in the past on the various agricultural fields therefore assumptions had to be made in this regard these assumptions were based on a literature review for the individual crops that were considered in the model according to this most of the cultivated crops were planted in the period from beginning of april to mid of may for most crops harvesting was assumed to take place mid end of october occasionally end of november beginning of december the temporal distribution of recorded groundwater pumping rates for agricultural irrigation further confirmed this assumption fig s7 supplemental information the study area of gochsheim was characterized by numerous individual independent and separate agricultural fields on each of these fields crops were cultivated during different periods furthermore occasionally during a season e g april november different crops on the same field were grown thus in order to account for the effects of different cultivation start times the irrigation demand was modelled for 45 different cultivation start times per year beginning from april and ending with mid of may 45 days every day was assumed as start of the respective cultivation in order to cover the specified main cultivation period from april to mid of may more detailed information to all crop specific assumptions required for modelling the agricultural irrigation demand in gochsheim are summarized in table s3 supplemental information 2 6 groundwater pumping rates for agricultural irrigation recorded irrigation data required for the validation of the model were obtained directly from the local farmers monthly resolved groundwater extraction rates for irrigation purposes as well as the irrigated land area were available for the years 2014 2018 since the recorded data had been documented manually by the individual farmers they often lacked transparency or consistency therefore a range was calculated within that the recorded irrigation demand data most probably laid 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of the modelling approach when comparing the range of irrigation demands determined by the model with the recorded actual irrigation demands for the years 2014 2018 two different scenarios could be identified characterized as average 2014 2016 2017 and dry 2015 2018 years respectively fig 1 for the first scenario comprising the years 2014 2016 and 2017 the ranges but also the medians as well as arithmetic means of the modelled data were in accordance with the respective recorded actual data for all of these years the modelled irrigation demand ranged between 175 and 240 mm with a median and arithmetic mean irrigation demand of approximately 200 230 mm fig 1 in the second scenario consisting of the years 2015 and 2018 the modelled irrigation demands were significantly higher than for the other years and exceeded the respective recorded actual data consistently by a factor of about 1 3 1 4 with regard to the respective arithmetic means the modelled mean irrigation demand for both years were 320 and 340 mm respectively while the yearly mean value of the recorded actual demand data for both years was about 240 mm fig 1 in general for both years 2015 as well as 2018 relatively high modelled but also recorded actual irrigation requirements were observed this substantial difference between the recorded actual and modelled data for these years could be attributed to the fact that both years 2015 and 2018 had low precipitation 200 mm relatively high temperatures above average horizontal lines in fig 2 and thus high et0 rates during crop season from april to october mean temperature in 2015 14 5 c and et0 of 700 mm mean temperature in 2018 16 5 c and et0 of 800 mm fig 2 2018 had been an extremely dry and hot year marx 2019 consequently the overall annual gross irrigation requirement computed by the model was significantly higher than that of the other years however the recorded actual demand did not follow this particular pattern thus the corresponding overall annual gross irrigation requirement was less high than it would be expected for such a dry and hot year the mean of the modelled overall annual gross irrigation requirement therefore overestimated the respective recorded actual value by 42 when displaying the modelled overall gross irrigation demand in monthly resolution for both years 2015 and 2018 and by the simultaneous comparison with the respective recorded actual demand values fig 3 it was obvious that the modelled overall monthly gross irrigation data consistently overestimated the recorded actual monthly data for the period from april to august only the month of september did not fit into that pattern since in this month the modelled irrigation requirement was less than the recorded actual demand however the local farmers reported that during hot and dry years such as 2015 and 2018 even for the month of september irrigation was necessary to soak the dry and hard soil with water in order to soften it and enable harvesting particularly for root crops consequently groundwater was extracted not for compensating the deficit of the crop water requirement but for harvesting reason the reasons for the overestimation and differences between the irrigation demand determined by the model approach and the recorded actual irrigation demand particularly for the hot and dry years 2015 as well as 2018 were likely caused by the following reasons scheduling of the irrigation the irrigation schedule of farmers with regard to the irrigation frequency and extent was unknown the irrigation scheduling in the model was based on the soil moisture balance and always irrigated to full therefore ideal soil water saturation capacity in contrast in reality farmers irrigate purely according to subjective measurements i e not according to the idealized model irrigation crop losses according to the board of the irrigation association in gochsheim at least 15 20 crop losses were reported for 2018 due to insufficient irrigation this means that an optimal irrigation for the prevention of the corresponding crop losses would also have required correspondingly higher amounts of irrigation in reality in the model calculation this optimal ideal irrigation was assumed without any crop loss and therefore resulted in higher irrigation demands assuming the reported crop loss as a corresponding reduction in supply security by 15 20 allowed the comparison of the actual irrigation demand of 210 275 mm for 2018 fig 1 with the range between the 80 and 85 quantile of the annual modelled irrigation demand of 218 240 mm fig 7 accordingly the modelled irrigation requirement for ensuring an 80 85 supply security was in very good agreement with the respective recorded irrigation demand for the year 2018 during which a crop loss of about 15 20 had been experienced this finding further provided a strong indication of the validity of the model based on these results the modelled irrigation requirement represented a good approximation of the actual overall annual gross irrigation demand for years characterized by sufficient rainfall and moderate temperatures such as the years 2014 2016 and 2017 during these years no crop losses occurred which meant that the applied irrigation quantity was sufficient for preventing any water stress for the crops for years with high temperatures and insufficient precipitation thus increased et0 during the main irrigation season from april to october fig 2 the reported crop losses could have been mitigated by sufficient ideal irrigation as it was computed by the model therefore the modelled overall annual gross irrigation demand for these years also represented a good approximation of the actual needed overall annual gross irrigation requirements based thereon the modelling of a broader database for a holistic estimation of the annual but in particular of the daily irrigation demand was possible along with the comprehensive discussion of the other model results even additional aspects confirming the validity of the applied model approach were elaborated within the sections 3 2 and 3 3 however these were omitted for this section 3 2 crop specific net irrigation requirements the crop specific annual net irrigation requirements for ten different crops were modelled fig 4 these modelled irrigation requirement data were statistically analyzed and compared with irrigation requirement data adapted from paschold and beltz 2010 as well as zinkernagel et al 2017 table 2 for the simulation period from 1973 to 2019 the most water intensive crop was celery with a mean and maximum annual net irrigation demand of 371 mm and 602 mm respectively onions had the second highest annual net irrigation requirement with a corresponding mean and maximum of 242 mm and 427 mm respectively the discrepancies in the annual net irrigation requirements of the various crops were mainly due to their different crop coefficients kc because the higher the kc the higher the crop specific evapotranspiration and consequently the corresponding crop specific irrigation required allen et al 1998 savva et al 2002 hochschule geisenheim 2019 for instance with the highest crop specific annual net irrigation requirement of 228 602 mm year celery table 2 is simultaneously characterized by the highest kc value ranging between 0 5 and 1 4 kc table s3 supplemental information the results with regard to the crop specific annual net irrigation demands were comparable to the findings given by paschold and beltz 2010 as well as zinkernagel et al 2017 within their studies they determined e g for celery onion as well as potato arithmetic mean annual net irrigation requirements with 300 320 mm 259 304 mm and 138 172 mm respectively table 2 in addition the maximum values of the crop specific annual net irrigation demands determined by the model table 2 were also in good agreement with the corresponding results presented by paschold and beltz 2010 and zinkernagel et al 2017 the estimations with regard to the crop specific annual net irrigation demand by paschold and beltz 2010 as well as zinkernagel et al 2017 were again just recently november 2019 confirmed within the german technical guidance document dwa m 590 2019 beside the annual crop specific net irrigation demand also the daily crop specific net irrigation requirements were determined fig 5 table 3 the most water intensive crop on a daily basis constituted ornamental plants with a minimum arithmetic mean and maximum daily irrigation requirement of 15 mm 41 mm and 64 mm respectively the relatively high daily net irrigation demand for this crop in comparison to the remaining crops was attributed to the relatively high critical depletion at the middle critical depletion 0 45 and the end of the crop development critical depletion 0 8 table s3 supplemental information since irrigation was assumed to always take place as soon as the critical depletion of the crop had been reached the following applied the lower the critical depletion the sooner and more often irrigation was required for higher critical depletion values however more irrigation was required in fewer days allen et al 1998 savva et al 2002 the same explanation applied for the relatively high net irrigation demand of sugar beet or in reverse logic for the relatively low net irrigation demand e g typical for lettuce celery or onions table s3 in supplemental information for crop specific critical depletion values and became also obvious by analyzing the number of irrigation days n in table 3 by comparing the modelled daily net irrigation requirement data with corresponding data from literature table 3 again the similarity became obvious and by that the validity with regard to daily net irrigation requirement was confirmed for instance the arithmetic means of the modelled daily net irrigation requirements for cabbage celery or potato were 19 mm 12 mm and 28 mm respectively while the corresponding data given by gallichand et al 1991 were 14 24 mm 6 14 mm and 18 30 mm respectively the overall good agreement of the modelled crop specific annual as well as daily irrigation requirement data with corresponding data from the literature further supported the validity of the model on the other hand it might allow an assessment of the crop specific irrigation demand for future planning purposes by the local farmers and might even provide a useful tool for decision making on the choice of crops in the context of climate change effects or in general as guide for designing irrigation equipment and reservoirs gallichand et al 1991 3 3 overall gross irrigation requirements the overall gross irrigation requirements for the past 47 years 1973 2019 were derived from the modelling results according to section 2 2 in order to create the broadest possible database for estimating the overall irrigation demand in the agricultural area in gochsheim the range of the overall annual gross irrigation requirements determined by the model for this period for gochsheim is visualized in fig 6 in form of box whisker plots a close relationship between climate characteristics and the corresponding quantitative overall irrigation requirements exits as can be inferred from fig 2 and fig 6 years with a high mean temperature 15 c and low precipitation 250 300 mm during the main irrigation season such as the years 1976 2003 2015 and 2018 tended to have relatively high irrigation demands with 290 360 mm this close interdependence between the irrigation demand and the climate data further confirmed the plausibility of the irrigation requirement results generated by the model for 50 of the modelled scenarios an annual overall gross irrigation of 171 mm median would have been sufficient table 4 fig 7 upper right panel the median was similar to the arithmetic mean of the annual overall gross irrigation requirement of 181 mm table 4 according to fig 1 these values median and arithmetic mean of modelled data were close to the recorded overall gross irrigation demand of about 185 mm for the year 2014 with its precipitation and its mean temperature during the main irrigation season being nearly the same as the long term mean 1973 2019 the year 2014 was actually representative for a normal year this again proofed the validity of the model approach according to the modelled data the overall annual gross demand would have been covered with a 95 certainty if 322 mm had been supplied and by providing 367 mm per year even the maximum of the modelled irrigation demand could have been sufficiently met covered this upper range of the modeled annual irrigation requirements 322 367 mm was in close agreement with an estimate of the overall annual gross irrigation demand for an extreme hot and dry year by the engineering consulting firm bgs umwelt gmbh a collaborating partner within the project for which this model was performed furthermore the results were in good agreement with modelling results for that area by wriedt et al 2009 having determined a range min max of the net irrigation requirements between 122 and 239 mm simulation period 1995 2002 which translated to gross irrigation requirements of 153 299 mm under the assumption of an overall irrigation efficiency of 80 in summary according to the modelling results as well as recorded actual irrigation requirement data for a normal year e g represented by 2014 an overall annual gross irrigation requirement of about 170 190 mm will be sufficient while during an extreme hot as well as dry year such as 2015 or 2018 the overall annual gross irrigation demand might double 322 367 mm in order to guarantee an adequate irrigation of the local crops in gochsheim and preventing any crop loss the implementation of non potable water reuse projects including required infrastructure for a whole agricultural area such in gochsheim needs a comprehensive understanding of the respective local water demand asano and mills 1990 asano 1991 urkiaga et al 2008 especially the overall daily peak gross irrigation demand is of utmost importance for the planning and design of pumps storage irrigation systems und water treatment facilities for non potable water reuse watts 1968 wright and jensen 1972 khadra and lamaddalena 2006 gallichand et al 1991 therefore based on the previous confirmation of the validity of the modelling approach and in addition to the overall annual gross irrigation requirements a higher temporal resolution was created by computing overall daily gross irrigation requirements for the whole agricultural area in gochsheim according to the cumulative frequency distribution fig 7 bottom two panels and the corresponding statistical analysis table 4 50 median of the modelled overall daily gross irrigation requirements were less than 3 0 mm the arithmetic mean with 4 4 mm was 47 higher than the median by a provision of 38 7 mm even the maximum of the overall daily gross irrigation requirements could have been covered however the provision of the maximum overall daily gross irrigation requirement of 38 7 mm would not have been feasible the complete agricultural area in gochsheim to be irrigated summed up to about 55 60 ha assuming that a maximum of 20 ha had been irrigated at one day this would have translated into a demand of 7740 m3 day if this amount had been applied in 4 h which was a common time for the local irrigation applications in gochsheim a water flow of 1935 m3 hour would have been required with a technically common flow velocity of 0 8 1 m sec within the main supply pipe this would have resulted into a corresponding pipe diameter of 100 cm not only the costs of the construction of the corresponding pipe trench but also the costs for the pipes itself or the corresponding treatment plant if wastewater reclamation had been considered would not be economically feasible in the context of the local conditions in gochsheim furthermore the probability of the event that the maximum of 38 7 mm was needed could be neglected 1 15 10 5 in contrast the 95 quantile of the overall daily gross irrigation requirement of 14 3 mm table 4 fig 7 represented a more economically as well as technically feasible benchmark moreover the value was also comparable to not only the overall daily gross peak irrigation requirement reported by the local farmers but also to an estimation derived from bgs umwelt apparently for planning of non potable water reuse projects and in the case of lacking recorded data modelling based on the cropwat 8 0 approach allen et al 1998 combined with statistical analysis constituted a helpful approach for estimating useful and plausible benchmarks of the overall daily peak irrigation requirement 4 conclusion modelling is a viable and cost effective approach for estimating irrigation demand data for a proper planning of non potable water reuse projects so far most studies in this field focus on the determination of annually or monthly resolved crop requirement data the proper estimation of overall daily peak demand data crucial for planning of agricultural water reuse projects is usually not addressed if accurate meteorological data are available the computational approach on which the cropwat 8 0 is based on a software provided by the fao constitutes an easy to implement model by a simulation of a broad range of different possible growing scenarios and a comprehensive visual as well as statistical analysis of the modelled data i a the crop specific irrigation requirements which are useful measures for the irrigation and water management planning of individual farmers can be evaluated furthermore by this modelling approach and a corresponding weighting of the calculated crop specific gross irrigation requirements even the more important overall daily monthly or annual peak gross irrigation requirements for a whole agricultural area can be estimated in particular the overall daily peak gross irrigation requirements represent the basis for adequate design of a non potable water reuse infrastructure the approach for the determination of this value utilized in this study can also be easily as well as cost effectively applied to other comparable projects since only a limited and usually well available data set meteorological soil and crop data is required however since this applied modelling approach constitutes a rather conservative assessment of the overall daily peak irrigation demand the technically and economically most feasible demand value should be determined based on a statistical analysis taking into account the local desired security of supply the results within this study revealed that the 95 quantile of the modelled daily irrigation demand with 14 3 mm represented a viable benchmark for the design of infrastructure required for the non potable water reuse project for agricultural purposes in gochsheim a municipality in lower franconia as a final conclusion this approach and the results constitute a viable as well as helpful basis not only for the agricultural management of individual local farmers but in particular an essential prerequisite for the planning of non potable water reuse projects for agricultural purposes adapted to the local conditions declaration of competing

10318,water reclamation and reuse represent a promising approach to mitigate water related use conflicts especially in the agricultural sector where challenges with regard to water management are increasingly exacerbated by the effects of climate change however for the conceptualization and implementation of non potable water reuse projects for agricultural purposes a comprehensive understanding of the irrigation requirements is required but this information is frequently not readily available within the scope of this study modelling based on the approach implemented within the cropwat 8 0 software was applied in order to determine the irrigation requirements for an agricultural area in gochsheim lower franconia germany since locally recorded data were missing inconsistent or incomplete the model was validated not only by available locally recorded groundwater extraction rates for agricultural irrigation purposes but also by comparison with findings from the literature based thereon the annual and daily crop specific net irrigation requirements of ten commonly cultivated crops were computed those comprised celery lettuce onions potatoes cabbage and others the crops showed crop specific typical annual as well as daily net irrigation requirements e g celery with an annual and daily demand of 228 602 mm and 5 20 mm respectively particularly important for the planning of a water reuse project was the determination of the overall daily peak gross irrigation requirement the modelling approach revealed a value of 14 3 mm day for this area which represents the technically as well as economically most feasible benchmark and a good approximation to the historical recorded overall daily peak gross irrigation demand graphical abstract ga1 keywords non potable

urban landscape irrigation cooling water demand for energy production industrial and commercial requirements or the requirement to maintain minimum ecological flows exceed the water availability these conflicts occur often seasonally in the spring and summer for several weeks to several months when the water demand in the various sectors is disproportionately high in 2017 the german working group on water issues of the federal states and the federal government published a report on the effects of climate change on water management in germany lawa 2017 the impact of climate change on the flow regime of surface waters e g rivers and streams in a water scarce region such as lower franconia has also been extensively studied altmayer et al 2017 according to the findings of these two studies extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall that can lead to floods and long lasting droughts may occur more often in more severe extents and longer duration with an average annual precipitation of approximately 450 650 mm year the region around würzburg schweinfurt in lower franconia is one of the driest areas in bavaria germany dwd 2018c lfu 2018 especially in the region around the city of

representative for other regions in lower franconia other parts of bavaria but also other regions in germany with similar challenges ruf 2010 moreover the area is characterized by low groundwater recharge rates 25 mm year and by rivers with limited discharge in lower franconia special efforts have always been necessary to ensure the drinking water supply as far as possible from local and well protected groundwater resources in order to ensure an integrated and sustainable management of the locally overexploited groundwater by agriculture ruf 2010 the development of alternative options for the extraction distribution and potential use of stormwater and reclaimed water in particular for urban landscape and agricultural irrigation purposes are urgently needed this is especially important to secure groundwater as the prime source for drinking water supply options that have been neglected in these regions around schweinfurt to compensate for these conflicts are to expand the portfolio of available water resources with so far unused water resources and to replace high quality water resources such as groundwater through local semi decentralized multiple non potable water reuse strategies thereby keeping water in a region longer overall this could substantially reduce the pressure on constrained groundwater resources and is already practiced on large scale in other regions

the inclusion of water reuse in integrated water resources planning represents a promising approach for a sustainable water resource management miller 2006 alcalde sanz and gawlik 2014 however for proper planning of water reuse projects a reliable estimation of the respective demand is required asano and mills 1990 asano 1991 urkiaga et al 2008 thus for an adequate conceptualization and a proper design of the associated infrastructure for a non potable water reuse strategy for agricultural areas such as the region around schweinfurt besides the determination of the crop specific irrigation requirements it is of utmost importance to gain an understanding of the overall gross irrigation requirements in this context particularly the daily peak demand is an important parameter watts 1968 wright and jensen 1972 khadra and lamaddalena 2006 mariño et al 1993 gallichand et al 1991 the local irrigation association of gochsheim neighboring municipality of schweinfurt fig s1 supplemental information is obliged to record its respective irrigation quantities and to report to the local state agency however since the recorded data were partially incomplete were characterized by low temporal resolution recording of complete annual or monthly irrigation demand but not of daily peak demand and were lacking transparency with regard to the area specific requirement it was necessary to conduct modelling to determine temporal sufficiently resolved water demand data for agricultural irrigation this situation is a common shortcoming and other studies also have reported of lacking consistent information on irrigation water use and highlighted the importance of modelling to compensate for this uncertainty wriedt et al 2009 shen et al 2013 wu et al 2017 shi et al 2018 abolafia rosenzweig et al 2019 seidel et al 2019 lópez lambraño et al 2020 mansour et al 2020a 2020b within these and also further studies foster et al 2019 le page et al 2020 li et al 2020a 2020b zambrano vaca et al 2020 the estimation of irrigation water requirements has been comprehensively addressed however either the determination of the irrigation requirements of only a single crop was performed zambrano vaca et al 2020 only annually or monthly resolved demand data were determined shen et al 2013 shi et al 2018 le page et al 2020 li et al 2020a 2020b lópez lambraño et al 2020 the determination of the crop water requirement was based solely on soil moisture data that are not easily available abolafia rosenzweig et al 2019 or the focus was only laid on the estimation of crop coefficients seidel et al 2019 the determination of overall daily peak gross irrigation requirements which are especially crucial for planning of non potable water reuse projects is not properly elaborated yet therefore within the scope of this study a modelling approach was developed to determine the crop specific net irrigation demands as well as the overall annual monthly and daily gross irrigation requirements for the local practice of agriculture using the town of gochsheim as a case study the analysis of the modelled data provided the basis for the development of a non potable water reuse project for agricultural purposes adapted to the local conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the study site with a total area of about 55 60 ha was located near schweinfurt 50 049206 n 10 219422 e in lower franconia in northern bavaria germany at an altitude of 210 240 m above sea level fig s1 supplemental information 2 2 computational approach for the estimation of the irrigation demand modelling of the agricultural irrigation requirement was performed by using the general purpose programming language python and was based on the same computational procedure as applied in the cropwat 8 0 software freely available from the united nations food and agriculture organization fao the implementation of the cropwat 8 0 software into python allowed modelling of the irrigation demand for a broader range of many different possible growing scenarios the method was based on the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 savva et al 2002 and is the recommended methodology for calculations of the required reference evapotranspiration if accurate meteorological data are available droogers and allen 2002 feng et al 2017 seidel et al 2019 for a more detailed description of the input data for the model refer to table s1 supplemental information details on the computational approach for the crop specific net irrigation requirements based on allen et al 1998 and savva et al 2002 in which i a also the effective rainfall is taken into account are given within the supplemental information details on computational approach for estimation of the crop specific irrigation requirements for the modelling of the crop specific irrigation demand some simplifications or assumptions were made namely since within the modelling approach the prevention of any water stress for the crops was intended irrigation took place as soon as the critical depletion was reached hence a water stress coefficient ks of 1 was chosen this represented a conservative approach for the determination of the irrigation requirements the full saturation of the soil with water at the beginning of the planting season was assumed this translated into an initial soil moisture depletion ρini of 0 water stored in the soil at the beginning of each period wb soil water content at full saturation field capacity of the soil paw 100 mm m since in the study area around gochsheim the mean groundwater table during the irrigation season april october was usually 1 5 4 m below ground surface fig s6 supplemental information it was assumed that capillary ascent of water into the effective rooting zone did not happen thus groundwater contribution from water table ge was neglected ge 0 leaching requirement was neglected lrmm 0 since based on reports by the local farmers irrigation is performed according to best management practices this is tantamount to the effort to prevent infiltration irrigation scheduling is also a determining factor effecting the irrigation demand in practice farmers irrigate their crops according to subjective assessment mainly based on their personal experience since it was not possible to account for the individual irrigation scheduling of the local farmers it was assumed for modelling that irrigation was performed when the soil water content reached the critical depletion consequently this approach represented an ideal irrigation with regard to crop yield preventing any water stress for the crop and thus preventing any water stress induced crop loss beside the irrigation scheduling also the exact amount of applied irrigation water depends on the subjective irrigation methodology of the local farmers however this could not be reflected in the model hence modelling of irrigation requirements was based on the assumption of full recharge of the field capacity of the soil the overall efficiency of the local irrigation system in gochsheim was estimated by farmers to be approximately 75 85 which was in accordance with the irrigation efficiency of the commonly used stationary irrigation systems sprinklers given in savva et al 2002 or lfl 2008 based thereon for modelling purposes an overall irrigation efficiency of 80 was assumed beside the computation of the crop specific net irrigation requirements also the overall gross irrigation requirements were determined being more specifically the intention was the estimation of the gross irrigation demand for the whole agricultural area in gochsheim for that purpose it was necessary to weight the respective crop specific gross irrigation requirements according to the respective shares of the fields cultivated with the corresponding crops in the total agricultural area in gochsheim in a specific year table s2 supplemental information finally the sum total of the weighted crop specific gross irrigation requirements was calculated 1 i r g o v e r a l l i k 1 n f i i r g k w i t h f i a r e a o f f i e l d i c u l t i v a t e d w i t h c r o p k t o t a l a g r i c u l t u r

meteorological service dwd at the climate station located in bad kissingen lower franconia germany were fed into the model for a representative as well as comprehensive estimation of the agricultural irrigation requirement dwd 2018b the climate station bad kissingen distance to the planning area approximately 28 km provided a comprehensive climate record precipitation temperature wind speed

determining factors influencing the agricultural irrigation demand savva et al 2002 gleysol and gleyic cambisol consisting of silt loam or clay but also stagnic luvisol pseudogley and cambisol pseudogley consisting of sand to loamy sand were predominant in the agricultural area of gochsheim fig s3 supplemental information the topsoil in the agricultural area of gochsheim consisted mainly of loamy sands as well as loamy clay bgr geoviewer 2020 fig s2 supplemental information based on the knowledge of the soil type the soil specific characteristics table 1 were deduced according to amelung et al 2018 the values in table 1 were in accordance with results regarding the effective rooting zone rze as well as the plant available water paw obtained from the bgr geoviewer 2020 fig s4 supplemental information with an average depth of rze of 0 9 m the paw ranged between 100 155 mm m table 1 and fig s4 supplemental information in order to make conservative and therefore not too optimistic assumptions with regard to paw and for the modelling of the irrigation requirements a paw of 100 mm m was used for further calculations with 73 3 mm the maximum daily precipitation in the planning area in the period from 1973 to 2019 was smaller than the assumed maximum rain infiltration rate of approximately 90 96 mm according to maniak 2016 for medium deep sandy soils loess or loamy sand soils fig s2 in supplemental information thus this parameter could be neglected for further calculations since the largest part of the agricultural area in gochsheim could be characterized by a maximum rooting depth rzmax of 2 m fig s5 supplemental information it was assumed that crop roots did not reach this depth and therefore crops were not limited in their physiological potential rooting depth with regard to the initial soil moisture no data were available however an initial soil moisture depletion ρini of 0 was assumed which is equivalent to a full saturation of the available field capacity of the soil this in turn meant that the initial available soil moisture pawini corresponded to total available soil moisture 2 5 crop data and parameters the bavarian state research center for agriculture bayerische landesanstalt für landwirtschaft provided information on area specific sectoral agricultural use in form of data extracted from the integrated administration and control system iacs from 2016 to 2019 various types of vegetables such as cabbage lettuce sugar beet onions potatoes and ornamental plants were grown prior to 2016 no distinction was made between the certain types of vegetables it was merely given that the agricultural land was mainly cultivated with vegetables however it was unknown which specific crops have been grouped together under the collective term vegetables sugar beets ornamental plants and potatoes were also cultivated and in the years before 2012 aromatic medicinal and culinary plants such as herbs for the period prior to the year 2005 no information was available regarding the agricultural land management thus based on iacs data assumptions had been made on the cultivated crops and their corresponding area fractions for a detailed overview of the cultivated crops and their respective area fractions for the period from 2005 to 2019 refer to table s2 in supplemental information the lengths of the growth stages of the different crops were inferred from savva et al 2002 for the region europe if data were specifically lacking for europe the most plausible data from other regions were chosen instead table s3 supplemental information most of the required crop coefficients kc were obtained from hochschule geisenheim 2019 or bbch 2001 where the respective data were missing the crop coefficients according to allen et al 1998 or savva et al 2002 were used the initial rooting depths of the various crops 0 25 m were also taken from allen et al 1998 or savva et al 2002 the maximum values of the rooting depths if available were obtained from information provided by the dwd 2018a otherwise also from the information given by allen et al 1998 or savva et al 2002 the values for the critical depletion ρcritical required for modelling were obtained from savva et al 2002 and blz 2017 table s3 supplemental information the intention of the applied modelling approach was the conservative estimation of agricultural irrigation demand therefore within the applied modelling approach ideal irrigation was assumed which is equivalent to no occurrence of any crop loss thus the yield response factor which accounts for reduction in crop yield when crop stress would be caused by shortage of soil water savva et al 2002 was neglected for model computations according to the local farmers in gochsheim the growing period in the region was from april to october no information was available on the individual planting and harvesting data of the individual crops cultivated in the past on the various agricultural fields therefore assumptions had to be made in this regard these assumptions were based on a literature review for the individual crops that were considered in the model according to this most of the cultivated crops were planted in the period from beginning of april to mid of may for most crops harvesting was assumed to take place mid end of october occasionally end of november beginning of december the temporal distribution of recorded groundwater pumping rates for agricultural irrigation further confirmed this assumption fig s7 supplemental information the study area of gochsheim was characterized by numerous individual independent and separate agricultural fields on each of these fields crops were cultivated during different periods furthermore occasionally during a season e g april november different crops on the same field were grown thus in order to account for the effects of different cultivation start times the irrigation demand was modelled for 45 different cultivation start times per year beginning from april and ending with mid of may 45 days every day was assumed as start of the respective cultivation in order to cover the specified main cultivation period from april to mid of may more detailed information to all crop specific assumptions required for modelling the agricultural irrigation demand in gochsheim are summarized in table s3 supplemental information 2 6 groundwater pumping rates for agricultural irrigation recorded irrigation data required for the validation of the model were obtained directly from the local farmers monthly resolved groundwater extraction rates for irrigation purposes as well as the irrigated land area were available for the years 2014 2018 since the recorded data had been documented manually by the individual farmers they often lacked transparency or consistency therefore a range was calculated within that the recorded irrigation demand data most probably laid 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of the modelling approach when comparing the range of irrigation demands determined by the model with the recorded actual irrigation demands for the years 2014 2018 two different scenarios could be identified characterized as average 2014 2016 2017 and dry 2015 2018 years respectively fig 1 for the first scenario comprising the years 2014 2016 and 2017 the ranges but also the medians as well as arithmetic means of the modelled data were in accordance with the respective recorded actual data for all of these years the modelled irrigation demand ranged between 175 and 240 mm with a median and arithmetic mean irrigation demand of approximately 200 230 mm fig 1 in the second scenario consisting of the years 2015 and 2018 the modelled irrigation demands were significantly higher than for the other years and exceeded the respective recorded actual data consistently by a factor of about 1 3 1 4 with regard to the respective arithmetic means the modelled mean irrigation demand for both years were 320 and 340 mm respectively while the yearly mean value of the recorded actual demand data for both years was about 240 mm fig 1 in general for both years 2015 as well as 2018 relatively high modelled but also recorded actual irrigation requirements were observed this substantial difference between the recorded actual and modelled data for these years could be attributed to the fact that both years 2015 and 2018 had low precipitation 200 mm relatively high temperatures above average horizontal lines in fig 2 and thus high et0 rates during crop season from april to october mean temperature in 2015 14 5 c and et0 of 700 mm mean temperature in 2018 16 5 c and et0 of 800 mm fig 2 2018 had been an extremely dry and hot year marx 2019 consequently the overall annual gross irrigation requirement computed by the model was significantly higher than that of the other years however the recorded actual demand did not follow this particular pattern thus the corresponding overall annual gross irrigation requirement was less high than it would be expected for such a dry and hot year the mean of the modelled overall annual gross irrigation requirement therefore overestimated the respective recorded actual value by 42 when displaying the modelled overall gross irrigation demand in monthly resolution for both years 2015 and 2018 and by the simultaneous comparison with the respective recorded actual demand values fig 3 it was obvious that the modelled overall monthly gross irrigation data consistently overestimated the recorded actual monthly data for the period from april to august only the month of september did not fit into that pattern since in this month the modelled irrigation requirement was less than the recorded actual demand however the local farmers reported that during hot and dry years such as 2015 and 2018 even for the month of september irrigation was necessary to soak the dry and hard soil with water in order to soften it and enable harvesting particularly for root crops consequently groundwater was extracted not for compensating the deficit of the crop water requirement but for harvesting reason the reasons for the overestimation and differences between the irrigation demand determined by the model approach and the recorded actual irrigation demand particularly for the hot and dry years 2015 as well as 2018 were likely caused by the following reasons scheduling of the irrigation the irrigation schedule of farmers with regard to the irrigation frequency and extent was unknown the irrigation scheduling in the model was based on the soil moisture balance and always irrigated to full therefore ideal soil water saturation capacity in contrast in reality farmers irrigate purely according to subjective measurements i e not according to the idealized model irrigation crop losses according to the board of the irrigation association in gochsheim at least 15 20 crop losses were reported for 2018 due to insufficient irrigation this means that an optimal irrigation for the prevention of the corresponding crop losses would also have required correspondingly higher amounts of irrigation in reality in the model calculation this optimal ideal irrigation was assumed without any crop loss and therefore resulted in higher irrigation demands assuming the reported crop loss as a corresponding reduction in supply security by 15 20 allowed the comparison of the actual irrigation demand of 210 275 mm for 2018 fig 1 with the range between the 80 and 85 quantile of the annual modelled irrigation demand of 218 240 mm fig 7 accordingly the modelled irrigation requirement for ensuring an 80 85 supply security was in very good agreement with the respective recorded irrigation demand for the year 2018 during which a crop loss of about 15 20 had been experienced this finding further provided a strong indication of the validity of the model based on these results the modelled irrigation requirement represented a good approximation of the actual overall annual gross irrigation demand for years characterized by sufficient rainfall and moderate temperatures such as the years 2014 2016 and 2017 during these years no crop losses occurred which meant that the applied irrigation quantity was sufficient for preventing any water stress for the crops for years with high temperatures and insufficient precipitation thus increased et0 during the main irrigation season from april to october fig 2 the reported crop losses could have been mitigated by sufficient ideal irrigation as it was computed by the model therefore the modelled overall annual gross irrigation demand for these years also represented a good approximation of the actual needed overall annual gross irrigation requirements based thereon the modelling of a broader database for a holistic estimation of the annual but in particular of the daily irrigation demand was possible along with the comprehensive discussion of the other model results even additional aspects confirming the validity of the applied model approach were elaborated within the sections 3 2 and 3 3 however these were omitted for this section 3 2 crop specific net irrigation requirements the crop specific annual net irrigation requirements for ten different crops were modelled fig 4 these modelled irrigation requirement data were statistically analyzed and compared with irrigation requirement data adapted from paschold and beltz 2010 as well as zinkernagel et al 2017 table 2 for the simulation period from 1973 to 2019 the most water intensive crop was celery with a mean and maximum annual net irrigation demand of 371 mm and 602 mm respectively onions had the second highest annual net irrigation requirement with a corresponding mean and maximum of 242 mm and 427 mm respectively the discrepancies in the annual net irrigation requirements of the various crops were mainly due to their different crop coefficients kc because the higher the kc the higher the crop specific evapotranspiration and consequently the corresponding crop specific irrigation required allen et al 1998 savva et al 2002 hochschule geisenheim 2019 for instance with the highest crop specific annual net irrigation requirement of 228 602 mm year celery table 2 is simultaneously characterized by the highest kc value ranging between 0 5 and 1 4 kc table s3 supplemental information the results with regard to the crop specific annual net irrigation demands were comparable to the findings given by paschold and beltz 2010 as well as zinkernagel et al 2017 within their studies they determined e g for celery onion as well as potato arithmetic mean annual net irrigation requirements with 300 320 mm 259 304 mm and 138 172 mm respectively table 2 in addition the maximum values of the crop specific annual net irrigation demands determined by the model table 2 were also in good agreement with the corresponding results presented by paschold and beltz 2010 and zinkernagel et al 2017 the estimations with regard to the crop specific annual net irrigation demand by paschold and beltz 2010 as well as zinkernagel et al 2017 were again just recently november 2019 confirmed within the german technical guidance document dwa m 590 2019 beside the annual crop specific net irrigation demand also the daily crop specific net irrigation requirements were determined fig 5 table 3 the most water intensive crop on a daily basis constituted ornamental plants with a minimum arithmetic mean and maximum daily irrigation requirement of 15 mm 41 mm and 64 mm respectively the relatively high daily net irrigation demand for this crop in comparison to the remaining crops was attributed to the relatively high critical depletion at the middle critical depletion 0 45 and the end of the crop development critical depletion 0 8 table s3 supplemental information since irrigation was assumed to always take place as soon as the critical depletion of the crop had been reached the following applied the lower the critical depletion the sooner and more often irrigation was required for higher critical depletion values however more irrigation was required in fewer days allen et al 1998 savva et al 2002 the same explanation applied for the relatively high net irrigation demand of sugar beet or in reverse logic for the relatively low net irrigation demand e g typical for lettuce celery or onions table s3 in supplemental information for crop specific critical depletion values and became also obvious by analyzing the number of irrigation days n in table 3 by comparing the modelled daily net irrigation requirement data with corresponding data from literature table 3 again the similarity became obvious and by that the validity with regard to daily net irrigation requirement was confirmed for instance the arithmetic means of the modelled daily net irrigation requirements for cabbage celery or potato were 19 mm 12 mm and 28 mm respectively while the corresponding data given by gallichand et al 1991 were 14 24 mm 6 14 mm and 18 30 mm respectively the overall good agreement of the modelled crop specific annual as well as daily irrigation requirement data with corresponding data from the literature further supported the validity of the model on the other hand it might allow an assessment of the crop specific irrigation demand for future planning purposes by the local farmers and might even provide a useful tool for decision making on the choice of crops in the context of climate change effects or in general as guide for designing irrigation equipment and reservoirs gallichand et al 1991 3 3 overall gross irrigation requirements the overall gross irrigation requirements for the past 47 years 1973 2019 were derived from the modelling results according to section 2 2 in order to create the broadest possible database for estimating the overall irrigation demand in the agricultural area in gochsheim the range of the overall annual gross irrigation requirements determined by the model for this period for gochsheim is visualized in fig 6 in form of box whisker plots a close relationship between climate characteristics and the corresponding quantitative overall irrigation requirements exits as can be inferred from fig 2 and fig 6 years with a high mean temperature 15 c and low precipitation 250 300 mm during the main irrigation season such as the years 1976 2003 2015 and 2018 tended to have relatively high irrigation demands with 290 360 mm this close interdependence between the irrigation demand and the climate data further confirmed the plausibility of the irrigation requirement results generated by the model for 50 of the modelled scenarios an annual overall gross irrigation of 171 mm median would have been sufficient table 4 fig 7 upper right panel the median was similar to the arithmetic mean of the annual overall gross irrigation requirement of 181 mm table 4 according to fig 1 these values median and arithmetic mean of modelled data were close to the recorded overall gross irrigation demand of about 185 mm for the year 2014 with its precipitation and its mean temperature during the main irrigation season being nearly the same as the long term mean 1973 2019 the year 2014 was actually representative for a normal year this again proofed the validity of the model approach according to the modelled data the overall annual gross demand would have been covered with a 95 certainty if 322 mm had been supplied and by providing 367 mm per year even the maximum of the modelled irrigation demand could have been sufficiently met covered this upper range of the modeled annual irrigation requirements 322 367 mm was in close agreement with an estimate of the overall annual gross irrigation demand for an extreme hot and dry year by the engineering consulting firm bgs umwelt gmbh a collaborating partner within the project for which this model was performed furthermore the results were in good agreement with modelling results for that area by wriedt et al 2009 having determined a range min max of the net irrigation requirements between 122 and 239 mm simulation period 1995 2002 which translated to gross irrigation requirements of 153 299 mm under the assumption of an overall irrigation efficiency of 80 in summary according to the modelling results as well as recorded actual irrigation requirement data for a normal year e g represented by 2014 an overall annual gross irrigation requirement of about 170 190 mm will be sufficient while during an extreme hot as well as dry year such as 2015 or 2018 the overall annual gross irrigation demand might double 322 367 mm in order to guarantee an adequate irrigation of the local crops in gochsheim and preventing any crop loss the implementation of non potable water reuse projects including required infrastructure for a whole agricultural area such in gochsheim needs a comprehensive understanding of the respective local water demand asano and mills 1990 asano 1991 urkiaga et al 2008 especially the overall daily peak gross irrigation demand is of utmost importance for the planning and design of pumps storage irrigation systems und water treatment facilities for non potable water reuse watts 1968 wright and jensen 1972 khadra and lamaddalena 2006 gallichand et al 1991 therefore based on the previous confirmation of the validity of the modelling approach and in addition to the overall annual gross irrigation requirements a higher temporal resolution was created by computing overall daily gross irrigation requirements for the whole agricultural area in gochsheim according to the cumulative frequency distribution fig 7 bottom two panels and the corresponding statistical analysis table 4 50 median of the modelled overall daily gross irrigation requirements were less than 3 0 mm the arithmetic mean with 4 4 mm was 47 higher than the median by a provision of 38 7 mm even the maximum of the overall daily gross irrigation requirements could have been covered however the provision of the maximum overall daily gross irrigation requirement of 38 7 mm would not have been feasible the complete agricultural area in gochsheim to be irrigated summed up to about 55 60 ha assuming that a maximum of 20 ha had been irrigated at one day this would have translated into a demand of 7740 m3 day if this amount had been applied in 4 h which was a common time for the local irrigation applications in gochsheim a water flow of 1935 m3 hour would have been required with a technically common flow velocity of 0 8 1 m sec within the main supply pipe this would have resulted into a corresponding pipe diameter of 100 cm not only the costs of the construction of the corresponding pipe trench but also the costs for the pipes itself or the corresponding treatment plant if wastewater reclamation had been considered would not be economically feasible in the context of the local conditions in gochsheim furthermore the probability of the event that the maximum of 38 7 mm was needed could be neglected 1 15 10 5 in contrast the 95 quantile of the overall daily gross irrigation requirement of 14 3 mm table 4 fig 7 represented a more economically as well as technically feasible benchmark moreover the value was also comparable to not only the overall daily gross peak irrigation requirement reported by the local farmers but also to an estimation derived from bgs umwelt apparently for planning of non potable water reuse projects and in the case of lacking recorded data modelling based on the cropwat 8 0 approach allen et al 1998 combined with statistical analysis constituted a helpful approach for estimating useful and plausible benchmarks of the overall daily peak irrigation requirement 4 conclusion modelling is a viable and cost effective approach for estimating irrigation demand data for a proper planning of non potable water reuse projects so far most studies in this field focus on the determination of annually or monthly resolved crop requirement data the proper estimation of overall daily peak demand data crucial for planning of agricultural water reuse projects is usually not addressed if accurate meteorological data are available the computational approach on which the cropwat 8 0 is based on a software provided by the fao constitutes an easy to implement model by a simulation of a broad range of different possible growing scenarios and a comprehensive visual as well as statistical analysis of the modelled data i a the crop specific irrigation requirements which are useful measures for the irrigation and water management planning of individual farmers can be evaluated furthermore by this modelling approach and a corresponding weighting of the calculated crop specific gross irrigation requirements even the more important overall daily monthly or annual peak gross irrigation requirements for a whole agricultural area can be estimated in particular the overall daily peak gross irrigation requirements represent the basis for adequate design of a non potable water reuse infrastructure the approach for the determination of this value utilized in this study can also be easily as well as cost effectively applied to other comparable projects since only a limited and usually well available data set meteorological soil and crop data is required however since this applied modelling approach constitutes a rather conservative assessment of the overall daily peak irrigation demand the technically and economically most feasible demand value should be determined based on a statistical analysis taking into account the local desired security of supply the results within this study revealed that the 95 quantile of the modelled daily irrigation demand with 14 3 mm represented a viable benchmark for the design of infrastructure required for the non potable water reuse project for agricultural purposes in gochsheim a municipality in lower franconia as a final conclusion this approach and the results constitute a viable as well as helpful basis not only for the agricultural management of individual local farmers but in particular an essential prerequisite for the planning of non potable water reuse projects for agricultural purposes adapted to the local conditions declaration of competing

10319,previous research established growth stage specific irrigation scheduling for upland cotton gossypium hirsutum l in uzbekistan we report further investigation of irrigation scheduling for two cotton varieties and its effect on seed lint yield and irrigation crop water productivity with and without use of a wetting front detector wfd to trigger irrigation cessation a wfd is a device buried in the soil to sense when the wetting front from irrigation reaches a certain depth the depth may be adjusted upon installation of the wfd field trials were conducted in silt loam soil near tashkent uzbekistan in 2016 2017 and 2018 the growth stages of germination to flowering flowering to boll formation and maturation were considered for the development of irrigation scheduling regimes with respect to field capacity water content fc the best growth development and seed lint yield for the sultan cotton variety were achieved with irrigations scheduled at soil water content levels of 70 75 and 65 of fc during the aforementioned three growth stages respectively and were achieved for variety uzpiti 103 with irrigations scheduled at 70 70 and 60 of fc during the aforementioned plant growth stages respectively there were appreciable varietal differences in water requirement with the early maturing sultan variety having a larger water requirement in contrast irrigation scheduling with larger fc values did not result in increasing the yield for the uzpiti 103 cotton variety in comparison with irrigation without wfd the use of the wfd decreased irrigation duration by 2 0 3 5 h net irrigation amount by 7 90 m3 ha 1 irrigation run off by 69 134 m3 ha 1 and deep percolation below the root zone by 10 17 m3 ha 1 while increasing irrigation crop water productivity by 0 08 0 10 kg m 3 and seed lint yield by 0 04 0 10 mgha 1 irrigation scheduling regimes based on percentages of fc and irrigation with wfd should be considered applicable practices for upland cotton varieties on silt loam soils of the central zone of uzbekistan and for similar soil climatic conditions of central asian countries keywords cotton irrigation scheduling crop water productivity cwp wetting front detector 1 introduction the challenges of global population growth and the corresponding growth of requirements for food and natural resource use including water and land are not new phenomena the doubling population of central asia since 1980 increased demand for food which escalated water demand all water resources in both of the main river basins in uzbekistan the amudarya and syrdarya are fully allocated between water users limited water resources are one of the crucial issues in uzbekistan and worldwide only 9 6 of total runoff of transboundary rivers in the aral sea basin is formed within uzbekistan in other words uzbekistan is quite dependent upon other riparian countries from the point of view of available water resources khamraev et al 2018 irrigation is an essential component of crop production in many areas of the world including most of uzbekistan in cotton for example recent studies have shown that proper timing of irrigation is an important production factor and that delaying irrigation can result in losses of between usd 62 ha and usd 300 ha vories et al 2003 water scarcity issues have prompted an interest in improved irrigation scheduling methods and enhanced crop water productivity cwp of cotton varieties considerable research has been done on cwp also known as water use efficiency wue which is defined as the economic yield divided by the crop water use or evapotranspiration and many papers and reviews have been written taylor et al 1983 faurès et al 2007 howell 2001 in addition to cwp irrigation efficiency ie is an important consideration and was first defined by israelsen 1932 as the amount of irrigation water diverted that is eventually available for crop water use according to literature in many irrigation schemes only about 45 of water diverted for irrigation actually reaches the crops levidow et al 2014 de pascale maggio 2005 found that the loss percentages for different irrigation methods were as follows drip irrigation 10 20 sprinkler irrigation 30 50 and furrow irrigation 50 60 in agriculture a farmer a manager of an irrigation project or a river basin authority may consider the efficient use of water quite differently for example in farms substantial water losses may infiltrate deeply in the soil resulting in deep percolation losses which may recharge the aquifers because of the high level of irrigation rates but these losses may not be a high priority for them at the farm level the productive use of water is understood by maximizing yield rather than saving water resources particularly when water is provided at no or little cost a river basin authority can define water use efficiency as allocating as much as possible of limited water resources however under growing water shortage conditions improved cwp and ie represent key factors in increasing cotton productivity which is highly correlated with cwp after becoming an independent country uzbekistan reoriented the focus of agricultural policy on food independency and prioritized food security presently approximately one million ha of irrigated winter wheat and 200 000 ha of dry land wheat are produced in recent years the area devoted to cotton has decreased due to the expansion of fields to grow cereals and other vegetable crops but at the present time cotton is still a dominant crop with a main cropping sequence of cotton winter wheat 1 1 this means that cotton is grown in the first year with winter wheat planted into cotton stubble in october and grown through the cold winter with harvest in the following june due to lack of water much of the wheat ground is left in fallow throughout the rest of the second year hence the 1 1 designation however when possible a summer crop of vegetables or legumes is grown in the remaining 90 100days with temperatures 10 c after wheat harvest the 1 1 cropping sequence has replaced the earlier cotton alfalfa 7 3 7years of cotton followed by 3years of alfalfa crop rotation on the irrigated lands of uzbekistan this plus the significant increase in the area under winter wheat and other summer crops including vegetables and legumes resulted in increasing the water demand at the same time it increased the requirement for adopting practices to improve ie and cwp owing to its deep continental geographic location the country has small and erratic precipitation relative to crop water requirements and agricultural production is predominantly based on irrigation crops other than rice are mainly irrigated by furrow irrigation in uzbekistan conducting irrigation earlier than needed can negatively affect cotton growth and development which leads to prolonging the length of fruiting branches decreasing the number of fruit elements and promoting overly large accumulation of vegetative biomass in research conducted at the uzbekistan cotton research institute irrigation scheduling rules were developed based on when soil water in the 1 5 m deep root zone was depleted to specific percentages of fc ibragimov et al 2007 for example one irrigation regime studied was based on root zone water content decreasing to 65 65 and 60 of field capacity during three growth stages respectively as follows the first of the three levels of fc 65 was used from germination to the squaring stage of the crop the second level again 65 was used from squaring to the flowering fruiting stage and the third level 60 was used during maturation of cotton bolls irrigation was applied when these thresholds were reached research of the cotton breeding seed production and agrotechnologies research institute uzbekistan on the impact of irrigation scheduling on seed lint yield of cotton showed that decreasing the soil moisture level for triggering irrigation by 5 10 from the optimal percentage of fc resulted in yield loss of 0 3 0 7 mgha 1 avliyakulov 2015 in uzbekistan most irrigators rely on their knowledge observation to schedule irrigations for example farmers observe leaf folding loss of turgor change of leaf color to dark green and flowers rising above the top of the canopy the disadvantage of these observations is that by the time they are evident the crop is already water stressed this is similar to the situation in australia where only approximately 40 of growers combine local knowledge with more objective measures to make their irrigation decision montagu and stirzaker 2008 in addition to scheduling irrigation to save water it is useful to know when to turn the water off in addition to knowing when to turn the water on nowadays in conventional practice the cotton grower is not sure if the entire layer of soil has been wetted or not it is acknowledged that there can be differences in the depth of wetting in different parts of a field which often adversely affects seed lint yield of cotton in research it has been identified that an advantage of using a wetting front detector is that it can determine the wetting front of the entire root zone layer of soil in australia stirzaker 2003 showed that using wetting front detectors wfd was a useful tool in micro irrigation management the wfd does not tell an irrigator when to start irrigating it simply informs them how well the last irrigation filled the profile and helps them to make a decision about the timing and duration of the next irrigation stirzaker 2005 also it can be used to directly switch off irrigation in sprinkler irrigation trials for example stirzaker and hutchinson 2006 evaluated the accuracy of scheduling irrigation using a simple wetting front detector that automatically switched the water off after the wetting front had reached a prescribed depth in soil we describe the wfd used in our research in section 2 5 considering the aforementioned we developed objectives for conducting and demonstrating best water management practices through field trials directed to improving efficient use of water in comparison with conventional on farm irrigation practices in uzbekistan the specific objectives of the field trials were 1 to test crop growth stage specific fc based irrigation scheduling regimes applied to two cotton varieties for optimization of yield and irrigation crop water productivity icwp 2 to study the potential of improving irrigation efficiency ie by using wetting front detectors and the effects on yield and icwp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experiments were conducted in 2016 2017 and 2018 at the central experimental station of uzbekistan s cotton breeding seed production and agrotechnologies research institute cbspari the experimental station is located in kibray district tashkent province at latitude of 41 25 10 2 n longitude of 69 29 10 9 e and elevation of 560 m a s l according to the russian soil classification which is still in use in uzbekistan the soil type is old irrigated typical sierozem with mechanical composition of silt loam usda 2017 the soil is similar to an ustic torriorthent in the usda classification methods from richards 1954 were used for determination of soluble salt cation and anion concentrations the salt content was 0 085 of mass in the 0 30 cm soil depth while chlorine ion content was 0 006 saturation paste extract electrical conductivity ece of soil with 0 085 salt content is 0 2dsm 1 according to the russian and usda classifications the soil is non saline the water table is 18 m below the surface and the soil formation is considered as automorphic which means that soil formation was not influenced by high water table stream flow or other substantial hydrologic influence other than precipitation climate is arid continental weather is recorded by a weather station at the research site the average temperature varies from 16 2 c to 16 8 с and the maximum temperature exceeds 38 5 40 5 c in summer whereas the minimum temperature declines to as low as 7 5 с in winter long term annual precipitation ranges from 350 to 400 mm with 90 occurring from october through may the soil is characterized by low humus content 0 489 0 629 soil organic matter was determined according to tyurin uzbekistan cotton research institute uzcri 2007 which is a modified walkley black method nelson and sommers 1982 acidification of humus carbon with a solution of chromic anhydride in the presence of sulfuric acid and titration of unused chromic anhydride with ferrous ammonium sulfate fe nh4 2 so4 2 6h2o the analyzes of npk content in soil were done annually in the laboratories of the cbspari total n was analyzed by the kjeldahl method with wet oxidation of soil organic matter using sulfuric acid bremner and mulvaney 1982 the no3 n content mgkg 1 was analyzed calorimetrically with phenol disulphonic acid according to the modified method of granval lajoux from 1886 silber 1913 haper 1924 durynina and egorov 1998 available p2o5 mgkg 1 and exchangeable k2o mgkg 1 were analyzed according to the method described by machigin protasov which involves extraction of p and k compounds with 1 solution ammonium carbonate pн 9 0 and use of a flame photometer which is comparable to the olsen methodology olsen and sommers 1982 total nitrogen total phosphorus and total potassium contents in the surface to 30 cm and 30 50 cm soil layers were 0 063 and 0 044 0 122 and 0 085 and 1 80 and 1 85 respectively while no3 n for the same soil layers was 2 0 and 1 0 mg kg 1 available p2o5 was 22 4 and 20 9 mg kg 1 and exchangeable k2o was 200 and 185 mg kg 1 respectively mineral fertilizer was applied at the rates of 200 kg n ha 1 140 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 100 kg k2o ha 1 the research was conducted following the methods of field experimentation by uzbekistan cotton research institute uzcri 2007 the field trials were conducted in three replicates the experimental layout was a split split plot with complete randomized block design each replicated plot size was 480 m2 with 8 cotton rows and furrow length of 100 m 4 8 mx100 m 2 2 soil water and field water balance determinations field capacity was determined from one randomly selected location 2 m 2 m in the field by flooding covering the flooded area with polyethylene sheet and determining soil moisture in the following days over a period of 2 5days until stabilization was achieved at all the soil depths field capacity fc was determined in 10 cm increments to depth of 100 cm for adopting an index in order to develop fc based irrigation scheduling field capacity fc of soil in the 0 100 cm depth layer was 0 29 m3 m 3 vwc infiltration capacity was determined before sowing and at the end of season using standard double ring metallic infiltrometers with an outer ring diameter of 0 4 m and inner ring diameter of 0 2 m both rings were buried in the soil to a depth of 0 15 m and continuous 6 hours observations were conducted every season soil bulk density bd mgm 3 was measured in every 10 cm from the surface to 100 cm soil depth before sowing and at the end of season using the core method blake and hartge 1986 soil porosity φ m3 m 3 was calculated from bd values using the equation φ 1 bd 2 65 where 2 65 was the assumed particle density mgm 3 the soil water content was determined by the oven drying method applied to soil samples taken approximately twice a week during the growing season in field conditions soil moisture was sampled in three replicates in the place between furrow and plant row from germination to flowering and in maturation growth stages soil samples were taken in 10 cm increments from the surface to 70 cm depth and in the flowering and boll formation growth stages sampling was continued in 10 cm increments to 100 cm depth volumetric water content of the soil profile was determined by multiplying the mass basis water content mgmg 1 by the bulk density in each soil layer irrigation water applied to the field and runoff from the field were both measured using trapezoidal water weirs cippoletti in the supply ditch and at the end of the furrows where tailwater was collected usbr 2001 considering the initially shallow root zone and the desire not to wet the profile too deeply until flowering the wfd was adjusted to indicate when the root zone soil layer was wetted to 70 cm considering an increasingly deep root zone from flowering to boll formation the wfd was adjusted to indicate wetting reaching 100 cm depth finally considering the desire to force the crop to mature and cease flowering during maturation the wfd was adjusted to 70 cm again in order to decrease irrigation time irrigations were conducted with variable flow rate in order to reduce runoff losses and more smoothly wet the entire root zone layer of soil deep percolation loss below the root zone m m3 ha 1 was calculated using the equation ryzhov 1948 1 m wn wm 100 bd h k where wn is gravimetric soil moisture after irrigation wm is gravimetric soil moisture prior to irrigation 100 is a fixed number bd is defined previously h is depth m of wetted soil layer below the root zone and k is the area in ha where deep percolation losses occurred mostly in the initial length of furrow for example м wn wm 100 bd h k 21 33 17 30 100 1 38 0 20 0 36 40 m3 ha 1 2 3 cotton varieties harvest and statistical design two upland cotton gossypium hirsutum l varieties sultan and uzpiti 103 were studied sultan is a cotton cultivar released in uzbekistan and grown on more than 184 thousand hectares in 2019 covering 17 8 of total cropping area of cotton uzpiti 103 is a prospective variety that was grown on more than 2 thousand hectares in 2019 covering 0 2 of total cropping area of cotton in uzbekistan these varieties sultan and uzpiti 103 were chosen because they were released varieties for tashkent province and because irrigation scheduling regimes had not yet been developed for them additionally the cotton varieties were chosen on the basis of maturation time the sultan variety is early maturing vegetation period 115 120days in comparison with uzpiti 103 which we classify as an early medium maturing variety 117 125days vegetation period is measured from germination till 1st boll opening in 50 of plants the mass of cotton per boll was determined by picking the cotton bolls located in 3 6 and 9 fruiting branches of 100 plants in each plot the harvest procedure was to pick cotton in the middle four rows in each replicate plot and separate the cotton into lint and seed components in uzbekistan cotton is harvested multiple times by hand always in two harvests and sometimes in three harvests the statistical design was split split plot with irrigation scheduling regimes described in section 2 4 as the main treatment and cotton varieties and irrigation methods as the splits with three replications table 1 all data were checked for normality and analyzed using split split plot design in sas software sas institute 2008 this included the variables of seed lint yield net irrigation water used per unit yield total irrigation water used per unit yield and irrigation crop water productivity icwp which were analyzed with the repeated measures option the mean effect of the treatment variables irrigation scheduling fc cotton varieties and irrigation method with and without using wetting front detectors and their interactions were compared at a p 0 05 level of significance an lsd post hoc test compared individual treatment means where the anova test indicated significant p 0 05 treatment effects the results are presented in accordance with the statistical significance of interaction of the main effects of treatment for example as shown in section 3 the split split plot analysis showed that irrigation scheduling cotton varieties was the highest level of interaction for all variables including yield net irrigation amount per unit yield total irrigation amount per unit yield and icwp 2 4 irrigation treatments the field experiment included two irrigation scheduling treatments and two irrigation method treatments the first irrigation method treatment included cotton irrigation management without wetting front detectors the second treatment included irrigation management using wetting front detectors to signal when irrigation application should be turned off in both irrigation method treatments two irrigation scheduling treatments were applied for the irrigation scheduling treatments specific percentages of fc were used according to the three chosen cotton growth stages the stages of development were according to elsner et al 1979 e g the regime of 70 75 65 involved irrigating when soil water content declined to 70 of fc from germination till flowering stage 0 5 to 75 of fc from flowering to boll formation stage 5 7 and to 65 of fc during cotton boll maturation stage 7 9 the experimental design is given in table 1 treatments 2 and 6 had wetting front detectors installed treatment 4 was irrigated the same as treatment 2 and treatment 8 was irrigated the same as treatment 6 in both cases using amount of water and duration as determined using wetting front detectors in treatments 2 and 6 respectively the water content data from the three replicate plots in a treatment were averaged together and irrigation proceeded alike in every plot in a treatment when the average reached the assigned fc threshold during an irrigation the furrow flow rate was decreased twice once when water reached three quarters of the furrow length when the flow rate was reduced by half and again when water almost reached the end of furrow when the flow rate was again decreased by half after that the irrigation was continued with decreased flow rate which enabled moistening the entire root zone layer of soil more smoothly conducting irrigations with variable flow rate enabled achieving wetting the soil layer 1 1 1 2 m in the initial part of furrow length and 0 8 0 9 m at the end of furrow length 2 5 operating procedures of wfd device the wfd is an accurate low cost device developed by stirzaker 2003 2005 and available for purchase at https viashop csiro au fig 1 identification of the wetting of a specific root zone layer is the main function of the wfd which helps to answer the question when to stop irrigation during the irrigation the water infiltrates through the soil and after water reaches the reservoir fig 1 left it activates a float which pushes up a rod that can be seen and is a signal to stop the irrigation fig 2 if the float is activated during an irrigation then the reservoir must be emptied before the next irrigation this is done by placing suction on the extraction tube which is a flexible tube that is extended to above the soil surface during wfd installation 2 6 installation of wfd in field installation of the wfds in the correct parts of the field is critical and must be determined carefully the wfds must be installed in non traffic cotton rows to ensure they are not damaged by tractors passing through the field during the growing season in field experiments six wetting front detectors were installed at 70 and 100 cm below the soil surface in a single cotton plant row in each irrigation scheduling treatment of 70 70 60 and 70 75 65 of fc with the furrow length of 100 m treatments 2 and 6 in table 1 in furrow irrigation the initial part of the furrow is over moistened because of having greater irrigation duration thus only in the initial part of the furrow in each irrigation scheduling treatment an additional wfd was installed to the 120 cm soil depth to detect the extent of over moistening the devices were installed near distances of 10 m 50 m and 90 m from the head end of the row for example separated by 1 m distance three wfds were installed near the initial 10 m distance of furrow length at depths of 70 100 and 120 cm fig 3 another two wfds separated by 1 m distance were installed near the 50 m furrow distance at depths of 70 and 100 cm and another two wfds separated by 1 m distance were installed near the 90 m furrow distance at depths of 70 and 100 cm all wfds were placed in a single cotton row fig 3 to install a wfd a hole with 25 cm diameter was excavated to the depth required placing the soil from each distinct soil layer into a separate pile then the wfd was placed in the hole which was then filled with soil carefully by putting soil from each layer back in place in the reverse order from the initial removal of soil after refilling the hole with soil the installed wfd should be watered in order to know if the device is working properly as well as to settle the soil to achieve natural bulk density with the original wfd design irrigation was stopped when the activation of the float indicator was observed in the visible part of the wfd but one of the disadvantages of this was that the irrigator must enter the field to verify if the float is activated or not attempts to allow observation from the field s edge included adding an illumination lamp but the flashing light was only observable at nighttime and an audible signaling alert but its ability to transmit sound was only 50 200 m ultimately a radio transmitter was added to each wfd to send data indicating wetting front detection to a wifi router enabling wireless transmission of data to a computer which recorded the data using a software thus acting as a datalogger the wetting front detectors were installed as described previously in the initial middle and end of the row length and a wifi router powered by a small solar panel was placed outside of the field in the vicinity of the wfds a computer software was used in which wfds were identified with numbers the number indicating the current place in the field wfd icons were colored red yellow and green the red wfd icons were installed to receive water at the bottom of the 0 100 and 0 120 cm layers while the yellow wfds were installed to receive water at the bottom of the 0 70 cm layer when water reached the bottom of the relevant soil layer the wfd icon turned color from red or yellow to green fig 4 during field experiment irrigations the wetting front layer was observed by getting data from the wfd via the wifi router which helped identify the exact time at which to finish irrigation 3 results and discussion precipitation and temperature variations during the growing season of the study years are shown in fig 5 the three seasons were fairly similar in temperature and precipitation with spring rains in april and may followed by a hot dry summer of july through september in 2016 the 1st harvest was on september 26 27 the 2nd harvest was on october 9 and the 3rd harvest was on october 25 in 2017 the 1st harvest was on october 1 3 the 2nd harvest was on october 23 and there was no 3rd harvest in 2018 the 1st harvest was on october 5 6 the 2nd harvest was on october 30 31 and there was no 3rd harvest 3 1 irrigation water balance and effects on porosity and infiltration capacity each season the soil profile 0 100 cm water content remained below the fc and thus below the maximum allowed by soil porosity fig 6 irrigation events were signaled when the soil water content declined to specific percentages of fc for example for the irrigation scheduling regime of 70 75 65 fc irrigation was initiated during the flowering phase when soil water content decreased to 75 of fc while in comparison for the irrigation scheduling regime of 70 70 60 fc irrigation was initiated when soil water content declined to 70 of fc it can be seen that fc percentages differed from each other in each treatment that is why before the last irrigation event in the maturation phase the soil water content values were less for the irrigation scheduling regime of 70 70 60 fc in comparison with water contents for the irrigation scheduling regime of 70 75 65 fc for which the fc percentage was 65 during the maturation phase fig 6 changes in infiltration capacity were mostly related to the number of irrigation events and net irrigation amount for each of the 3years a total of five irrigation events were conducted for the 70 70 60 of fc irrigation scheduling regime and six irrigation events were conducted for the 70 75 65 of fc irrigation scheduling regime seasonal net irrigation water applied for each treatment was different for the 70 70 60 of fc irrigation scheduling regime net irrigation was 4882 m3 ha 1 in 2016 4808 m3 ha 1 in 2017 and 4454 m3 ha 1 in 2018 net irrigation amounts were larger for the 70 75 65 of fc irrigation scheduling regime totaling 5355 m3 ha 1 in 2016 5466 m3 ha 1 in 2017 and 5020 m3 ha 1 in 2018 in comparison cotton seasonal irrigation water amount ranged from 4320 to 7390 m3 ha 1 for limited and full irrigation in california howell et al 1987 in uzbekistan cotton irrigation ranged from 4210 to 4700 m3 ha 1 while et ranged from 438 to 487 mm in furrow irrigated cotton under conditions similar to those in the present study ibragimov et al 2011 in each season and for each treatment values of bd increased and porosity decreased in the plow layer 0 30 cm but increases in bd and decreases in porosity were significantly 5 level not shown greater in all 3years for the 70 75 65 of fc irrigation regime which received more irrigations than did the 70 70 60 of fc irrigation regime fig 7 decreases in porosity were significant in 2017 for the 70 70 60 of fc regime but insignificant at 20 and 30 cm depths in 2016 and 2018 and at the 10 cm depth in 2016 decreases in porosity corresponded with decreases in infiltration capacity at the beginning of the season in the first observed hour infiltration capacity was 386 m3 ha 1 2016 410 m3 ha 1 2017 392 m3 ha 1 2018 and the rates declined in each successive hour to values of 184 149 87 69 and 59 m3 ha 1 2016 206 152 115 91 and 77 m3 ha 1 2017 192 157 90 72 and 61 m3 ha 1 2018 for a total infiltration capacity over 6 h of 934 m3 ha 1 2016 1051 m3 ha 1 2017 and 964 m3 ha 1 2018 at season s end infiltration capacity was decreased by 44 and 66 m3 ha 1 2016 60 and 143 m3 ha 1 2017 43 and 79 m3 ha 1 2018 in treatments with the 70 70 60 of fc irrigation regime and the 70 75 65 of fc regime respectively the infiltration capacity was the least in treatments with larger fc values and more frequent irrigations increased number and increased seasonal irrigation amount appear to have caused the reduction of infiltration capacity and the corresponding increase in bd and reduction in porosity 3 2 water balance effects of using wfds monitoring soil wetting with the help of wfds showed that soil moistened 3 4 h earlier in the initial part of the furrow and wetted the profile to 0 4 m greater depth than at the wfd at 90 m from the head of the row near the end of the furrow length comparison of the irrigation methods with and without using wfds when applying the same irrigation scheduling showed that using the wfd can be a key element to save irrigation water by triggering when to stop irrigation for all 3years the irrigation scheduling regime of 70 75 65 of fc was used in the treatment where the wfds were used and in the treatment where wfds were not used table 2 six irrigation events were conducted during the phase from germination till flowering one irrigation occurred during the phase from flowering until boll formation four irrigations occurred during boll maturation one irrigation occurred reasons that the number of irrigation events in both irrigation methods was the same included that the same irrigation scheduling regime was applied irrigations were delayed by 2 3days in the treatment without wfds because of the larger volume of water applied thus the last irrigation event without wfds was in the full maturation phase whereas the last irrigation event in treatment with wfds was conducted in the beginning of maturation however delaying irrigation by 2 3days was not sufficient to affect the number of irrigations in 2016 for irrigation using wfds the total seasonal irrigation amount was 5830 m3 ha 1 net irrigation amount was 5355 m3 ha 1 runoff totaled 475 m3 ha 1 and deep percolation loss was 245 m3 ha 1 table 2 for irrigation without wfds these values were larger in comparison with using wfds for irrigation without wfds the total seasonal irrigation amount was greater by 736 m3 ha 1 net irrigation amount was greater by 683 m3 ha 1 runoff was greater by 53 m3 ha 1 and deep percolation loss was greater by 162 m3 ha 1 in comparison with using wfds the wfds were able to identify the wetting front layer quickly enough to ensure stopping irrigation in time to save irrigation water similar results were obtained in the 2017 year season as well table 3 much more irrigation water was wasted in irrigation without wfds for example in the 2017 year season the net irrigation amount was larger for irrigation without wfds by approximately the same amount as for the 2016 year season but the total seasonal runoff was much larger in 2017 256 m3 ha 1 by comparison with 2016 53 m3 ha 1 while the deep percolation loss in 2017 was decreased in comparison with 2016 deep percolation losses of 125 m3 ha 1 in 2017 and 162 m3 ha 1 in 2016 table 3 in 2018 for irrigation using wfds the total seasonal irrigation amount was 5619 m3 ha 1 net irrigation amount was 5020 m3 ha 1 runoff totaled 599 m3 ha 1 and deep percolation loss was 308 m3 ha 1 table 4 for irrigation without wfds these values were larger in comparison with using wfds for irrigation without wfds the total seasonal irrigation amount was greater by 696 m3 ha 1 net irrigation amount was greater by 177 m3 ha 1 runoff was greater by 519 m3 ha 1 and deep percolation loss was greater by 81 m3 ha 1 in comparison with using wfds irrigation durations were longer without wfds by 2 h 1 5 2 h and 2 5 h in the three crop growth phases in comparison with durations when wfds were used irrigation intervals were 12 17 days in the treatment using the wfds in comparison with values of 14 20days for the treatment without wfds table 4 overall in 2018 in comparison with irrigation scheduling without wfds for individual irrigations using the wfds the irrigation duration was less by 2 0 3 5 h net irrigation amount was less by 7 90 m3 ha 1 irrigation run off was less by 69 134 m3 ha 1 and deep percolation losses were less by 10 17 m3 ha 1 table 4 the highest rate of additional total runoff in irrigation without wfds occurred in 2018 519 m3 ha 1 when in contrast the smallest total deep percolation losses occurred 81 m3 ha 1 in 2018 overall the smallest values of deep percolation were associated with the largest rates of runoff and vice versa deep percolation loss was included in the net irrigation amount but this water lost below the root zone layer was not counted as water available to the crop 3 3 yield and irrigation crop water productivity the influence of different irrigation scheduling regimes cotton varieties and irrigation methods on seed lint yield of cotton net irrigation water used per unit yield total irrigation water used per unit yield and irrigation crop water productivity icwp are presented in tables 5 6 and 7 in 2016 both irrigation scheduling fc regimes using wfds resulted in decreased irrigation amount and increased yield and icwp for example compared with not using wfds the seed lint yield of cotton variety sultan when using wfds increased by 0 05mgha 1 icwp increased by 0 11 kg m 3 total irrigation water used per unit yield decreased by 102 m3 mg 1 and net irrigation water used per unit yield decreased by 189 m3 mg 1 for the 70 70 60 of fc irrigation scheduling the largest seed lint yield of 4 16mgha 1 was obtained with cotton variety sultan using the 70 75 65 of fc irrigation scheduling regime with wfds these results indicate that the water requirement of sultan was larger in comparison with uzpiti 103 the largest seed lint yield for sultan was achieved with irrigation scheduling of 70 75 65 fc with net irrigation amount of 5280 m3 ha 1 in contrast the largest seed lint yield for cotton variety uzpiti 103 was 4 05mgha 1 in the treatment with the 70 70 60 of fc irrigation scheduling regime with wfds with net irrigation amount of 4715 m3 ha 1 increased fc values in the 70 75 65 of fc irrigation scheduling regime did not increase the seed lint yield of cotton variety uzpiti 103 crop water productivity results were almost identical to the range of 0 55 0 62 kg m 3 and seed lint yields ranging from 3 18 to 4 03mgha 1 reported by ibragimov et al 2007 even if cotton varieties were different in this split split plot design experiment the interaction between irrigation scheduling cotton varieties was statistically confirmed for all variables including yield net irrigation amount per unit yield total irrigation amount per unit yield and icwp for 2016 2018 years in the 2016 season irrigation scheduling cotton varieties irrigation method was statistically significant for all variables whereas in 2017 only net irrigation amount per unit yield and total irrigation amount per unit yield were statistically significant irrigation scheduling was significantly affected by irrigation method with variables of yield net irrigation amount per unit yield and total irrigation amount per unit yield in 2016 with variables of net irrigation amount per unit yield and total irrigation amount per unit yield in 2017 and with the variables of net irrigation amount per unit yield total irrigation amount per unit yield and icwp in 2018 tables 5 6 7 similar results were achieved in 2017 as well the largest icwp was achieved with the uzpiti 103 cotton variety by using the 70 70 60 of fc irrigation scheduling regime with wfds with results of 1 08 kg m 3 in comparison with the 70 75 65 of fc irrigation scheduling regime for which the smallest icwp value was observed 0 80 kg m 3 this is likely due to the water requirement of cotton variety uzpiti 103 being less than that of the sultan variety the largest seed lint yield of cotton variety sultan 5 44mgha 1 was obtained using the 70 75 65 of fc irrigation scheduling regime with wfds which was an additional 0 05mgha 1 seed lint yield in comparison with the same irrigation scheduling without wfds table 6 the changes of seed lint yield among cotton varieties are related to their biological characteristics and water requirement in 2018 the net irrigation water used per unit yield ranged from 1142 to 1335 m3 mg 1 in treatments with wfd while the net water used per unit yield ranged from 1232 to 1393 m3 mg 1 for irrigation without wfds table 7 significant differences in seed lint yield were not observed between irrigation using wfds and irrigation without wfds but yield was consistently less and irrigation water used was consistently greater for irrigation without aid of wfds for instance irrigation crop water productivity icwp yield net irrigation was 4 4 7 9 larger in treatments using wfds 0 75 0 88 kg m 3 in comparison with irrigation without aid of wfds 0 72 0 81 kg m 3 4 conclusion the study investigated the effects of two irrigation scheduling regimes based on percentages of field capacity and the effects of two irrigation methods with and without wetting front detectors wfds on yield and water use of two cotton cultivars over three seasons on old irrigated silty loam soil of eastern uzbekistan the study results revealed that the 70 75 65 of fc irrigation scheduling regime improved irrigation crop water productivity icwp for the sultan cotton variety compared with the 70 70 60 of fc irrigation scheduling regime in contrast the 70 70 60 of fc irrigation scheduling regime resulted in improved icwp for the uzpiti 103 cotton variety compared with a regime of 70 75 65 of fc the 70 70 60 of fc irrigation scheduling regime resulted in saving 10 7 of irrigation water compared with the 70 75 65 of fc regime for the uzpiti 103 cotton variety the study results also showed that losses of runoff water and deep percolation below the rooting zone can be reduced by using wetting front detectors wfds with a data logging network that allows the irrigator to achieve wetting of the entire rooting zone while decreasing irrigation duration runoff and deep percolation of irrigation water thus increasing irrigation efficiency compared with irrigation without wfds using wfds increased irrigation crop water productivity icwp on average by 11 9 and 12 3 for irrigation scheduling done using the 70 75 65 of fc regime and 70 70 60 of fc regime respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

10319,previous research established growth stage specific irrigation scheduling for upland cotton gossypium hirsutum l in uzbekistan we report further investigation of irrigation scheduling for two cotton varieties and its effect on seed lint yield and irrigation crop water productivity with and without use of a wetting front detector wfd to trigger irrigation cessation a wfd is a device buried in the soil to sense when the wetting front from irrigation reaches a certain depth the depth may be adjusted upon installation of the wfd field trials were conducted in silt loam soil near tashkent uzbekistan in 2016 2017 and 2018 the growth stages of germination to flowering flowering to boll formation and maturation were considered for the development of irrigation scheduling regimes with respect to field capacity water content fc the best growth development and seed lint yield for the sultan cotton variety were achieved with irrigations scheduled at soil water content levels of 70 75 and 65 of fc during the aforementioned three growth stages respectively and were achieved for variety uzpiti 103 with irrigations scheduled at 70 70 and 60 of fc during the aforementioned plant growth stages respectively there were appreciable varietal differences in water requirement with the early maturing sultan variety having a larger water requirement in contrast irrigation scheduling with larger fc values did not result in increasing the yield for the uzpiti 103 cotton variety in comparison with irrigation without wfd the use of the wfd decreased irrigation duration by 2 0 3 5 h net irrigation amount by 7 90 m3 ha 1 irrigation run off by 69 134 m3 ha 1 and deep percolation below the root zone by 10 17 m3 ha 1 while increasing irrigation crop water productivity by 0 08 0 10 kg m 3 and seed lint yield by 0 04 0 10 mgha 1 irrigation scheduling regimes based on percentages of fc and irrigation with wfd should be considered applicable practices for upland cotton varieties on silt loam soils of the central zone of uzbekistan and for similar soil climatic conditions of central asian countries keywords cotton irrigation scheduling crop water productivity cwp wetting front detector 1 introduction the challenges of global population growth and the corresponding growth of requirements for food and natural resource use including water and land are not new phenomena the doubling population of central asia since 1980 increased demand for food which escalated water demand all water resources in both of the main river basins in uzbekistan the amudarya and syrdarya are fully allocated between water users limited water resources are one of the crucial issues in uzbekistan and worldwide only 9 6 of total runoff of transboundary rivers in the aral sea basin is formed within uzbekistan in other words uzbekistan is quite dependent upon other riparian countries from the point of view of available water resources khamraev et al 2018 irrigation is an essential component of crop production in many areas of the world including most of uzbekistan in cotton for example recent studies have shown that proper timing of irrigation is an important production factor and that delaying irrigation can result in losses of between usd 62 ha and usd 300 ha vories et al 2003 water scarcity issues have prompted an interest in improved irrigation scheduling methods and enhanced crop water productivity cwp of cotton varieties considerable research has been done on cwp also known as water use efficiency wue which is defined as the economic yield divided by the crop water use or evapotranspiration and many papers and reviews have been written taylor et al 1983 faurès et al 2007 howell 2001 in addition to cwp irrigation efficiency ie is an important consideration and was first defined by israelsen 1932 as the amount of irrigation water diverted that is eventually available for crop water use according to literature in many irrigation schemes only about 45 of water diverted for irrigation actually reaches the crops levidow et al 2014 de pascale maggio 2005 found that the loss percentages for different irrigation methods were as follows drip irrigation 10 20 sprinkler irrigation 30 50 and furrow irrigation 50 60 in agriculture a farmer a manager of an irrigation project or a river basin authority may consider the efficient use of water quite differently for example in farms substantial water losses may infiltrate deeply in the soil resulting in deep percolation losses which may recharge the aquifers because of the high level of irrigation rates but these losses may not be a high priority for them at the farm level the productive use of water is understood by maximizing yield rather than saving water resources particularly when water is provided at no or little cost a river basin authority can define water use efficiency as allocating as much as possible of limited water resources however under growing water shortage conditions improved cwp and ie represent key factors in increasing cotton productivity which is highly correlated with cwp after becoming an independent country uzbekistan reoriented the focus of agricultural policy on food independency and prioritized food security presently approximately one million ha of irrigated winter wheat and 200 000 ha of dry land wheat are produced in recent years the area devoted to cotton has decreased due to the expansion of fields to grow cereals and other vegetable crops but at the present time cotton is still a dominant crop with a main cropping sequence of cotton winter wheat 1 1 this means that cotton is grown in the first year with winter wheat planted into cotton stubble in october and grown through the cold winter with harvest in the following june due to lack of water much of the wheat ground is left in fallow throughout the rest of the second year hence the 1 1 designation however when possible a summer crop of vegetables or legumes is grown in the remaining 90 100days with temperatures 10 c after wheat harvest the 1 1 cropping sequence has replaced the earlier cotton alfalfa 7 3 7years of cotton followed by 3years of alfalfa crop rotation on the irrigated lands of uzbekistan this plus the significant increase in the area under winter wheat and other summer crops including vegetables and legumes resulted in increasing the water demand at the same time it increased the requirement for adopting practices to improve ie and cwp owing to its deep continental geographic location the country has small and erratic precipitation relative to crop water requirements and agricultural production is predominantly based on irrigation crops other than rice are mainly irrigated by furrow irrigation in uzbekistan conducting irrigation earlier than needed can negatively affect cotton growth and development which leads to prolonging the length of fruiting branches decreasing the number of fruit elements and promoting overly large accumulation of vegetative biomass in research conducted at the uzbekistan cotton research institute irrigation scheduling rules were developed based on when soil water in the 1 5 m deep root zone was depleted to specific percentages of fc ibragimov et al 2007 for example one irrigation regime studied was based on root zone water content decreasing to 65 65 and 60 of field capacity during three growth stages respectively as follows the first of the three levels of fc 65 was used from germination to the squaring stage of the crop the second level again 65 was used from squaring to the flowering fruiting stage and the third level 60 was used during maturation of cotton bolls irrigation was applied when these thresholds were reached research of the cotton breeding seed production and agrotechnologies research institute uzbekistan on the impact of irrigation scheduling on seed lint yield of cotton showed that decreasing the soil moisture level for triggering irrigation by 5 10 from the optimal percentage of fc resulted in yield loss of 0 3 0 7 mgha 1 avliyakulov 2015 in uzbekistan most irrigators rely on their knowledge observation to schedule irrigations for example farmers observe leaf folding loss of turgor change of leaf color to dark green and flowers rising above the top of the canopy the disadvantage of these observations is that by the time they are evident the crop is already water stressed this is similar to the situation in australia where only approximately 40 of growers combine local knowledge with more objective measures to make their irrigation decision montagu and stirzaker 2008 in addition to scheduling irrigation to save water it is useful to know when to turn the water off in addition to knowing when to turn the water on nowadays in conventional practice the cotton grower is not sure if the entire layer of soil has been wetted or not it is acknowledged that there can be differences in the depth of wetting in different parts of a field which often adversely affects seed lint yield of cotton in research it has been identified that an advantage of using a wetting front detector is that it can determine the wetting front of the entire root zone layer of soil in australia stirzaker 2003 showed that using wetting front detectors wfd was a useful tool in micro irrigation management the wfd does not tell an irrigator when to start irrigating it simply informs them how well the last irrigation filled the profile and helps them to make a decision about the timing and duration of the next irrigation stirzaker 2005 also it can be used to directly switch off irrigation in sprinkler irrigation trials for example stirzaker and hutchinson 2006 evaluated the accuracy of scheduling irrigation using a simple wetting front detector that automatically switched the water off after the wetting front had reached a prescribed depth in soil we describe the wfd used in our research in section 2 5 considering the aforementioned we developed objectives for conducting and demonstrating best water management practices through field trials directed to improving efficient use of water in comparison with conventional on farm irrigation practices in uzbekistan the specific objectives of the field trials were 1 to test crop growth stage specific fc based irrigation scheduling regimes applied to two cotton varieties for optimization of yield and irrigation crop water productivity icwp 2 to study the potential of improving irrigation efficiency ie by using wetting front detectors and the effects on yield and icwp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experiments were conducted in 2016 2017 and 2018 at the central experimental station of uzbekistan s cotton breeding seed production and agrotechnologies

russian soil classification which is still in use in uzbekistan the soil type is old irrigated typical sierozem with mechanical composition of silt loam usda 2017 the soil is similar to an ustic torriorthent in the usda classification methods from richards 1954 were used for determination of soluble salt cation and anion concentrations the salt content was 0 085 of mass in the 0 30 cm soil depth while chlorine ion content was 0 006 saturation paste extract electrical conductivity ece of soil with 0 085 salt content is 0 2dsm 1 according to the russian and usda classifications the soil is non saline the water table is 18 m below the surface and the soil formation is considered as automorphic which means that soil formation was not influenced by high water table stream flow or other substantial hydrologic influence other than precipitation climate is arid continental weather is recorded by a weather station at the research site the average temperature varies from 16 2 c to 16 8 с and the maximum temperature exceeds 38 5 40 5 c in summer whereas the minimum temperature declines to as low as 7 5 с in winter long term annual precipitation ranges from 350 to 400 mm with 90 occurring from october through may the soil is characterized by low humus content 0 489 0 629 soil organic matter was determined according to tyurin uzbekistan cotton research institute uzcri 2007 which is a modified walkley black method nelson and sommers 1982 acidification of humus carbon with a solution of chromic anhydride in the presence of sulfuric acid and titration of unused chromic anhydride with ferrous ammonium sulfate fe nh4 2 so4 2 6h2o the analyzes of npk content in soil were done annually in the laboratories of the cbspari total n was analyzed by the kjeldahl method with wet oxidation of soil organic matter using sulfuric acid bremner and mulvaney 1982 the no3 n content mgkg 1 was analyzed calorimetrically with phenol disulphonic acid according to the modified method of granval lajoux from 1886 silber 1913 haper 1924 durynina and egorov 1998 available p2o5 mgkg 1 and exchangeable k2o mgkg 1 were analyzed according to the method described by machigin protasov which involves extraction of p and k compounds with 1 solution ammonium carbonate pн 9 0 and use of a flame photometer which is comparable to the olsen methodology olsen and sommers 1982 total nitrogen total phosphorus and total potassium contents in the surface to 30 cm and 30 50 cm soil layers were 0 063 and 0 044 0 122 and 0 085 and 1 80 and 1 85 respectively while no3 n for the same soil layers was 2 0 and 1 0 mg kg 1 available p2o5 was 22 4 and 20 9 mg kg 1 and exchangeable k2o was 200 and 185 mg kg 1 respectively mineral fertilizer was applied at the rates of 200 kg n ha 1 140 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 100 kg k2o ha 1 the research was conducted following the methods of field experimentation by uzbekistan cotton research institute uzcri 2007 the field trials were conducted in three replicates the experimental layout was a split split plot with complete randomized block design each replicated plot size was 480 m2 with 8 cotton rows and furrow length of 100 m 4 8 mx100 m 2 2 soil water and field water balance determinations field capacity was determined from one randomly selected location 2 m 2 m in the field by flooding covering the flooded area with polyethylene sheet and determining soil moisture in the following days over a period of 2 5days until stabilization was achieved at all the soil depths field capacity fc was determined in 10 cm increments to depth of 100 cm for adopting an index in order to develop fc based irrigation scheduling field capacity fc of soil in the 0 100 cm depth layer was 0 29 m3 m 3 vwc infiltration capacity was determined before sowing and at the end of season using standard double ring metallic infiltrometers with an outer ring diameter of 0 4 m and inner ring diameter of 0 2 m both rings were buried in the soil to a depth of 0 15 m and continuous 6 hours observations were conducted every season soil bulk density bd mgm 3 was measured in every 10 cm from the surface to 100 cm soil depth before sowing and at the end of season using the core method blake and hartge 1986 soil porosity φ m3 m 3 was calculated from bd values using the equation φ 1 bd 2 65 where 2 65 was the assumed particle density mgm 3 the soil water content was determined by the oven drying method applied to soil samples taken approximately twice a week during the growing season in field conditions soil moisture was sampled in three replicates in the place between furrow and plant row from germination to flowering and in maturation growth stages soil samples were taken in 10 cm increments from the surface to 70 cm depth and in the flowering and boll formation growth stages sampling was continued in 10 cm increments to 100 cm depth volumetric water content of the soil profile was determined by multiplying the mass basis water content mgmg 1 by the bulk density in each soil layer irrigation water applied to the field and runoff from the field were both measured using trapezoidal water weirs cippoletti in the supply ditch and at the end of the furrows where tailwater was collected usbr 2001 considering the initially shallow root zone and the desire not to wet the profile too deeply until flowering the wfd was adjusted to indicate when the root zone soil layer was wetted to 70 cm considering an increasingly deep root zone from flowering to boll formation the wfd was adjusted to indicate wetting reaching 100 cm depth finally considering the desire to force the crop to mature and cease flowering during maturation the wfd was adjusted to 70 cm again in order to decrease irrigation time irrigations were conducted with variable flow rate in order to reduce runoff losses and more smoothly wet the entire root zone layer of soil deep percolation loss below the root zone m m3 ha 1 was calculated using the equation ryzhov 1948 1 m wn wm 100 bd h k where wn is gravimetric soil moisture after irrigation wm is gravimetric soil moisture prior to irrigation 100 is a fixed number bd is defined previously h is depth m of wetted soil layer below the root zone and k is the area in ha where deep percolation losses occurred mostly in the initial length of furrow for example м wn wm 100 bd h k 21 33 17 30 100 1 38 0 20 0 36 40 m3 ha 1 2 3 cotton varieties harvest and statistical design two upland cotton gossypium hirsutum l varieties sultan and uzpiti 103 were studied sultan is a cotton cultivar released in uzbekistan and grown on more than 184 thousand hectares in 2019 covering 17 8 of total cropping area of cotton uzpiti 103 is a prospective variety that was grown on more than 2 thousand hectares in 2019 covering 0 2 of total cropping area of cotton in uzbekistan these varieties sultan and uzpiti 103 were chosen because they were released varieties for tashkent province and because irrigation scheduling regimes had not yet been developed for them additionally the cotton varieties were chosen on the basis of maturation time the sultan variety is early maturing vegetation period 115 120days in comparison with uzpiti 103 which we classify as an early medium maturing variety 117 125days vegetation period is measured from germination till 1st boll opening in 50 of plants the mass of cotton per boll was determined by picking the cotton bolls located in 3 6 and 9 fruiting branches of 100 plants in each plot the harvest procedure was to pick cotton in the middle four rows in each replicate plot and separate the cotton into lint and seed components in uzbekistan cotton is harvested multiple times by hand always in two harvests and sometimes in three harvests the statistical design was split split plot with irrigation scheduling regimes described in section 2 4 as the main treatment and cotton varieties and irrigation methods as the splits with three replications table 1 all data were checked for normality and analyzed using split split plot design in sas software sas institute 2008 this included the variables of seed lint yield net irrigation water used per unit yield total irrigation water used per unit yield and irrigation crop water productivity icwp which were analyzed with the repeated measures option the mean effect of the treatment variables irrigation scheduling fc cotton varieties and irrigation method with and without using wetting front detectors and their interactions were compared at a p 0 05 level of significance an lsd post hoc test compared individual treatment means where the anova test indicated significant p 0 05 treatment effects the results are presented in accordance with the statistical significance of interaction of the main effects of treatment for example as shown in section 3 the split split plot analysis showed that irrigation scheduling cotton varieties was the highest level of interaction for all variables including yield net irrigation amount per unit yield total irrigation amount per unit yield and icwp 2 4 irrigation treatments the field experiment included two irrigation scheduling treatments and two irrigation method treatments the first irrigation method treatment included cotton irrigation management without wetting front detectors the second treatment included irrigation management using wetting front detectors to signal when irrigation application should be turned off in both irrigation method treatments two irrigation scheduling treatments were applied for the irrigation scheduling treatments specific percentages of fc were used according to the three chosen cotton growth stages the stages of development were according to elsner et al 1979 e g the regime of 70 75 65 involved irrigating when soil water content declined to 70 of fc from germination till flowering stage 0 5 to 75 of fc from flowering to boll formation stage 5 7 and to 65 of fc during cotton boll maturation stage 7 9 the experimental design is given in table 1 treatments 2 and 6 had wetting front detectors installed treatment 4 was irrigated the same as treatment 2 and treatment 8 was irrigated the same as treatment 6 in both cases using amount of water and duration as determined using wetting front detectors in treatments 2 and 6 respectively the water content data from the three replicate plots in a treatment were averaged together and irrigation proceeded alike in every plot in a treatment when the average reached the assigned fc threshold during an irrigation the furrow flow rate was decreased twice once when water reached three quarters of the furrow length when the flow rate was reduced by half and again when water almost reached the end of furrow when the flow rate was again decreased by half after that the irrigation was continued with decreased flow rate which enabled moistening the entire root zone layer of soil more smoothly conducting irrigations with variable flow rate enabled achieving wetting the soil layer 1 1 1 2 m in the initial part of furrow length and 0 8 0 9 m at the end of furrow length 2 5 operating procedures of wfd device the wfd is an accurate low cost device developed by stirzaker 2003 2005 and available for purchase at https viashop csiro au fig 1 identification of the wetting of a specific root zone layer is the main function of the wfd which helps to answer the question when to stop irrigation during the irrigation the water infiltrates through the soil and after water reaches the reservoir fig 1 left it activates a float which pushes up a rod that can be seen and is a signal to stop the irrigation fig 2 if the float is activated during an irrigation then the reservoir must be emptied before the next irrigation this is done by placing suction on the extraction tube which is a flexible tube that is extended to above the soil surface during wfd installation 2 6 installation of wfd in field installation of the wfds in the correct parts of the field is critical and must be determined carefully the wfds must be installed in non traffic cotton rows to ensure they are not damaged by tractors passing through the field during the growing season in field experiments six wetting front detectors were installed at 70 and 100 cm below the soil surface in a single cotton plant row in each irrigation scheduling treatment of 70 70 60 and 70 75 65 of fc with the furrow length of 100 m treatments 2 and 6 in table 1 in furrow irrigation the initial part of the furrow is over moistened because of having greater irrigation duration thus only in the initial part of the furrow in each irrigation scheduling treatment an additional wfd was installed to the 120 cm soil depth to detect the extent of over moistening the devices were installed near distances of 10 m 50 m and 90 m from the head end of the row for example separated by 1 m distance three wfds were installed near the initial 10 m distance of furrow length at depths of 70 100 and 120 cm fig 3 another two wfds separated by 1 m distance were installed near the 50 m furrow distance at depths of 70 and 100 cm and another two wfds separated by 1 m distance were installed near the 90 m furrow distance at depths of 70 and 100 cm all wfds were placed in a single cotton row fig 3 to install a wfd a hole with 25 cm diameter was excavated to the depth required placing the soil from each distinct soil layer into a separate pile then the wfd was placed in the hole which was then filled with soil carefully by putting soil from each layer back in place in the reverse order from the initial removal of soil after refilling the hole with soil the installed wfd should be watered in order to know if the device is working properly as well as to settle the soil to achieve natural bulk density with the original wfd design irrigation was stopped when the activation of the float indicator was observed in the visible part of the wfd but one of the disadvantages of this was that the irrigator must enter the field to verify if the float is activated or not attempts to allow observation from the field s edge included adding an illumination lamp but the flashing light was only observable at nighttime and an audible signaling alert but its ability to transmit sound was only 50 200 m ultimately a radio transmitter was added to each wfd to send data indicating wetting front detection to a wifi router enabling wireless transmission of data to a computer which recorded the data using a software thus acting as a datalogger the wetting front detectors were installed as described previously in the initial middle and end of the row length and a wifi router powered by a small solar panel was placed outside of the field in the vicinity of the wfds a computer software was used in which wfds were identified with numbers the number indicating the current place in the field wfd icons were colored red yellow and green the red wfd icons were installed to receive water at the bottom of the 0 100 and 0 120 cm layers while the yellow wfds were installed to receive water at the bottom of the 0 70 cm layer when water reached the bottom of the relevant soil layer the wfd icon turned color from red or yellow to green fig 4 during field experiment irrigations the wetting front layer was observed by getting data from the wfd via the wifi router which helped identify the exact time at which to finish irrigation 3 results and discussion precipitation and temperature variations during the growing season of the study years are shown in fig 5 the three seasons were fairly similar in temperature and precipitation with spring rains in april and may followed by a hot dry summer of july through september in 2016 the 1st harvest was on september 26 27 the 2nd harvest was on october 9 and the 3rd harvest was on october 25 in 2017 the 1st harvest was on october 1 3 the 2nd harvest was on october 23 and there was no 3rd harvest in 2018 the 1st harvest was on october 5 6 the 2nd harvest was on october 30 31 and there was no 3rd harvest 3 1 irrigation water balance and effects on porosity and infiltration capacity each season the soil profile 0 100 cm water content remained below the fc and thus below the maximum allowed by soil porosity fig 6 irrigation events were signaled when the soil water content declined to specific percentages of fc for example for the irrigation scheduling regime of 70 75 65 fc irrigation was initiated during the flowering phase when soil water content decreased to 75 of fc while in comparison for the irrigation scheduling regime of 70 70 60 fc irrigation was initiated when soil water content declined to 70 of fc it can be seen that fc percentages differed from each other in each treatment that is why before the last irrigation event in the maturation phase the soil water content values were less for the irrigation scheduling regime of 70 70 60 fc in comparison with water contents for the irrigation scheduling regime of 70 75 65 fc for which the fc percentage was 65 during the maturation phase fig 6 changes in infiltration capacity were mostly related to the number of irrigation events and net irrigation amount for each of the 3years a total of five irrigation events were conducted for the 70 70 60 of fc irrigation scheduling regime and six irrigation events were conducted for the 70 75 65 of fc irrigation scheduling regime seasonal net irrigation water applied for each treatment was different for the 70 70 60 of fc irrigation scheduling regime net irrigation was 4882 m3 ha 1 in 2016 4808 m3 ha 1 in 2017 and 4454 m3 ha 1 in 2018 net irrigation amounts were larger for the 70 75 65 of fc irrigation scheduling regime totaling 5355 m3 ha 1 in 2016 5466 m3 ha 1 in 2017 and 5020 m3 ha 1 in 2018 in comparison cotton seasonal irrigation water amount ranged from 4320 to 7390 m3 ha 1 for limited and full irrigation in california howell et al 1987 in uzbekistan cotton irrigation ranged from 4210 to 4700 m3 ha 1 while et ranged from 438 to 487 mm in furrow irrigated cotton under conditions similar to those in the present study ibragimov et al 2011 in each season and for each treatment values of bd increased and porosity decreased in the plow layer 0 30 cm but increases in bd and decreases in porosity were significantly 5 level not shown greater in all 3years for the 70 75 65 of fc irrigation regime which received more irrigations than did the 70 70 60 of fc irrigation regime fig 7 decreases in porosity were significant in 2017 for the 70 70 60 of fc regime but insignificant at 20 and 30 cm depths in 2016 and 2018 and at the 10 cm depth in 2016 decreases in porosity corresponded with decreases in infiltration capacity at the beginning of the season in the first observed hour infiltration capacity was 386 m3 ha 1 2016 410 m3 ha 1 2017 392 m3 ha 1 2018 and the rates declined in each successive hour to values of 184 149 87 69 and 59 m3 ha 1 2016 206 152 115 91 and 77 m3 ha 1 2017 192 157 90 72 and 61 m3 ha 1 2018 for a total infiltration capacity over 6 h of 934 m3 ha 1 2016 1051 m3 ha 1 2017 and 964 m3 ha 1 2018 at season s end infiltration capacity was decreased by 44 and 66 m3 ha 1 2016 60 and 143 m3 ha 1 2017 43 and 79 m3 ha 1 2018 in treatments with the 70 70 60 of fc irrigation regime and the 70 75 65 of fc regime respectively the infiltration capacity was the least in treatments with larger fc values and more frequent irrigations increased number and increased seasonal irrigation amount appear to have caused the reduction of infiltration capacity and the corresponding increase in bd and reduction in porosity 3 2 water balance effects of using wfds monitoring soil wetting with the help of wfds showed that soil moistened 3 4 h earlier in the initial part of the furrow and wetted the profile to 0 4 m greater depth than at the wfd at 90 m from the head of the row near the end of the furrow length comparison of the irrigation methods with and without using wfds when applying the same irrigation scheduling showed that using the wfd can be a key element to save irrigation water by triggering when to stop irrigation for all 3years the irrigation scheduling regime of 70 75 65 of fc was used in the treatment where the wfds were used and in the treatment where wfds were not used table 2 six irrigation events were conducted during the phase from germination till flowering one irrigation occurred during the phase from flowering until boll formation four irrigations occurred during boll maturation one irrigation occurred reasons that the number of irrigation events in both irrigation methods was the same included that the same irrigation scheduling regime was applied irrigations were delayed by 2 3days in the treatment without wfds because of the larger volume of water applied thus the last irrigation event without wfds was in the full maturation phase whereas the last irrigation event in treatment with wfds was conducted in the beginning of maturation however delaying irrigation by 2 3days was not sufficient to affect the number of irrigations in 2016 for irrigation using wfds the total seasonal irrigation amount was 5830 m3 ha 1 net irrigation amount was 5355 m3 ha 1 runoff totaled 475 m3 ha 1 and deep percolation loss was 245 m3 ha 1 table 2 for irrigation without wfds these values were larger in comparison with using wfds for irrigation without wfds the total seasonal irrigation amount was greater by 736 m3 ha 1 net irrigation amount was greater by 683 m3 ha 1 runoff was greater by 53 m3 ha 1 and deep percolation loss was greater by 162 m3 ha 1 in comparison with using wfds the wfds were able to identify the wetting front layer quickly enough to ensure stopping irrigation in time to save irrigation water similar results were obtained in the 2017 year season as well table 3 much more irrigation water was wasted in irrigation without wfds for example in the 2017 year season the net irrigation amount was larger for irrigation without wfds by approximately the same amount as for the 2016 year season but the total seasonal runoff was much larger in 2017 256 m3 ha 1 by comparison with 2016 53 m3 ha 1 while the deep percolation loss in 2017 was decreased in comparison with 2016 deep percolation losses of 125 m3 ha 1 in 2017 and 162 m3 ha 1 in 2016 table 3 in 2018 for irrigation using wfds the total seasonal irrigation amount was 5619 m3 ha 1 net irrigation amount was 5020 m3 ha 1 runoff totaled 599 m3 ha 1 and deep percolation loss was 308 m3 ha 1 table 4 for irrigation without wfds these values were larger in comparison with using wfds for irrigation without wfds the total seasonal irrigation amount was greater by 696 m3 ha 1 net irrigation amount was greater by 177 m3 ha 1 runoff was greater by 519 m3 ha 1 and deep percolation loss was greater by 81 m3 ha 1 in comparison with using wfds irrigation durations were longer without wfds by 2 h 1 5 2 h and 2 5 h in the three crop growth phases in comparison with durations when wfds were used irrigation intervals were 12 17 days in the treatment using the wfds in comparison with values of 14 20days for the treatment without wfds table 4 overall in 2018 in comparison with irrigation scheduling without wfds for individual irrigations using the wfds the irrigation duration was less by 2 0 3 5 h net irrigation amount was less by 7 90 m3 ha 1 irrigation run off was less by 69 134 m3 ha 1 and deep percolation losses were less by 10 17 m3 ha 1 table 4 the highest rate of additional total runoff in irrigation without wfds occurred in 2018 519 m3 ha 1 when in contrast the smallest total deep percolation losses occurred 81 m3 ha 1 in 2018 overall the smallest values of deep percolation were associated with the largest rates of runoff and vice versa deep percolation loss was included in the net irrigation amount but this water lost below the root zone layer was not counted as water available to the crop 3 3 yield and irrigation crop water productivity the influence of different irrigation scheduling regimes cotton varieties and irrigation methods on seed lint yield of cotton net irrigation water used per unit yield total irrigation water used per unit yield and irrigation crop water productivity icwp are presented in tables 5 6 and 7 in 2016 both irrigation scheduling fc regimes using wfds resulted in decreased irrigation amount and increased yield and icwp for example compared with not using wfds the seed lint yield of cotton variety sultan when using wfds increased by 0 05mgha 1 icwp increased by 0 11 kg m 3 total irrigation water used per unit yield decreased by 102 m3 mg 1 and net irrigation water used per unit yield decreased by 189 m3 mg 1 for the 70 70 60 of fc irrigation scheduling the largest seed lint yield of 4 16mgha 1 was obtained with cotton variety sultan using the 70 75 65 of fc irrigation scheduling regime with wfds these results indicate that the water requirement of sultan was larger in comparison with uzpiti 103 the largest seed lint yield for sultan was achieved with irrigation scheduling of 70 75 65 fc with net irrigation amount of 5280 m3 ha 1 in contrast the largest seed lint yield for cotton variety uzpiti 103 was 4 05mgha 1 in the treatment with the 70 70 60 of fc irrigation scheduling regime with wfds with net irrigation amount of 4715 m3 ha 1 increased fc values in the 70 75 65 of fc irrigation scheduling regime did not increase the seed lint yield of cotton variety uzpiti 103 crop water productivity results were almost identical to the range of 0 55 0 62 kg m 3 and seed lint yields ranging from 3 18 to 4 03mgha 1 reported by ibragimov et al 2007 even if cotton varieties were different in this split split plot design experiment the interaction between irrigation scheduling cotton varieties was statistically confirmed for all variables including yield net irrigation amount per unit yield total irrigation amount per unit yield and icwp for 2016 2018 years in the 2016 season irrigation scheduling cotton varieties irrigation method was statistically significant for all variables whereas in 2017 only net irrigation amount per unit yield and total irrigation amount per unit yield were statistically significant irrigation scheduling was significantly affected by irrigation method with variables of yield net irrigation amount per unit yield and total irrigation amount per unit yield in 2016 with variables of net irrigation amount per unit yield and total irrigation amount per unit yield in 2017 and with the variables of net irrigation amount per unit yield total irrigation amount per unit yield and icwp in 2018 tables 5 6 7 similar results were achieved in 2017 as well the largest icwp was achieved with the uzpiti 103 cotton variety by using the 70 70 60 of fc irrigation scheduling regime with wfds with results of 1 08 kg m 3 in comparison with the 70 75 65 of fc irrigation scheduling regime for which the smallest icwp value was observed 0 80 kg m 3 this is likely due to the water requirement of cotton variety uzpiti 103 being less than that of the sultan variety the largest seed lint yield of cotton variety sultan 5 44mgha 1 was obtained using the 70 75 65 of fc irrigation scheduling regime with wfds which was an additional 0 05mgha 1 seed lint yield in comparison with the same irrigation scheduling without wfds table 6 the changes of seed lint yield among cotton varieties are related to their biological characteristics and water requirement in 2018 the net irrigation water used per unit yield ranged from 1142 to 1335 m3 mg 1 in treatments with wfd while the net water used per unit yield ranged from 1232 to 1393 m3 mg 1 for irrigation without wfds table 7 significant differences in seed lint yield were not observed between irrigation using wfds and irrigation without wfds but yield was consistently less and irrigation water used was consistently greater for irrigation without aid of wfds for instance irrigation crop water productivity icwp yield net irrigation was 4 4 7 9 larger in treatments using wfds 0 75 0 88 kg m 3 in comparison with irrigation without aid of wfds 0 72 0 81 kg m 3 4 conclusion the study investigated the effects of two irrigation scheduling regimes based on percentages of field capacity and the effects of two irrigation methods with and without wetting front detectors wfds on yield and water use of two cotton cultivars over three seasons on old irrigated silty loam soil of eastern uzbekistan the study results revealed that the 70 75 65 of fc irrigation scheduling regime improved irrigation crop water productivity icwp for the sultan cotton variety compared with the 70 70 60 of fc irrigation scheduling regime in contrast the 70 70 60 of fc irrigation scheduling regime resulted in improved icwp for the uzpiti 103 cotton variety compared with a regime of 70 75 65 of fc the 70 70 60 of fc irrigation scheduling regime resulted in saving 10 7 of irrigation water compared with the 70 75 65 of fc regime for the uzpiti 103 cotton variety the study results also showed that losses of runoff water and deep percolation below the rooting zone can be reduced by using wetting front detectors wfds with a data logging network that allows the irrigator to achieve wetting of the entire rooting zone while decreasing irrigation duration runoff and deep percolation of irrigation water thus increasing irrigation efficiency compared with irrigation without wfds using wfds increased irrigation crop water productivity icwp on average by 11 9 and 12 3 for irrigation scheduling done using the 70 75 65 of fc regime and 70 70 60 of fc regime respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
