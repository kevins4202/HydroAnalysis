and reducing total nitrogen tn loss by analysis of published data from multi site field studies 2 identify the appropriate wsi regimes for paddy fields across china based on a newly proposed index system and 3 estimate the potential overall effects under full implementation of wsi regimes for rice production at the country level based on scenario simulation 2 data and methods 2 1 data sources to analyse the general effect of common wsi practices in paddy fields research data from multi site studies were collated the principal source of such data was the chinese national knowledge infrastructure project cnki to ensure comparability of the data only data that satisfied the following criteria were regarded as effective and used in subsequent analysis the control treatment ck must involve conventional flooded irrigation fi and the study period must cover the whole rice growing season such effective studies covered 16 provinces territories and 63 study sites in china environmental data related to paddy fields were obtained to identify appropriate wsi practices in different regions of china soil properties 0 20 mm including soil sand fraction soil silt fraction soil clay fraction soil ph soil salinity ds m and soil organic carbon were collected from fao harmonized world soil database hwsd soil propertie data 2019 precipitation and land use data were obtained

fertiliser application and irrigation amount were sourced from published data hou et al 2018 rice yields in 2016 were obtained from chinese agricultural statistical data published by the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china rice yield data 2019 the data were rasterised before further analysis 2 2 methods 2 2 1 analysis of the effects of various wsi regimes the good operability and effects of swi ci ii and rgi mean that they are widely applied as wsi regimes in china based on multi site study data pertaining to the effects of these four wsi regimes from our literature survey the water saving rate wsr pollutant reducing rate prr and yield increasing rate yir of each study site were calculated and classified by irrigation regime furthermore these data were used to calculate the mean and standard deviation sd of wsr prr and yir of various wsi regimes through comparison of the average wsr prr and yir the deferences in water saving pollutant reducing and yield increasing effects between various wsi regimes were analysed tn loss via surface runoff was used as a proxy indicator of pollutant reduction 2 2 2 selection of appropriate wsi regime based on an index system firstly we analysed the application conditions of various irrigation regimes and identified the critical factors affecting their distribution across china by literature survey in general common wsi practices are suitable in regions characterised by high soil fertility good water and nutrient conservation capabilities a wet climate high groundwater levels and relatively flat terrain ali and talukder 2008 he et al 2016 mao 2002 sun et al 2014 these critical factors were selected as indices with which to establish a new index system for irrigation regime selection due to the differences in water saving yield increasing and pollutant reducing effects among different wsi regimes the comprehensive effects are chosen as an alternative reference index when other environmental factors related to wsi regimes are similar considering the applicability and effects of various wsi practices and the representativeness and measurability of the indices an index system for irrigation regime selection was proposed soil 1 climatic and hydrologic conditions 2 terrain 3 and effects 4 were chosen as the four types of indicators the selection criteria for different irrigation regimes corresponding to the index system are listed in table 1 chi et al 2003 gu and zhao 2012 mao 2002 the soil index 1 is subdivided soil texture soil fertility and soil salinisation the american triangular chart for soil texture classification was used to classify soil texture as either sandy loamy or clayey the topsoil ph t ph and topsoil organic carbon content t oc were selected as indicative of soil saline alkaline capacity and fertility respectively shallow groundwater plays a key role in agro hydrological processes especially in arid regions and often supplies a necessary part of the water requirements of crops and surrounding native vegetation wang et al 2018a overall fi recharges groundwater whereas wsi may even extract water from the ground hence wsi is better suited to areas with high groundwater levels to avoid possible water stress whereby growth is inhibited due to water shortage homma et al 2004 lacking groundwater data at the country level we assumed that the risk of water shortage type water stress caused by low groundwater levels under wsi practices occurs less in regions of abundant rainfall precipitation is used to divide the four climatic zones and approximately express the climatic and hydrologic conditions therein terrain conditions can be classified according to slope or using the classification systems of land use and cover change lucc prevailing in china in this study paddy fields were divided into plain paddy slope 6 hilly paddy 6 slope 15 mountainous paddy 15 slope 25 and steep sloping paddy or slope 25 based on lucc data based on the index system for irrigation regime selection and application conditions of various irrigation regimes the potential distribution of wsi regimes in china was simulated in arcgis the actual distribution of wsi practices as evinced by survey data was used to verify the index system 2 2 3 analysis of potential effects of wsi at the country level given that ci ii and swi share certain application conditions and confer different effects we set three scenarios scenario 1 with ci swi and gri scenario 2 with ii swi and gri and scenario 3 with swi and gri based on the effects and spatial distribution of wsi regimes the overall effects under optimal wsi application scenarios at the country level were estimated given that there was a good linear correlation between n and p losses and the fertiliser amount shi et al 2010 the fertiliser amount was used as the weight to calculate total prr at the country level the irrigation amount and rice yield of various regions were used as weights to calculate total wsr and yir at the country level respectively eqs 1 3 1 w s r t o t a l i i w s r i i i 2 p r r t o t a l f i p r r i f i 3 y i r t o t a l y i y i r i y i where

local yield increasing rate under one specific wsi regime yi rice yield in the local region kg ha 3 result and discussion 3 1 individual effect of wsi regimes paddy fields are mainly distributed across north eastern central and southern china which corresponded to main areas of single cropping rice paddy upland rotation and double cropping rice respectively according to our literature survey the actual distribution of wsi practices in paddy fields is as depicted in fig 2 swi ci and ii are widely distributed across china as relatively mature irrigation regimes ii and ci are suitable for popularisation at present gri is widely applied in mountainous regions of guizhou hubei and fujian provinces and is applied in the northern region and jiangsu jiangxi and anhui provinces in combination with other wsi regimes the effects of different wsi regimes on saving water increasing yield and reducing pollution as extracted from literature data are shown in fig 3 a relatively large sd under the same wsi regime arose because the effects of wsi practices were influenced by a variety of factors one irrigation regime may have use different irrigation amounts in regions with different climatic conditions even in the same region the effects of wsi vary with time and intensity of rainfall type and amount of fertiliser soil condition and rice variety chu et al 2018 ci had the highest average wsr 35 12 followed by rgi 31 28 swi 24 25 and ii 19 21 the water saving effects of various wsi regimes were mainly related to the duration under low water or no water conditions and the total irrigation amount under ci paddy fields have no surface water layer during most of the rice growing period throughout the growth period besides the drainage period swi establishes a low water level below that in conventional fi swi ci and ii focus on reducing irrigation water by maintenance of a low water level and enhanced water use efficiency wue rgi is dedicated to taking full advantage of rainwater in general the duration under no water conditions in descending order is ci ii and swi and the total irrigation amount used in ci is generally less than that in swi and ii the durations under no water conditions and the water demand of rgi depend on local rainfall and the combined wsi regime used therewith in terms of pollutant reducing effect ci had the highest average prr for tn with 54 97 followed by swi 36 87 and ii 24 76 compared to fi the long term low water even no water operation of wsi can reduce the possibility of discharging surface runoff delay the discharge time after rain events and decrease the highly concentrated drainage pollutant load during the early period of a rainstorm by increasing the water storage capacity in paddy fields thus efficiently controlling tn loss via surface runoff gao et al 2009 sun et al 2014 the average prr has a significantly positive correlation with the average wsr of wsi regimes y 1 8615x 9 8916 with r2 0 9911 where y denotes prr and x denotes wsr that is the greater wsr is the greater the average prr fig 4 a the higher wsr can generate large potential water storage capacity in paddy fields therefore the potential to reduce tn loss in paddy fields will increase with increasing of wsr given the high positive correlation between wsr and prr under various wsi regimes the prr under rgi for which there is a lack of literature data was estimated as 47 34 with a wsr of 31 28 wsi improved the double effects of both source controlling and sink increasing by decreasing pollutant loss from paddy fields while increasing their water storage capacity which is conducive to retention of runoff and other input water such as irrigation water appropriate wsi practices can promote root activity and enhance wue which benefit other physiological processes and result in a higher crop yield he et al 2016 jiao et al 2018 song et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 in terms of yield increasing effect ci had the lowest average yir with 0 79 followed by ii 5 40 swi 8 12 then rgi 11 82 the application of more advanced irrigation practices not only saved irrigation water and reduced n loss but also greatly increased crop yields lu et al 2015 ci had little yield increasing effect although it resulted in high wsr and prr unlike the positive relationship between prr and wsr yir initially increased with increasing wsr but then decreased fig 4b moderate water stress imposed by choice of wsi can increase rice yield but the yield increasing effect will be diminished when the wsr is increased to a certain extent with a concomitant increase in water stress wsi regimes confer multiple effects which meet the corresponding sdgs of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development the yield increasing effects meet goal 2 4 increase productivity and production the pollutant reducing effects meet goal 6 3 improve water quality by reducing pollution and the water saving effects meet goal 6 4 substantially increase water use efficiency across all sectors wsi regimes help to promote sustainable rice production agenda for sustainable development 2019 3 2 environmental characteristics of paddy fields in china the main environmental factors that affect the applicability of wsi practices are shown in fig 5 a e the soil is the most important factor determining the applicability of wsi practices in china only 14 05 of paddy fields are on sandy soils which are mainly distributed in the eastern coastal region of jiangsu and zhejiang provinces and are scattered in anhui hubei sichuan and ningxia provinces to develop wsi regimes for use on sandy soils is inappropriate because of the low soil fertility and high infiltration rate zheng et al 2018 according to the topsoil organic carbon content t oc data 78 03 of the paddy fields in china have medium to very high soil fertility the remaining 21 97 are affected by poor soil fertility soil which are mainly in the northern region of heilongjiang province the southern region of liaoning province and the northern and central regions of jiangsu province according to topsoil ph t ph data 52 47 of paddy fields in china are on mild saline and alkaline land mainly distributed in the yangtze river basin of central china only 0 59 of paddy fields in china are on middle saline and alkaline land mainly distributed in coastal areas of liaoning and jiangsu provinces wsi practices with insufficient irrigation water are unsuitable for use in saline alkali soils easily salinised regions arid regions and semi arid regions because the upward flow of unsaturated capillary water caused by evaporation can lead to soil alkalsation and desalinisation chi et al 2003 hence conventional fi is usually used in saline alkali soils precipitation is an important recharge of surface water and groundwater hund et al 2018 melki et al 2017 xiao et al 2018 according to annual precipitation data most of china s paddy fields are exposed to a humid or semi humid climate precipitation exceeding 400 mm y 1 and only 1 57 of total paddy area belong to arid and semi arid climate according to terrain data paddy fields in china are mainly distributed across both plains and hills only 4 21 of paddy areas scatter in mountainous regions such as guizhou yunnan sichuan and shanxi provinces swi ci and ii regimes favor relatively flat regions rather than mountainous ones for one reason the high ground water levels they require usually occur beneath flatter terrain for another these are precision irrigation techniques that rely on good irrigation and drainage facilities which are not easy to construct in mountainous regions 3 3 potential application and distribution of wsi regimes in china based on the proposed index system for irrigation regime selection the potential distribution of appropriate wsi regimes for paddy system in china was simulated fig 6 the potential distribution was consistent with the adopted wsi practices fig 2 which indicated that the new index system is applicable in irrigation regime selection as simulated about 94 19 of the total paddy area in china is suited to the application of wsi practices swi is the most widely distributed wsi regime and is suitable for 90 03 of the total paddy area among the 90 03 of paddy fields 66 70 of paddy fields marked in red in fig 6 are only suitable for swi mainly in the paddy upland rotation region of central china such as sichuan hubei anhui and jiangsu provinces 23 33 of paddy fields marked in blue in fig 6 are simultaneously suitable for ci and ii because of their similar environmental requirements mainly in the single cropping rice regions in the north east and in the double cropping rice regions in the south such as heilongjiang hunan guangxi and hainan provinces in mountainous regions rice yield is mostly limited by insufficient irrigation infrastructure and seasonal water shortages guo et al 2018 as the optimised wsi regime for mountainous terrain rgi cover a smaller proportion 4 16 of the total paddy area mainly in sichuan guizhou and yunnan provinces rgi is usually used in conjunction with other wsi regimes towa and guo 2014 which indicated that its potential area of application may be larger than that simulated in this study about 5 81 of the total paddy area in china is unsuited to adoption of any of the four wsi practices due to factors such as soil structure deterioration and low soil fertility as found in many coastal regions 3 4 potential overall effect of wsi practices at the country level fig 5f g shows the nationwide spatial distribution of n fertilizer amount irrigation amount and rice yield the high yield regions were mainly distributed in jilin and liaoning provinces in northern china and jiangsu hubei and sichuan provinces in central china which also featured high levels of n fertilisation and irrigation china is still at the stage of raising rice yields with high fertilisation and irrigation levels this is the main reason why nps pollution from paddy fields is severe in china under full implementation of potential appropriate wsi regimes for rice production in china fig 6 the overall effects on water saving wsrtotal pollutant reducing prrtotal and yield increasing yirtotal at the country level were estimated on the basis of the eqs 1 3 given that ci ii and swi have different effects and similar distributions across 23 33 of paddy areas we set three scenarios under scenario 1 with ci in ci ii swi regions the wsrtotal prrtotal and yirtotal will reach 26 41 39 11 and 5 39 respectively under scenario 2 with ii in ci ii swi regions these three indices will reach 22 06 32 11 and 6 32 respectively under scenario 3 with swi in ci ii swi regions these three indices will reach 23 22 34 88 and 6 87 respectively scenario 1 offered better water saving and pollutant reducing effects with lower yield increasing effect than scenarios 2 and 3 this result indicated that nationwide wsi practices would have noticeable effects on water saving and pollutant reduction as well as ensuring growth in rice yield 4 conclusion wsi exerted a positive water saving pollutant reducing and yield increasing influence for sustainable rice production among the four common wsi regimes used in china ci had the greatest water saving effect with the highest average wsr of 35 12 followed by rgi 31 28 swi 24 25 and ii 19 21 ci also had the highest average prr for tn of 56 09 followed by swi 31 16 and ii 20 52 in terms of yield increasing effect ci had the lowest average yir 0 79 followed by ii 5 40 swi 8 12 and rgi 11 82 in general the larger the wsr the higher the prr but the yield increasing effect will be diminished when wsr is increased to a certain extent due to water shortage type water stress the water saving is the most important factor affecting pollutant reduction and rice yield is the main constraint on water saving and pollutant reduction appropriate irrigation regimes can achieve these multiple objectives simultaneously from the perspective of pollutant reduction ci is the optimal wsi regime from the perspective of the multiple effects of water saving pollutant reduction and yield increase swi is the optimal wsi regime wsi regimes can achieve the desired multiple effects and accordingly meet the multiple sdgs enshrined in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development the distribution of wsi regimes is largely affected by regional environmental factors such as soil climatic and hydrological conditions and terrain wsi practices have significant application potential in china and 94 19 of all paddy area is suited to adoption of wsi practices swi is the most widely distributed wsi regime with 90 03 of the total paddy area in china followed by ci and ii 23 33 and rgi 4 16 in particular some 23 33 of paddy area is simultaneously suitable for ci ii and swi in which regions the most appropriate wsi regime can be further selected based on the differences between desired effects only 5 81 of all paddy area in china is unsuitable for application of any of the four wsi regimes due to factors such as soil structure deterioration and low soil fertility by full implementation of appropriate wsi regimes in rice production at the country level the total wsr prr and yir are likely to reach 22 06 26 41 32 11 39 11 and 5 39 6 87 the widespread use of wsi practices in china has noticeable potential to alleviate water shortage and nps pollution while ensuring stable even higher rice yield the integrated effects of wsi practices with other management practices such as fertiliser management and tillage will be a significant research direction in paddy system in addition wsi practices not only have a positive effect on saving water increasing yield and reducing pollution but are also advantageous to controlling greenhouse gas emissions and to reducing the risk of pest and disease damage the versatility of wsi practices and their environmental and economic benefits will be another research focus in the future funding sources this work was supported by the national key research and development program of china grant number

irrigation regimes corresponding to the index system are listed in table 1 chi et al 2003 gu and zhao 2012 mao 2002 the soil index 1 is subdivided soil texture soil fertility and soil salinisation the american triangular chart for soil texture classification was used to classify soil texture as either sandy loamy or clayey the topsoil ph t ph and topsoil organic carbon content t oc were selected as indicative of soil saline alkaline capacity and fertility respectively shallow groundwater plays a key role in agro hydrological processes especially in arid regions and often supplies a necessary part of the water requirements of crops and surrounding native vegetation wang et al 2018a overall fi recharges groundwater whereas wsi may even extract water from the ground hence wsi is better suited to areas with high groundwater levels to avoid possible water stress whereby growth is inhibited due to water shortage homma et al 2004 lacking groundwater data at the country level we assumed that the risk of water shortage type water stress caused by low groundwater levels under wsi practices occurs less in regions of abundant rainfall precipitation is used to divide the four climatic zones and approximately express the climatic and hydrologic conditions therein terrain conditions can be classified according to slope or using the classification systems of land use and cover change lucc prevailing in china in this study paddy fields were divided into plain paddy slope 6 hilly paddy 6 slope 15 mountainous paddy 15 slope 25 and steep sloping paddy or slope 25 based on lucc data based on the index system for irrigation regime selection and application conditions of various irrigation regimes the potential distribution of wsi regimes in china was simulated in arcgis the actual distribution of wsi practices as evinced by survey data was used to verify the index system 2 2 3 analysis of potential effects of wsi at the country level given that ci ii and swi share certain application conditions and confer different effects we set three scenarios scenario 1 with ci swi and gri scenario 2 with ii swi and gri and scenario 3 with swi and gri based on the effects and spatial distribution of wsi regimes the overall effects under optimal wsi application scenarios at the country level were estimated given that there was a good linear correlation between n and p losses and the fertiliser amount shi et al 2010 the fertiliser amount was used as the weight to calculate total prr at the country level the irrigation amount and rice yield of various regions were used as weights to calculate total wsr and yir at the country level respectively eqs 1 3 1 w s r t o t a l i i w s r i i i 2 p r r t o t a l f i p r r i f i 3 y i r t o t a l y i y i r i y i where

local yield increasing rate under one specific wsi regime yi rice yield in the local region kg ha 3 result and discussion 3 1 individual effect of wsi regimes paddy fields are mainly distributed across north eastern central and southern china which corresponded to main areas of single cropping rice paddy upland rotation and double cropping rice respectively according to our literature survey the actual distribution of wsi practices in paddy fields is as depicted in fig 2 swi ci and ii are widely distributed across china as relatively mature irrigation regimes ii and ci are suitable for popularisation at present gri is widely applied in mountainous regions of guizhou hubei and fujian provinces and is applied in the northern region and jiangsu jiangxi and anhui provinces in combination with other wsi regimes the effects of different wsi regimes on saving water increasing yield and reducing pollution as extracted from literature data are shown in fig 3 a relatively large sd under the same wsi regime arose because the effects of wsi practices were influenced by a variety of factors one irrigation regime may have use different irrigation amounts in regions with different climatic conditions even in the same region the effects of wsi vary with time and intensity of rainfall type and amount of fertiliser soil condition and rice variety chu et al 2018 ci had the highest average wsr 35 12 followed by rgi 31 28 swi 24 25 and ii 19 21 the water saving effects of various wsi regimes were mainly related to the duration under low water or no water conditions and the total irrigation amount under ci paddy fields have no surface water layer during most of the rice growing period throughout the growth period besides the drainage period swi establishes a low water level below that in conventional fi swi ci and ii focus on reducing irrigation water by maintenance of a low water level and enhanced water use efficiency wue rgi is dedicated to taking full advantage of rainwater in general the duration under no water conditions in descending order is ci ii and swi and the total irrigation amount used in ci is generally less than that in swi and ii the durations under no water conditions and the water demand of rgi depend on local rainfall and the combined wsi regime used therewith in terms of pollutant reducing effect ci had the highest average prr for tn with 54 97 followed by swi 36 87 and ii 24 76 compared to fi the long term low water even no water operation of wsi can reduce the possibility of discharging surface runoff delay the discharge time after rain events and decrease the highly concentrated drainage pollutant load during the early period of a rainstorm by increasing the water storage capacity in paddy fields thus efficiently controlling tn loss via surface runoff gao et al 2009 sun et al 2014 the average prr has a significantly positive correlation with the average wsr of wsi regimes y 1 8615x 9 8916 with r2 0 9911 where y denotes prr and x denotes wsr that is the greater wsr is the greater the average prr fig 4 a the higher wsr can generate large potential water storage capacity in paddy fields therefore the potential to reduce tn loss in paddy fields will increase with increasing of wsr given the high positive correlation between wsr and prr under various wsi regimes the prr under rgi for which there is a lack of literature data was estimated as 47 34 with a wsr of 31 28 wsi improved the double effects of both source controlling and sink increasing by decreasing pollutant loss from paddy fields while increasing their water storage capacity which is conducive to retention of runoff and other input water such as irrigation water appropriate wsi practices can promote root activity and enhance wue which benefit other physiological processes and result in a higher crop yield he et al 2016 jiao et al 2018 song et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 in terms of yield increasing effect ci had the lowest average yir with 0 79 followed by ii 5 40 swi 8 12 then rgi 11 82 the application of more advanced irrigation practices not only saved irrigation water and reduced n loss but also greatly increased crop yields lu et al 2015 ci had little yield increasing effect although it resulted in high wsr and prr unlike the positive relationship between prr and wsr yir initially increased with increasing wsr but then decreased fig 4b moderate water stress imposed by choice of wsi can increase rice yield but the yield increasing effect will be diminished when the wsr is increased to a certain extent with a concomitant increase in water stress wsi regimes confer multiple effects which meet the corresponding sdgs of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development the yield increasing effects meet goal 2 4 increase productivity and production the pollutant reducing effects meet goal 6 3 improve water quality by reducing pollution and the water saving effects meet goal 6 4 substantially increase water use efficiency across all sectors wsi regimes help to promote sustainable rice production agenda for sustainable development 2019 3 2 environmental characteristics of paddy fields in china the main environmental factors that affect the applicability of wsi practices are shown in fig 5 a e the soil is the most important factor determining the applicability of wsi practices in china only 14 05 of paddy fields are on sandy soils which are mainly distributed in the eastern coastal region of jiangsu and zhejiang provinces and are scattered in anhui hubei sichuan and ningxia provinces to develop wsi regimes for use on sandy soils is inappropriate because of the low soil fertility and high infiltration rate zheng et al 2018 according to the topsoil organic carbon content t oc data 78 03 of the paddy fields in china have medium to very high soil fertility the remaining 21 97 are affected by poor soil fertility soil which are mainly in the northern region of heilongjiang province the southern region of liaoning province and the northern and central regions of jiangsu province according to topsoil ph t ph data 52 47 of paddy fields in china are on mild saline and alkaline land mainly distributed in the yangtze river basin of central china only 0 59 of paddy fields in china are on middle saline and alkaline land mainly distributed in coastal areas of liaoning and jiangsu provinces wsi practices with insufficient irrigation water are unsuitable for use in saline alkali soils easily salinised regions arid regions and semi arid regions because the upward flow of unsaturated capillary water caused by evaporation can lead to soil alkalsation and desalinisation chi et al 2003 hence conventional fi is usually used in saline alkali soils precipitation is an important recharge of surface water and groundwater hund et al 2018 melki et al 2017 xiao et al 2018 according to annual precipitation data most of china s paddy fields are exposed to a humid or semi humid climate precipitation exceeding 400 mm y 1 and only 1 57 of total paddy area belong to arid and semi arid climate according to terrain data paddy fields in china are mainly distributed across both plains and hills only 4 21 of paddy areas scatter in mountainous regions such as guizhou yunnan sichuan and shanxi provinces swi ci and ii regimes favor relatively flat regions rather than mountainous ones for one reason the high ground water levels they require usually occur beneath flatter terrain for another these are precision irrigation techniques that rely on good irrigation and drainage facilities which are not easy to construct in mountainous regions 3 3 potential application and distribution of wsi regimes in china based on the proposed index system for irrigation regime selection the potential distribution of appropriate wsi regimes for paddy system in china was simulated fig 6 the potential distribution was consistent with the adopted wsi practices fig 2 which indicated that the new index system is applicable in irrigation regime selection as simulated about 94 19 of the total paddy area in china is suited to the application of wsi practices swi is the most widely distributed wsi regime and is suitable for 90 03 of the total paddy area among the 90 03 of paddy fields 66 70 of paddy fields marked in red in fig 6 are only suitable for swi mainly in the paddy upland rotation region of central china such as sichuan hubei anhui and jiangsu provinces 23 33 of paddy fields marked in blue in fig 6 are simultaneously suitable for ci and ii because of their similar environmental requirements mainly in the single cropping rice regions in the north east and in the double cropping rice regions in the south such as heilongjiang hunan guangxi and hainan provinces in mountainous regions rice yield is mostly limited by insufficient irrigation infrastructure and seasonal water shortages guo et al 2018 as the optimised wsi regime for mountainous terrain rgi cover a smaller proportion 4 16 of the total paddy area mainly in sichuan guizhou and yunnan provinces rgi is usually used in conjunction with other wsi regimes towa and guo 2014 which indicated that its potential area of application may be larger than that simulated in this study about 5 81 of the total paddy area in china is unsuited to adoption of any of the four wsi practices due to factors such as soil structure deterioration and low soil fertility as found in many coastal regions 3 4 potential overall effect of wsi practices at the country level fig 5f g shows the nationwide spatial distribution of n fertilizer amount irrigation amount and rice yield the high yield regions were mainly distributed in jilin and liaoning provinces in northern china and jiangsu hubei and sichuan provinces in central china which also featured high levels of n fertilisation and irrigation china is still at the stage of raising rice yields with high fertilisation and irrigation levels this is the main reason why nps pollution from paddy fields is severe in china under full implementation of potential appropriate wsi regimes for rice production in china fig 6 the overall effects on water saving wsrtotal pollutant reducing prrtotal and yield increasing yirtotal at the country level were estimated on the basis of the eqs 1 3 given that ci ii and swi have different effects and similar distributions across 23 33 of paddy areas we set three scenarios under scenario 1 with ci in ci ii swi regions the wsrtotal prrtotal and yirtotal will reach 26 41 39 11 and 5 39 respectively under scenario 2 with ii in ci ii swi regions these three indices will reach 22 06 32 11 and 6 32 respectively under scenario 3 with swi in ci ii swi regions these three indices will reach 23 22 34 88 and 6 87 respectively scenario 1 offered better water saving and pollutant reducing effects with lower yield increasing effect than scenarios 2 and 3 this result indicated that nationwide wsi practices would have noticeable effects on water saving and pollutant reduction as well as ensuring growth in rice yield 4 conclusion wsi exerted a positive water saving pollutant reducing and yield increasing influence for sustainable rice production among the four common wsi regimes used in china ci had the greatest water saving effect with the highest average wsr of 35 12 followed by rgi 31 28 swi 24 25 and ii 19 21 ci also had the highest average prr for tn of 56 09 followed by swi 31 16 and ii 20 52 in terms of yield increasing effect ci had the lowest average yir 0 79 followed by ii 5 40 swi 8 12 and rgi 11 82 in general the larger the wsr the higher the prr but the yield increasing effect will be diminished when wsr is increased to a certain extent due to water shortage type water stress the water saving is the most important factor affecting pollutant reduction and rice yield is the main constraint on water saving and pollutant reduction appropriate irrigation regimes can achieve these multiple objectives simultaneously from the perspective of pollutant reduction ci is the optimal wsi regime from the perspective of the multiple effects of water saving pollutant reduction and yield increase swi is the optimal wsi regime wsi regimes can achieve the desired multiple effects and accordingly meet the multiple sdgs enshrined in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development the distribution of wsi regimes is largely affected by regional environmental factors such as soil climatic and hydrological conditions and terrain wsi practices have significant application potential in china and 94 19 of all paddy area is suited to adoption of wsi practices swi is the most widely distributed wsi regime with 90 03 of the total paddy area in china followed by ci and ii 23 33 and rgi 4 16 in particular some 23 33 of paddy area is simultaneously suitable for ci ii and swi in which regions the most appropriate wsi regime can be further selected based on the differences between desired effects only 5 81 of all paddy area in china is unsuitable for application of any of the four wsi regimes due to factors such as soil structure deterioration and low soil fertility by full implementation of appropriate wsi regimes in rice production at the country level the total wsr prr and yir are likely to reach 22 06 26 41 32 11 39 11 and 5 39 6 87 the widespread use of wsi practices in china has noticeable potential to alleviate water shortage and nps pollution while ensuring stable even higher rice yield the integrated effects of wsi practices with other management practices such as fertiliser management and tillage will be a significant research direction in paddy system in addition wsi practices not only have a positive effect on saving water increasing yield and reducing pollution but are also advantageous to controlling greenhouse gas emissions and to reducing the risk of pest and disease damage the versatility of wsi practices and their environmental and economic benefits will be another research focus in the future funding sources this work was supported by the national key research and development program of china grant number

11091,stationary actual evapotranspiration et estimation methods deal with some issues such as maintenance problems the point data recording for a particular location the complex hydrological process calculation and requiring the expert workers to solve this et estimation methods like surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal method can be used based on the satellite images however the efficiency of the sebal model varies in et estimation for different products and environmental conditions on the other hand pistachio is an important crop of iran which little investigation were accomplished to estimate its et using the presented models therefore the purpose of this study is to investigate the efficiency of sebal algorithm in estimating et of pistachio crop in this regard actual et of a 100 hectares pistachio farm located in safaeieh region in the semnan province iran was selected as the study area implementations were performed using 29 landsat 8 operational land imager oli images during the 2013 2017 period the results were verified and compared with the results of evapotranspiration in standard condition estimated by the intelligent meteorological instrument imetos pessl as the ground truth the results of this study indicate the determination coefficient and root mean square error rmse of the estimated actual et for pistachio plant as 0 8 and 2 5 mm respectively moreover the results indicate the high spatial variability of et in the pistachio growth period and the need to use a satellite data analysis method like the sebal method to prepare the et map overall the results show the good efficiency of the sebal model for estimating the actual et of the pistachio product keywords evapotranspiration of pistachio surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal intelligent meteorological instrument imetos pessl landsat 8 operational land imager oli images 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is of great importance in water resources management and agriculture the calculation of et is performed empirically and experimentally with high accuracy using eddy correlation method kizer and elliott 1991 the bowen ratio technique and weighing lysimeter wright 1991 however these methods can only determine the et rate at a single point or a small area for specific times and are not expandable for a wide area hence et estimation models can be used to overcome these limitations in these models satellite images can be used to determine the et on extensive areas in a more comprehensive statement satellite remote sensing et models provide a fairly accurate estimate of et in vast areas with minimum use of ground data and utilizing multiple algorithms bastiaanssen and chandrapala 2003 moreover et remote measurements due to vast spatial and temporal coverage the optimal use of time and cost high accuracy of results and easy and inexpensive access to data is an appropriate option for massive et measurements zamani losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 various models have been presented for estimating et from satellite images allen et al 2007 su 2002 one of the most widely used models for estimating et through satellite imagery is the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal model this model was initially developed by bastiaanssen et al 1998c and improved by allen et al 2002 for the idaho mountainous regions based on measured et values at ground level this model was implemented by bastiaanssen et al 1998a and bastiaanssen et al 1998b in order to determine et in large farms in china india spain and pakistan and the results were compared with field in situ et measurements the results showed that in 85 of the cases the data obtained from this algorithm were consistent with field in situ data without any calibration trezza 2002 estimated the water requirement of crops in idaho region from landsat satellite data using sebal he compared the accuracy of this model with the weighing lysimeter data from the kimberley agricultural research institute of idaho the results of the sebal method showed a difference of less than 5 with the results of weighing lysimeter data in another study conducted by tasumi et al 2003 in idaho two energy balance models including sebal and mapping et with internalized calibration metric were compared the results showed that both energy balance models have good agreement with the results of the lysimeter and proved the efficiency of using energy balance models to calculate actual et values bastiaanssen et al 2005 implemented sebal in more than 30 countries they examined the sebal algorithm in two farm and regional scales the results showed that the daily accuracy of the comparison of the measured values and the results of the sebal algorithm was 85 for the farm scale and was up to 95 for the seasonal evaluation moreover the accuracy of this algorithm in the regional scale reached to 96 opoku duah et al 2008 used the sebal model with remote sensing data from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sensors in order to estimate the et of the savannah region in western africa the results were compared with the extracted et from landsat etm images during this comparison modis with coefficient of determination of 0 71 and an error of 2 mm day showed better performance compared to the aster ramos et al 2009 investigated the 4 year et of the flumen region of the ebro plain in northeastern spain using the sebal algorithm and compared them with lysimetric values the actual et values obtained from the sebal method for the grass had the deviation of 0 3 mm day versus the lysimetric measurements and deviation of 0 36 mm day compared to the penman monteith method furthermore actual et of maize and wheat and actual et obtained by the lysimetric method had a good consistency for research fields with a deviation of 0 6 mm day moreover 20 error in the regional scale was obtained between the et values estimated by sebal and penman monteith method teixeira et al 2009 calibrated all measured parameters used in the sebal algorithm including surface albedo surface temperature atmospheric and surface reflectance thermal radiation flux surface roughness net radiation air temperature gradient sensible thermal flux and evaporation term in the semi desert region of brazil in 4 regions and 7 climatic stations then daily et was calculated for mixed agricultural lands and natural ecosystems in this study the coefficients of the sebal algorithm were developed according to local conditions this led to the determination of quantitative effects of irrigated agriculture on the regional water balance as well as the water use efficiency of the horticulture which is the largest water consumer in the semi arid region of brazil ruhoff et al 2012 estimated the et values in brazil based on the sebal model using modis satellite imagery the results of the comparison of daily values of sebal model with the results of eddy correlation method for sugarcane and savannah cultivars indicated r2 of 0 76 and 0 66 respectively the researchers found vegetation index temperature gradient and net radiation as the most sensitive inputs of the model du et al 2013 combined et calculated by the sebal model and modis et products with meteorological data for estimating et in the sanjiang plain in china the results showed that daily et estimated by the sebal model ranged from 11 29 to 27 57 relative to the eddy correlation system the results also showed that the use of the sebal algorithm can play an important role in water resource decision making paul et al 2014 investigated the effect of roughness on sebal model performance in the semi desert region of texas in america estimated values of et and other components of the sebal algorithm were compared with field data measured by four precise weighing lysimeters in two irrigated and dryland agriculture conditions the results indicate the need for a realistic investigation of the heat transfer resistance in one source resistance modeling frames zamani losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 evaluated sebal surface energy balance system sebs and metric models for estimating evaporation from a freshwater lake in iran the results show the sebal inefficiency and the proper performance of sebs and metric models in estimating evaporation from the selected water body in comparison with the evaporation pan data regarding the previous studies sebal et estimates need to be evaluated and verified for each agricultural product and environmental condition moreover little research has been carried out in the field of satellite estimates of et on pistachio et product which is one of the most important agricultural products of iran furthermore in implementations of previous studies of the sebal required meteorological information measured at the nearest weather station was used to calibrate and evaluate the results considering the rapid changes in environmental conditions these data may not be accurate for throughout the study area and can cause some uncertainties therefore the main aim of this study is to estimate the et of pistachio horticultural product by the sebal model and to evaluate it precisely with the in situ et data measurements in this regard in the second section of the study area the data used the study area and methodology of this research have been described the third section is the results and analysis and the fourth section provides conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area iran is one of the major pistachio producers in the world the selected area for this research is a 100 ha pistachio farm located in the province of semnan in iran fig 1 the selected farm is 840 m above mean sea level and its latitude and longitude is 35 14 30 76 n and 53 3 38 41 e respectively the average annual temperature in semnan is 17 01 c moreover precipitation in this area is very low and often in the form of rain fall and reaches an average of 145 mm year the age of the pistachio trees of selected study field is from the one year to about fifteen years old the planting distance of trees in this field is 3 7 m the height of the trees starts at 30 cm and reaches 3 m the irrigation system used in this garden is subsurface drip irrigation 2 2 data used 2 2 1 satellite images for this research 29 images acquired by the landsat 8 operational land imager oli were used during the pistachio growth period from 2013 to 2017 table 1 the images were prepared from the united states geological survey usgs global visualization viewer glovis database http glovis usgs gov the selected images were acquired at clear sky conditions no clouds in all images the imaging time was 7 00 utc and the path and row of images were 163 and 36 respectively 2 2 2 in situ measurements in this study the meteorological parameters required by the sebal model were measured by the intelligent meteorological pessl system imetos pessl installed in the selected farm in the corresponding dates of satellite images furthermore the et estimates obtained by this instrument have been used to evaluate the sebal model the device has been installed about 5 m from the northwest corner of the farm the imetos pessl instrument can measure and record meteorological data in an hourly and daily manner and then estimates the et of the reference crop as well as daily et of standard condition accordingly furthermore to calculate the momentum roughness length parameter required by the sebal model the location of 35 points of the plants with their height has been measured those measurements were accomplished during the field investigation of the study area and the surrounding area using the gps measurements 2 3 methodology in this research sebal algorithm was used to estimate the et of pistachio crop the sebal model uses digital images acquired by landsat or other sensors that are capable of recording radiation in the visible near infrared and thermal infrared regions the et value is calculated at the overpass time of satellite for each pixel for example every 30 30 m2 of landsat oli image the calculation process is based on the energy balance which the amount of et is obtained by the amount of energy remained from the classical equation of energy balance therefore the amount of et is equal to the net radiation minus the heat fluxes into the air and soil bastiaanssen et al 1998a the general equation used in sebal is as 1 λ et r n g h where λet is the latent heat flux w m2 rn is the net radiation flux at the surface w m2 g is the soil heat flux w m2 and h is the sensible heat flux w m2 in the following the calculation method for each of these parameters has been introduced 2 3 1 the net radiation flux rn rn is calculated for each pixel using albedo and atmospheric transmissivity acquired from short wave bands and long wave radiation obtained from thermal bands in other words the amount of net radiation is calculated from the balance of radiation flux at ground surface w m2 using incoming short wave radiation r s that a portion of this radiation energy is reflected by various surfaces r s long wave radiation from the atmosphere r l and long wave radiation from the surface r l therefore the net instantaneous radiation per unit area is calculated as bastiaanssen et al 1998a 2 r n 1 α r s r l r l 1 ε 0 r l where α is surface albedo and ε 0 is thermal surface emissivity dimensionless surface albedo is the ratio of solar electromagnetic radiation reflected from the surface of the soil and plant to the incoming radiation its value is acquired by combining the spectral reflectance values from seven short wave bands of landsat 8 oli allen 2000b the surface albedo can be calculated from the following equation 3 α α t o a α p a t h r a d i a n c e τ s w 2 where α p a t h r a d i a n c e is the average of the part of solar incident radiance for all bands which has been scattered to the sensor before reaching ground level its values range from 0 025 to 0 04 which has been suggested as 0 03 for sebal allen et al 2005 moreover τ s w is the atmospheric transmissivity which is calculated from the following equation 4 τ s w 0 75 2 10 5 z where z is the height of the meteorological station from the mean sea level bastiaanssen et al 1998a 2 3 2 incoming short wave radiation r s the flux of direct and diffuse solar radiation that actually reaches the ground assuming clear sky conditions for the imaging time is calculated as the following equation 5 r s g s c c o s θ d r τ s w where g s c is the solar constant which is equal to 1367 w m2 cosθ is the cosine of the incident angle of solar radiation where θ can be obtained by using the satellite image header file for landsat data in mtl format dr is the inverse of the square relative distance of the earth to the sun allen et al 2005 2 3 3 outgoing long wave radiation r l the reflected long wave radiation flux is calculated using stefan boltzmann s relation as 6 r l ε 0 σ t s 4 where ε 0 is the broadband surface emissivity σ is the stefan boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 w m 2 k 4 and ts is the surface temperature k surface temperatures is calculated using the planck equation bastiaanssen et al 2005 7 t s k 2 ln ε n b k 1 r c 1 where rc is the corrected thermal radiance of the surface and ε n b is narrow band surface emissivity k1 and k2 are constant values that in this study their values for landsat oli images are 480 8883 and 1201 1442 respectively the following equation is used to calculate atmospheric emissivity 8 ε a 0 85 ln τ s w 0 09 where ε a is the atmospheric radiance 2 3 4 incoming long wave radiation r l this radiation is the flux of thermal radiation from the atmosphere downwards which is calculated using the stefan boltzmann equation as 9 r l ε a σ t a 4 where t a is the temperature of the air near the surface which is replaced by a cold pixel temperature tcold the method of choosing this pixel is described below 2 3 5 selecting hot and cold pixels the sebal method uses two anchor pixels to determine the stable boundary conditions in the energy balance relationship these pixels called hot and cold pixels should be within the study area cold pixel is selected from a fully vegetated and fully irrigated area where the surface temperature is assumed to be equal to the air temperature near the surface the hot pixel is selected from a non vegetated and dry land in which the amount of et is assumed to be zero the computation performance of sebal is dependent on the accuracy of choosing these two pixels therefore cold and hot pixels should be selected precisely the selection of these pixels is based on factors such as surface temperature albedo and vegetation indices in selecting hot and cold pixels care should be taken to avoid the selection of very low or very high temperatures if the cold pixel is selected from areas with very low temperatures the et values in pixels with high et but higher temperatures than the selected cold pixel is estimated to be less than real value in the case of hot pixels if the temperature is very high the amount of et of pixels with a lower temperature but the et value of zero is estimated to be greater than zero allen et al 2002 then two factors of temperature ts and vegetation index ndvi have been used to select hot and cold pixels the cold pixel should have a low temperature and high ndvi and conversely the hot pixel should have high temperature and low ndvi in the present study areas with full vegetation as well as desert lands can be identified completely separated on satellite imagery according to ground information the low temperature condition the close proximity to the imetos pessl and also complete vegetation coverage in the area of 100 hectares of studied pistachio land has been used in order to determine the cold pixel 2 3 6 soil heat flux g the soil heat flux is the heat transfer rate inside the soil and vegetation by molecular convection the following relationship that correlates the amount of soil heat flux vegetation index and net surface radiation can be used to calculate the soil heat flux bastiaanssen 2000 10 g r n t s α 0 0038 α 0 0074 α 2 1 98 n d v i 4 where t s is surface temperature and ndvi is the normalized differential vegetation index sun et al 2011 2 3 7 sensible heat flux h the sensible heat flux is the heat transfer to the air by molecular convection due to the temperature difference between the air and the surface and is calculated as bastiaanssen 2000 11 h ρ c p d t r a h where ρ is the air density kg m3 cp air specific heat 1004 j kg k dt is the temperature difference t1 t2 at the height of z1 and z2 k and rah is the aerodynamic resistance against heat transfer s m each of the parameters of this relationship is a function of the temperature gradient surface roughness and wind speed in the above relation there are two unknowns including rah and dt which make it difficult to solve hence an iteration method is used to calculate those two unknowns according to allen et al 2002 2 3 8 24 hour et initially the λet latent heat flux which shows the instantaneous amount of heat from the surface due to et at the time of the satellite s overpass is calculated using eq 1 then the instantaneous et etinst value is calculated in mm hr using the following equation 12 e t i n s t 3600 λ e t λ where λ is the latent evaporation heat j kg and the 3600 is used to convert the seconds to hours allen tasumi et al 2005 the latent evaporation heat λ is obtained using the following equation where ts is the surface temperature kirkham 2014 13 λ 2 501 0 00236 t s 273 15 10 6 in the next step the reference et fraction etrf is calculated as the ratio of instantaneous et etinst calculated for each pixel to the reference et etr in this research etrf is calculated for satellite overpass time using the penman monteith method waters et al 2002 the calculation of etrf was performed using ref et software which was developed in idaho university allen 2000a 14 e t r f e t i n s t e t r etrf is used to calculate 24 hour et the etrf value is between zero and one which is equal to zero in hot pixels and one in cold pixels allen et al 2002 all the processing and programming of this research have been done in matlab software 3 results and discussion initially a representative pixel of the et of the selected farm was selected to evaluate the implementations results afterwards the produced products in middle levels were evaluated and eventually the final et product was evaluated 3 1 selecting the representative pixel for evaluation of the products for evaluation of the obtained middle and final products for 29 images in the selected dates it was necessary to select a representative pixel the selection of the representative pixel was based on the density of pistachio vegetation cover the proximity to the meteorological station and the mid pixels of the study area due to the avoidance of the selecting mixed pixels representative pixel was selected for implementation of the model for all 29 images as shown in fig 2 to evaluate the middle product for instance middle products of the images of 2016 have been extracted and presented in table 2 3 2 evaluation of the acquired ndvi products after investigating ndvi values it was found that vegetated surfaces had values between zero and one and water and clouds also had values less than zero in table 2 twelve images of 2016 were used in different months for better comparison of the values according to table 2 images of 13 06 2016 29 06 2016 they have higher ndvi values in the representative pixel than the rest of the images this is in line with the phonological process of pistachio which is in its greenness peak in the june when the crop reaches its maximum level of vitality allen 2000b furthermore the surface albedo values of days with the maximum ndvi values were relatively lower this is due to higher absorption of pistachio cover in the corresponding dates 3 3 analysis of surface albedo α and surface temperature ts the results of surface albedo in the study area indicate that in general in dates when the vegetation is higher the surface albedo is less due to the darker color absorption of pistachio on these dates comparing with the other dates table 2 according to table 2 there is a lower ndvi on the 20 04 2016 compared to other dates and therefore higher surface albedo was acquired on the other hand with the increasing the albedo the solar energy absorption decreases and as a result the surface temperature decreases according to table 2 the extracted results of the surface temperature coincide with the results of the albedo 3 4 analysis of net surface radiation r n according to allen et al 2002 the values obtained for net radiation rn should be within the interval of 100 700 w m2 depending on the location and the time of imaging according to the results represented in table 2 the values of net radiation are in this range the net radiation is directly related with incoming long wave and short wave radiation since these two parameters are directly related to the surface temperature in areas with higher surface temperatures the net radiation is higher on the other hand net radiation has an inverse relationship with the surface albedo 3 5 analysis of the sensible heat flux h and the soil heat flux g due to the moisture content of vegetation the sensible heat flux is also higher in dates with higher ndvi table 2 in addition some dates showed negative sensible heat flux that this indicates the receiving the incoming energy and the lack of radiation from the selected representative pixel also the values of the soil heat flux corresponded to the values of net radiation and at the dates with higher net radiation the soil heat flux is higher 3 6 calculation of 24 hour et in standard conditions in the sebal model after calculating all the required parameters of the sebal model this model was implemented for 29 images in different dates table 3 afterwards 24 hour et of the pistachio at the representative points was calculated for 29 images using sebal model in standard condition two examples of the results have been shown in fig 3 as illustrated the total 24 hour et values calculated by sebal in fig 3a are greater than the fig 3b this is due to the fact that the pistachio is photosynthetically less active at the later stages of growth and its et rates are reduced based on the results of table 2 the ndvi for the representative pixel has a high value on the 28 05 2016 and has a low value on the 19 10 2016 this means that on the 28 05 2016 the vegetation green cover on the ground is higher than that of 19 10 2016 and its et has increased the produced maps indicate that well irrigated lands show the higher et rates getting away the study area and the agricultural land around it and approaching the lands with low vegetation cover et rates are greatly reduced however changes in et can be due to the lack of vegetation uniformity within the study area soil texture and soil salinity 3 7 estimation of et in standard condition using imetos pessl the imetos pessl is equipped with a software program that estimates the et of the reference plant by the penman monteith formula using daily meteorological data manual et al version 01 2011 after estimating the et of the reference plant to achieve et in the standard condition it is necessary to determine the plant coefficient this software calculates the plants water requirement online at www fieldclimate com it was performed by using characteristics such as effective precipitation which uses the u s bureau of reclamation usbr method adnan 2009 precipitation data of the station and the type of irrigation system in the studied area which is drip irrigation with the efficiency of 95 then according to table 4 crop coefficients in four stages of pistachio growth based on fao 56 growth period were determined in order to obtain et under standard condition allen 2000b finally the et calculated by the sebal model for representative points on the same date was compared with the 24 hour et data of the imetos pessl table 3 to evaluate the etc results obtained from the sebal model the determination coefficient and root mean square error rmse of these values with the values obtained from the imetos pessl were calculated fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the determination coefficient between et estimated by the sebal model and estimated by the imetos pessl has an acceptable coefficient of determination approximately 0 8 moreover the rmse value of the etc model of sebal was estimated as 2 5 mm day using the imetos pessl therefore these results indicate the efficiency of the sebal model in estimating et for pistachio in a relatively small field furthermore according to table 3 in the growing season the maximum et was obtained from the sebal model which started from may 20 and continues to july 26 this case illustrates the importance of this period of pistachio growth in the area more than 50 of the et of pistachio was associated with the months of may to august which proved the importance of irrigation of pistachio trees in these months on the other hand the differences of the results obtained from the sebal model were different from the imetos pessl in the growing season this is due to that in these months et is affected by irrigation conversely the minimum et difference between the sebal model and the imetos pessl is associated with the months march october and november in these months irrigation is lower and the variability is only subject to vegetative conditions measured data by meteorological instrument and the estimation of 24 hour etc was valid just for the installed location and is not able to map the et within the study area the reason for this can be the temporal variability of et due to the variability of the weather condition and the spatial variability due to high variations in meteorological parameters hydrological characteristics of soil and types and density of vegetations on the other hand the sebal model estimated the actual et of the pistachio crop for all 100 hectare pixels of the study area by consuming cost and time with accuracy close to the imetos pessl station 4 conclusion proper estimation of plant et and also the water requirements of plants are very important in improving water management and increasing water consumption efficiency in this regard satellite evapotranspiration estimation models such as sebal can be useful of course the efficiency of this model is different in different climates and different crops therefore the purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of the sebal algorithm for pistachio crop which is one of the most important agricultural products of iran the implementations were performed using 29 landsat 8 satellite images during the period from march 2013 to april 2016 implementations for a 100 hectare pistachio farm located in sorkheh city semnan province iran were carried out using remote sensing data and meteorological data the results were verified and compared with the results of et in the standard condition of the intelligent meteorological device imetos pessl as the ground truth data the results of the study showed the determination coefficient and rmse in the estimation of real et for pistachio plant at about 0 8 and 2 5 mm respectively furthermore the middle level product had logical ranges comparing with the previous studies the results proved that sebal model has good efficiency for estimating actual et during growth period the highest estimated et values were obtained on the greenness peak of the pistachio and the lowest ones were acquired on the other phenological periods moreover the maps generated from 29 images on various dates using the sebal model implementation represented that the well irrigated lands or fully covered with vegetation have the highest et values in total the sebal model estimates the actual et of the pistachio crop with a high accuracy compared to the imetos pessl results calculated using the penman monteith fao method by using the minimum meteorological data overall the results proved that the sebal algorithm can be an appropriate method for estimating the pistachio et and can be used as an efficient tool for managing water resources in farm garden lands or horticulture forestry projects and etc 
11091,stationary actual evapotranspiration et estimation methods deal with some issues such as maintenance problems the point data recording for a particular location the complex hydrological process calculation and requiring the expert workers to solve this et estimation methods like surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal method can be used based on the satellite images however the efficiency of the sebal model varies in et estimation for different products and environmental conditions on the other hand pistachio is an important crop of iran which little investigation were accomplished to estimate its et using the presented models therefore the purpose of this study is to investigate the efficiency of sebal algorithm in estimating et of pistachio crop in this regard actual et of a 100 hectares pistachio farm located in safaeieh region in the semnan province iran was selected as the study area implementations were performed using 29 landsat 8 operational land imager oli images during the 2013 2017 period the results were verified and compared with the results of evapotranspiration in standard condition estimated by the intelligent meteorological instrument imetos pessl as the ground truth the results of this study indicate the determination coefficient and root mean square error rmse of the estimated actual et for pistachio plant as 0 8 and 2 5 mm respectively moreover the results indicate the high spatial variability of et in the pistachio growth period and the need to use a satellite data analysis method like the sebal method to prepare the et map overall the results show the good efficiency of the sebal model for estimating the actual et of the pistachio product keywords evapotranspiration of pistachio surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal intelligent meteorological instrument imetos pessl landsat 8 operational land imager oli images 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is of great importance in water resources management and agriculture the calculation of et is performed empirically and experimentally with high accuracy using eddy correlation method kizer and elliott 1991 the bowen ratio technique and weighing lysimeter wright 1991 however these methods can only determine the et rate at a single point or a small area for specific times and are not expandable for a wide area hence et estimation models can be used to overcome these limitations in these models satellite images can be used to determine the et on extensive areas in a more comprehensive statement satellite remote sensing et models provide a fairly accurate estimate of et in vast areas with minimum use of ground data and utilizing multiple algorithms bastiaanssen and chandrapala 2003 moreover et remote measurements due to vast spatial and temporal coverage the optimal use of time and cost high accuracy of results and easy and inexpensive access to data is an appropriate option for massive et measurements zamani losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 various models have been presented for estimating et from satellite images allen et al 2007 su 2002 one of the most widely used models for estimating et through satellite imagery is the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal model this model was initially developed by bastiaanssen et al 1998c and improved by allen et al 2002 for the idaho mountainous regions based on measured et values at ground level this model was implemented by bastiaanssen et al 1998a and bastiaanssen et al 1998b in order to determine et in large farms in china india spain and pakistan and the results were compared with field in situ et measurements the results showed that in 85 of the cases the data obtained from this algorithm were consistent with field in situ data without any calibration trezza 2002 estimated the water requirement of crops in idaho region from landsat satellite data using sebal he compared the accuracy of this model with the weighing lysimeter data from the kimberley agricultural research institute of idaho the results of the sebal method showed a difference of less than 5 with the results of weighing lysimeter data in another study conducted by tasumi et al 2003 in idaho two energy balance models including sebal and mapping et with internalized calibration metric were compared the results showed that both energy balance models have good agreement with the results of the lysimeter and proved the efficiency of using energy balance models to calculate actual et values bastiaanssen et al 2005 implemented sebal in more than 30 countries they examined the sebal algorithm in two farm and regional scales the results showed that the daily accuracy of the comparison of the measured values and the results of the sebal algorithm was 85 for the farm scale and was up to 95 for the seasonal evaluation moreover the accuracy of this algorithm in the regional scale reached to 96 opoku duah et al 2008 used the sebal model with remote sensing data from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sensors in order to estimate the et of the savannah region in western africa the results were compared with the extracted et from landsat etm images during this comparison modis with coefficient of determination of 0 71 and an error of 2 mm day showed better performance compared to the aster ramos et al 2009 investigated the 4 year et of the flumen region of the ebro plain in northeastern spain using the sebal algorithm and compared them with lysimetric values the actual et values obtained from the sebal method for the grass had the deviation of 0 3 mm day versus the lysimetric measurements and deviation of 0 36 mm day compared to the penman monteith method furthermore actual et of maize and wheat and actual et obtained by the lysimetric method had a good consistency for research fields with a deviation of 0 6 mm day moreover 20 error in the regional scale was obtained between the et values estimated by sebal and penman monteith method teixeira et al 2009 calibrated all measured parameters used in the sebal algorithm including surface albedo surface temperature atmospheric and surface reflectance thermal radiation flux surface roughness net radiation air temperature gradient sensible thermal flux and evaporation term in the semi desert region of brazil in 4 regions and 7 climatic stations then daily et was calculated for mixed agricultural lands and natural ecosystems in this study the coefficients of the sebal algorithm were developed according to local conditions this led to the determination of quantitative effects of irrigated agriculture on the regional water balance as well as the water use efficiency of the horticulture which is the largest water consumer in the semi arid region of brazil ruhoff et al 2012 estimated the et values in brazil based on the sebal model using modis satellite imagery the results of the comparison of daily values of sebal model with the results of eddy correlation method for sugarcane and savannah cultivars indicated r2 of 0 76 and 0 66 respectively the researchers found vegetation index temperature gradient and net radiation as the most sensitive inputs of the model du et al 2013 combined et calculated by the sebal model and modis et products with meteorological data for estimating et in the sanjiang plain in china the results showed that daily et estimated by the sebal model ranged from 11 29 to 27 57 relative to the eddy correlation system the results also showed that the use of the sebal algorithm can play an important role in water resource decision making paul et al 2014 investigated the effect of roughness on sebal model performance in the semi desert region of texas in america estimated values of et and other components of the sebal algorithm were compared with field data measured by four precise weighing lysimeters in two irrigated and dryland agriculture conditions the results indicate the need for a realistic investigation of the heat transfer resistance in one source resistance modeling frames zamani losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 evaluated sebal surface energy balance system sebs and metric models for estimating evaporation from a freshwater lake in iran the results show the sebal inefficiency and the proper performance of sebs and metric models in estimating evaporation from the selected water body in comparison with the evaporation pan data regarding the previous studies sebal et estimates need to be evaluated and verified for each agricultural product and environmental condition moreover little research has been carried out in the field of satellite estimates of et on pistachio et product which is one of the most important agricultural products of iran furthermore in implementations of previous studies of the sebal required meteorological information measured at the nearest weather station was used to calibrate and evaluate the results considering the rapid changes in environmental conditions these data may not be accurate for throughout the study area and can cause some uncertainties therefore the main aim of this study is to estimate the et of pistachio horticultural product by the sebal model and to evaluate it precisely with the in situ et data measurements in this regard in the second section of the study area the data used the study area and methodology of this research have been described the third section is the results and analysis and the fourth section provides conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area iran is one of the major pistachio producers in the world the selected area for this research is a 100 ha pistachio farm located in the province of semnan in iran fig 1 the selected farm is 840 m above mean sea level and its latitude and longitude is 35 14 30 76 n and 53 3 38 41 e respectively the average annual temperature in semnan is 17 01 c moreover precipitation in this area is very low and often in the form of rain fall and reaches an average of 145 mm year the age of the pistachio trees of selected study field is from the one year to about fifteen years old the planting distance of trees in this field is 3 7 m the height of the trees starts at 30 cm and reaches 3 m the irrigation system used in this garden is subsurface drip irrigation 2 2 data used 2 2 1 satellite images for this research 29 images acquired by the landsat 8 operational land imager oli were used during the pistachio growth period from 2013 to 2017 table 1 the images were prepared from the united states geological survey usgs global visualization viewer glovis database http glovis usgs gov the selected images were acquired at clear sky conditions no clouds in all images the imaging time was 7 00 utc and the path and row of images were 163 and 36 respectively 2 2 2 in situ measurements in this study the meteorological parameters required by the sebal model were measured by the intelligent meteorological pessl system imetos pessl installed in the selected farm in the corresponding dates of satellite images furthermore the et estimates obtained by this instrument have been used to evaluate the sebal model the device has been installed about 5 m from the northwest corner of the farm the imetos pessl instrument can measure and record meteorological data in an hourly and daily manner and then estimates the et of the reference crop as well as daily et of standard condition accordingly furthermore to calculate the momentum roughness length parameter required by the sebal model the location of 35 points of the plants with their height has been measured those measurements were accomplished during the field investigation of the study area and the surrounding area using the gps measurements 2 3 methodology in this research sebal algorithm was used to estimate the et of pistachio crop the sebal model uses digital images acquired by landsat or other sensors that are capable of recording radiation in the visible near infrared and thermal infrared regions the et value is calculated at the overpass time of satellite for each pixel for example every 30 30 m2 of landsat oli image the calculation process is based on the energy balance which the amount of et is obtained by the amount of energy remained from the classical equation of energy balance therefore the amount of et is equal to the net radiation minus the heat fluxes into the air and soil bastiaanssen et al 1998a the general equation used in sebal is as 1 λ et r n g h where λet is the latent heat flux w m2 rn is the net radiation flux at the surface w m2 g is the soil heat flux w m2 and h is the sensible heat flux w m2 in the following the calculation method for each of these parameters has been introduced 2 3 1 the net radiation flux rn rn is calculated for each pixel using albedo and atmospheric transmissivity acquired from short wave bands and long wave radiation obtained from thermal bands in other words the amount of net radiation is calculated from the balance of radiation flux at ground surface w m2 using incoming short wave radiation r s that a portion of this radiation energy is reflected by various surfaces r s long wave radiation from the atmosphere r l and long wave radiation from the surface r l therefore the net instantaneous radiation per unit area is calculated as bastiaanssen et al 1998a 2 r n 1 α r s r l r l 1 ε 0 r l where α is surface albedo and ε 0 is thermal surface emissivity dimensionless surface albedo is the ratio of solar electromagnetic radiation reflected from the surface of the soil and plant to the incoming radiation its value is acquired by combining the spectral reflectance values from seven short wave bands of landsat 8 oli allen 2000b the surface albedo can be calculated from the following equation 3 α α t o a α p a t h r a d i a n c e τ s w 2 where α p a t h r a d i a n c e is the average of the part of solar incident radiance for all bands which has been scattered to the sensor before reaching ground level its values range from 0 025 to 0 04 which has been suggested as 0 03 for sebal allen et al 2005 moreover τ s w is the atmospheric transmissivity which is calculated from the following equation 4 τ s w 0 75 2 10 5 z where z is the height of the meteorological station from the mean sea level bastiaanssen et al 1998a 2 3 2 incoming short wave radiation r s the flux of direct and diffuse solar radiation that actually reaches the ground assuming clear sky conditions for the imaging time is calculated as the following equation 5 r s g s c c o s θ d r τ s w where g s c is the solar constant which is equal to 1367 w m2 cosθ is the cosine of the incident angle of solar radiation where θ can be obtained by using the satellite image header file for landsat data in mtl format dr is the inverse of the square relative distance of the earth to the sun allen et al 2005 2 3 3 outgoing long wave radiation r l the reflected long wave radiation flux is calculated using stefan boltzmann s relation as 6 r l ε 0 σ t s 4 where ε 0 is the broadband surface emissivity σ is the stefan boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 w m 2 k 4 and ts is the surface temperature k surface temperatures is calculated using the planck equation bastiaanssen et al 2005 7 t s k 2 ln ε n b k 1 r c 1 where rc is the corrected thermal radiance of the surface and ε n b is narrow band surface emissivity k1 and k2 are constant values that in this study their values for landsat oli images are 480 8883 and 1201 1442 respectively the following equation is used to calculate atmospheric emissivity 8 ε a 0 85 ln τ s w 0 09 where ε a is the atmospheric radiance 2 3 4 incoming long wave radiation r l this radiation is the flux of thermal radiation from the atmosphere downwards which is calculated using the stefan boltzmann equation as 9 r l ε a σ t a 4 where t a is the temperature of the air near the surface which is replaced by a cold pixel temperature tcold the method of choosing this pixel is described below 2 3 5 selecting hot and cold pixels the sebal method uses two anchor pixels to determine the stable boundary conditions in the energy balance relationship these pixels called hot and cold pixels should be within the study area cold pixel is selected from a fully vegetated and fully irrigated area where the surface temperature is assumed to be equal to the air temperature near the surface the hot pixel is selected from a non vegetated and dry land in which the amount of et is assumed to be zero the computation performance of sebal is dependent on the accuracy of choosing these two pixels therefore cold and hot pixels should be selected precisely the selection of these pixels is based on factors such as surface temperature albedo and vegetation indices in selecting hot and cold pixels care should be taken to avoid the selection of very low or very high temperatures if the cold pixel is selected from areas with very low temperatures the et values in pixels with high et but higher temperatures than the selected cold pixel is estimated to be less than real value in the case of hot pixels if the temperature is very high the amount of et of pixels with a lower temperature but the et value of zero is estimated to be greater than zero allen et al 2002 then two factors of temperature ts and vegetation index ndvi have been used to select hot and cold pixels the cold pixel should have a low temperature and high ndvi and conversely the hot pixel should have high temperature and low ndvi in the present study areas with full vegetation as well as desert lands can be identified completely separated on satellite imagery according to ground information the low temperature condition the close proximity to the imetos pessl and also complete vegetation coverage in the area of 100 hectares of studied pistachio land has been used in order to determine the cold pixel 2 3 6 soil heat flux g the soil heat flux is the heat transfer rate inside the soil and vegetation by molecular convection the following relationship that correlates the amount of soil heat flux vegetation index and net surface radiation can be used to calculate the soil heat flux bastiaanssen 2000 10 g r n t s α 0 0038 α 0 0074 α 2 1 98 n d v i 4 where t s is surface temperature and ndvi is the normalized differential vegetation index sun et al 2011 2 3 7 sensible heat flux h the sensible heat flux is the heat transfer to the air by molecular convection due to the temperature difference between the air and the surface and is calculated as bastiaanssen 2000 11 h ρ c p d t r a h where ρ is the air density kg m3 cp air specific heat 1004 j kg k dt is the temperature difference t1 t2 at the height of z1 and z2 k and rah is the aerodynamic resistance against heat transfer s m each of the parameters of this relationship is a function of the temperature gradient surface roughness and wind speed in the above relation there are two unknowns including rah and dt which make it difficult to solve hence an iteration method is used to calculate those two unknowns according to allen et al 2002 2 3 8 24 hour et initially the λet latent heat flux which shows the instantaneous amount of heat from the surface due to et at the time of the satellite s overpass is calculated using eq 1 then the instantaneous et etinst value is calculated in mm hr using the following equation 12 e t i n s t 3600 λ e t λ where λ is the latent evaporation heat j kg and the 3600 is used to convert the seconds to hours allen tasumi et al 2005 the latent evaporation heat λ is obtained using the following equation where ts is the surface temperature kirkham 2014 13 λ 2 501 0 00236 t s 273 15 10 6 in the next step the reference et fraction etrf is calculated as the ratio of instantaneous et etinst calculated for each pixel to the reference et etr in this research etrf is calculated for satellite overpass time using the penman monteith method waters et al 2002 the calculation of etrf was performed using ref et software which was developed in idaho university allen 2000a 14 e t r f e t i n s t e t r etrf is used to calculate 24 hour et the etrf value is between zero and one which is equal to zero in hot pixels and one in cold pixels allen et al 2002 all the processing and programming of this research have been done in matlab software 3 results and discussion initially a representative pixel of the et of the selected farm was selected to evaluate the implementations results afterwards the produced products in middle levels were evaluated and eventually the final et product was evaluated 3 1 selecting the representative pixel for evaluation of the products for evaluation of the obtained middle and final products for 29 images in the selected dates it was necessary to select a representative pixel the selection of the representative pixel was based on the density of pistachio vegetation cover the proximity to the meteorological station and the mid pixels of the study area due to the avoidance of the selecting mixed pixels representative pixel was selected for implementation of the model for all 29 images as shown in fig 2 to evaluate the middle product for instance middle products of the images of 2016 have been extracted and presented in table 2 3 2 evaluation of the acquired ndvi products after investigating ndvi values it was found that vegetated surfaces had values between zero and one and water and clouds also had values less than zero in table 2 twelve images of 2016 were used in different months for better comparison of the values according to table 2 images of 13 06 2016 29 06 2016 they have higher ndvi values in the representative pixel than the rest of the images this is in line with the phonological process of pistachio which is in its greenness peak in the june when the crop reaches its maximum level of vitality allen 2000b furthermore the surface albedo values of days with the maximum ndvi values were relatively lower this is due to higher absorption of pistachio cover in the corresponding dates 3 3 analysis of surface albedo α and surface temperature ts the results of surface albedo in the study area indicate that in general in dates when the vegetation is higher the surface albedo is less due to the darker color absorption of pistachio on these dates comparing with the other dates table 2 according to table 2 there is a lower ndvi on the 20 04 2016 compared to other dates and therefore higher surface albedo was acquired on the other hand with the increasing the albedo the solar energy absorption decreases and as a result the surface temperature decreases according to table 2 the extracted results of the surface temperature coincide with the results of the albedo 3 4 analysis of net surface radiation r n according to allen et al 2002 the values obtained for net radiation rn should be within the interval of 100 700 w m2 depending on the location and the time of imaging according to the results represented in table 2 the values of net radiation are in this range the net radiation is directly related with incoming long wave and short wave radiation since these two parameters are directly related to the surface temperature in areas with higher surface temperatures the net radiation is higher on the other hand net radiation has an inverse relationship with the surface albedo 3 5 analysis of the sensible heat flux h and the soil heat flux g due to the moisture content of vegetation the sensible heat flux is also higher in dates with higher ndvi table 2 in addition some dates showed negative sensible heat flux that this indicates the receiving the incoming energy and the lack of radiation from the selected representative pixel also the values of the soil heat flux corresponded to the values of net radiation and at the dates with higher net radiation the soil heat flux is higher 3 6 calculation of 24 hour et in standard conditions in the sebal model after calculating all the required parameters of the sebal model this model was implemented for 29 images in different dates table 3 afterwards 24 hour et of the pistachio at the representative points was calculated for 29 images using sebal model in standard condition two examples of the results have been shown in fig 3 as illustrated the total 24 hour et values calculated by sebal in fig 3a are greater than the fig 3b this is due to the fact that the pistachio is photosynthetically less active at the later stages of growth and its et rates are reduced based on the results of table 2 the ndvi for the representative pixel has a high value on the 28 05 2016 and has a low value on the 19 10 2016 this means that on the 28 05 2016 the vegetation green cover on the ground is higher than that of 19 10 2016 and its et has increased the produced maps indicate that well irrigated lands show the higher et rates getting away the study area and the agricultural land around it and approaching the lands with low vegetation cover et rates are greatly reduced however changes in et can be due to the lack of vegetation uniformity within the study area soil texture and soil salinity 3 7 estimation of et in standard condition using imetos pessl the imetos pessl is equipped with a software program that estimates the et of the reference plant by the penman monteith formula using daily meteorological data manual et al version 01 2011 after estimating the et of the reference plant to achieve et in the standard condition it is necessary to determine the plant coefficient this software calculates the plants water requirement online at www fieldclimate com it was performed by using characteristics such as effective precipitation which uses the u s bureau of reclamation usbr method adnan 2009 precipitation data of the station and the type of irrigation system in the studied area which is drip irrigation with the efficiency of 95 then according to table 4 crop coefficients in four stages of pistachio growth based on fao 56 growth period were determined in order to obtain et under standard condition allen 2000b finally the et calculated by the sebal model for representative points on the same date was compared with the 24 hour et data of the imetos pessl table 3 to evaluate the etc results obtained from the sebal model the determination coefficient and root mean square error rmse of these values with the values obtained from the imetos pessl were calculated fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the determination coefficient between et estimated by the sebal model and estimated by the imetos pessl has an acceptable coefficient of determination approximately 0 8 moreover the rmse value of the etc model of sebal was estimated as 2 5 mm day using the imetos pessl therefore these results indicate the efficiency of the sebal model in estimating et for pistachio in a relatively small field furthermore according to table 3 in the growing season the maximum et was obtained from the sebal model which started from may 20 and continues to july 26 this case illustrates the importance of this period of pistachio growth in the area more than 50 of the et of pistachio was associated with the months of may to august which proved the importance of irrigation of pistachio trees in these months on the other hand the differences of the results obtained from the sebal model were different from the imetos pessl in the growing season this is due to that in these months et is affected by irrigation conversely the minimum et difference between the sebal model and the imetos pessl is associated with the months march october and november in these months irrigation is lower and the variability is only subject to vegetative conditions measured data by meteorological instrument and the estimation of 24 hour etc was valid just for the installed location and is not able to map the et within the study area the reason for this can be the temporal variability of et due to the variability of the weather condition and the spatial variability due to high variations in meteorological parameters hydrological characteristics of soil and types and density of vegetations on the other hand the sebal model estimated the actual et of the pistachio crop for all 100 hectare pixels of the study area by consuming cost and time with accuracy close to the imetos pessl station 4 conclusion proper estimation of plant et and also the water requirements of plants are very important in improving water management and increasing water consumption efficiency in this regard satellite evapotranspiration estimation models such as sebal can be useful of course the efficiency of this model is different in different climates and different crops therefore the purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of the sebal algorithm for pistachio crop which is one of the most important agricultural products of iran the implementations were performed using 29 landsat 8 satellite images during the period from march 2013 to april 2016 implementations for a 100 hectare pistachio farm located in sorkheh city semnan province iran were carried out using remote sensing data and meteorological data the results were verified and compared with the results of et in the standard condition of the intelligent meteorological device imetos pessl as the ground truth data the results of the study showed the determination coefficient and rmse in the estimation of real et for pistachio plant at about 0 8 and 2 5 mm respectively furthermore the middle level product had logical ranges comparing with the previous studies the results proved that sebal model has good efficiency for estimating actual et during growth period the highest estimated et values were obtained on the greenness peak of the pistachio and the lowest ones were acquired on the other phenological periods moreover the maps generated from 29 images on various dates using the sebal model implementation represented that the well irrigated lands or fully covered with vegetation have the highest et values in total the sebal model estimates the actual et of the pistachio crop with a high accuracy compared to the imetos pessl results calculated using the penman monteith fao method by using the minimum meteorological data overall the results proved that the sebal algorithm can be an appropriate method for estimating the pistachio et and can be used as an efficient tool for managing water resources in farm garden lands or horticulture forestry projects and etc

irrigation scheduling in fruit trees as has been reported by naor 2000 lampinen et al 2001 garcía orellana et al 2007 ortuño et al 2009a b ortuño et al 2010 and conejero et al 2011 a suitable plant based water stress indicator for use in irrigation scheduling practices has to be sufficiently sensitive consistent and reliable for detecting minimum changes in the plant water status moreover it is important to consider that the magnitude of any plant based water status indicator even in a well watered tree is not constant over a period of days with different environmental conditions therefore the absolute values of these indicators registered without considering the evaporative demand might be meaningless for this reason for irrigation scheduling it is better to use the concept of signal intensity si normalizing the absolute values with respect to values in non limiting soil water conditions fernandez and cuevas 2010 ortuño et al 2010 the irrigation protocol for trees using plant based water status indicators consists of maintaining the plant based water status indicator si at around a threshold value decreasing the irrigation rate when the si does not exceed the threshold value and increasing the irrigation rate when the si exceeds the threshold value when fruit trees are grown with high frequency irrigation the irrigation water amounts to be applied are usually estimated daily conejero et al 2011 every three days conejero et al 2007 or weekly velez et al 2007 the discrete measurement of predawn or midday leaf water potential ψpd or ψmd and midday 12 h solar time stem water potential ψstem are the most widely used approaches for evaluating plant water status mccutchan and shackel 1992 naor 2000 however in recent years the possibility of obtaining real time continuous and automated registers of the plant water status avoiding frequent trips to the field and a significant input of manpower has led to the increased use of alternative indices using plant sensors such as sap flow sf and maximum daily trunk shrinkage mds a single parameter obtained from trunk diameter monitoring which can be used for full and deficit irrigation scheduling in fruit trees garcía orellana et al 2007 ortuño et al 2009a b conejero et al 2011 moriana et al 2013 to the best of our knowledge research on the response at plant water relations level of persimmon plants to drought is very scarce nevertheless yakushiji et al 2013 showed that predawn leaf turgor potential ψppd began to decrease when ψpd fell below ca 0 7 to 0 8 mpa and that the response of fruit water status to drought clearly depends on the fruit growth stage yamamura et al 1989 indicated that even a moderate water deficit leaf water potential ψleaf values around 1 8 mpa increased fruit drop also badal et al 2010 assessed the usefulness of the mds as a persimmon water deficit indicator bearing the above in mind the purpose of the present study was i to evaluate the sensitivity of continuous and discretely measured indicators of the plant water status to use in irrigation scheduling in persimmon trees and ii to analyze leaf water relations in order to clarify the response mechanisms stress avoidance and stress tolerance developed by persimmon plants in response to mild water stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions plant material and treatments the experiment

171 mm no rainfall was recorded during the experimental period the plant material consisted of 3 year old persimmon trees diospyros kaki l f cv rojo brillante grafted on diospyros lotus l tree spacing followed a 3 m x 5 m pattern pest control and fertilization practices were those normally used by the growers and no weeds were allowed to develop within the orchard two irrigation treatments were considered in which irrigation was carried out daily and during night time using a drip irrigation system with one lateral pipe per tree row from day of the year doy 218 251 in order to guarantee non limiting soil water conditions control plants treatment t0 were irrigated using six emitters each delivering 4 l h 1 per plant in order to maintain soil water content in the 0 60 cm soil depth at levels near constant and slightly above soil field capacity in the t1 treatment water was applied at 70 of control trees 2 1 1 measurements θv was measured with a portable fdr sensor hh2 δt u k previously calibrated the measurements were made in four plots per treatment the access tubes for the fdr sensor were placed in the irrigation line at about 30 cm from an emitter the data were obtained at 0 10 0 20 0 30 0 40 and 0 60 m depth ψleaf was measured on the south facing side and the middle third of the trees in two fully developed leaves per tree of each replicate using a pressure chamber pms 600 exp pms instruments company albany usa as recommended by turner 1988 after measuring ψleaf the leaves were frozen in liquid nitrogen and the osmotic potential was measured after thawing the samples and expressing sap using a vapour pressure osmometer wescor 5600 logan usa leaf turgor potential ψp values were derived as the difference between osmotic and water potentials the ψstem was measured in a similar number and type of leaves as used for ψleaf enclosing leaves in a small black plastic bag covered with aluminium foil for at least 2 h before measurements in the pressure chamber leaf conductance gleaf in attached leaves was measured with a porometer delta t ap4 delta t devices cambridge uk on the abaxial surface of the leaves and in a similar number and type of leaves as used for the ψleaf measurements at the end of the experimental period two pressure volume pv curves were performed per replicate in order to determine values of leaf osmotic potential at

tyree and hammel 1972 tyree and richter 1981 1982 savé et al 1993 for this leaves were excised at predawn and resaturated by dipping the petioles in distilled water for 24 h in darkness at 4 c the resaturated leaves were weighed using an analytical balance 0 1 mg precision placed in the pressure chamber lined with damp filter paper and slowly pressurized 0 025 mpa s 1 until the balance pressure was reached when the leaf sap appeared through the cut petiole protruding from the chamber once depressurized the leaf was allowed to transpire outside the pressure chamber on the laboratory bench at room temperature 22 2 c leaves were repeatedly weighed and their balance pressures were determined over the full range of the pressure gauge kikuta and richter 1986 data for initial saturated weight intermediate fresh weight corresponding to values for ψleaf and final dry weight at 80 c for 48 h were used to calculate the relative water content rwc barrs and weatherley 1962 the curves were drawn using a type ii transformation tyree and richter 1982 the reciprocal of ψleaf was plotted against rwc and the resultant relationships displayed both linear and non linear regions extrapolation on the straight portion of the curve obtained for a value of rwc 1 gave the reciprocal of the ψos and extrapolation to the abscissa gave rwca the ψtlp and rwctlp were estimated as the intersection between the linear and curvilinear portions of the pv curve the є of leaf tissue at 100 rwc rwco was estimated according to patakas and noitsakis 1999 as є mpa ψos ψstlp 100 rwca 100 rwctlp where ψstlp is the osmotic potential at the turgor loss point and ψos values correspond to those obtained from the analysis of the pv curves the micrometric trunk diameter fluctuations tdf were measured throughout the experimental period on four trees per treatment using a set of linear variable displacement transducers lvdt model df 2 5 mm accuracy 10 μm solartron metrology bognor regis uk attached to the trunk with a special bracket made of invar an alloy of ni and fe with a thermal expansion coefficient close to zero katerji et al 1994 and aluminium sensors were placed on the north side 10 cm above the graft point of each tree and were covered with silver thermoprotected foil to prevent heating and wetting of the device measurements were taken every 10 s and the datalogger model cr10x campbell scientific logan ut usa was programmed to report 15 min means mds was calculated as the difference between maximum and minimum daily trunk diameter sf was measured using the compensation heat pulse technique swanson and whitfield 1981 in the same trees used for tdf measurements throughout the experimental period one set of heat pulse probes was located above the lvdt sensors on each tree each set consisted of a heater needle of 1 8 mm diameter and two temperature probes also of 1 8 mm diameter installed in parallel holes drilled radially in the trunks at 10 mm downstream and 5 mm upstream each heat pulse probe had three thermocouple sensors to monitor the sap velocity at a radial depth of 5 12 and 21 mm below the cambium sap velocity was measured following the procedure of green et al 2003 using the theoretical calibrations of swanson and whitfield 1981 to account for the probe induced effects of wounding the volume fractions of wood and water determined by lópez bernal et al 2014 were used the temperature signals and the corresponding heat pulse velocities were recorded at 30 min intervals using heat pulse instrumentation controlled by a datalogger cr10x campbell scientific ltd logan utah 2 1 2 statistical design and analysis the design of the experiment was completely randomized with four replications each replication consisting of three adjacent tree rows each with seven trees measurements were taken on the inner tree of the central row of each replicate which were very similar in appearance leaf area trunk cross sectional area height ground shaded area etc whereas the other trees served as border trees statistical analysis was performed by an analysis of variance using the general linear model glm of spss spps 2002 values for each replicate were averaged before the mean and the standard error of each treatment were calculated 3 results in the t0 treatment θv between 0 and 0 60 m in depth was nearly constant and slightly above field capacity 102 3 of θv values at field capacity fig 1 in the t1 treatment θv values decreased achieving constant values of around 81 of soil field capacity from doy 222 251 ψpd values in t0 plants were very high and fairly constant throughout the experimental period while in t1 plants ψpd values were significantly lower than in t0 plants being characterized by a slight decrease from the beginning of the experiment to doy 222 when minimum values were reached fig 2 a ψmd values in t0 plants during the experimental period were fairly constant and higher than those in t1 plants whereas in t1 plants the ψmd values gradually decreased achieving minimum values on doy 231 and increasing slightly thereafter fig 2b ψppd and leaf turgor potential at midday ψpmd values in both irrigation treatments were always above zero indicating that turgor was maintained during the experimental period however both parameters showed differences in the response to irrigation treatments figs 2c and 2d the ψppd values in both treatments were high and showed some tendency to fluctuate fig 2c furthermore ψppd values in t1 plants were always lower than in t0 plants ψpmd values in t1 plants were also lower than those in t0 plants even though ψpmd values in t1 plants showed a gradual but clear tendency to decrease during the experimental period reaching minimum values of 0 36 mpa at the end of the experiment on doy 251 fig 2d ψstem values in both irrigation treatments were higher than the corresponding ψmd values throughout the experimental period and behaved somewhat similarly to ψpd values figs 3 a 2 b and 2 a respectively so ψstem values of t0 plants were almost constant during the experimental period while in t1 plants they showed a tendency to decrease almost all the time with lower values than those observed in t0 the glmd values in t0 plants were nearly constant during the experimental period whereas glmd values in t1 plants were clearly lower than in t0 plants gradually decreasing during the experimental period fig 3b during the experimental period regardless of the treatment ψleaf values exhibited a similar circadian rhythm on the five measuring dates reaching maximum values at predawn decreasing rapidly in the morning and reaching minimum values at around 14 00 17 00 h after which they gradually recovered fig 4 differences between the circadian ψleaf values of the t0 and t1 varied from day to day at the end of the experimental period doy 251 the daily ψleaf pattern in t1 plants was characterized by a gradual decrease reaching minimum values at 14 00 h and showing only a very slight recovery during the afternoon at sunrise the increase in radiation induced stomatal opening while gleaf increased to reach maximum values between 10 00 and 14 00 h after which it progressively decreased fig 4 t0 plants showed higher gleaf values than those in plants under water deficit t1 during most of the day and but specially when daily maximum gleaf values were achieved differences in gleaf values between t0 and t1 plants gradually increased due to the response of t1 plants to the deficit irrigation which gradually decreased the duration of maximum stomatal opening low and near constant gleaf values were registered during most of the day from doy 231 251 fig 4 ψp values showed a similar circadian rhythm on the five studied dates characterized by maximum values at predawn and minimum values at 12 00 17 00 h fig 4 ψp values in t1 plants tended to be lower than in t0 plants especially in the central hours of the day 12 00 17 00 h daily sf values in t0 plants were characterized by a more pronounced fluctuation than was seen in t1 plants where they decreased gradually showing differences between treatments from doy 221 onwards and remaining almost constant from doy 223 onwards fig 5 a mds values in t1 plants were higher than in t0 plants in addition differences in mds values between treatments were significant the day immediately after the beginning of the experiment 2 days earlier than the differences in sf became evident fig 5a and b in contrast with the behaviour observed in daily sf values no differences between treatments were observed in mds values from doy 226 230 on doy 235 and on doy 238 the regression analysis between sf and ψpd ψmd ψstem and glmd obtained by pooling data for the whole observation period demonstrated that decreases in sf values were associated with decreases in ψpd ψmd ψstem and glmd values fig 6 in order to study the sensitivity of the measured plant based water status indicators we considered both continuously and discretely recorded plant based indicators sf mds ψpd ψmd ψstem and glmd during increasing intervals of time from the beginning to the end of the experimental period table 1 the si values increased in all plant based water stress indicators considered in response to water deficit however during the experimental period different behaviours were observed so at the beginning of the deficit irrigation period the mds si t1 t0 and ψpd si t1 t0 increased more sharply than si of the other indicators after doy 222 sf si t0 t1 values tended to be higher than the si values of other indicators nevertheless from doy 218 226 and 218 231 ψpd si t1 t0 values were similar to those observed in the sf si when the mean si values were considered in relation to their noise for all the plant based water stress indicators table 1 the described behaviours changed the data indicated that ψmd mean noise was very low leading it to show the highest ψmd signal noise ratio at the beginning of the experimental period doy 218 222 and 218 226 however from doy 226 to the end of the experiment the substantial increase in the sf si led to a higher signal noise ratio for all the following intervals of time considered even though ψmd signal noise ratios were close to those of the sf signal noise ratio at the end of the experimental period doy 251 no significant differences in ψos ψtlp є rwctlp or rwca values were found between t0 and t1 plants table 2 nevertheless it is important to point out that rwca values were very high in both treatments 4 discussion throughout the experimental period and based on the fact that i θv values in t0 treatment were slightly above field capacity fig 1 ii ψpd ψmd and ψstem values figs 2a 2 b and 3 a were nearly constant and very high in relation to the values already reported for other authors for full irrigated persimmon plants badal et al 2010 buesa et al 2013 and iii ψpd values depend mainly on soil moisture levels elfving et al 1972 torrecillas et al 1988 sellin 1996 we conclude that t0 plants were under non limiting soil water conditions moreover considering that the tree water relations under flooding conditions are characterized by a substantial decrease in leaf conductance and leaf water potential as a consequence of the effects of chemical signals from roots and an increase in the resistance to water flowing through the plant ruiz sánchez et al 1997 dell amico et al 2001 the water relations of t0 plants indicated the absence of any waterlogging because leaf turgor was maintained ψppd and ψpmd 0 and high and near constant values of ψpd ψmd ψstem sf and glmd were observed figs 2a b 3 a b and 5 a regarding the t1 treatment the fact that minimum θv values were around 81 of field capacity and minimum ψpd ψmd ψstem and glmd values were around 0 50 mpa 1 17 mpa 0 87 mpa and 99 66 mmol m 2 s 1 respectively indicated that t1 plants were under a mild degree of water deficit during the experimental period figs 2a 2 b 3 a and 3 b cruz et al 2012 rodríguez et al 2012 torrecillas et al 2018 in addition the rate of development of water stress in t1 plants was very low because the ψpd ψstem and ψmd values decreased by only around 0 01 0 02 and 0 01 mpa per day basis 2a 3a and 2b respectively hale and orcutt 1987 the progressive decrease in glmd in t1 plants and the tendency to shorten the duration of maximum stomatal opening in its circadian rhythm as stress progressed figs 3b and 4 indicated that stomata regulation is a key mechanism in controlling leaf water status because leaf turgor was maintained in t1 plants fig 2c and d and persimmon plants did not develop any other stress tolerance mechanism such as elastic adjustment є decrease or active osmotic adjustment ψos decrease in our experimental conditions table 2 the decrease in glmd values of woody crop leaves in response to water deficit has been reported as a stress avoidance mechanism in response to water deficit which improves water use efficiency rieger and duemmel 1992 girona et al 1993 the behaviour of є ψos ψtlp and rwctlp values which did not change as a result of water deficit in t1 plants table 2 was similar to the results obtained by other authors sánchez blanco et al 1991 savé et al 1995 torrecillas et al 1996 suggesting that the є and ψos affect the rwctlp and ψtlp values respectively rwca values in persimmon plants around 58 table 2 were similar to those found for grapes 51 63 rodrigues et al 1993 to the lower limit of the range found for pinus ponderosa 57 81 hardegree 1989 and to the higher limit found for pomegranate 42 58 rodríguez et al 2012 and almond 42 59 torrecillas et al 1996 on the other hand persimmon rwca values were high compared with other tree species such as apricot 27 42 torrecillas et al 1999 peach 29 44 mellisho et al 2011 eucalyptus globulus 14 27 correia et al 1989 and quercus alba 26 31 parker and pallardi 1987 high rwca values represent a xeromorphic characteristic cutler et al 1977 and are a consequence of thicker cell walls or differences in cell wall structure hellkvist et al 1974 which could contribute to the retention of water when water potential decreases torrecillas et al 1996 sf ψpd ψmd ψstem and glmd encompass different time scales because the last four are point measurements taken at predawn or at midday and are considered as indicators of the minimum ψpd and maximum ψmd ψstem and glmd daily plant water deficit whereas sf is an integrative indicator which reflects the continuous sap flow records on a diurnal basis despite these facts the relationships between sf and ψpd ψmd ψstem and glmd fig 6 were high and constant indicating that sf can be used to indicate the water status of young persimmon trees assuming that any comparison of the sensitivities of different plant based water status indicators for diagnosing water deficit must consider the strength of each indicator in the context of its variability goldhamer and fereres 2001 naor and cohen 2003 it can be observed that ψmd was the most suitable indicator for persimmon irrigation scheduling when short periods of time are considered because it showed the highest signal noise ratio during the first 4 or 8 days of the experimental period doy 218 222 and 218 226 table 1 however as the interval of time considered grew doy 218 231 218 237 218 244 and 218 251 sf si sharply increased and sf noise was maintained leading it to show the highest signal noise ratio for these intervals of time table 1 moreover taking into consideration that during the two first periods of time considered doy 218 222 and 218 226 the sf signal noise ratio despite being lower than that showed by ψmd was relatively high it could be concluded that sf is a more suitable indicator than ψmd for irrigation scheduling because it can provide continuous and automated registers of the plant water status in real time avoiding frequent trips to the field and a significant input of manpower since frequent ψmd readings are needed in this respect ortuño et al 2004 indicated that in young trees continuously measured plant water status indicators were more immediate and sensitive than discretely measured indicators for detecting water stress also other authors indicated that mds and sf revealed significant differences between irrigation treatments even in the absence of differences in ψstem goldhamer et al 1999 remorini and massai 2003 by contrast in persimmon plants badal et al 2010 assessed the feasibility of using mds ψstem glmd and fruit diameter variations and concluded that although mds can be successfully used as continuous plant water stress indicator ψstem was the most sensitive plant water stress indicator the above results indicated that persimmon plants exposed to mild water stress are able to gradually develop stomata control a stress avoidance mechanism also under water stress the high relative apoplastic water content could contribute to the retention of water so both drought resistance characteristics could have contributed to the leaf turgor maintenance observed during the experimental period in addition the discrete and continuously recorded plant based indicators showed different degrees of sensitivity for diagnosing persimmon tree water status overall sf measurements made by the heat pulse technique are the most suitable method for estimating persimmon water status because it showed the highest signal noise ratio in almost all intervals of time considered while providing continuous and automated registers of

based water stress indicator for use in irrigation scheduling practices has to be sufficiently sensitive consistent and reliable for detecting minimum changes in the plant water status moreover it is important to consider that the magnitude of any plant based water status indicator even in a well watered tree is not constant over a period of days with different environmental conditions therefore the absolute values of these indicators registered without considering the evaporative demand might be meaningless for this reason for irrigation scheduling it is better to use the concept of signal intensity si normalizing the absolute values with respect to values in non limiting soil water conditions fernandez and cuevas 2010 ortuño et al 2010 the irrigation protocol for trees using plant based water status indicators consists of maintaining the plant based water status indicator si at around a threshold value decreasing the irrigation rate when the si does not exceed the threshold value and increasing the irrigation rate when the si exceeds the threshold value when fruit trees are grown with high frequency irrigation the irrigation water amounts to be applied are usually estimated daily conejero et al 2011 every three days conejero et al 2007 or weekly velez et al 2007 the discrete measurement of predawn or midday leaf water potential ψpd or ψmd and midday 12 h solar time stem water potential ψstem are the most widely used approaches for evaluating plant water status mccutchan and shackel 1992 naor 2000 however in recent years the possibility of obtaining real time continuous and automated registers of the plant water status avoiding frequent trips to the field and a significant input of manpower has led to the increased use of alternative indices using plant sensors such as sap flow sf and maximum daily trunk shrinkage mds a single parameter obtained from trunk diameter monitoring which can be used for full and deficit irrigation scheduling in fruit trees garcía orellana et al 2007 ortuño et al 2009a b conejero et al 2011 moriana et al 2013 to the best of our knowledge research on the response at plant water relations level of persimmon plants to drought is very scarce nevertheless yakushiji et al 2013 showed that predawn leaf turgor potential ψppd began to decrease when ψpd fell below ca 0 7 to 0 8 mpa and that the response of fruit water status to drought clearly depends on the fruit growth stage yamamura et al 1989 indicated that even a moderate water deficit leaf water potential ψleaf values around 1 8 mpa increased fruit drop also badal et al 2010 assessed the usefulness of the mds as a persimmon water deficit indicator bearing the above in mind the purpose of the present study was i to evaluate the sensitivity of continuous and discretely measured indicators of the plant water status to use in irrigation scheduling in persimmon trees and ii to analyze leaf water relations in order to clarify the response mechanisms stress avoidance and stress tolerance developed by persimmon plants in response to mild water stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions plant material and treatments the experiment was carried out during the summer of 2016 at a farm located near the city of murcia spain 38 1 n 1 3 w the soil is a calcaric fluvisol with clay texture soil volumetric water contents θv at saturation field capacity and permanent wilting point were 0 48 0 42 and 0 28 m3 m 3 respectively the irrigation water had an electrical conductivity of between 1 2 and 1 4 ds m and a cl concentration ranging from 20 to 35 mg l 1 the climate of the area is typically mediterranean with mild winters low annual rainfall and hot dry summers during the experimental period average daily maximum and minimum air temperatures were 32 and 19 c respectively the mean daily air vapour pressure deficit vpdm allen et al 1998 ranged from 0 89 to 2 64 kpa and reference crop evapotranspiration eto allen et al 1998 was 171 mm no rainfall was recorded during the experimental period the plant material consisted of 3 year old persimmon trees diospyros kaki l f cv rojo brillante grafted on diospyros lotus l tree spacing followed a 3 m x 5 m pattern pest control and fertilization practices were those normally used by the growers and no weeds were allowed to develop within the orchard two irrigation treatments were considered in which irrigation was carried out daily and during night time using a drip irrigation system with one lateral pipe per tree row from day of the year doy 218 251 in order to guarantee non limiting soil water conditions control plants treatment t0 were irrigated using six emitters each delivering 4 l h 1 per plant in order to maintain soil water content in the 0 60 cm soil depth at levels near constant and slightly above soil field capacity in the t1 treatment water was applied at 70 of control trees 2 1 1 measurements θv was measured with a portable fdr sensor hh2 δt u k previously calibrated the measurements were made in four plots per treatment the access tubes for the fdr sensor were placed in the irrigation line at about 30 cm from an emitter the data were obtained at 0 10 0 20 0 30 0 40 and 0 60 m depth ψleaf was measured on the south facing side and the middle third of the trees in two fully developed leaves per tree of each replicate using a pressure chamber pms 600 exp pms instruments company albany usa as recommended by turner 1988 after measuring ψleaf the leaves were frozen in liquid nitrogen and the osmotic potential was measured after thawing the samples and expressing sap using a vapour pressure osmometer wescor 5600 logan usa leaf turgor potential ψp values were derived as the difference between osmotic and water potentials the ψstem was measured in a similar number and type of leaves as used for ψleaf enclosing leaves in a small black plastic bag covered with aluminium foil for at least 2 h before measurements in the pressure chamber leaf conductance gleaf in attached leaves was measured with a porometer delta t ap4 delta t devices cambridge uk on the abaxial surface of the leaves and in a similar number and type of leaves as used for the ψleaf measurements at the end of the experimental period two pressure volume pv curves were performed per replicate in order to determine values of leaf osmotic potential at full turgor ψos leaf water potential at the turgor loss point ψtlp leaf bulk modulus of elasticity є relative water content at the turgor loss point rwctlp and relative apoplastic water content rwca tyree and hammel 1972 tyree and richter 1981 1982 savé et al 1993 for this leaves were excised at predawn and resaturated by dipping the petioles in distilled water for 24 h in darkness at 4 c the resaturated leaves were weighed using an analytical balance 0 1 mg precision placed in the pressure chamber lined with damp filter paper and slowly pressurized 0 025 mpa s 1 until the balance pressure was reached when the leaf sap appeared through the cut petiole protruding from the chamber once depressurized the leaf was allowed to transpire outside the pressure chamber on the laboratory bench at room temperature 22 2 c leaves were repeatedly weighed and their balance pressures were determined over the full range of the pressure gauge kikuta and richter 1986 data for initial saturated weight intermediate fresh weight corresponding to values for ψleaf and final dry weight at 80 c for 48 h were used to calculate the relative water content rwc barrs and weatherley 1962 the curves were drawn using a type ii transformation tyree and richter 1982 the reciprocal of ψleaf was plotted against rwc and the resultant relationships displayed both linear and non linear regions extrapolation on the straight portion of the curve obtained for a value of rwc 1 gave the reciprocal of the ψos and extrapolation to the abscissa gave rwca the ψtlp and rwctlp were estimated as the intersection between the linear and curvilinear portions of the pv curve the є of leaf tissue at 100 rwc rwco was estimated according to patakas and noitsakis 1999 as є mpa ψos ψstlp 100 rwca 100 rwctlp where ψstlp is the osmotic potential at the turgor loss point and ψos values correspond to those obtained from the analysis of the pv curves the micrometric trunk diameter fluctuations tdf were measured throughout the experimental period on four trees per treatment using a set of linear variable displacement transducers lvdt model df 2 5 mm accuracy 10 μm solartron metrology bognor regis uk attached to the trunk with a special bracket made of invar an alloy of ni and fe with a thermal expansion coefficient close to zero katerji et al 1994 and aluminium sensors were placed on the north side 10 cm above the graft point of each tree and were covered with silver thermoprotected foil to prevent heating and wetting of the device measurements were taken every 10 s and the datalogger model cr10x campbell scientific logan ut usa was programmed to report 15 min means mds was calculated as the difference between maximum and minimum daily trunk diameter sf was measured using the compensation heat pulse technique swanson and whitfield 1981 in the same trees used for tdf measurements throughout the experimental period one set of heat pulse probes was located above the lvdt sensors on each tree each set consisted of a heater needle of 1 8 mm diameter and two temperature probes also of 1 8 mm diameter installed in parallel holes drilled radially in the trunks at 10 mm downstream and 5 mm upstream each heat pulse probe had three thermocouple sensors to monitor the sap velocity at a radial depth of 5 12 and 21 mm below the cambium sap velocity was measured following the procedure of green et al 2003 using the theoretical calibrations of swanson and whitfield 1981 to account for the probe induced effects of wounding the volume fractions of wood and water determined by lópez bernal et al 2014 were used the temperature signals and the corresponding heat pulse velocities were recorded at 30 min intervals using heat pulse instrumentation controlled by a datalogger cr10x campbell scientific ltd logan utah 2 1 2 statistical design and analysis the design of the experiment was completely randomized with four replications each replication consisting of three adjacent tree rows each with seven trees measurements were taken on the inner tree of the central row of each replicate which were very similar in appearance leaf area trunk cross sectional area height ground shaded area etc whereas the other trees served as border trees statistical analysis was performed by an analysis of variance using the general linear model glm of spss spps 2002 values for each replicate were averaged before the mean and the standard error of each treatment were calculated 3 results in the t0 treatment θv between 0 and 0 60 m in depth was nearly constant and slightly above field capacity 102 3 of θv values at field capacity fig 1 in the t1 treatment θv values decreased achieving constant values of around 81 of soil field capacity from doy 222 251 ψpd values in t0 plants were very high and fairly constant throughout the experimental period while in t1 plants ψpd values were significantly lower than in t0 plants being characterized by a slight decrease from the beginning of the experiment to doy 222 when minimum values were reached fig 2 a ψmd values in t0 plants during the experimental period were fairly constant and higher than those in t1 plants whereas in t1 plants the ψmd values gradually decreased achieving minimum values on doy 231 and increasing slightly thereafter fig 2b ψppd and leaf turgor potential at midday ψpmd values in both irrigation treatments were always above zero indicating that turgor was maintained during the experimental period however both parameters showed differences in the response to irrigation treatments figs 2c and 2d the ψppd values in both treatments were high and showed some tendency to fluctuate fig 2c furthermore ψppd values in t1 plants were always lower than in t0 plants ψpmd values in t1 plants were also lower than those in t0 plants even though ψpmd values in t1 plants showed a gradual but clear tendency to decrease during the experimental period reaching minimum values of 0 36 mpa at the end of the experiment on doy 251 fig 2d ψstem values in both irrigation treatments were higher than the corresponding ψmd values throughout the experimental period and behaved somewhat similarly to ψpd values figs 3 a 2 b and 2 a respectively so ψstem values of t0 plants were almost constant during the experimental period while in t1 plants they showed a tendency to decrease almost all the time with lower values than those observed in t0 the glmd values in t0 plants were nearly constant during the experimental period whereas glmd values in t1 plants were clearly lower than in t0 plants gradually decreasing during the experimental period fig 3b during the experimental period regardless of the treatment ψleaf values exhibited a similar circadian rhythm on the five measuring dates reaching maximum values at predawn decreasing rapidly in the morning and reaching minimum values at around 14 00 17 00 h after which they gradually recovered fig 4 differences between the circadian ψleaf values of the t0 and t1 varied from day to day at the end of the experimental period doy 251 the daily ψleaf pattern in t1 plants was characterized by a gradual decrease reaching minimum values at 14 00 h and showing only a very slight recovery during the afternoon at sunrise the increase in radiation induced stomatal opening while gleaf increased to reach maximum values between 10 00 and 14 00 h after which it progressively decreased fig 4 t0 plants showed higher gleaf values than those in plants under water deficit t1 during most of the day and but specially when daily maximum gleaf values were achieved differences in gleaf values between t0 and t1 plants gradually increased due to the response of t1 plants to the deficit irrigation which gradually decreased the duration of maximum stomatal opening low and near constant gleaf values were registered during most of the day from doy 231 251 fig 4 ψp values showed a similar circadian rhythm on the five studied dates characterized by maximum values at predawn and minimum values at 12 00 17 00 h fig 4 ψp values in t1 plants tended to be lower than in t0 plants especially in the central hours of the day 12 00 17 00 h daily sf values in t0 plants were characterized by a more pronounced fluctuation than was seen in t1 plants where they decreased gradually showing differences between treatments from doy 221 onwards and remaining almost constant from doy 223 onwards fig 5 a mds values in t1 plants were higher than in t0 plants in addition differences in mds values between treatments were significant the day immediately after the beginning of the experiment 2 days earlier than the differences in sf became evident fig 5a and b in contrast with the behaviour observed in daily sf values no differences between treatments were observed in mds values from doy 226 230 on doy 235 and on doy 238 the regression analysis between sf and ψpd ψmd ψstem and glmd obtained by pooling data for the whole observation period demonstrated that decreases in sf values were associated with decreases in ψpd ψmd ψstem and glmd values fig 6 in order to study the sensitivity of the measured plant based water status indicators we considered both continuously and discretely recorded plant based indicators sf mds ψpd ψmd ψstem and glmd during increasing intervals of time from the beginning to the end of the experimental period table 1 the si values increased in all plant based water stress indicators considered in response to water deficit however during the experimental period different behaviours were observed so at the beginning of the deficit irrigation period the mds si t1 t0 and ψpd si t1 t0 increased more sharply than si of the other indicators after doy 222 sf si t0 t1 values tended to be higher than the si values of other indicators nevertheless from doy 218 226 and 218 231 ψpd si t1 t0 values were similar to those observed in the sf si when the mean si values were considered in relation to their noise for all the plant based water stress indicators table 1 the described behaviours changed the data indicated that ψmd mean noise was very low leading it to show the highest ψmd signal noise ratio at the beginning of the experimental period doy 218 222 and 218 226 however from doy 226 to the end of the experiment the substantial increase in the sf si led to a higher signal noise ratio for all the following intervals of time considered even though ψmd signal noise ratios were close to those of the sf signal noise ratio at the end of the experimental period doy 251 no significant differences in ψos ψtlp є rwctlp or rwca values were found between t0 and t1 plants table 2 nevertheless it is important to point out that rwca values were very high in both treatments 4 discussion throughout the experimental period and based on the fact that i θv values in t0 treatment were slightly above field capacity fig 1 ii ψpd ψmd and ψstem values figs 2a 2 b and 3 a were nearly constant and very high in relation to the values already reported for other authors for full irrigated persimmon plants badal et al 2010 buesa et al 2013 and iii ψpd values depend mainly on soil moisture levels elfving et al 1972 torrecillas et al 1988 sellin 1996 we conclude that t0 plants were under non limiting soil water conditions moreover considering that the tree water relations under flooding conditions are characterized by a substantial decrease in leaf conductance and leaf water potential as a consequence of the effects of chemical signals from roots and an increase in the resistance to water flowing through the plant ruiz sánchez et al 1997 dell amico et al 2001 the water relations of t0 plants indicated the absence of any waterlogging because leaf turgor was maintained ψppd and ψpmd 0 and high and near constant values of ψpd ψmd ψstem sf and glmd were observed figs 2a b 3 a b and 5 a regarding the t1 treatment the fact that minimum θv values were around 81 of field capacity and minimum ψpd ψmd ψstem and glmd values were around 0 50 mpa 1 17 mpa 0 87 mpa and 99 66 mmol m 2 s 1 respectively indicated that t1 plants were under a mild degree of water deficit during the experimental period figs 2a 2 b 3 a and 3 b cruz et al 2012 rodríguez et al 2012 torrecillas et al 2018 in addition the rate of development of water stress in t1 plants was very low because the ψpd ψstem and ψmd values decreased by only around 0 01 0 02 and 0 01 mpa per day basis 2a 3a and 2b respectively hale and orcutt 1987 the progressive decrease in glmd in t1 plants and the tendency to shorten the duration of maximum stomatal opening in its circadian rhythm as stress progressed figs 3b and 4 indicated that stomata regulation is a key mechanism in controlling leaf water status because leaf turgor was maintained in t1 plants fig 2c and d and persimmon plants did not develop any other stress tolerance mechanism such as elastic adjustment є decrease or active osmotic adjustment ψos decrease in our experimental conditions table 2 the decrease in glmd values of woody crop leaves in response to water deficit has been reported as a stress avoidance mechanism in response to water deficit which improves water use efficiency rieger and duemmel 1992 girona et al 1993 the behaviour of є ψos ψtlp and rwctlp values which did not change as a result of water deficit in t1 plants table 2 was similar to the results obtained by other authors sánchez blanco et al 1991 savé et al 1995 torrecillas et al 1996 suggesting that the є and ψos affect the rwctlp and ψtlp values respectively rwca values in persimmon plants around 58 table 2 were similar to those found for grapes 51 63 rodrigues et al 1993 to the lower limit of the range found for pinus ponderosa 57 81 hardegree 1989 and to the higher limit found for pomegranate 42 58 rodríguez et al 2012 and almond 42 59 torrecillas et al 1996 on the other hand persimmon rwca values were high compared with other tree species such as apricot 27 42 torrecillas et al 1999 peach 29 44 mellisho et al 2011 eucalyptus globulus 14 27 correia et al 1989 and quercus alba 26 31 parker and pallardi 1987 high rwca values represent a xeromorphic characteristic cutler et al 1977 and are a consequence of thicker cell walls or differences in cell wall structure hellkvist et al 1974 which could contribute to the retention of water when water potential decreases torrecillas et al 1996 sf ψpd ψmd ψstem and glmd encompass different time scales because the last four are point measurements taken at predawn or at midday and are considered as indicators of the minimum ψpd and maximum ψmd ψstem and glmd daily plant water deficit whereas sf is an integrative indicator which reflects the continuous sap flow records on a diurnal basis despite these facts the relationships between sf and ψpd ψmd ψstem and glmd fig 6 were high and constant indicating that sf can be used to indicate the water status of young persimmon trees assuming that any comparison of the sensitivities of different plant based water status indicators for diagnosing water deficit must consider the strength of each indicator in the context of its variability goldhamer and fereres 2001 naor and cohen 2003 it can be observed that ψmd was the most suitable indicator for persimmon irrigation scheduling when short periods of time are considered because it showed the highest signal noise ratio during the first 4 or 8 days of the experimental period doy 218 222 and 218 226 table 1 however as the interval of time considered grew doy 218 231 218 237 218 244 and 218 251 sf si sharply increased and sf noise was maintained leading it to show the highest signal noise ratio for these intervals of time table 1 moreover taking into consideration that during the two first periods of time considered doy 218 222 and 218 226 the sf signal noise ratio despite being lower than that showed by ψmd was relatively high it could be concluded that sf is a more suitable indicator than ψmd for irrigation scheduling because it can provide continuous and automated registers of the plant water status in real time avoiding frequent trips to the field and a significant input of manpower since frequent ψmd readings are needed in this respect ortuño et al 2004 indicated that in young trees continuously measured plant water status indicators were more immediate and sensitive than discretely measured indicators for detecting water stress also other authors indicated that mds and sf revealed significant differences between irrigation treatments even in the absence of differences in ψstem goldhamer et al 1999 remorini and massai 2003 by contrast in persimmon plants badal et al 2010 assessed the feasibility of using mds ψstem glmd and fruit diameter variations and concluded that although mds can be successfully used as continuous plant water stress indicator ψstem was the most sensitive plant water stress indicator the above results indicated that persimmon plants exposed to mild water stress are able to gradually develop stomata control a stress avoidance mechanism also under water stress the high relative apoplastic water content could contribute to the retention of water so both drought resistance characteristics could have contributed to the leaf turgor maintenance observed during the experimental period in addition the discrete and continuously recorded plant based indicators showed different degrees of sensitivity for diagnosing persimmon tree water status overall sf measurements made by the heat pulse technique are the most suitable method for estimating persimmon water status because it showed the highest signal noise ratio in almost all intervals of time considered while providing continuous and automated registers of

11093,the mississippi river alluvial floodplain is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the united states in recent decades factors of economic forces and government policies have driven crop selection and respective farming management changes in this region this study quantified the effects of changes in crop conversion and farming management practices to discharge and sediment loads in the upper sunflower river watershed farming and climate conditions were dynamically characterized in space and time by integrating annual crop yield at the county scale annual crop irrigation in the field scale and an enhanced description of precipitation this information was used as input into the annualized agricultural non point source annagnps watershed pollution model to describe existing conditions and simulate alternative scenarios simulations considering high irrigation adoption indicated 15 average annual percent change increase in short term flow during the months of june july and august at the outlet conversely simulations considering future trends in crop conversion to corn soybean production indicates a potential reduction in average annual sediment loads for clay and silt respectively to 4 6 mg ha and 0 41 mg ha from 5 5 mg ha and 0 44 mg ha for existing conditions as irrigation increases and crop production continues to shift towards corn soybeans these findings support the development of responsible irrigation management strategies designed for efficient water usage coupled with implementation of in field conservation practices for reduced sediment loads keywords watershed simulation soil erosion annagnps crop conversion irrigation non point source pollution 1 introduction soil erosion in agricultural watersheds is the principal cause of soil degradation and its consequences can impact downstream ecosystem services threaten long term food security and affect economic stability pimentel et al 1995 lal 2001 ananda and herath 2003 van oost et

factors include soil type and its physical chemical properties landscape topography and climatic conditions controlling the surface and sub surface water balance i e precipitation frequency duration and intensity solar radiation temperature and above ground air moisture anthropogenic factors are represented by farming management practices these include the selection of crop variety and rotation farming equipment type and usage pattern fertilizer irrigation pesticides and implementation of conservation alternatives parajuli et al 2013 changes in crop selection and rotations can be driven by economic dynamics and or government policies secchi et al 2011 in the u s for example government policies for energy independence through increased production of biofuels eisa 2007 have significantly increased corn production wallander et al 2011 since 2009 in addition to spatial expansion in traditional corn producing states corn has replaced traditional crops such as cotton in southern states and it is being grown in areas not previously used for row crops in northern states wallander et al 2011 wright and wimberly 2013 increased production has also been achieved by advances in genetic technology and changes in farming management practices such as multi crop rotations often soybean and implementation of irrigation pesticide and fertilizer practices this rapid crop conversion has raised concerns over a potential increase in non point source pollution loads responsible for acidification of downstream water bodies increased sediment concentrations eutrophication poor water quality and reduced water availability yang and suh 2015 pimentel et al 1995 love and nejadhashemi 2011 yasarer et al 2016 this national trend can be observed in the mississippi alluvial plain referred to locally as the delta the delta region is an important contributor to corn and soybean production in the state of mississippi harvested total area for corn and soybean respectively increased by 750 and 330 between 1995 to 2016 nass 2017 this change is noteworthy since in the delta corn and soybean crops are considered not fully adapted given the region s flat topography shrink swell soil types hot summers and high occurrence of insects and weeds heatherly et al 1990 locke et al 2008 however high productivity can be achieved through changes in management practices including but not limited to use of pesticides and large scale irrigation locke et al 2008 rebich et al 2004 willis et al 1983 yang and suh 2015 rapid conversion to a corn soybean dominated landscape and associated farming practices has raised concerns in the agricultural areas of the mississippi alluvium plain about the potential increase in non point source pollution primarily associated with soil erosion processes pimentel and patzek 2005 pimentel et al 1995 wallander et al 2011 changes in crop production have elevated awareness not only of the local impacts of non point source pollutants but more importantly their transport to downstream waterbodies beyond the watershed of origin boundaries studies integrating land use information with watershed modeling technology were conducted to quantify this phenomenon at regional scales secchi et al 2011 have used the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 watershed model to simulate planting trends toward continuous corn growth or a corn corn soybean rotation within the upper mississippi river basin 48 950 775 ha findings have indicated a correlation between increased corn production and high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus additionally results from the secchi et al 2011 study have demonstrated the potential for increases in fertilizer and pesticide use to reduce water quality in the region and also downstream in the mississippi river similarly parajuli et al 2013 studied the impact of crop rotations and tillage on crop and sediment yield in big sunflower river watershed 1 048 800 ha within the delta region using the swat model findings from this work indicate a significant reduction of sediment loads through implementation of crop rotations and reduced no tillage management however in both of these regional studies farming management is assumed to be either static repeated yearly management for the duration of the simulation or pseudo static few years of crop rotation repeated for the duration of the simulation this assumption is required for simplified representation of existing conditions within models simulating physical processes at these large scales this research program seeks to quantify the impact of crop conversion and associated farming management changes to flow and sediment loads in the mississippi delta region based on enhanced spatial and temporal characterization of farming practices and crop rotations specifically the objectives of this study are as follows 1 development of methods for improved characterization of farming management in time and space and integration with u s department of agriculture usda developed watershed scale modeling technologies 2 quantification of relationships between water sediment loads and trends in land use change and irrigation adoption observed within the region and 3 estimation of future non point source pollution trends based on results from alternative scenarios analysis in general this research seeks to determine the implications for runoff and sediment loads in the upper sunflower river usr watershed if increases in corn soy rotations and irrigation adoption trends continue into the future 2 methods 2 1 upper sunflower river watershed the usr watershed is located in the alluvial valley and floodplain of the mississippi river within the lower mississippi river basin shaded area in inset map of fig 1 which is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the united states particularly for rice cotton corn and soybean production the usr watershed encompasses 188 549 ha with the outlet defined at the u s geological survey gauging station 7 288 500 at sunflower ms the watershed spans three counties in northern mississippi coahoma bolivar and sunflower fig 1 the natural topography is flat with row crop fields being further precision graded for improved irrigation efficiency elevation ranges from 26 m to 65 m with an average elevation of 46 m above mean sea level for the entire watershed despite the flat topography soil erosion by surface runoff has been observed during spring and fall months when precipitation intensities and amounts are the highest and the soil surface is unprotected by vegetative cover murphree and mcgregor 1991 average annual precipitation between 1970 and 2016 in the watershed is 1321 mm with average minimum and maximum temperatures of 17 c and 29 c respectively during the active growing season the combination of warm temperatures with high air humidity makes the use of pesticides to control weeds and insects an important component of row crop farming management locke et al 2008 mcdowell et al 1984 anthropogenic modifications to the delta s landscape include clearing of natural riparian vegetation channelization of streams and development of large flood control structures along the mississippi river faulkner et al 2011 additionally large flood control reservoirs were built in the 1940s to protect this region from runoff in the uplands of the basin although none of these structures are located in the study watershed these landscape changes coupled with a long growing season fertile floodplain soils and access to the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer have contributed to the agricultural productivity in the delta region barlow and coupe 2014 specifically within the usr watershed agricultural land use land cover alone comprises 94 of the watershed of the farm land in production corn and soybeans are the dominant row crops produced having replaced legacy crops such as cotton fig 2 another anthropogenic driver of agricultural productivity in the delta region is the significant increase of crop irrigation made possible by pumping water from the shallow mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer this trend can be observed in the number of active irrigation well permits within the usr watershed fig 3 a in the delta region increased irrigation is of great concern given declining water tables and reduction of base flow in streams which the sunflower river has experienced kebede et al 2014 2 2 description of the annualized agriculture non point source pollution model the usda has developed the annualized agricultural non point source annagnps watershed pollution model through a partnership between the agricultural research service research branch and the natural resource conservation service applied branch the annagnps model was developed to quantitatively evaluate the long term effect of farming and conservation practices on non point source pollutants in un gauged agricultural watersheds the model has capabilities to support the selection and spatial location of best management practices to evaluate the efficiency of individual practices locally where they are implemented track pollutants from their source as they move through the system and more importantly their inter related effect to the overall watershed pollutant loads momm et al 2016 watersheds are sub divided into two basic modeling units concentrated flow referred to as reaches and sub catchments referred to as cells which can be characterized using topographic analysis techniques based on geographic information systems gis methods or manually annagnps cells are hierarchically connected by annagnps reaches depicting surface and shallow subsurface flow throughout the watershed runoff sediment and pollutants transported out from cells are routed through the reaches while accounting for the inter relation between upland and channel hydrological and pollutant transport processes the annagnps model performs long term continuous simulations of mixed land use watersheds on a daily time step to model management practice impacts on runoff and sediment nutrient pesticide detachment transportation and deposition bingner and theurer 2001 the hydrology of the watershed is based on a daily water balance considering surface runoff evapotranspiration et and percolation of water through the soil profile yuan et al 2006 runoff is estimated using the runoff curve number cn method usda 1985 et using the dual crop coefficient procedure based on the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and soil percolation using the brooks corey method based on hydraulic conductivity bisantino et al 2013 detachment transportation and deposition of sediment and attached and dissolved chemicals are determined using an integrated approach landscape erosion processes are calculated using the revised universal soil loss equation rusle for estimation of sheet and rill erosion while accounting for land cover and farming management practices renard et al 1997 the delivery of multiple particle sizes of eroded sediments to concentrated flow is calculated using the hydro geomorphic universal soil loss equation husle theurer and clarke 1991 an important characteristic of the annagnps model is the capability of describing farming practices on a daily basis this is accomplished by the development of databases representing unique farming management schedules and respective farming operations these databases provide the means to estimate crop growth canopy cover root mass fall height and soil disturbance by farming equipment additionally the annagnps model contains components to characterize ephemeral gully emergence evolution and erosion rates at scales smaller than sub catchments and components to estimate the effects of conservation practices such as riparian vegetated filters and sediment retention wetlands momm et al 2012 2014 2016 2 3 input database development a geospatial database was developed describing historical climate topography soils and agricultural practices for the usr watershed in preparation for annagnps input database development 2 3 1 watershed definition topographic information was assembled from lidar irregular point clouds collected during 2009 2010 by the u s army corps of engineers usace in the mississippi delta phase 2 project and downloaded from the mississippi automated resource information system maris website http www maris state ms us accessed on january 2017 tiled point clouds were merged into a single file interpolated into a 1 m raster grid file based on classified bare ground points and resampled into a 10 m digital elevation model detailed hydrologic analysis was performed to correct for elevation artifacts produced by embedded drainage structures such as culverts and bridges an iterative approach was used to compare the produced channel network with the published u s geological survey national hydrological dataset and high resolution aerial photographs terrain analysis was performed using the agnps gis topographic analysis tool topagnps for dem preprocessing pit filling standard terrain analysis hydrographic sub catchment delineation and drainage network generation garbrecht et al 2000 the watershed was subdivided into 3992 annagnps cells sub catchments and 1602 annagnps reaches concentrated flow based on the threshold values of 64 ha for critical source area and 260 m for minimum source channel length these threshold values were obtained through an iterative gis based approach in which discretized watershed alternatives were quantitatively compared to land use information 2 3 2 climate climate data for dates between january 1 1970 and december 31 2015 were obtained from the u s national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa global historical climatology network daily https www ncdc noaa gov ghcn daily description and the u s natural resources conservation service nrcs scan sites https www wcc nrcs usda gov scan datasets for climate observation stations located within and around the study area fig 4 seven climate stations in total were selected based on their proximity to the watershed and data temporal extent to represent climatic conditions at the study site large filled circles in fig 4 these seven climate stations were defined within the annagnps model as default climate stations daily precipitation mm as well as maximum and minimum temperature c were utilized for each of the seven selected climate observation stations an annagnps input climate file was created containing the daily weather data reported at that station daily weekly and monthly gaps in data coverage were observed in these seven climate files missing weather records at these stations were filled with data using a nearest neighbor approach from supplementary climate observation stations within a 30 km distance buffer see small red circle from noaa and large unfilled purple circle from nrcs supplementary stations in fig 4 dew point c sky cover wind speed ms 1 and solar radiation wm 2 were generated using the generation of weather elements for multiple applications gem model which utilizes local historical climate data and long term statistical parameters to produce daily climate data hanson et al 1996 johnson et al 1996 hanson and johnson 1998 each sub catchment annagnps cell was assigned to a climate station identifier based on its spatial proximity to the nearest climate station fig 5 a the seven selected climate stations were converted to thiessen polygons to determine their zones of influence the annagnps cell gis layer was overlaid with the thiessen polygons and each annagnps cell was then assigned to a climate station using gis based intersection analysis 2 3 3 soil soil data was gathered from the nrcs website https websoilsurvey sc egov usda gov accessed on december 2016 these datasets were used to develop annagnps soil databases a unique soil type was assigned to each annagnps cell based on gis standard overlay and intersection procedures a total of 64 unique soil types were considered fig 5b 2 3 4 irrigation spatial and temporal quantification of irrigation management practices were estimated based on well irrigation permits over time fig 3a registered wells represented as point features in gis layers were linked to temporal databases of irrigation permits the point feature class was dynamic representing the year to year variability in active irrigation permits ymd 2017 these selected points were spatially joined to agricultural individual field parcel boundaries digitized polygons based on multi year aerial photographs and converted to raster grids this analysis yielded annual raster grid files from 2001 to 2015 containing agricultural fields with active irrigation well permits irrigation raster grids were combined with watershed sub division information on an annual basis to assign each annagnps cell an irrigation flag the resulting database containing individual annagnps cells and respective years of irrigation was created through a custom computer program that automated the process no information was publicly available on the amount and timing of water pumped from each well so a standard irrigation strategy was adopted for the entire watershed many producers in the delta region still use a subjective irrigation scheduling method based on visually observing crop conditions kebede et al 2014 this irrigation approach was simulated with the annagnps model using the water balance automated irrigation method by determining daily soil moisture levels daily estimates of surface water flux based on inputs of precipitation and irrigation and outputs of surface runoff et and soil infiltration were used to determine whether an individual field annagnps cell is irrigated the irrigation strategy adopted was based on documented delta region averages massey et al 2017 the irrigation season in this region is from june to august with a varying end date for each crop the irrigation season ending dates adopted were july 15 july 31 and august 15 for corn rice and cotton soybeans respectively open furrow application is the most common irrigation method massey et al 2017 and therefore the selected methodology simulated with the annagnps model a uniform application of 76 2 mm 24 h was adopted 2 3 5 land cover land use and management characterization of land use land cover and respective farming management at the field scale was accomplished through intersecting i annual land use land cover at field scale provided by the cropland data layer cdl ii annual well irrigation permit layers at the field scale iii annual average crop yield at the county scale and iv a one year farming management schedule and operations for individual crops annual land cover land use information between 2001 and 2015 was acquired from the u s department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service cdl as raster grid files boryan et al 2011a b a zonal majority gis analysis was performed to determine the primary land use for each sub catchment for each year fig 6 this analysis generated a 15 year sequence of land cover land use for each annagnps cell for example annagnps cell 531 was assigned the following land cover land use sequence from 2001 to 2015 co co co co co co co c s c wws c s s and s where co represents cotton s soybeans wws soybeans followed by winter wheat and c corn the sequence of land cover land use were combined with the irrigation database and revised accordingly for example for annagnps cell 531 the revised sequence based on irrigation information was co co co co co co co c s ci wwsi ci si si and si the addition of the character i to each code indicates the presence of one or more irrigation well with an active permit from 2010 to 2015 farm management in annagnps is represented by management schedules as a temporal series of in field actions table 3 farm management schedules contain a continuous sequence of activities from all years of the simulation which in this study is from 2001 to 2015 single year farm management templates for key crops were developed based on combined information from the rusle2 database for u s department of agriculture defined crop management zone 69 usda 2017 previous annagnps simulations of similar watersheds in the region yasarer et al 2017 that used historical farming practices that were representative in this region during this period a total of 15 one year farm management templates were considered two non crop forest grassland and 11 crops irrigated and non irrigated the annagnps farming management data section was generated through a custom python script that integrated the revised sequence of land cover land use individual one year management templates temporally variable crop yield and spatio temporal irrigation information 2 4 model calibration and validation to account for uncertainties regarding irrigation amount and timing the amount of surface water artificially ponded during winter months for recreation and stream base flow variations the annagnps model was calibrated and validated using observed streamflow from a stream gauge located at the outlet of the watershed fig 1 total monthly streamflow during the simulation period ranged from 2 62 106 mg to 3 17 108 mg and averaged 7 77 107 mg ground water contribution to streamflow was not modeled and therefore base flow was removed from observed daily streamflow using monthly totals annual base flow estimates ranged from 21 in 2006 to 38 in 2010 with an annual average of 28 of the total flow the lynne hollick filter method was used to remove base flow implemented in the r hydrostats package lyne and hollick 1979 the calibration period was defined as october 2002 beginning of observed streamflow data to december 2008 and the validation period included the latter half of the simulation period january 2009 to december 2015 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias coefficient of determination ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr were calculated between simulated and observed total monthly runoff generated streamflow for each simulation period of the calibration and validation datasets moriasi et al 2007 after improving spatio temporal characterization of precipitation distribution in the watershed fig 5a the model was further calibrated by adjusting the runoff curve number cn values chahor et al 2014 a runoff curve number is an empirical value which estimates the amount of runoff for a surface based on the surface soil cover type and hydrologic condition usda 1986 an iterative approach was used to generate subsequent calibration simulations in which curve numbers were uniformly decreased by 2 increments from the initial values suggested by usda page 2 6 and 2 7 usda 1986 from zero to 24 total increment statistical values were calculated for each calibration simulation optimal results were achieved with a widespread 16 reduction in the curve number step three in table 1 although the selection of runoff curve number values in the third iteration has significantly improved the accuracy of statistical values the remaining discrepancies between simulated and observed monthly streamflow appeared to be related to a few peak events overestimation of streamflow during these peak events was attributed to the process of filling gaps within selected climate stations based on nearby supplementary climate stations fig 4 further scrutiny of large precipitation events at contributing stations was performed analysis of map based time series of precipitation events allowed simulation of the spatial movement of storms in time helping to determine whether individual events affected the watershed these adjustments to the selected climate files resulted in significant improvements in model performance fig 7 and step four in table 1 limited sediment load measurements were available for this watershed there were only 35 discrete measurements of suspended sediment at the gauge station located at the watershed s outlet there were many gaps between the measurements sometimes up to several months which limited efforts to investigate trends and to compare observed and simulated sediment values on a monthly time scale observed suspended sediment values were converted from an instantaneous suspended sediment concentration to a total daily suspended sediment load based on measured daily flow a detailed analysis comparing observed and simulated sediment loads was not possible given the uncertainty involved in converting instantaneous measurements into a daily total the small number of measurements 35 total and their lack of temporal resolution fig 8 instead annagnps input parameters controlling sediment loads were set based on previous simulations in the region yasarer et al 2017 yasarer et al 2018 yuan et al 2001 2008 nonetheless the simulation depicting existing conditions characterizes the general trend in suspended sediment load at the outlet fig 8 2 5 development of alternative scenarios the annagnps simulation calibrated and validated to observed values describing existing conditions in the usr watershed was considered as the base scenario to investigate the impact of crop conversion on sediment loads and discharge five 5 hypothetical alternative scenarios were devised scenario a considered existing land use land cover conditions but assumed that all agricultural fields were irrigated for all years of the simulation period conversely scenario b represented existing land use land cover but no irrigation these two scenarios were contrasted with the base scenario to evaluate the impact of irrigation on runoff patterns the other alternative scenarios were devised to evaluate the contribution of management practices to hydrological patterns and resulting sediment load alternative scenario c assumed a modified version of the 2001 land management in this scenario fields assigned to corn and soybeans in 2001 were converted to cotton and this modified 2001 land management was repeated from 2002 to 2015 no irrigation practices were adopted this simulation was designed to represent a hypothetical scenario in which no corn soybean crops and respective management practices were introduced in this watershed similarly in alternative scenario d fields assigned to cotton corn and soybeans in 2001 were converted into grass fields referred to as conservation reserve program crp with no irrigation practices this alternative assumes one extreme in which producers are participating in government sponsored conservation practices the final alternative scenario e considered a modified version of the 2015 land use land cover conditions all fields assigned to crp and cotton were converted into corn and soybean crops with irrigation practices this year was repeated for the duration of the simulation 2001 2015 this hypothetical alternative scenario sought to represent an extrapolation of existing crop conversion trends to future years quantitative comparisons between runoff and sediment load on a monthly time scale were considered using percent difference pd eq 1 non parametric correlation analysis and statistical analysis of means 1 p d c h a n g e r e f e r e n c e c h a n g e r e f e r e n c e 2 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of existing conditions during the 15 years evaluated the percent total watershed area used for corn production increased from 0 19 to 4 55 soybean production increased from 17 21 to 65 01 fig 3b and cotton production decreased from 49 74 to 5 56 agricultural fields with active irrigation well permits increased from 26 of the total watershed area 49 023 ha in 2001 to 43 81 076 ha in 2015 with an average increase rate of 20 per year ymd 2017 similarly average yield increased by 37 and 35 for soybean and corn respectively nass 2017 these temporal spatial changes in crop selection irrigation adoption and crop yield were characterized through the development of 3143 unique 15 year crop rotations linked to 3992 sub catchments 3 2 calibration and validation uncertainties in historical streamflow arose from lack of information on amount and timing of irrigation practices location and amount of surface water impounded during winter months and unknown infiltrated runoff ratio amounts in space and time these uncertainties were accounted for using adjustments of the runoff curve number streamflow calibration from 2002 to 2008 improved monthly nse values from 0 76 to 0 61 and pbias from 67 2 to 8 3 monthly validation statistics from 2009 to 2016 also improved with nse values from 0 38 uncalibrated to 0 68 when calibrated similarly monthly validation pbias decreased from 99 2 to 8 60 when calibrated table 1 shows the improvement in calibration and validation statistics with various model input and parameter adjustments even after adjustments to precipitation data there were three months during the calibration years may 2003 february 2004 and december 2004 which had high volumes of observed flow at the outlet while no precipitation event was recorded by any of the 78 climate stations fig 8 this led to underestimation of streamflow during these months and likely contributes to the overall negative pbias result during the monthly calibration period 3 3 water balance one important characteristic resulting from crop conversion in this region is the accompanying adoption of irrigation practices there was a constant annual increase in agricultural fields with active irrigation well permits fig 3a ymd 2017 this increase in irrigation was described in the existing conditions simulation when irrigation went from 23 of the total watershed area irrigated in 2001 to 43 in 2015 line with circle symbols in fig 9 a this simulation was contrasted to two alternative scenarios scenario a with approximately 80 of the total watershed area irrigated throughout the simulation period line with square symbols in fig 9a and scenario b with approximately less than 5 of the total watershed area irrigated throughout the simulation period representing irrigation applied to rice fields only line with triangle symbols in fig 9a the simulated total irrigation water applied for the entire watershed area and simulation period was 184 mm mean 12 3 and std 10 1 419 mm mean 27 91 and std 24 00 and 29 mm mean 1 9 and std 2 6 for existing conditions and scenarios a and b respectively because the irrigation schedule adopted was the soil water storage capacity method irrigation application varied from year to year based on climatic conditions fig 9b for example in 2002 a total of 170 mm of precipitation was recorded during the irrigation season for the entire watershed area june july and august yielding estimates of applied irrigation of 24 mm 82 mm and 7 mm for existing conditions and scenarios a and b respectively using existing conditions as reference a pd of 108 for scenario a and 110 for scenario b demonstrates the disparity between the scenarios conversely in 2004 total precipitation for the watershed was 282 mm during the irrigation season yielding estimates of applied irrigation of 2 mm 6 mm pd 112 and 0 06 mm pd 185 for existing conditions and scenarios a and b respectively changes in irrigation practices caused small changes in et which were only apparent in years with reduced precipitation fig 9c in 2002 reduced precipitation resulted in increased irrigation during the growing season months and estimates of total et for the watershed area during these months was 194 mm for existing conditions and 210 mm pd 9 and 188 mm pd 11 for scenarios a and b respectively considering only the irrigation season for all years simulated the trend line slopes of 64 72 and 58 for existing conditions and scenarios a and b respectively indicate differences in long term irrigation contributions to surface flow fig 9d although the irrigation rates per unit area see example for july in fig 9e were assumed constant converting estimates of irrigation rates to volumes demonstrate the potential impact of irrigation to the overall watershed water balance fig 9f for example in july 2002 estimates of total irrigation volumes are 2152 10 000 m3 7096 10 000 m3 and 722 10 000 m3 for scenarios existing conditions a and b respectively as expected the effect of irrigation was observed during the crop growing season since the only difference between these three simulations is the annual percent of irrigated area in those months the adoption of irrigation or the lack of it can influence runoff derived discharge at the outlet significantly results from scenario a provided an assessment of increased irrigated area extrapolation of the existing trend into the future fig 9a in the delta region only 28 of the total precipitation is estimated to occur during the growing season snipes et al 2005 thus irrigation practices are needed to maintain crop productivity depending on the precipitation pattern in a specific year irrigation can also become a significant component of the water balance inputs and outputs during these months for example in june of 2005 the total precipitation for the watershed was approximately 32 mm and irrigation was estimated to account for 29 13 mm 47 28 mm and 11 4 mm of the total water input for existing conditions scenario a and scenario b respectively changes in land use had a small effect on estimated annual runoff two alternative scenarios c and d both with no irrigation but each with a different selection of crops were contrasted in scenario c fields assigned to corn and soybeans were converted to cotton and in scenario d fields assigned to corn soybeans and cotton were converted to grass simulating crp the watershed average annual runoff was estimated as 347 mm and 382 mm for scenarios c and d respectively table 2 average monthly runoff for scenarios existing condition c and d are depicted in fig 10 a runoff at the watershed s gauging stations was slightly smaller for scenario c than existing conditions with higher differences during the growing season fig 10b increasing crp adoption indicated on average smaller runoff throughout the year but slightly smaller differences between cotton and crp from april to october fig 10b the differences in runoff were attributed to the longer growing period of grasses compared to row crops which are modeled using different runoff curve numbers to characterize their differences in surface roughness soil physical conditions surface cover type and hydrologic behavior 3 4 sediment load because the focus of this study was on sediment loads produced in agricultural fields by sheet and rill erosion fields only estimates of suspended sediment loads for clay and silt particle sizes were analyzed as expected the adoption of crp significantly reduced the amount of sediment loads leaving fields and reaching the watershed gauge the annual average suspended sediment load for existing conditions is 5 5 mg ha for clay and 0 38 mg ha for silt and these estimates are significantly reduced to 0 37 mg ha and 0 03 mg ha respectively for scenario d on a monthly scale this reduction represents an average pd reduction greater than 130 fig 11 although this is not a realistic scenario this can signify the potential that conservation practices have as a water quality mitigation strategy yasarer et al 2016 conversely in scenario c cotton was simulated as the principal crop grown in the region in the management database corn soybean fields were converted to cotton this scenario was intended to represent conditions where no conversion to corn soybean was implemented under scenario c annual averages have increased to 7 3 mg ha for clay particles but remained the same for silt table 2 average monthly estimates of suspended sediment of clay particle sizes indicated a small pd change of estimates from january to june within 20 with significant changes from july to november 50 fig 11b a similar pattern but with higher changes in a shorter period of time was observed for silt size particles fig 11c and d simulation results indicate a potential increase in suspended sediment loads by continued cotton production scenario e simulated an alternative in which land use assigned to crp and cotton were converted into rotations of corn and soybeans under this scenario the annual average suspended sediment yield was 4 51 mg ha for clay and 0 35 mg ha for silt this is a small reduction when compared to existing conditions but a large reduction from estimates produced by scenario c similar to scenario c the largest differences occurred during the growing season under scenario e the largest pds were found to be from july to october with the greatest differences in october fig 11b and d the main difference in sediment load patterns between existing conditions and scenarios c and e is the timing to sediment loads to peak for example for scenario e the main pd for clay sized particles was from july to november 50 pd while for silt size particles there was a pd swale in october 100 pd in fig 11d indicating a decrease when compared to existing conditions this could be attributed to farming practices employed during cotton cultivation overall trends for all years were also evaluated through calculation of annual average mass per unit area and expressed as ranked ratios of the total watershed annual average fig 12 the conversion of crp and cotton into corn and soybean rotations scenario e generated an average reduction in sediment load of approximately 13 at 100 of area from 78 7 under existing conditions to 65 4 for scenario e conversely alternative scenario c which simulated cotton over corn soybean generated an annual average increase of 23 when compared to existing conditions from 78 7 to 100 under existing conditions 20 of the watershed contributed to 47 of total sediment load while alternative scenarios c and e contributed to 67 and 40 respectively the reduction of total sediment production when converting cotton into corn soybeans can be attributed to the introduction of modern farming practices when migrating from one crop to another secchi et al 2011 corn and soybeans are often produced with either no till or reduced tillage operations with high plant seeding density for efficient furrow irrigation practices soybeans can be economically produced with reduced or no tillage due to glyphosate resistant soybean seeds that allow for widespread application of herbicides gianessi 2005 all of these management operations tend to reduce field erosion by sheet and rill physical processes as a result of reduced soil disturbance of the soil by farming equipment increased crop residue increased soil health by adoption of multi crop rotations and reduced et wu et al 2010 vaché et al 2002 management operations within the model were defined based on practices observed in several watersheds within the study region therefore they are an approximation for common practices in the region the management operations assigned in the model may not represent the full range of practices that are possible a common approach in watershed management is ranking fields cells or sub catchments based on annual average load produced per unit area to facilitate the identification of areas most vulnerable to nutrient and sediment loss these areas can then be targeted within a non point source pollution reduction management strategy in addition to changes to results at the watershed s outlet crop conversions can also influence where in the watershed conservation resources should be allocated fig 13 sub catchments originally ranked as low load producing areas green color in fig 13 in one scenario could potentially be ranked high in another scenario red color in fig 13 these ranking changes are the result of crop conversions between scenarios however in this watershed farm management practices play an important role in sediment load generation watersheds with complex topography i e containing fields with a wide range of slopes may not see the effect of management in the ranking of sediment producing fields fields with moderate to high slopes will be ranked high mostly due to topography in this region with predominant flat topography ranking of cells is significantly influenced by crop selection and respective in field management and therefore any efforts designed to develop conservation practices should depend on accurate characterization of farming practices in time and space 4 conclusions the mississippi river alluvial floodplain is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the united states and the upper sunflower river usr watershed is a significant portion of this region from 2001 to 2015 land use patterns have changed with watershed percentages of corn and soybean cropland increasing from 0 19 to 4 55 and from 17 21 to 65 01 respectively and with cotton declining from 49 74 to 5 56 meanwhile irrigation has become a more common practice at the landscape level with 43 of the watershed irrigated in 2015 up from 26 in 2001 this study quantified the effects of these crop conversions and increased irrigation on runoff and sediment load existing farming conditions were dynamically characterized in space and time by overlaying annual average crop yield at the county scale annual irrigation at the field scale and annual land use at the field scale to develop 3143 unique 15 year crop rotations the annagnps simulation was calibrated and validated for runoff at the monthly time step with nse values of 0 61 and 0 68 respectively the annagnps simulation representing existing conditions was contrasted with alternative scenarios of varying irrigation and land use conditions i e crop rotations observed trends indicated crop conversion towards corn soybean with increased irrigation adoption simulations considering an increase in irrigated area with existing land use suggest potential changes to runoff derived streamflow at the watershed outlet mainly when considering months during the growing season at the monthly time scale simulation results for the months of june july and august indicate a 15 average annual pd increase in streamflow this is a conservative estimate due to field based uncertainties in irrigation scheduling and amounts and how these practices were modeled lower irrigation amounts were simulated during wet years significant short term increases in runoff derived discharge at the outlet resulted from increased irrigation for example in a single month irrigation can represent approximately 13 of the total water balance input estimated value from existing conditions simulation for june 2006 and in the following month approximately 27 of the water input conversely simulations considering future trends in crop conversion to corn soybean production indicates a potential reduction in average annual sediment loads for clay and silt to 4 6 mg ha and 0 41 mg ha from 5 5 mg ha and 0 44 mg ha respectively under existing conditions attributed primarily to modern farming practices when adopting a new crop uncertainties in this study arise from complex interactions between sub surface flow processes and surface water systems due to aquifer lowering and or recharge which are not captured in the annagnps model and irrigation amounts and timings uncertainties in streamflow were addressed by adjusting curve numbers estimating runoff from the landscape future investigations linking surface and sub surface observations modeling will support understanding of how trends in crop conversions impact aquifer water quantity furthermore only land use and management factors were considered and the contribution of climatic variations on the hydrology and water quality dynamics should also be investigated acknowledgement this work is supported by non land grant colleges of agriculture nlgca

11093,the mississippi river alluvial floodplain is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the united states in recent decades factors of economic forces and government policies have driven crop selection and respective farming management changes in this region this study quantified the effects of changes in crop conversion and farming management practices to discharge and sediment loads in the upper sunflower river watershed farming and climate conditions were dynamically characterized in space and time by integrating annual crop yield at the county scale annual crop irrigation in the field scale and an enhanced description of precipitation this information was used as input into the annualized agricultural non point source annagnps watershed pollution model to describe existing conditions and simulate alternative scenarios simulations considering high irrigation adoption indicated 15 average annual percent change increase in short term flow during the months of june july and august at the outlet conversely simulations considering future trends in crop conversion to corn soybean production indicates a potential reduction in average annual sediment loads for clay and silt respectively to 4 6 mg ha and 0 41 mg ha from 5 5 mg ha and 0 44 mg ha for existing conditions as irrigation increases and crop production continues to shift towards corn soybeans these findings support the development of responsible irrigation management strategies designed for efficient water usage coupled with implementation of in field conservation practices for reduced sediment

increased corn production wallander et al 2011 since 2009 in addition to spatial expansion in traditional corn producing states corn has replaced traditional crops such as cotton in southern states and it is being grown in areas not previously used for row crops in northern states wallander et al 2011 wright and wimberly 2013 increased production has also been achieved by advances in genetic technology and changes in farming management practices such as multi crop rotations often soybean and implementation of irrigation pesticide and fertilizer practices this rapid crop conversion has

growth or a corn corn soybean rotation within the upper mississippi river basin 48 950 775 ha findings have indicated a correlation between increased corn production and high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus additionally results from the secchi et al 2011 study have demonstrated the potential for increases in fertilizer and pesticide use to reduce water quality in the region and also downstream in the mississippi river similarly parajuli et al 2013 studied the impact of crop rotations and tillage on crop and sediment yield in big sunflower river watershed 1 048 800 ha within the delta region using the swat model findings from this work indicate a significant reduction of sediment loads through implementation of crop rotations and reduced no tillage management however in both of these regional studies farming management is assumed to be either static repeated yearly management for the duration of the simulation or pseudo static few years of crop rotation repeated for the duration of the simulation this assumption is required for simplified representation of existing conditions within models simulating physical processes at these large scales this research program seeks to quantify the impact of crop conversion and associated farming management changes to flow and sediment loads in the mississippi delta region based on enhanced spatial and temporal characterization of farming practices and crop rotations specifically the objectives of this study are as follows 1 development of methods for improved characterization of farming management in time and space and integration with u s department of agriculture usda developed watershed scale modeling technologies 2 quantification of relationships between water sediment loads and trends in land use change and irrigation adoption observed within the region and 3 estimation of future non point source pollution trends based on results from alternative scenarios analysis in general this research seeks to determine the implications for runoff and sediment loads in the upper sunflower river usr watershed if increases in corn soy rotations and irrigation adoption trends continue into the future 2 methods 2 1 upper sunflower river watershed the usr watershed is located in the alluvial valley and floodplain of the mississippi river within the lower mississippi river basin shaded area in inset map of fig 1 which is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the united states particularly for rice cotton corn and soybean production the usr watershed encompasses 188 549 ha with the outlet defined at the u s geological survey gauging station 7 288 500 at sunflower ms the watershed spans three counties in northern mississippi coahoma bolivar and sunflower fig 1 the natural topography is flat with row crop fields being further precision graded for improved irrigation efficiency elevation ranges from 26 m to 65 m with an average elevation of 46 m above mean sea level for the entire watershed despite the flat topography soil erosion by surface runoff has been observed during spring and fall months when precipitation intensities and amounts are the highest and the soil surface is unprotected by vegetative cover murphree and mcgregor 1991 average annual precipitation between 1970 and 2016 in the watershed is 1321 mm with average minimum and maximum temperatures of 17 c and 29 c respectively during the active growing season the combination of warm temperatures with high air humidity makes the use of pesticides to control weeds and insects an important component of row crop farming management locke et al 2008 mcdowell et al 1984 anthropogenic modifications to the delta s landscape include clearing of natural riparian vegetation channelization of streams and development of large flood control structures along the mississippi river faulkner et al 2011 additionally large flood control reservoirs were built in the 1940s to protect this region from runoff in the uplands of the basin although none of these structures are located in the study watershed these landscape changes coupled with a long growing season fertile floodplain soils and access to the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer have contributed to the agricultural productivity in the delta region barlow and coupe 2014 specifically within the usr watershed agricultural land use land cover alone comprises 94 of the watershed of the farm land in production corn and soybeans are the dominant row crops produced having replaced legacy crops such as cotton fig 2 another anthropogenic driver of agricultural productivity in the delta region is the significant increase of crop irrigation made possible by pumping water from the shallow mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer this trend can be observed in the number of active irrigation well permits within the usr watershed fig 3 a in the delta region increased irrigation is of great concern given declining water tables and reduction of base flow in streams which the sunflower river has experienced kebede et al 2014 2 2 description of the annualized agriculture non point source pollution model the usda has developed the annualized agricultural non point source annagnps watershed pollution model through a partnership between the agricultural research service research branch and the natural resource conservation service applied branch the annagnps model was developed to quantitatively evaluate the long term effect of farming and conservation practices on non point source pollutants in un gauged agricultural watersheds the model has capabilities to support the selection and spatial location of best management practices to evaluate the efficiency of individual practices locally where they are implemented track pollutants from their source as they move through the system and more importantly their inter related effect to the overall watershed pollutant loads momm et al 2016 watersheds are sub divided into two basic modeling units concentrated flow referred to as reaches and sub catchments referred to as cells which can be characterized using topographic analysis techniques based on geographic information systems gis methods or manually annagnps cells are hierarchically connected by annagnps reaches depicting surface and shallow subsurface flow throughout the watershed runoff sediment and pollutants transported out from cells are routed through the reaches while accounting for the inter relation between upland and channel hydrological and pollutant transport processes the annagnps model performs long term continuous simulations of mixed land use watersheds on a daily time step to model management practice impacts on runoff and sediment nutrient pesticide detachment transportation and deposition bingner and theurer 2001 the hydrology of the watershed is based on a daily water balance considering surface runoff evapotranspiration et and percolation of water through the soil profile yuan et al 2006 runoff is estimated using the runoff curve number cn method usda 1985 et using the dual crop coefficient procedure based on the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and soil percolation using the brooks corey method based on hydraulic conductivity bisantino et al 2013 detachment transportation and deposition of sediment and attached and dissolved chemicals are determined using an integrated approach landscape erosion processes are calculated using the revised universal soil loss equation rusle for estimation of sheet and rill erosion while accounting for land cover and farming management practices renard et al 1997 the delivery of multiple particle sizes of eroded sediments to concentrated flow is calculated using the hydro geomorphic universal soil loss equation husle theurer and clarke 1991 an important characteristic of the annagnps model is the capability of describing farming practices on a daily basis this is accomplished by the development of databases representing unique farming management schedules and respective farming operations these databases provide the means to estimate crop growth canopy cover root mass fall height and soil disturbance by farming equipment additionally the annagnps model contains components to characterize ephemeral gully emergence evolution and erosion rates at scales smaller than sub catchments and components to estimate the effects of conservation practices such as riparian vegetated filters and sediment retention wetlands momm et al 2012 2014 2016 2 3 input database development a geospatial database was developed describing historical climate topography soils and agricultural practices for the usr watershed in preparation for annagnps input database development 2 3 1 watershed definition topographic information was assembled from lidar irregular point clouds collected during 2009 2010 by the u s army corps of engineers usace in the mississippi delta phase 2 project and downloaded from the mississippi automated resource information system maris website http www maris state ms us accessed on january 2017 tiled point clouds were merged into a single file interpolated into a 1 m raster grid file based on classified bare ground points and resampled into a 10 m digital elevation model detailed hydrologic analysis was performed to correct for elevation artifacts produced by embedded drainage structures such as culverts and bridges an iterative approach was used to compare the produced channel network with the published u s geological survey national hydrological dataset and high resolution aerial photographs terrain analysis was performed using the agnps gis topographic analysis tool topagnps for dem preprocessing pit filling standard terrain analysis hydrographic sub catchment delineation and drainage network generation garbrecht et al 2000 the watershed was subdivided into 3992 annagnps cells sub catchments and 1602 annagnps reaches concentrated flow based on the threshold values of 64 ha for critical source area and 260 m for minimum source channel length these threshold values were obtained through an iterative gis based approach in which discretized watershed alternatives were quantitatively compared to land use information 2 3 2 climate climate data for dates between january 1 1970 and december 31 2015 were obtained from the u s national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa global historical climatology network daily https www ncdc noaa gov ghcn daily description and the u s natural resources conservation service nrcs scan sites https www wcc nrcs usda gov scan datasets for climate observation stations located within and around the study area fig 4 seven climate stations in total were selected based on their proximity to the watershed and data temporal extent to represent climatic conditions at the study site large filled circles in fig 4 these seven climate stations were defined within the annagnps model as default climate stations daily precipitation mm as well as maximum and minimum temperature c were utilized for each of the seven selected climate observation stations an annagnps input climate file was created containing the daily weather data reported at that station daily weekly and monthly gaps in data coverage were observed in these seven climate files missing weather records at these stations were filled with data using a nearest neighbor approach from supplementary climate observation stations within a 30 km distance buffer see small red circle from noaa and large unfilled purple circle from nrcs supplementary stations in fig 4 dew point c sky cover wind speed ms 1 and solar radiation wm 2 were generated using the generation of weather elements for multiple applications gem model which utilizes local historical climate data and long term statistical parameters to produce daily climate data hanson et al 1996 johnson et al 1996 hanson and johnson 1998 each sub catchment annagnps cell was assigned to a climate station identifier based on its spatial proximity to the nearest climate station fig 5 a the seven selected climate stations were converted to thiessen polygons to determine their zones of influence the annagnps cell gis layer was overlaid with the thiessen polygons and each annagnps cell was then assigned to a climate station using gis based intersection analysis 2 3 3 soil soil data was gathered from the nrcs website https websoilsurvey sc egov usda gov accessed on december 2016 these datasets were used to develop annagnps soil databases a unique soil type was assigned to each annagnps cell based on gis standard overlay and intersection procedures a total of 64 unique soil types were considered fig 5b 2 3 4 irrigation spatial and temporal quantification of irrigation management practices were estimated based on well irrigation permits over time fig 3a registered wells represented as point features in gis layers were linked to temporal databases of irrigation permits the point feature class was dynamic representing the year to year variability in active irrigation permits ymd 2017 these selected points were spatially joined to agricultural individual field parcel boundaries digitized polygons based on multi year aerial photographs and converted to raster grids this analysis yielded annual raster grid files from 2001 to 2015 containing agricultural fields with active irrigation well permits irrigation raster grids were combined with watershed sub division information on an annual basis to assign each annagnps cell an irrigation flag the resulting database containing individual annagnps cells and respective years of irrigation was created through a custom computer program that automated the process no information was publicly available on the amount and timing of water pumped from each well so a standard irrigation strategy was adopted for the entire watershed many producers in the delta region still use a subjective irrigation scheduling method based on visually observing crop conditions kebede et al 2014 this irrigation approach was simulated with the annagnps model using the water balance automated irrigation method by determining daily soil moisture levels daily estimates of surface water flux based on inputs of precipitation and irrigation and outputs of surface runoff et and soil infiltration were used to determine whether an individual field annagnps cell is irrigated the irrigation strategy adopted was based on documented delta region averages massey et al 2017 the irrigation season in this region is from june to august with a varying end date for each crop the irrigation season ending dates adopted were july 15 july 31 and august 15 for corn rice and cotton soybeans respectively open furrow application is the most common irrigation method massey et al 2017 and therefore the selected methodology simulated with the annagnps model a uniform application of 76 2 mm 24 h was adopted 2 3 5 land cover land use and management characterization of land use land cover and respective farming management at the field scale was accomplished through intersecting i annual land use land cover at field scale provided by the cropland data layer cdl ii annual well irrigation permit layers at the field scale iii annual average crop yield at the county scale and iv a one year farming management schedule and operations for individual crops annual land cover land use information between 2001 and 2015 was acquired from the u s department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service cdl as raster grid files boryan et al 2011a b a zonal majority gis analysis was performed to determine the primary land use for each sub catchment for each year fig 6 this analysis generated a 15 year sequence of land cover land use for each annagnps cell for example annagnps cell 531 was assigned the following land cover land use sequence from 2001 to 2015 co co co co co co co c s c wws c s s and s where co represents cotton s soybeans wws soybeans followed by winter wheat and c corn the sequence of land cover land use were combined with the irrigation database and revised accordingly for example for annagnps cell 531 the revised sequence based on irrigation information was co co co co co co co c s ci wwsi ci si si and si the addition of the character i to each code indicates the presence of one or more irrigation well with an active permit from 2010 to 2015 farm management in annagnps is represented by management schedules as a temporal series of in field actions table 3 farm management schedules contain a continuous sequence of activities from all years of the simulation which in this study is from 2001 to 2015 single year farm management templates for key crops were developed based on combined information from the rusle2 database for u s department of agriculture defined crop management zone 69 usda 2017 previous annagnps simulations of similar watersheds in the region yasarer et al 2017 that used historical farming practices that were representative in this region during this period a total of 15 one year farm management templates were considered two non crop forest grassland and 11 crops irrigated and non irrigated the annagnps farming management data section was generated through a custom python script that integrated the revised sequence of land cover land use individual one year management templates temporally variable crop yield and spatio temporal irrigation information 2 4 model calibration and validation to account for uncertainties regarding irrigation amount and timing the amount of surface water artificially ponded during winter months for recreation and stream base flow variations the annagnps model was calibrated and validated using observed streamflow from a stream gauge located at the outlet of the watershed fig 1 total monthly streamflow during the simulation period ranged from 2 62 106 mg to 3 17 108 mg and averaged 7 77 107 mg ground water contribution to streamflow was not modeled and therefore base flow was removed from observed daily streamflow using monthly totals annual base flow estimates ranged from 21 in 2006 to 38 in 2010 with an annual average of 28 of the total flow the lynne hollick filter method was used to remove base flow implemented in the r hydrostats package lyne and hollick 1979 the calibration period was defined as october 2002 beginning of observed streamflow data to december 2008 and the validation period included the latter half of the simulation period january 2009 to december 2015 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias coefficient of determination ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr were calculated between simulated and observed total monthly runoff generated streamflow for each simulation period of the calibration and validation datasets moriasi et al 2007 after improving spatio temporal characterization of precipitation distribution in the watershed fig 5a the model was further calibrated by adjusting the runoff curve number cn values chahor et al 2014 a runoff curve number is an empirical value which estimates the amount of runoff for a surface based on the surface soil cover type and hydrologic condition usda 1986 an iterative approach was used to generate subsequent calibration simulations in which curve numbers were uniformly decreased by 2 increments from the initial values suggested by usda page 2 6 and 2 7 usda 1986 from zero to 24 total increment statistical values were calculated for each calibration simulation optimal results were achieved with a widespread 16 reduction in the curve number step three in table 1 although the selection of runoff curve number values in the third iteration has significantly improved the accuracy of statistical values the remaining discrepancies between simulated and observed monthly streamflow appeared to be related to a few peak events overestimation of streamflow during these peak events was attributed to the process of filling gaps within selected climate stations based on nearby supplementary climate stations fig 4 further scrutiny of large precipitation events at contributing stations was performed analysis of map based time series of precipitation events allowed simulation of the spatial movement of storms in time helping to determine whether individual events affected the watershed these adjustments to the selected climate files resulted in significant improvements in model performance fig 7 and step four in table 1 limited sediment load measurements were available for this watershed there were only 35 discrete measurements of suspended sediment at the gauge station located at the watershed s outlet there were many gaps between the measurements sometimes up to several months which limited efforts to investigate trends and to compare observed and simulated sediment values on a monthly time scale observed suspended sediment values were converted from an instantaneous suspended sediment concentration to a total daily suspended sediment load based on measured daily flow a detailed analysis comparing observed and simulated sediment loads was not possible given the uncertainty involved in converting instantaneous measurements into a daily total the small number of measurements 35 total and their lack of temporal resolution fig 8 instead annagnps input parameters controlling sediment loads were set based on previous simulations in the region yasarer et al 2017 yasarer et al 2018 yuan et al 2001 2008 nonetheless the simulation depicting existing conditions characterizes the general trend in suspended sediment load at the outlet fig 8 2 5 development of alternative scenarios the annagnps simulation calibrated and validated to observed values describing existing conditions in the usr watershed was considered as the base scenario to investigate the impact of crop conversion on sediment loads and discharge five 5 hypothetical alternative scenarios were devised scenario a considered existing land use land cover conditions but assumed that all agricultural fields were irrigated for all years of the simulation period conversely scenario b represented existing land use land cover but no irrigation these two scenarios were contrasted with the base scenario to evaluate the impact of irrigation on runoff patterns the other alternative scenarios were devised to evaluate the contribution of management practices to hydrological patterns and resulting sediment load alternative scenario c assumed a modified version of the 2001 land management in this scenario fields assigned to corn and soybeans in 2001 were converted to cotton and this modified 2001 land management was repeated from 2002 to 2015 no irrigation practices were adopted this simulation was designed to represent a hypothetical scenario in which no corn soybean crops and respective management practices were introduced in this watershed similarly in alternative scenario d fields assigned to cotton corn and soybeans in 2001 were converted into grass fields referred to as conservation reserve program crp with no irrigation practices this alternative assumes one extreme in which producers are participating in government sponsored conservation practices the final alternative scenario e considered a modified version of the 2015 land use land cover conditions all fields assigned to crp and cotton were converted into corn and soybean crops with irrigation practices this year was repeated for the duration of the simulation 2001 2015 this hypothetical alternative scenario sought to represent an extrapolation of existing crop conversion trends to future years quantitative comparisons between runoff and sediment load on a monthly time scale were considered using percent difference pd eq 1 non parametric correlation analysis and statistical analysis of means 1 p d c h a n g e r e f e r e n c e c h a n g e r e f e r e n c e 2 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of existing conditions during the 15 years evaluated the percent total watershed area used for corn production increased from 0 19 to 4 55 soybean production increased from 17 21 to 65 01 fig 3b and cotton production decreased from 49 74 to 5 56 agricultural fields with active irrigation well permits increased from 26 of the total watershed area 49 023 ha in 2001 to 43 81 076 ha in 2015 with an average increase rate of 20 per year ymd 2017 similarly average yield increased by 37 and 35 for soybean and corn respectively nass 2017 these temporal spatial changes in crop selection irrigation adoption and crop yield were characterized through the development of 3143 unique 15 year crop rotations linked to 3992 sub catchments 3 2 calibration and validation uncertainties in historical streamflow arose from lack of information on amount and timing of irrigation practices location and amount of surface water impounded during winter months and unknown infiltrated runoff ratio amounts in space and time these uncertainties were accounted for using adjustments of the runoff curve number streamflow calibration from 2002 to 2008 improved monthly nse values from 0 76 to 0 61 and pbias from 67 2 to 8 3 monthly validation statistics from 2009 to 2016 also improved with nse values from 0 38 uncalibrated to 0 68 when calibrated similarly monthly validation pbias decreased from 99 2 to 8 60 when calibrated table 1 shows the improvement in calibration and validation statistics with various model input and parameter adjustments even after adjustments to precipitation data there were three months during the calibration years may 2003 february 2004 and december 2004 which had high volumes of observed flow at the outlet while no precipitation event was recorded by any of the 78 climate stations fig 8 this led to underestimation of streamflow during these months and likely contributes to the overall negative pbias result during the monthly calibration period 3 3 water balance one important characteristic resulting from crop conversion in this region is the accompanying adoption of irrigation practices there was a constant annual increase in agricultural fields with active irrigation well permits fig 3a ymd 2017 this increase in irrigation was described in the existing conditions simulation when irrigation went from 23 of the total watershed area irrigated in 2001 to 43 in 2015 line with circle symbols in fig 9 a this simulation was contrasted to two alternative scenarios scenario a with approximately 80 of the total watershed area irrigated throughout the simulation period line with square symbols in fig 9a and scenario b with approximately less than 5 of the total watershed area irrigated throughout the simulation period representing irrigation applied to rice fields only line with triangle symbols in fig 9a the simulated total irrigation water applied for the entire watershed area and simulation period was 184 mm mean 12 3 and std 10 1 419 mm mean 27 91 and std 24 00 and 29 mm mean 1 9 and std 2 6 for existing conditions and scenarios a and b respectively because the irrigation schedule adopted was the soil water storage capacity method irrigation application varied from year to year based on climatic conditions fig 9b for example in 2002 a total of 170 mm of precipitation was recorded during the irrigation season for the entire watershed area june july and august yielding estimates of applied irrigation of 24 mm 82 mm and 7 mm for existing conditions and scenarios a and b respectively using existing conditions as reference a pd of 108 for scenario a and 110 for scenario b demonstrates the disparity between the scenarios conversely in 2004 total precipitation for the watershed was 282 mm during the irrigation season yielding estimates of applied irrigation of 2 mm 6 mm pd 112 and 0 06 mm pd 185 for existing conditions and scenarios a and b respectively changes in irrigation practices caused small changes in et which were only apparent in years with reduced precipitation fig 9c in 2002 reduced precipitation resulted in increased irrigation during the growing season months and estimates of total et for the watershed area during these months was 194 mm for existing conditions and 210 mm pd 9 and 188 mm pd 11 for scenarios a and b respectively considering only the irrigation season for all years simulated the trend line slopes of 64 72 and 58 for existing conditions and scenarios a and b respectively indicate differences in long term irrigation contributions to surface flow fig 9d although the irrigation rates per unit area see example for july in fig 9e were assumed constant converting estimates of irrigation rates to volumes demonstrate the potential impact of irrigation to the overall watershed water balance fig 9f for example in july 2002 estimates of total irrigation volumes are 2152 10 000 m3 7096 10 000 m3 and 722 10 000 m3 for scenarios existing conditions a and b respectively as expected the effect of irrigation was observed during the crop growing season since the only difference between these three simulations is the annual percent of irrigated area in those months the adoption of irrigation or the lack of it can influence runoff derived discharge at the outlet significantly results from scenario a provided an assessment of increased irrigated area extrapolation of the existing trend into the future fig 9a in the delta region only 28 of the total precipitation is estimated to occur during the growing season snipes et al 2005 thus irrigation practices are needed to maintain crop productivity depending on the precipitation pattern in a specific year irrigation can also become a significant component of the water balance inputs and outputs during these months for example in june of 2005 the total precipitation for the watershed was approximately 32 mm and irrigation was estimated to account for 29 13 mm 47 28 mm and 11 4 mm of the total water input for existing conditions scenario a and scenario b respectively changes in land use had a small effect on estimated annual runoff two alternative scenarios c and d both with no irrigation but each with a different selection of crops were contrasted in scenario c fields assigned to corn and soybeans were converted to cotton and in scenario d fields assigned to corn soybeans and cotton were converted to grass simulating crp the watershed average annual runoff was estimated as 347 mm and 382 mm for scenarios c and d respectively table 2 average monthly runoff for scenarios existing condition c and d are depicted in fig 10 a runoff at the watershed s gauging stations was slightly smaller for scenario c than existing conditions with higher differences during the growing season fig 10b increasing crp adoption indicated on average smaller runoff throughout the year but slightly smaller differences between cotton and crp from april to october fig 10b the differences in runoff were attributed to the longer growing period of grasses compared to row crops which are modeled using different runoff curve numbers to characterize their differences in surface roughness soil physical conditions surface cover type and hydrologic behavior 3 4 sediment load because the focus of this study was on sediment loads produced in agricultural fields by sheet and rill erosion fields only estimates of suspended sediment loads for clay and silt particle sizes were analyzed as expected the adoption of crp significantly reduced the amount of sediment loads leaving fields and reaching the watershed gauge the annual average suspended sediment load for existing conditions is 5 5 mg ha for clay and 0 38 mg ha for silt and these estimates are significantly reduced to 0 37 mg ha and 0 03 mg ha respectively for scenario d on a monthly scale this reduction represents an average pd reduction greater than 130 fig 11 although this is not a realistic scenario this can signify the potential that conservation practices have as a water quality mitigation strategy yasarer et al 2016 conversely in scenario c cotton was simulated as the principal crop grown in the region in the management database corn soybean fields were converted to cotton this scenario was intended to represent conditions where no conversion to corn soybean was implemented under scenario c annual averages have increased to 7 3 mg ha for clay particles but remained the same for silt table 2 average monthly estimates of suspended sediment of clay particle sizes indicated a small pd change of estimates from january to june within 20 with significant changes from july to november 50 fig 11b a similar pattern but with higher changes in a shorter period of time was observed for silt size particles fig 11c and d simulation results indicate a potential increase in suspended sediment loads by continued cotton production scenario e simulated an alternative in which land use assigned to crp and cotton were converted into rotations of corn and soybeans under this scenario the annual average suspended sediment yield was 4 51 mg ha for clay and 0 35 mg ha for silt this is a small reduction when compared to existing conditions but a large reduction from estimates produced by scenario c similar to scenario c the largest differences occurred during the growing season under scenario e the largest pds were found to be from july to october with the greatest differences in october fig 11b and d the main difference in sediment load patterns between existing conditions and scenarios c and e is the timing to sediment loads to peak for example for scenario e the main pd for clay sized particles was from july to november 50 pd while for silt size particles there was a pd swale in october 100 pd in fig 11d indicating a decrease when compared to existing conditions this could be attributed to farming practices employed during cotton cultivation overall trends for all years were also evaluated through calculation of annual average mass per unit area and expressed as ranked ratios of the total watershed annual average fig 12 the conversion of crp and cotton into corn and soybean rotations scenario e generated an average reduction in sediment load of approximately 13 at 100 of area from 78 7 under existing conditions to 65 4 for scenario e conversely alternative scenario c which simulated cotton over corn soybean generated an annual average increase of 23 when compared to existing conditions from 78 7 to 100 under existing conditions 20 of the watershed contributed to 47 of total sediment load while alternative scenarios c and e contributed to 67 and 40 respectively the reduction of total sediment production when converting cotton into corn soybeans can be attributed to the introduction of modern farming practices when migrating from one crop to another secchi et al 2011 corn and soybeans are often produced with either no till or reduced tillage operations with high plant seeding density for efficient furrow irrigation practices soybeans can be economically produced with reduced or no tillage due to glyphosate resistant soybean seeds that allow for widespread application of herbicides gianessi 2005 all of these management operations tend to reduce field erosion by sheet and rill physical processes as a result of reduced soil disturbance of the soil by farming equipment increased crop residue increased soil health by adoption of multi crop rotations and reduced et wu et al 2010 vaché et al 2002 management operations within the model were defined based on practices observed in several watersheds within the study region therefore they are an approximation for common practices in the region the management operations assigned in the model may not represent the full range of practices that are possible a common approach in watershed management is ranking fields cells or sub catchments based on annual average load produced per unit area to facilitate the identification of areas most vulnerable to nutrient and sediment loss these areas can then be targeted within a non point source pollution reduction management strategy in addition to changes to results at the watershed s outlet crop conversions can also influence where in the watershed conservation resources should be allocated fig 13 sub catchments originally ranked as low load producing areas green color in fig 13 in one scenario could potentially be ranked high in another scenario red color in fig 13 these ranking changes are the result of crop conversions between scenarios however in this watershed farm management practices play an important role in sediment load generation watersheds with complex topography i e containing fields with a wide range of slopes may not see the effect of management in the ranking of sediment producing fields fields with moderate to high slopes will be ranked high mostly due to topography in this region with predominant flat topography ranking of cells is significantly influenced by crop selection and respective in field management and therefore any efforts designed to develop conservation practices should depend on accurate characterization of farming practices in time and space 4 conclusions the mississippi river alluvial floodplain is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the united states and the upper sunflower river usr watershed is a significant portion of this region from 2001 to 2015 land use patterns have changed with watershed percentages of corn and soybean cropland increasing from 0 19 to 4 55 and from 17 21 to 65 01 respectively and with cotton declining from 49 74 to 5 56 meanwhile irrigation has become a more common practice at the landscape level with 43 of the watershed irrigated in 2015 up from 26 in 2001 this study quantified the effects of these crop conversions and increased irrigation on runoff and sediment load existing farming conditions were dynamically characterized in space and time by overlaying annual average crop yield at the county scale annual irrigation at the field scale and annual land use at the field scale to develop 3143 unique 15 year crop rotations the annagnps simulation was calibrated and validated for runoff at the monthly time step with nse values of 0 61 and 0 68 respectively the annagnps simulation representing existing conditions was contrasted with alternative scenarios of varying irrigation and land use conditions i e crop rotations observed trends indicated crop conversion towards corn soybean with increased irrigation adoption simulations considering an increase in irrigated area with existing land use suggest potential changes to runoff derived streamflow at the watershed outlet mainly when considering months during the growing season at the monthly time scale simulation results for the months of june july and august indicate a 15 average annual pd increase in streamflow this is a conservative estimate due to field based uncertainties in irrigation scheduling and amounts and how these practices were modeled lower irrigation amounts were simulated during wet years significant short term increases in runoff derived discharge at the outlet resulted from increased irrigation for example in a single month irrigation can represent approximately 13 of the total water balance input estimated value from existing conditions simulation for june 2006 and in the following month approximately 27 of the water input conversely simulations considering future trends in crop conversion to corn soybean production indicates a potential reduction in average annual sediment loads for clay and silt to 4 6 mg ha and 0 41 mg ha from 5 5 mg ha and 0 44 mg ha respectively under existing conditions attributed primarily to modern farming practices when adopting a new crop uncertainties in this study arise from complex interactions between sub surface flow processes and surface water systems due to aquifer lowering and or recharge which are not captured in the annagnps model and irrigation amounts and timings uncertainties in streamflow were addressed by adjusting curve numbers estimating runoff from the landscape future investigations linking surface

11094,the hydrological and agricultural droughts and their characteristics were evaluated using the standardized streamflow index ssfi and standardized soil moisture index ssi across the konya closed basin kcb in turkey respectively the modified mann kendall mmk trend method was applied to detect trends over the kcb furthermore the teleconnections of various large scale climate indices lsci nao ao pdo scand poleur and ea wr over 3 month ssfi and ssi series were considered through cross wavelet transform xwt technique the analysis indicated an increase in drought duration and severity since 1999 the mmk test revealed significant negative trends for ssfi series at different time scales a series of mmk test on different ssi series exhibited trendless behavior over the northern parts of the kcb however significant negative positive trend on southeastern southwestern area appeared to be prevailing moreover the results of xwt analysis in association with different lsci and ssfi ssi series demonstrated multiple considerable common powers on lower periods i e less than 8 month the xwt analysis showed significant relationship between the lsci with drought indices in some periods and the absence of such associations in the remaining period keywords non parametric drought indices modified mann kendall large scale climate indices cross wavelet transform turkey 1 introduction the increasing greenhouse gases emissions have led to climate warming becoming the top environmental issue in the 21st century it is widely accepted that global warming is leading to a temperature and evapotranspiration increase which represent a basic element of the hydrologic cycle jhajharia et al 2012 drought is a recurrent natural hazard which may occur in any climatic region the effects of drought are not only limited to regional water crises but may lead to significant social economic and environmental consequences generally droughts are classified into four groups including meteorological hydrological agricultural and socio economic which are representing a specific and or group of drought indicators wilhite 2000 the shortage in the received amount of precipitation over a specific period compared to the long term average is defined as meteorological drought the reduction in surface or groundwater resources usually river flows available surface subsurface water is a key characteristic of hydrological drought tallaksen and van lanen 2004 hydrological drought is generally related to meteorological drought as it shares similar varying recurrence intervals as a consequence of hydrological droughts insufficient water supplies poor water quality and limited water for irrigation purposes all causing crop failure could adversely impact a number of economic and social activities mishra and singh 2010 vicente serrano et al 2012 the deficits in soil s water content result in agricultural drought which is eventually linked to the different features of meteorological drought in addition agricultural drought shows the persistence of drought more reliably mo 2011 hao and aghakouchak 2013 in the concern of agricultural drought the amount of water humidity existing at the plants roots is much important for plants compared to annual precipitation drought involved sectors require reliable information to react timely against the unfavorable effects of drought in the context of climate change several surveys recently appeared and combined concerns continue to dictate at different stages of governance in many societies it is evident that the most of current efforts have been focusing on large or country scaled drought observations however hydrological and storage information at a basin scale is needed for the comprehensive and precise decision making process bachmair et al 2015 stated that current drought monitoring skills may be inappropriate and drought indicators and thresholds need to be selected at smaller scales since most appropriate indicators and thresholds are extremely variable in a spatial sense from the standpoint of the water cycle they also asserted catchment scale as the most adequate measure in the same context van loon and lahaa 2015 pointed out the crucial symbol of storages in soil lakes aquifers etc which could influence drought duration and severity having this specific inspiration together with the importance of drought events in a semi arid region in the water resources management it would be contributing to investigate hydrological and agricultural drought characteristics at the catchment scale exposed to semi arid climate conditions afterwards we were motivated to concentrate on konya closed basin kcb in tukey which is a big size catchment located in mid latitude and having semi arid climate characteristics the substantial uncertainty in precipitation quantity which is a key climatic characteristic of the eastern mediterranean region consequently raise the concerns with drought in turkey this uncertainty comes from different reasons for instance anticyclones from southern latitudes dominate particularly during summers and result in long lasting dry and stable weather conditions over turkey with the exception of the northern coasts and northeastern parts furthermore the atmospheric blocking caused by the dominance of subtropical high pressure system could set back the cyclonic activities over the region throughout the year agricultural sectors require the largest water consumption all over turkey kcb at the level of 74 88 water withdrawals according to an unpublished report by turkey s ministry of forest and water management more than 55 over 2 7 million hectare of kcb are classified as agricultural lands therefore the hydro climatological state of kcb becomes highly important for the region s ecosystem which is extra motivation for us to select this area in addition overexploitation of groundwater for agricultural purposes has led to drying circumstances in several lakes and wetlands for instance the water volume of lake tuz second largest lake in turkey and hosting thousands of flamingos every year was severely diminished consequently the negative water balance is linked to excessive groundwater exploitation which constitutes a serious problem in central anatolia especially in the kcb an approximate well numbers is 100 000 currently being used over the basin however a number of 65 000 wells have been documented illegal i̇şçioğlu 2008 moreover üstün et al 2015 declared a downward motion with a rate of 34 mm year in central to eastern parts during the period of 2002 2009 reporting the land subsidence in the kcb it is convincing that the magnitude of subsidence is exacerbated during the droughts when farmers rely heavily on groundwater to sustain in one of the most productive agricultural regions in turkey trend analysis assessment has been one of the most popular topics in hydrology science and climate communities the mann kendall mk mann 1945 kendall 1975 nonparametric trend test endorsed by world meteorological organization is the most commonly used method in trend recognizing on different hydro climatic variables numerous investigators have applied the mk method to different hydrologic and climatological series in turkey e g kahya and kalayci 2004 partal and kahya 2006 unal et al 2012 asikoglu and ciftlik 2015 although some studies concerned trend analysis of different hydro climatic variables in turkey şarlak et al 2009 kahya 2011 no study has focused on hydrological and agricultural drought indices at the basin scale in addition advanced understanding of the spatial and temporal conjunctions between the large scale climate indices lsci and the variations of hydrological and agricultural drought indices can enhance the science of management in water resources systems the majority of previous studies applied the conventional correlation analysis to evaluate the lsci phenomena on different hydro climatologic variables or drought indices for instance the role of various lsci such as north atlantic oscillation nao and arctic oscillation ao over turkish hydro climatologic variables were evaluated by different studies e g karabörk and kahya 2003 türkeş and erlat 2003 karabörk et al 2005 sousa et al 2011 however no study appeared to reveal the probable teleconnections of scandinavian polar eurasia and eastern atlantic western russia patterns with hydrological and agricultural drought indices over turkey accordingly the use of spectral based methods such as wavelet transform wt techniques could improve the latent associations between a pair of time series grinsted et al 2004 recently the use of wt technique has raised attentions among hydrologists küçük et al 2009 yu and lin 2015 tan et al 2016 chen et al 2018 the wt breaks down data into time and frequency space and detects the dominant variability and associated variation which is robust in nonstationary signals tan et al 2016 yu and lin 2015 explained the decomposition of a given time series through a tiny wave to detect the clustered frequency at a specific onset they revealed the advantages of this process to recognize the non stationary in a given data although tosunoğlu and kaplan 2018 applied the additive wt on streamflow series on çoruh and euphrates basins in eastern turkey there is no study regarding the use of wavelet transform on drought analysis at the basin scale in turkey furthermore the non stationarity associations between generated drought indices and different lsci was assessed using bivariate wavelet analyses in summary the objectives of this study are to i analyze the features of hydrological and agricultural droughts at different time scales ii discover a possible tempo spatial relationship between the proposed hydrological and agricultural series iii detect possible trends using the modified mann kendall method over the generated series and iv explore a probable role played by different lsci over the variability of drought series using cross wt analysis 2 study area and data 2 1 study area situated in the core of the central anatolia plateau the kcb s altitude varies between approximately 400 m 3400 m fig 1 although the kcb comprises 14 of turkish irrigation lands it only shares 3 of potential turkish water resources the kcb is the fourth largest basin that accounts for nearly 7 of the total precipitation volume in the country the average annual precipitation varies between 300 mm and 2400 mm over the central anatolia to the eastern black sea coast respectively where annual precipitation lower than 350 mm spreads all over a large area of central anatolia in particular over the kcb turkish state meteorological service 2017 the historical average annual precipitation reaches to 330 mm in the central kcb and to 700 mm in the southwestern mountainous parts in general mediterranean climate dominates in the southern kcb with mild and rainy winters and dry and hot summers while the center and northern kcb face with terrestrial climate with cold winters and hot dry summers vazifehkhah and kahya 2017 the southwestern area receives more precipitation compared to the other parts while it decreases in the southwest northeast directions more than three million people live in the kcb including eight cities in 39 districts where 45 of the total population reside in rural parts several lakes in the basin and natural richness host migrant birds the kcb has recently experienced many drought occasions due to the increased temperature and reduced precipitation potentially driven by climate change according to a report by worldwide fund turkish branch 65 of the region s wetlands have recently dried out wwf 2017 2 2 data monthly streamflow data at 10 gauge stations complied by the turkish state hydraulic works tshw 2016 spanning from 1975 to 2014 was used in this study in the stage of data selection those that hold insufficient quality representing seasonal pattern and generally obtain zero values during warm months may september were removed the geographic characteristics of the hydrometric stations are presented in table 1 while the statistical details of streamflow series are given in table 2 in general the stations with higher lower flow rates are located in the southwestern eastern and northern parts the monthly model simulated soil moisture series for twenty eight grids provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 2017a for the same period 1975 2014 were applied in addition some grids that are placed closed to the kcb s border but have similar geographical specifications and might have probable hydrological interactions with the study area were chosen in the grid selection step the grids soil moisture data are distributed on a half degree resolution on lat long directions and fully cover the study area see fig 1 interested readers are referred to fan and van den dool 2004 van den dool 2003 for more information regarding the soil moisture series monthly values of major lsci including north atlantic oscillation nao arctic oscillation ao the pacific decadal oscillation pdo the scandinavian scand the polar eurasia poleur and the eastern atlantic western russia ea wr patterns are obtained from the climatic prediction center of noaa noaa 2017b when a monthly or seasonal index is constructed the time series under consideration can be normalized by the standard deviation of monthly or seasonal averages to form a standardized index therefore each time series of the above mentioned lsci is normalized by the standard deviation of the running 3 month averages to form desired running 3 month indices 2 2 1 the streamflow data preparation it is always advisable to check stationarity of hydro climatic variables wang et al 2009 as a result the stationarity and homogeneity conditions of streamflow series were assessed at the beginning of the main statistical analyses readers are referred to wang et al 2009 for comprehensive information regarding stationarity tests in the field of hydrology the unit root test is one of the effective methods to test the stationarity of time series yuan and bentler 1997 to this end the stationarity of streamflow series was assessed by augmented dickey fuller test cheung and la 1995 our results proved the stationarity of streamflow series details not shown in the same context salas 1980 explained about the inconsistency and non homogeneity that induces the hydrologic features to change in time thus non homogeneity is common in hydrologic variables further three well known homogeneity tests as the pettitt s test pettitt 1979 the standard normal homogeneity test snht given by alexandersson 1986 and the buishand s test driven by buishand 1982 at 0 05 significance level are performed to temporally check the homogeneity of monthly streamflow series the null hypothesis assumes that the monthly streamflow data are classified as a homogenous series the overall results indicate that 22 out of 30 cases 10 stations 3 methods rejected the null hypothesis table 3 the stations that passed two tests 3 13 and 101 are assumed to be as a homogenous series in addition the stations 95 and 100 were shown to be homogenous based on the snht and pettit s test respectively the double mass curve dmc technique is employed to spatially test the consistency of monthly streamflow series and assess their consistency this is a commonly applied procedure to identify hydrological changes caused by anthropogenic activities searcy and hardison 1960 which is the plot of the cumulative values of one variable time series compared to the accumulative values of another associated variable time series on a simultaneous period wang et al 2013 for this purpose the streamflow series were classified into two groups the first consisting of the stations 3 13 95 100 and 101 which are assumed to be homogenous series and comparatively exhibit higher flow rates located in the southwestern region fig 1 region a and the second consisting of the stations 22 28 80 87 and 94 which are distributed on comparatively low precipitation parts fig 1 region b to determine the consistency of streamflow series spatially we examined the plot of cumulative monthly streamflow series at each station versus cumulative monthly streamflow averaged over its corresponding region the results of dmc analysis revealed that the stations 13 100 and 101 located in region a and the station 94 in region b are categorized as consistent series fig 2 those with lower deviations around the curves could be recognized as low consistency even they could be supposed as consistent with considering lower accurateness bras 1990 therefore the remaining stations could be considered as a consistent series with a lower accuracy eventually one can utilize the analyzed streamflow series for different purposes such as generating drought indices and or applying nonparametric trend tests 3 methodology 3 1 the nonparametric drought indices to date the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 is among the most applied meteorological drought indices while the streamflow drought index sdi nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 and standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 are the well known hydrological drought indices the spi and sdi are typically derived by fitting the gamma and lognormal probability distribution functions respectively accordingly several hydrological studies have suggested the lognormal distribution as a suitable fit to streamflow series e g chen et al 2018 shukla and wood 2008 vicente serrano et al 2012 however some recent studies warned errors related to the tails of the applied distribution which may lead to inappropriate results farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 although vazifehkhah and kahya 2018 showed the incapability of various probability distributions in fitting monthly streamflow series for the three stations in the kcb the efficiency of the lognormal distribution on the streamflow series was checked using the kolmogorov smirnov k s test at 95 confidence intervals the results of the k s test indicate the failure of the lognormal as a suitable distribution to monthly and running 6 month streamflow series table 4 except the stations 13 and 28 which have sufficient p values the null hypothesis in the remaining stations were rejected as they follow the lognormal distribution these statistical results indicate the incapability of former parametric hydrological drought indices such as the sdi and sri over the study area on the other hand soil moisture series generally follow normal or beta distribution sheffield et al 2004 carrão et al 2016 although the validity of the above mentioned assumption was checked over the applied soil moisture series statistical details not shown it is decided to use an identical method to derive the hydrological and agricultural drought indices on different time scales to overcome this issue the standardized drought analysis toolbox sdat farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 was applied to derive non parametric standardized drought indices to this end the empirical probability can be calculated using the gringorten plotting position gringorten 1963 as an alternative method 1 p x t i 0 44 n 0 12 where p xt stands for the corresponding empirical probability at month t i shows the rank of non zero input in an ascending format and n denotes the sample size the empirical probabilities estimated above are easily transformed to a standardized index using 2 s i ϕ 1 p where p is probability derived from eq 1 and ϕ is the standard normal distribution function the derived percentiles could be standardized using the common approximations provided by abramowitz and stegun 1965 3 s i c 0 c 1 t c 2 t 2 1 d 1 t d 2 t 2 d 3 t 3 for 0 p x 0 t ln 1 h x 2 s i t c 0 c 1 t c 2 t 2 1 d 1 t d 2 t 2 d 3 t 3 for 0 5 p x 1 t ln 1 1 h x 2 and c0 2 515517 c1 0 802583 c2 0 010328 d1 1 432788 d2 0 189269 d3 0 001308 this algorithm could be used for any variable such as streamflow and or soil moisture series to calculate drought indices golian et al 2014 finally monthly streamflow and soil moisture series were used to generate the respective 3 6 12 and 24 month hydrological so called standardized streamflow index ssfi 3 ssfi 6 ssfi 12 and ssfi 24 and agricultural drought indices so called standardized soil moisture index ssi 3 ssi 6 ssi 12 and ssi 24 respectively the commonly used d scale drought classification proposed by svoboda et al 2002 was here adopted to gain a better visualization of drought severity categories as abnormally dry d0 0 50 to 0 79 moderate drought d1 0 8 to 1 29 severe drought d2 1 3 to 1 59 extreme drought d3 1 6 to 1 99 and exceptional drought d4 2 or less following hao and aghakouchak 2013 and vazifehkhah et al 2019 who suggested 0 8 as a threshold value representing 20th percentile or below of given index the same value is considered denoting the d1 to d4 categories 3 2 the modified mann kendall method the mann kendall mk method preferred by the world meteorological organization is a non parametric method for trend assessment huang et al 2014 hamed and rao 1998 rectified it by eliminating the persistence considering the lag i autocorrelation generally i 1 that could considerably affect the results they also stated that the modified mann kendall mmk method is vigorous in computing trends in hydro climatological series due to the scarcity of place we do not discuss the methodological details here but we can refer readers to kahya and kalayci 2004 and huang et al 2014 for its mathematical developments the mmk method is employed to calculate trends on the generated ssfi and ssi series moreover the z statistics and sen s slope sen 1968 are calculated at 0 05 significance level for instance if z is less more than the critical value at p value 0 05 then there is a significant decreasing increasing trend at 95 confidence level 3 3 the cross wavelet transform technique the continuous wavelet transform cwt method is one of the recent skills in investigating the dependency between hydro climatological variables hudgins et al 1993 torrence and compo 1998 mishra et al 2011 it jointly uses the wavelet transform i e wx wy while exploiting the cross spectrum analysis which can preferably clarify the variation features and combined fluctuations of the inputs in both time and frequency fields huang et al 2016 the cross wavelet transform xwt which allows the detection of cross magnitude significant period and non stationarity between the time series was adopted to identify the cross wavelet spectrum from 3 month ssfi ssi series in association with different lsci over the kcb the high variations of derived ssfi and ssi series on shorter time scales caused to apply xwt analysis only on the 3 month time scale the morlet wavelet is preferred family of wavelet functions which is localized in both time and frequency performing with a mean of zero konapala et al 2017 therefore it is selected for further analysis in this study assuming the w n x s and w n y s as cwts of given time series the xwt at a specific time and scale could be expressed as w n x y s w n x s w n y s where n is the size of given data and w n y s is the complex conjugate of w n y s 4 results and discussion 4 1 tempo spatial variation of the ssfi and ssi series for the purpose of enhanced visualization and because of the multiplicity in number of gauge stations n 10 and soil moisture grids n 28 we decided to plot the average of generated ssfi and ssi series in the entire study area as well as the regions a and b distinctively figs 3 and 4 generally the variation of the ssfi 3 series in region a showed higher shifts compared to region b this could be due to high precipitation and consequently higher streamflow in region a although the minimum records before 2001 are associated with region a region b experienced severe drought occurrences on post 2001 era it could be highlighted that all the stations experienced d1 d4 categories in various durations during the period 1998 2008 the ssfi 6 results came out to be similar in shape to that of the ssfi 3 capturing the persistent short term droughts over the regions for example the maximum ssfi 6 is recorded as 0 5 in region b since 1995 whereas several severe wet periods were recorded in region a regarding the ssfi 12 and ssfi 24 series the d1 d4 categories appeared likely to persist in region b while region a could experience several wet periods it is evident from the ssfi 12 outcomes that the most severe droughts d3 d4 categories occurred on the years 1994 2001 2007 and 2008 for instance more than 80 of the cases demonstrated the d3 d4 categories in the period of april to december 2001 moreover a perceptible decline is obvious for the ssfi 24 results in the period 1998 2009 over the region which eventually ends with a gradual basin wide recovery after 2009 the minimum ssfi 24 result for the entire region was recorded on january 2009 which ends the most prolonged long term drought case 50 months in addition the absence of wet spells on region b is evident after 1999 for the generated ssfi series at different time scales in general the lower ssi 3 values were noticed to be related to the grids located in region a b before after the year 1998 in accordance to the ssfi 3 outcomes the lower variations for ssi 3 results are depicted as the agricultural drought is well established to show the drought persistence and is less sensitive to abrupt fluctuations the pattern of the ssi 6 series are in good agreement with the ssfi 6 series over the regions for instance the minimum ssi 6 records occurred on the years 1989 1990 2001 2007 2013 and 2014 however there are some relatively higher values for the ssi 6 comparing with the ssfi 6 records in some specific periods for example winter in 1997 and 2007 at stations in region a which could arise because of the overestimated model simulated soil moisture data due to the frequent low intensity rainfall events in the period 1984 1998 1998 2009 the ssi 6 ssi 12 outcomes for region a are generally lower higher than region b although the lowest records for ssi 12 occurred on february 1991 during the most prolonged period 28 month over region a a basin wide minimum record of 1 63 on november 2001 was observed in region b in addition the patterns of drought improvement and degradation for ssi 24 series were in good agreement with the ssfi 24 results overall increased departures between ssfi and corresponding ssi series on different time scales were observed towards the longer time scales 12 24 compared to the shorter ones 3 6 in addition the characteristics of the various generated ssfi and ssi series over the studied regions are summarized in table 5 the average and maximum duration severity values for the ssfi 3 6 and 12 series in region b are much higher than the values in region a in contrary to the other ssfi series the higher duration and severity for average and maximum values for the ssfi 24 series belong to region b the higher maximum severity values of the ssfi series are associated to the region b at all time scales that reveals worse hydrological drought conditions over the aforementioned area our analysis also indicated intensification in drought duration and severity values since the year 2000 in the kcb in addition the higher duration and severity values of ssi at all time scales happened in region a whereas region b contained strong drought occurrences regarding to the average inter arrival results for the ssfi 3 ssfi 6 series the occurrences of d1 d4 categories with a frequency of 18 23 months were depicted moreover the maximum average inter arrival values of ssi series at different time scales are associated with region a with the exception on the ssi 24 series over region b 4 2 the trend analysis the results of mmk test and corresponding sen s slope for different ssfi series revealed distinguished outcomes over the regions fig 5 the majority of ssfi series exhibited significant negative trends with the exception of results at the station 100 in general the highest z statistics and corresponding sen s slope were observed on the stations 22 28 and 80 in other words the stations located in region b experienced considerable negative trend compared to region a in addition the magnitude of z statistics and corresponding sen s slope increase with the increases in time scale magnitude these findings are in good agreement with those of yavuz and erdoğan 2012 who found downward precipitation trends in the lake tuz region for the period 1975 2008 it could be deduced from the mmk assessments on ssi series fig 6 that the outputs can be clustered on three major groups of grids the first group is comprised by those having significant positive trends and mostly located in region a the grids 7 and 10 illustrated the highest upward trend on all time scales this finding could be linked to comparatively higher water budget because of receiving relatively higher precipitation resulted from more snow that eventually could modify the model simulated soil moisture data the second group classifies the grids that experience significant decreasing trend situated in the southeastern parts the third group consists of the grids that generally demonstrate non significant decreasing trend behaviors whereas some non significant positive trends were detected particularly in the northwestern parts as a result lower sen s slope values were found over the grids associated to the third group as compared to those in the first and second groups 4 3 the cross wavelet transform analysis due to the similarity in the variation of derived drought series on the studied regions on each time scale e g the similarity of ssfi 3 on the regions a and b the cross wavelet transform xwt analysis was adopted only for the average of the generated series over the basin the significant levels of the cross spectra power were considered as a red noise base specified by a thick black background at the 95 confidence level in the xwt figures moreover the changes in the arrow s direction in a specific frequency ranges could explain the changes in sign of correlations as well as the leading factor on the relationships generally the xwt analysis between the applied lsci and ssfi 3 ssi 3 series shown in fig 7 8 illustrate the low common power on high frequency signals i e periods less than 8 month and high common power on low frequency signals i e periods more than 32 month it is evident in the figures that nao has strong effects on the ssfi 3 and ssi 3 series for the periods 1980 2002 and 2008 2012 similarly ao exhibits intense impact on equivalent periods of those by nao the results of xwt based on the pdo and ssfi 3 ssi 3 series demonstrate several significant associations with 5 17 6 70 months signal during the study period it is worth to note that the significant correlations appeared to have negative signs for the shorter periods the scand pattern exhibited leading impacts on ssfi 3 and ssi 3 series however non significant relationships over the low frequencies were prevailing over the aforementioned relationships considering the poleur pattern with ssfi 3 ssi 3 series revealed the existence of several significant common powers varying between 5 17 8 64 month signal during the study period while phase arrows generally point south which exhibit the leading of poleur pattern over the applied indices furthermore several links on shorter periods were observed between the eawr pattern and ssfi 3 ssi 3 series depicting the existence of significant correlations on various specific periods over the applied series approximate overlapped patterns on the nao and ao linkages to the ssfi 3 ssi 3 series seem to be consistent with previous studies concerning different hydro climatologic variables over turkey these results are in accordance with the findings of türkeş and erlat 2003 and karabörk et al 2005 who explained significant negative correlations between precipitation and nao index in central anatolian region our results also support the significant negative correlation between the annual nao index and turkish lakes level explained by küçük et al 2009 particularly of those found for beyşehir and tuz lakes that are located in the kcb the results concerning ao are in good agreement with those found by unal et al 2012 who detected negative correlation between the ao and precipitation in central anatolian region of turkey although baltacı et al 2017 tried to explain significant negative correlations for the pairs of the total precipitation series and nao and ao over central anatolian region r 2 0 44 the featured xwt analysis revealed a muddled association between the applied lsci with ssfi ssi series in addition the weak correlations proposed by above mentioned study between the scand and ea wr patterns with total precipitation could be improved by the developed xwt analyses which could put forward the existence of strong significant relationship in some periods and lack of such correlation in the remaining study period in addition supposing any specific year on each generated figures appears to exist a high common power on some periods and lack of such connection on the rest of the periods numerous significant impacts of the lsci on ssfi and ssi series are shown on high frequencies however the exhibited association between mentioned inputs on lower frequencies were also detected on the ssi series this could be accompanied to the persistency in the ssi series which are less likely to vary nevertheless the majority of high common powers on low frequencies does not exhibit significant correlations fig 8 5 conclusions in this study we attempted to assess the tempo spatial variability of hydrological and agricultural droughts using the standardized streamflow index ssfi and standardized soil moisture index ssi at various time scales for the period 1975 2014 over the konya closed basin kcb respectively moreover the modified mann kendall mmk method was applied on the calculated ssfi and ssi series to assess the non parametric trends on the derived drought series in addition possible teleconnections of some large scale climate indices lsci over the 3 month ssfi ssi series were discovered the findings of this research could be summarized as follows the variation of hydrological drought in the kcb revealed that over the recent years more hydrologic droughts occurred in the entire basin compared to the earlier years although a uniform increase decrease pattern was monitored on the studied regions the generated ssfi ssi plots at different time scales showed the discordancy over the peak least spells analysis of different ssfi ssi characteristics approved the superiority of long lasting drought occurrences over region b a generally the ssfi ssi results belonging to region a contributed lower higher values compared to those obtained by region b until since 1999 overall the mmk test at different time scales resulted in significant decreasing trends on ssfi series over the entire basin with the exception of trendless behavior on station 100 the results of the mmk test imply that most of the results concerning the ssi series are in favor of no trend in the northern kcb while the majority of grids in the region a showed a considerable upward tendency the results indicated significant decreasing trends in the southeastern parts in region b there appears to be a significant association between the drought indices and lscis in different periods and the absence of such relationship in the remaining period further the numerous changes in arrow phases over the study period indicated the disordered associations between the considered lsci and ssfi ssi series this could be interpreted to the nonstationary and nonlinear links between the lsci and ssfi ssi series over the study area a numerous isolated and intensive relationships with varying magnitude of xwt analysis reveal a heterogenic mechanism as well as the nonlinear relationship between the lsci with ssfi ssi series these findings could improve the findings of several previous studies that only used the correlation analysis to detect the possible impacts of various lsci on drought variability over the study area in addition there is a noticeable common response between the correlation results of different lsci over various episodes which indicate potential convergence influences by the

sophisticated understanding of different lsci in association with hydrological and agricultural droughts variability this investigation put forward that the kcb has recently suffered substantially from hydrological and agricultural droughts particularly in the southeastern parts as a result adequate water resources management plans must be enforced to reduce the drought hazards and damages over

11094,the hydrological and agricultural droughts and their characteristics were evaluated using the standardized streamflow index ssfi and standardized soil moisture index ssi across the konya closed basin kcb in turkey respectively the modified mann kendall mmk trend method was applied to detect trends over the kcb furthermore the teleconnections of various large scale climate indices lsci nao ao pdo scand poleur and ea wr over 3 month ssfi and ssi series were considered through cross wavelet transform xwt technique the analysis indicated an increase in drought duration and severity since 1999 the mmk test revealed significant negative trends for ssfi series at different time scales a series of mmk test on different ssi series exhibited trendless behavior over the northern parts of the kcb however significant negative positive trend on southeastern southwestern area appeared to be prevailing moreover the results of xwt analysis in association with different lsci and ssfi ssi series demonstrated multiple considerable common powers on lower periods i e less than 8 month the xwt analysis showed significant relationship between the lsci with drought indices in some periods and the absence of such associations in the remaining period keywords non parametric drought indices modified mann kendall large scale climate indices cross wavelet transform turkey 1 introduction the increasing greenhouse gases emissions have led to climate warming becoming the top environmental issue in the 21st century it is widely accepted that global warming is leading to a temperature and evapotranspiration increase which represent a basic element of the hydrologic cycle jhajharia et al 2012 drought is a recurrent natural hazard which may occur in any climatic region the effects of drought are not only limited to regional water crises but may lead to significant social economic and environmental consequences generally droughts are classified into four groups including meteorological hydrological agricultural and socio economic which are representing a specific and or group of drought indicators wilhite 2000 the shortage in the received amount of precipitation over a specific period compared to the long term average is defined as meteorological drought the reduction in surface or groundwater resources usually river flows available surface subsurface water is a key characteristic of hydrological drought tallaksen and van lanen 2004 hydrological drought is generally related to meteorological drought as it shares similar varying recurrence intervals as a consequence of hydrological droughts insufficient water supplies poor water quality and limited water for irrigation purposes all causing crop failure could adversely impact a number of economic and social activities mishra and singh 2010 vicente serrano et al 2012 the deficits in soil s water content result in agricultural drought which is eventually linked to the different features of meteorological drought in addition agricultural drought shows the persistence of drought more reliably mo 2011 hao and aghakouchak 2013 in the concern of agricultural drought the amount of water humidity existing at the plants roots is much important for plants compared to annual precipitation drought involved sectors require reliable information to react timely against the unfavorable effects of drought in the context of climate change several surveys recently appeared and combined concerns continue to dictate at different stages of governance in many societies it is evident that the most of current efforts have been focusing on large or country scaled drought observations however hydrological and storage information at a basin scale is needed for the comprehensive and precise decision making process bachmair et al 2015 stated that current drought monitoring skills may be inappropriate and drought indicators and thresholds need to be selected at smaller scales since most appropriate indicators and thresholds are extremely variable in a spatial sense from the standpoint of the water cycle they also asserted catchment scale as the most adequate measure in the same context van loon and lahaa 2015 pointed out the crucial symbol of storages in soil lakes aquifers etc which could influence drought duration and severity having this specific inspiration together with the importance of drought events in a semi arid region in the water resources management it would be contributing to investigate hydrological and agricultural drought characteristics at the catchment scale exposed to semi arid climate conditions afterwards we were motivated to concentrate on konya closed basin kcb in tukey which is a big size catchment located in mid latitude and having semi arid climate characteristics the substantial uncertainty in precipitation quantity which is a key climatic characteristic of the eastern mediterranean region consequently raise the concerns with drought in turkey this uncertainty comes from different reasons for instance anticyclones from southern latitudes dominate particularly during summers and result in long lasting dry and stable weather conditions over turkey with the exception of the northern coasts and northeastern parts furthermore the atmospheric blocking caused by the dominance of subtropical high pressure system could set back the cyclonic activities over the region throughout the year agricultural sectors require the largest water consumption all over turkey kcb at the level of 74 88 water withdrawals according to an unpublished report by turkey s ministry of forest and water management more than 55 over 2 7 million hectare of kcb are classified as agricultural lands therefore the hydro climatological state of kcb becomes highly important for the region s ecosystem which is extra motivation for us to select this area in addition overexploitation of groundwater for agricultural purposes has led to drying circumstances in several lakes and wetlands for instance the water volume of lake tuz second largest lake in turkey and hosting thousands of flamingos every year was severely diminished consequently the negative water balance is linked to excessive groundwater exploitation which constitutes a serious problem in central anatolia especially in the kcb an approximate well numbers is 100 000 currently being used over the basin however a number of 65 000 wells have been documented illegal i̇şçioğlu 2008 moreover üstün et al 2015 declared a downward motion with a rate of 34 mm year in central to eastern parts during the period of 2002 2009 reporting the land subsidence in the kcb it is convincing that the magnitude of subsidence is exacerbated during the droughts when farmers rely heavily on groundwater to sustain in one of the most productive agricultural regions in turkey trend analysis assessment has been one of the most popular topics in hydrology science and climate communities the mann kendall mk mann 1945 kendall 1975 nonparametric trend test endorsed by world meteorological organization is the most commonly used method in trend recognizing on different hydro climatic variables numerous investigators have applied the mk method to different hydrologic and climatological series in turkey e g kahya and kalayci 2004 partal and kahya 2006 unal et al 2012 asikoglu and ciftlik 2015 although some studies concerned trend analysis of different hydro climatic variables in turkey şarlak et al 2009 kahya 2011 no study has focused on hydrological and agricultural drought indices at the basin scale in addition advanced understanding of the spatial and temporal conjunctions between the large scale climate indices lsci and the variations of hydrological and agricultural drought indices can enhance the science of management in water resources systems the majority of previous studies applied the conventional correlation analysis to evaluate the lsci phenomena on different hydro climatologic variables or drought indices for instance the role of various lsci such as north atlantic oscillation nao and arctic oscillation ao over turkish hydro climatologic variables were evaluated by different studies e g karabörk and kahya 2003 türkeş and erlat 2003 karabörk et al 2005 sousa et al 2011 however no study appeared to reveal the probable teleconnections of scandinavian polar eurasia and eastern atlantic western russia patterns with hydrological and agricultural drought indices over turkey accordingly the use of spectral based methods such as wavelet transform wt techniques could improve the latent associations between a pair of time series grinsted et al 2004 recently the use of wt technique has raised attentions among hydrologists küçük et al 2009 yu and lin 2015 tan et al 2016 chen et al 2018 the wt breaks down data into time and frequency space and detects the dominant variability and associated variation which is robust in nonstationary signals tan et al 2016 yu and lin 2015 explained the decomposition of a given time series through a tiny wave to detect the clustered frequency at a specific onset they revealed the advantages of this process to recognize the non stationary in a given data although tosunoğlu and kaplan 2018 applied the additive wt on streamflow series on çoruh and euphrates basins in eastern turkey there is no study regarding the use of wavelet transform on drought analysis at the basin scale in turkey furthermore the non stationarity associations between generated drought indices and different lsci was assessed using bivariate wavelet analyses in summary the objectives of this study are to i analyze the features of hydrological and agricultural droughts at different time scales ii discover a possible tempo spatial relationship between the proposed hydrological and agricultural series iii detect possible trends using the modified mann kendall method over the generated series and iv explore a probable role played by different lsci over the variability of drought series using cross wt analysis 2 study area and data 2 1 study area situated in the core of the central anatolia plateau the kcb s altitude varies between approximately 400 m 3400 m fig 1 although the kcb comprises 14 of turkish irrigation lands it only shares 3 of potential turkish water resources the kcb is the fourth largest basin that accounts for nearly 7 of the total precipitation volume in the country the average annual precipitation varies between 300 mm and 2400 mm over the central anatolia to the eastern black sea coast respectively where annual precipitation lower than 350 mm spreads all over a large area of central anatolia in particular over the kcb turkish state meteorological service 2017 the historical average annual precipitation reaches to 330 mm in the central kcb and to 700 mm in the southwestern mountainous parts in general mediterranean climate dominates in the southern kcb with mild and rainy winters and dry and hot summers while the center and northern kcb face with terrestrial climate with cold winters and hot dry summers vazifehkhah and kahya 2017 the southwestern area receives more precipitation compared to the other parts while it decreases in the southwest northeast directions more than three million people live in the kcb including eight cities in 39 districts where 45 of the total population reside in rural parts several lakes in the basin and natural richness host migrant birds the kcb has recently experienced many drought occasions due to the increased temperature and reduced precipitation potentially driven by climate change according to a report by worldwide fund turkish branch 65 of the region s wetlands have recently dried out wwf 2017 2 2 data monthly streamflow data at 10 gauge stations complied by the turkish state hydraulic works tshw 2016 spanning from 1975 to 2014 was used in this study in the stage of data selection those that hold insufficient quality representing seasonal pattern and generally obtain zero values during warm months may september were removed the geographic characteristics of the hydrometric stations are presented in table 1 while the statistical details of streamflow series are given in table 2 in general the stations with higher lower flow rates are located in the southwestern eastern and northern parts the monthly model simulated soil moisture series for twenty eight grids provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 2017a for the same period 1975 2014 were applied in addition some grids that are placed closed to the kcb s border but have similar geographical specifications and might have probable hydrological interactions with the study area were chosen in the grid selection step the grids soil moisture data are distributed on a half degree resolution on lat long directions and fully cover the study area see fig 1 interested readers are referred to fan and van den dool 2004 van den dool 2003 for more information regarding the soil moisture series monthly values of major lsci including north atlantic oscillation nao arctic oscillation ao the pacific decadal oscillation pdo the scandinavian scand the polar eurasia poleur and the eastern atlantic western russia ea wr patterns are obtained from the climatic prediction center of noaa noaa 2017b when a monthly or seasonal index is constructed the time series under consideration can be normalized by the standard deviation of monthly or seasonal averages to form a standardized index therefore each time series of the above mentioned lsci is normalized by the standard deviation of the running 3 month averages to form desired running 3 month indices 2 2 1 the streamflow data preparation it is always advisable to check stationarity of hydro climatic variables wang et al 2009 as a result the stationarity and homogeneity conditions of streamflow series were assessed at the beginning of the main statistical analyses readers are referred to wang et al 2009 for comprehensive information regarding stationarity tests in the field of hydrology the unit root test is one of the effective methods to test the stationarity of time series yuan and bentler 1997 to this end the stationarity of streamflow series was assessed by augmented dickey fuller test cheung and la 1995 our results proved the stationarity of streamflow series details not shown in the same context salas 1980 explained about the inconsistency and non homogeneity that induces the hydrologic features to change in time thus non homogeneity is common in hydrologic variables further three well known homogeneity tests as the pettitt s test pettitt 1979 the standard normal homogeneity test snht given by alexandersson 1986 and the buishand s test driven by buishand 1982 at 0 05 significance level are performed to temporally check the homogeneity of monthly streamflow series the null hypothesis assumes that the monthly streamflow data are classified as a homogenous series the overall results indicate that 22 out of 30 cases 10 stations 3 methods rejected the null hypothesis table 3 the stations that passed two tests 3 13 and 101 are assumed to be as a homogenous series in addition the stations 95 and 100 were shown to be homogenous based on the snht and pettit s test respectively the double mass curve dmc technique is employed to spatially test the consistency of monthly streamflow series and assess their consistency this is a commonly applied procedure to identify hydrological changes caused by anthropogenic activities searcy and hardison 1960 which is the plot of the cumulative values of one variable time series compared to the accumulative values of another associated variable time series on a simultaneous period wang et al 2013 for this purpose the streamflow series were classified into two groups the first consisting of the stations 3 13 95 100 and 101 which are assumed to be homogenous series and comparatively exhibit higher flow rates located in the southwestern region fig 1 region a and the second consisting of the stations 22 28 80 87 and 94 which are distributed on comparatively low precipitation parts fig 1 region b to determine the consistency of streamflow series spatially we examined the plot of cumulative monthly streamflow series at each station versus cumulative monthly streamflow averaged over its corresponding region the results of dmc analysis revealed that the stations 13 100 and 101 located in region a and the station 94 in region b are categorized as consistent series fig 2 those with lower deviations around the curves could be recognized as low consistency even they could be supposed as consistent with considering lower accurateness bras 1990 therefore the remaining stations could be considered as a consistent series with a lower accuracy eventually one can utilize the analyzed streamflow series for different purposes such as generating drought indices and or applying nonparametric trend tests 3 methodology 3 1 the nonparametric drought indices to date the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 is among the most applied meteorological drought indices while the streamflow drought index sdi nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 and standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 are the well known hydrological drought indices the spi and sdi are typically derived by fitting the gamma and lognormal probability distribution functions respectively accordingly several hydrological studies have suggested the lognormal distribution as a suitable fit to streamflow series e g chen et al 2018 shukla and wood 2008 vicente serrano et al 2012 however some recent studies warned errors related to the tails of the applied distribution which may lead to inappropriate results farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 although vazifehkhah and kahya 2018 showed the incapability of various probability distributions in fitting monthly streamflow series for the three stations in the kcb the efficiency of the lognormal distribution on the streamflow series was checked using the kolmogorov smirnov k s test at 95 confidence intervals the results of the k s test indicate the failure of the lognormal as a suitable distribution to monthly and running 6 month streamflow series table 4 except the stations 13 and 28 which have sufficient p values the null hypothesis in the remaining stations were rejected as they follow the lognormal distribution these statistical results indicate the incapability of former parametric hydrological drought indices such as the sdi and sri over the study area on the other hand soil moisture series generally follow normal or beta distribution sheffield et al 2004 carrão et al 2016 although the validity of the above mentioned assumption was checked over the applied soil moisture series statistical details not shown it is decided to use an identical method to derive the hydrological and agricultural drought indices on different time scales to overcome this issue the standardized drought analysis toolbox sdat farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 was applied to derive non parametric standardized drought indices to this end the empirical probability can be calculated using the gringorten plotting position gringorten 1963 as an alternative method 1 p x t i 0 44 n 0 12 where p xt stands for the corresponding empirical probability at month t i shows the rank of non zero input in an ascending format and n denotes the sample size the empirical probabilities estimated above are easily transformed to a standardized index using 2 s i ϕ 1 p where p is probability derived from eq 1 and ϕ is the standard normal distribution function the derived percentiles could be standardized using the common approximations provided by abramowitz and stegun 1965 3 s i c 0 c 1 t c 2 t 2 1 d 1 t d 2 t 2 d 3 t 3 for 0 p x 0 t ln 1 h x 2 s i t c 0 c 1 t c 2 t 2 1 d 1 t d 2 t 2 d 3 t 3 for 0 5 p x 1 t ln 1 1 h x 2 and c0 2 515517 c1 0 802583 c2 0 010328 d1 1 432788 d2 0 189269 d3 0 001308 this algorithm could be used for any variable such as streamflow and or soil moisture series to calculate drought indices golian et al 2014 finally monthly streamflow and soil moisture series were used to generate the respective 3 6 12 and 24 month hydrological so called standardized streamflow index ssfi 3 ssfi 6 ssfi 12 and ssfi 24 and agricultural drought indices so called standardized soil moisture index ssi 3 ssi 6 ssi 12 and ssi 24 respectively the commonly used d scale drought classification proposed by svoboda et al 2002 was here adopted to gain a better visualization of drought severity categories as abnormally dry d0 0 50 to 0 79 moderate drought d1 0 8 to 1 29 severe drought d2 1 3 to 1 59 extreme drought d3 1 6 to 1 99 and exceptional drought d4 2 or less following hao and aghakouchak 2013 and vazifehkhah et al 2019 who suggested 0 8 as a threshold value representing 20th percentile or below of given index the same value is considered denoting the d1 to d4 categories 3 2 the modified mann kendall method the mann kendall mk method preferred by the world meteorological organization is a non parametric method for trend assessment huang et al 2014 hamed and rao 1998 rectified it by eliminating the persistence considering the lag i autocorrelation generally i 1 that could considerably affect the results they also stated that the modified mann kendall mmk method is vigorous in computing trends in hydro climatological series due to the scarcity of place we do not discuss the methodological details here but we can refer readers to kahya and kalayci 2004 and huang et al 2014 for its mathematical developments the mmk method is employed to calculate trends on the generated ssfi and ssi series moreover the z statistics and sen s slope sen 1968 are calculated at 0 05 significance level for instance if z is less more than the critical value at p value 0 05 then there is a significant decreasing increasing trend at 95 confidence level 3 3 the cross wavelet transform technique the continuous wavelet transform cwt method is one of the recent skills in investigating the dependency between hydro climatological variables hudgins et al 1993 torrence and compo 1998 mishra et al 2011 it jointly uses the wavelet transform i e wx wy while exploiting the cross spectrum analysis which can preferably clarify the variation features and combined fluctuations of the inputs in both time and frequency fields huang et al 2016 the cross wavelet transform xwt which allows the detection of cross magnitude significant period and non stationarity between the time series was adopted to identify the cross wavelet spectrum from 3 month ssfi ssi series in association with different lsci over the kcb the high variations of derived ssfi and ssi series on shorter time scales caused to apply xwt analysis only on the 3 month time scale the morlet wavelet is preferred family of wavelet functions which is localized in both time and frequency performing with a mean of zero konapala et al 2017 therefore it is selected for further analysis in this study assuming the w n x s and w n y s as cwts of given time series the xwt at a specific time and scale could be expressed as w n x y s w n x s w n y s where n is the size of given data and w n y s is the complex conjugate of w n y s 4 results and discussion 4 1 tempo spatial variation of the ssfi and ssi series for the purpose of enhanced visualization and because of the multiplicity in number of gauge stations n 10 and soil moisture grids n 28 we decided to plot the average of generated ssfi and ssi series in the entire study area as well as the regions a and b distinctively figs 3 and 4 generally the variation of the ssfi 3 series in region a showed higher shifts compared to region b this could be due to high precipitation and consequently higher streamflow in region a although the minimum records before 2001 are associated with region a region b experienced severe drought occurrences on post 2001 era it could be highlighted that all the stations experienced d1 d4 categories in various durations during the period 1998 2008 the ssfi 6 results came out to be similar in shape to that of the ssfi 3 capturing the persistent short term droughts over the regions for example the maximum ssfi 6 is recorded as 0 5 in region b since 1995 whereas several severe wet periods were recorded in region a regarding the ssfi 12 and ssfi 24 series the d1 d4 categories appeared likely to persist in region b while region a could experience several wet periods it is evident from the ssfi 12 outcomes that the most severe droughts d3 d4 categories occurred on the years 1994 2001 2007 and 2008 for instance more than 80 of the cases demonstrated the d3 d4 categories in the period of april to december 2001 moreover a perceptible decline is obvious for the ssfi 24 results in the period 1998 2009 over the region which eventually ends with a gradual basin wide recovery after 2009 the minimum ssfi 24 result for the entire region was recorded on january 2009 which ends the most prolonged long term drought case 50 months in addition the absence of wet spells on region b is evident after 1999 for the generated ssfi series at different time scales in general the lower ssi 3 values were noticed to be related to the grids located in region a b before after the year 1998 in accordance to the ssfi 3 outcomes the lower variations for ssi 3 results are depicted as the agricultural drought is well established to show the drought persistence and is less sensitive to abrupt fluctuations the pattern of the ssi 6 series are in good agreement with the ssfi 6 series over the regions for instance the minimum ssi 6 records occurred on the years 1989 1990 2001 2007 2013 and 2014 however there are some relatively higher values for the ssi 6 comparing with the ssfi 6 records in some specific periods for example winter in 1997 and 2007 at stations in region a which could arise because of the overestimated model simulated soil moisture data due to the frequent low intensity rainfall events in the period 1984 1998 1998 2009 the ssi 6 ssi 12 outcomes for region a are generally lower higher than region b although the lowest records for ssi 12 occurred on february 1991 during the most prolonged period 28 month over region a a basin wide minimum record of 1 63 on november 2001 was observed in region b in addition the patterns of drought improvement and degradation for ssi 24 series were in good agreement with the ssfi 24 results overall increased departures between ssfi and corresponding ssi series on different time scales were observed towards the longer time scales 12 24 compared to the shorter ones 3 6 in addition the characteristics of the various generated ssfi and ssi series over the studied regions are summarized in table 5 the average and maximum duration severity values for the ssfi 3 6 and 12 series in region b are much higher than the values in region a in contrary to the other ssfi series the higher duration and severity for average and maximum values for the ssfi 24 series belong to region b the higher maximum severity values of the ssfi series are associated to the region b at all time scales that reveals worse hydrological drought conditions over the aforementioned area our analysis also indicated intensification in drought duration and severity values since the year 2000 in the kcb in addition the higher duration and severity values of ssi at all time scales happened in region a whereas region b contained strong drought occurrences regarding to the average inter arrival results for the ssfi 3 ssfi 6 series the occurrences of d1 d4 categories with a frequency of 18 23 months were depicted moreover the maximum average inter arrival values of ssi series at different time scales are associated with region a with the exception on the ssi 24 series over region b 4 2 the trend analysis the results of mmk test and corresponding sen s slope for different ssfi series revealed distinguished outcomes over the regions fig 5 the majority of ssfi series exhibited significant negative trends with the exception of results at the station 100 in general the highest z statistics and corresponding sen s slope were observed on the stations 22 28 and 80 in other words the stations located in region b experienced considerable negative trend compared to region a in addition the magnitude of z statistics and corresponding sen s slope increase with the increases in time scale magnitude these findings are in good agreement with those of yavuz and erdoğan 2012 who found downward precipitation trends in the lake tuz region for the period 1975 2008 it could be deduced from the mmk assessments on ssi series fig 6 that the outputs can be clustered on three major groups of grids the first group is comprised by those having significant positive trends and mostly located in region a the grids 7 and 10 illustrated the highest upward trend on all time scales this finding could be linked to comparatively higher water budget because of receiving relatively higher precipitation resulted from more snow that eventually could modify the model simulated soil moisture data the second group classifies the grids that experience significant decreasing trend situated in the southeastern parts the third group consists of the grids that generally demonstrate non significant decreasing trend behaviors whereas some non significant positive trends were detected particularly in the northwestern parts as a result lower sen s slope values were found over the grids associated to the third group as compared to those in the first and second groups 4 3 the cross wavelet transform analysis due to the similarity in the variation of derived drought series on the studied regions on each time scale e g the similarity of ssfi 3 on the regions a and b the cross wavelet transform xwt analysis was adopted only for the average of the generated series over the basin the significant levels of the cross spectra power were considered as a red noise base specified by a thick black background at the 95 confidence level in the xwt figures moreover the changes in the arrow s direction in a specific frequency ranges could explain the changes in sign of correlations as well as the leading factor on the relationships generally the xwt analysis between the applied lsci and ssfi 3 ssi 3 series shown in fig 7 8 illustrate the low common power on high frequency signals i e periods less than 8 month and high common power on low frequency signals i e periods more than 32 month it is evident in the figures that nao has strong effects on the ssfi 3 and ssi 3 series for the periods 1980 2002 and 2008 2012 similarly ao exhibits intense impact on equivalent periods of those by nao the results of xwt based on the pdo and ssfi 3 ssi 3 series demonstrate several significant associations with 5 17 6 70 months signal during the study period it is worth to note that the significant correlations appeared to have negative signs for the shorter periods the scand pattern exhibited leading impacts on ssfi 3 and ssi 3 series however non significant relationships over the low frequencies were prevailing over the aforementioned relationships considering the poleur pattern with ssfi 3 ssi 3 series revealed the existence of several significant common powers varying between 5 17 8 64 month signal during the study period while phase arrows generally point south which exhibit the leading of poleur pattern over the applied indices furthermore several links on shorter periods were observed between the eawr pattern and ssfi 3 ssi 3 series depicting the existence of significant correlations on various specific periods over the applied series approximate overlapped patterns on the nao and ao linkages to the ssfi 3 ssi 3 series seem to be consistent with previous studies concerning different hydro climatologic variables over turkey these results are in accordance with the findings of türkeş and erlat 2003 and karabörk et al 2005 who explained significant negative correlations between precipitation and nao index in central anatolian region our results also support the significant negative correlation between the annual nao index and turkish lakes level explained by küçük et al 2009 particularly of those found for beyşehir and tuz lakes that are located in the kcb the results concerning ao are in good agreement with those found by unal et al 2012 who detected negative correlation between the ao and precipitation in central anatolian region of turkey although baltacı et al 2017 tried to explain significant negative correlations for the pairs of the total precipitation series and nao and ao over central anatolian region r 2 0 44 the featured xwt analysis revealed a muddled association between the applied lsci with ssfi ssi series in addition the weak correlations proposed by above mentioned study between the scand and ea wr patterns with total precipitation could be improved by the developed xwt analyses which could put forward the existence of strong significant relationship in some periods and lack of such correlation in the remaining study period in addition supposing any specific year on each generated figures appears to exist a high common power on some periods and lack of such connection on the rest of the periods numerous significant impacts of the lsci on ssfi and ssi series are shown on high frequencies however the exhibited association between mentioned inputs on lower frequencies were also detected on the ssi series this could be accompanied to the persistency in the ssi series which are less likely to vary nevertheless the majority of high common powers on low frequencies does not exhibit significant correlations fig 8 5 conclusions in this study we attempted to assess the tempo spatial variability of hydrological and agricultural droughts using the standardized streamflow index ssfi and standardized soil moisture index ssi at various time scales for the period 1975 2014 over the konya closed basin kcb respectively moreover the modified mann kendall mmk method was applied on the calculated ssfi and ssi series to assess the non parametric trends on the derived drought series in addition possible teleconnections of some large scale climate indices lsci over the 3 month ssfi ssi series were discovered the findings of this research could be summarized as follows the variation of hydrological drought in the kcb revealed that over the recent years more hydrologic droughts occurred in the entire basin compared to the earlier years although a uniform increase decrease pattern was monitored on the studied regions the generated ssfi ssi plots at different time scales showed the discordancy over the peak least spells analysis of different ssfi ssi characteristics approved the superiority of long lasting drought occurrences over region b a generally the ssfi ssi results belonging to region a contributed lower higher values compared to those obtained by region b until since 1999 overall the mmk test at different time scales resulted in significant decreasing trends on ssfi series over the entire basin with the exception of trendless behavior on station 100 the results of the mmk test imply that most of the results concerning the ssi series are in favor of no trend in the northern kcb while the majority of grids in the region a showed a considerable upward tendency the results indicated significant decreasing trends in the southeastern parts in region b there appears to be a significant association between the drought indices and lscis in different periods and the absence of such relationship in the remaining period further the numerous changes in arrow phases over the study period indicated the disordered associations between the considered lsci and ssfi ssi series this could be interpreted to the nonstationary and nonlinear links between the lsci and ssfi ssi series over the study area a numerous isolated and intensive relationships with varying magnitude of xwt analysis reveal a heterogenic mechanism as well as the nonlinear relationship between the lsci with ssfi ssi series these findings could improve the findings of several previous studies that only used the correlation analysis to detect the possible impacts of various lsci on drought variability over the study area in addition there is a noticeable common response between the correlation results of different lsci over various episodes which indicate potential convergence influences by the applied lsci on drought variability over the studied region an analysis of xwt between any pairs of the lsci and ssf ssi was yet available in turkey therefore our results here can help in sophisticated understanding of different lsci in association with hydrological and agricultural droughts variability this investigation put forward that the kcb has recently suffered substantially from hydrological and agricultural droughts particularly in the southeastern parts as a result adequate water resources management plans must be enforced to reduce the drought hazards and damages over the basin acknowledgements this research was partially supported by the scientific research projects unit of istanbul technical university through the project 39267 the authors would like to thank to general directorate of turkish state hydraulic works for providing the streamflow data we also would like to appreciate noaa psd boulder colorado usa for providing soil moisture data we also
