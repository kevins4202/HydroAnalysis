21655,an array of pressure sensors can be used to correct the drift in inertial navigation systems for underwater vehicles uvs in absence of other navigation support systems such as acoustic positioning gps and doppler velocity measurements to date multiple pressure sensor arrays have been designed proposed and tested to prove the concept however it has not been researched the inclusion of non linearities is required in the post processing this paper focuses on the use of machine learning as a novel approach to improve the post processing accuracy including non linearities caused by the vehicle acceleration on the estimated speed compared to the linear parametric equation methodology a series of towing tank experiments have been conducted over an array of pressure sensors located on an uv platform the results show that pressure measurement array requires the use of non linear post processing methodologies as linear methodologies are not able to accurately account for vehicle acceleration effects keywords auv sensor array gaussian processes neural networks 1 introduction inertial navigation is a key element in the use of underwater vehicles uv as they provide information regarding the vehicle states in order to fulfil mission goals fanelli 2019 a common inertial navigation system ins is composed of a set of sensors as an accelerometer gyroscope and compass coupled with surveillance of surrounding objects the exact position of a vehicle is calculated by the application of sensor fusion and filters such as extended kalman filter or unscented kalman filter sabet et al 2014 in the case of air drones a very accurate location can be obtained by the three sensors mentioned above for fast sampling coupled together with gps for the drift reduction caused by the error induced by acceleration double integral titterton et al 2004 however the accuracy and robustness of inertial navigation systems to predict the vehicle states for uvs are highly dependent upon environmental conditions compared to land and air drones uvs have limited use of gps for drift correction as the gps signal becomes completely attenuated underwater alcocer et al 2006 in the case of uvs ins drift correction can be undertaken by the use of specific techniques such as underwater gps system allotta et al 2016 or the use of specific sensors such as acoustic doppler current profilers adcps and doppler velocity logs dvls fong and jones 2006 adcps measure the current around the vehicle by the projection of 3d ultrasound wave beams and the measurement of their travelling time or frequency change thus they can estimate the fluid velocity along the acoustic path in a similar way dvls calculate the vehicle speed in relation to the sea floor an underwater structure or object by the projection of an acoustic beam and the returning echo measurement however adcps and dvls are not fixable to small auvs as they are large sensors and require high quantities of energy in addition dvls require the presence of a surface and adcps do not measure the local flow on the vehicle surface thereby introducing errors in the measurements therefore drift correction by using pressure sensors to measure flow speed is a promising alternative due to its small form factor in both size and energy requirements in nature fish utilise a specific sense organ system known as the lateral line system for manoeuvring in complex fluid environments the lateral line system is formed from a series of sensory cell clusters called the cupula which are distributed along the fish s body these cupulas are simulated by the flow around the fish and allow it to determine the flow rate and direction over its own body van trump and mchenry 2008 these types of microstructure were the inspiration for the application of pressure sensors in array for speed measurement and current measurement fuentes pérez et al 2016 wang et al 2016 salumäe and kruusmaa 2013 the relationship between the pressure and flow velocity is well known pitot tubes use the principle that the flow velocity can be correlated to the dynamic pressure over a surface based on this principal kottapalli et al 2012 and fernandez et al 2007 have developed specific micro electromechanical system mems pressure transducers and pandya et al 2006 has developed a similar layout based on the hot wire principle the goal of these developments is to convert the external vehicle surface into a multi directional array of lateral lines even though the research in pressure transducer technology has shown results research remains limited on the precision and post processing required for the correct calculation of uv speed from pressure sensor arrays data it is commonly assumed in the post processing of the pressure data that flow has a linear relationship to vehicle speed fuentes pérez et al 2016 usually in the form of parametric bernoulli equations i e zero flow acceleration however the work presented in this paper differs from the results of meurer et al 2019 our configuration of sensors in a three dimensional shape shows that the flow acceleration introduces a substantial non linearity in the relationship this non linearity is also hard to be characterised via regression analysis as it is both time and spatially dependent a series of cfd simulations were employed for the selection of sensors and a towing tank experiment was carried out to explore the applicability of different post processing methodologies a mathematical model was developed for the integration of pressure measurements to obtain an equivalent absolute speed two machine learning methodologies were employed to improve post processing accuracy neural networks and gaussian processes gp were tested methods to include non linearities caused by the vehicle acceleration on the estimated speed compared to the linear parametric equation methodology the results show the need to account for the non linearities in the post processing of pressure data for speed measurement in underwater vehicles to obtain the correct registration of position based on these sensors 2 sensor implementation the mpxv5100 fig 1 100 kpa piezoresistive transducer was selected for the measurement of pressure at each point each sensor was coupled to a 15 ksps 20 bits analogue to digital converter with a low pass filter fig 2 shows the recommended configuration of a cutoff frequency of 650 hz the data was collected through the xylinq fpga of a ni myrio 1900 at 1 ksps for each channel the auv was mounted directly to the amc towing tank carriage and towed at different speeds angles and different acceleration rates as shown in table 1 and fig 3 3 linear parametric post processing fig 4 shows the five pressure sensors locations on the auv head a rear sensor measures a static pressure from location z p s such that the exact robot depth can be calculated as 1 z p 0 p s ρ g η 2 z δ z p s o where p s is the static pressure at the sensor η 2 z is the rotation matrix component from the vehicle frame to the world frame and δ z p s o is the vector of distance between the vehicle centre of gravity and the depth sensor as the hydrostatic pressure for each transducer will change with the vehicle movement at each time step this pressure has to be compensated by the calculation of their respective positions in relation to the centre of gravity and the depth of the vehicle similarly the depth of each transducer able to be calculated as 2 z p 1 η 2 z p s p 1 z p 0 z p 2 η 2 z p s p 2 z p 0 z p 3 η 2 z p s p 3 z p 0 z p 4 η 2 z p s p 4 z p 0 z p 5 η 2 z p s p 5 z p 0 where z p s p 1 5 is the vector from the depth sensor to the specific pressure sensors in the array with the measurements p and the specific depth at each sensor a pressure caused by the dynamic action of the vehicle p d for each transducer can be calculated as 3 p d 1 p 1 ρ g z p 1 p d 2 p 2 ρ g z p 2 p d 3 p 3 ρ g z p 3 p d 4 p 4 ρ g z p 4 p d 5 p 5 ρ g z p 5 the bernoulli principle defines the relationship between the pressure and the velocity as seen in eq 4 the hydrostatic pressure was removed from the bernoulli equation as this value was previously calculated eq 4 can be expanded with power functions to the form presented in eq 5 with the inclusion of a vector a of parameters that relate the pressure of each point to the vehicle respective velocity and a constant c for general compensation 4 c v 2 2 p ρ 5 v 4 c a p 2 v ap 2 2 a c p c 2 4 where a a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 is a vector of parameters and c is a constant to be calculated with the experimental data the parameter calculation for the mathematical model was carry out with the use of particle swarm optimisation pso and minimisation of the means squared error cost function 6 j θ 1 m i 1 m h θ x i y i 2 where the variables used are m number of training examples x i pressure values for the training prediction y i real values of velocity θ chosen parameters h θ x i predicted vehicle speed a first set of cfd simulations was carried out to verify that the proposed equation can fit the steady state data from the experiments the resultant pressure at each sensor point and the flow relative flow velocity at steady speed was used for the calculation of the equation parameters the proposed equation can fit the cfd data with higher precision of over 99 fig 5 shows the result of speed calculation with the parameters learned over cfd data further verification is done by fitting the results of the parameter calculation over the experimental data the mean value of pressure and velocity with 0 acceleration of half the experiments is employed in the fitting process and the complete set of data is used for validation fig 6 for steady state flow a precision of 83 was obtained 4 neural network post processing artificial neural networks anns have been successfully applied to a number of time series prediction and modelling tasks in particular when the time series is noisy and there is an underlying non linear dynamical system ann models frequently outperform standard linear techniques modelling of nonlinear systems with machine learning algorithms requires the inclusion of architectures with feedback and an example of such architecture is nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous inputs neural networks narx nn chen et al 1990 it has been shown that in concept narx nn can be used instead of conventional recurrent networks without any computational loss and that they are at least equivalent to turing machines siegelmann et al 1997 in general a narx architecture is the calculation of a function that relates the future output of the system to a series of regressors from previous states 7 y n f y n 1 k u n 1 k the nonlinear mapping f is generally unknown and can be estimated usually by a standard multilayer perceptron mlp network in the case of pressure post processing the function f is build with the first two delayed pressure measurements f y n 1 y n 2 there are two possibilities that have a concern in training narx nn the first one is called parallel mode in which the output is feedback to the input of the feedforward neural network as part of the standard narx architecture the second one is called series parallel mode in which the narx nn starts as an open nn in which the true output is used instead of feeding back the estimated output after training the narx nn in an open loop can be transformed to a close loop to be deployed parallel mode has the disadvantage of lower training times but has overall better performance in modelling a system for the pressure sensor data post processing the structure illustrated in fig 7 was used the structure consists of the first and second delays of the network output and the pressure measurements the training of the narx nn was carried out in closed loop as it resulted in more generic training the experiment data was re sample to 10 hz and a total of 2450 samples the data obtained from the experiment was divided into training data and validation data a normalised radial basis activation function is employed in the hidden layer experiments that were done more than one at the same speed were used for the trained model validation the neural network training was undertaken by using levenberg marquardt backpropagation of multiple series with each experiment run considered as a series and the neural network goal was to learn to predict each experiment result a result from the training of the narx nn can be seen in fig 8 where the nn has learned to produce the same result from the experiments by been feed with delayed signals 5 gp post processing gp is another black box methodology capable of learning the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of a system rasmussen 1999 a gp is a generalisation of the gaussian probability distribution where a probability distribution defines random variables which are scalars or vectors a stochastic process rules the properties of functions a gp shares a relationship with nn i e if an nn hidden layer is taken to infinitive the resulting nn is an approximation to gp neal 2012 the principal difference of a gp compared to nns is that a gp not only provides just the system output prediction but also a measure of prediction confidence a gp can be seen as an assembly of random variables f z i with a joint gaussian distribution for any finite subset a gp is a stochastic process containing random variables with a normal probability distribution a gp is a gaussian random function fully described by its mean function and covariance function rasmussen 1999 8 p f z 1 f z n z 1 z n n m f σ f where m f is the expectation of the random variables and σ f is the covariance of the random variables and p f z 1 f z n z 1 z n is the joint probability function of f z 1 f z n given z 1 z n the hyperparameters learning of the joint function is carried out by the minimisation of the marginal log likelihood defined as rasmussen 1999 9 log p y x θ 1 2 y t k y 1 y 1 2 log k n 2 log 2 π where k σ f σ n 2 i is the covariance matrix for the target value y if a white noise v n 0 σ n 2 is defined and θ is the vector of hyperparameters rasmussen 2004 the application of gp for post processing of nonlinear systems requires the use of nonlinear model structures for black boxes as narx nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous input narx structure fig 9 uses the input values p 1 5 k 1 and the measured output values u k 1 as regressors to learn the nonlinearity behaviour the structure narx is simpler to deploy as the data acquired from the experiment is a series of discrete samples from the inputs and outputs and the requirement is just to apply discrete delays to the measured signals the training of gp was carried out by the minimisation of the logarithmical marginal likelihood over the same data than narx nn the minimise function of rasmussen was employed to find the minimum value of the logarithmical marginal likelihood the results from the training can be seen in fig 10 for the condition of 1 m s and at 0 degrees it is observed that the variance follows and contains the pattern of the error 6 evaluation of models the evaluation of the models was undertaken by simulating a real deployment application the pressures captured in the towing tank at 0 75 m s at 0 degrees were used to calculate the vehicle speed all data points were provided to the trained model at each time interval in the case of the narx architectures the previously calculated data point was saved for the prediction of a new vehicle speed fig 11 presents the results of the three methodologies i e linear methodology narx nn and narx gp against the experimental data all methodologies are constrained by the absence of data at low speeds table 2 summarises the resulting rmse for different methods and shows that the rmse for the narx gp is the smallest and that the worst results are from the linear methodology the linear model was not trained with a low speed steady state as the noise of the towing tank and sensor resolution did not allow the capture of data the non linear methods were provided with data at low speed but it also important to note that the methodologies cannot be trusted at low speed 1 0 m s as the noise levels affect the training the linear methodology was found to be weak in the calculating of the non linear behaviour of the vehicle as expected but is also highly affected by the noise encountered in the experiment which results in a substantial overestimation for speeds less than 0 2 m s narx nn shows an overall improvement in the calculation of the speed compared to the linear methodology but it does not capture the non linear trends as precisely as the gps model e g the acceleration slope and the overshoot as the vehicle achieves the desired speed it is also noted that the gps methodology has another advantage by providing the standard deviation as a measurement of confidence e g at low speed the variance increases representing the difficulty of detecting low speeds filters can exploit this measurement of confidence such as the unscented kalman filter 7 conclusion the pressure sensor array for underwater vehicles can be an important addition to the arsenal of sensors for position estimation of a uv however the commonly adopted linear methodology in data processing does not account for non linear behaviour in the relationship between pressure and vehicle speed in the presence of acceleration the experiment in the towing tank showed that acceleration has a substantial non linear effect on the relationship the experimental data were further used to probe the performance of non linear methodologies to estimate vehicle speed based on pressure sensor data the proposed non linear methodologies i e narx nn and narx gp show the advantage of including non linear capabilities in the post processing of pressure measurements narx nn and narx gp show a higher capability to predict the vehicle velocity with acceleration present the best methodology over the experimental data was narx gp showing superior capability to nn in predicting the non linear behaviour of the relationship between pressure and velocity with the addition of a confidence measurement further experiments with this sensor array system are required to prove that the methodologies presented in this paper can be used in commercial vehicles in a subsequent set of control experiments with the platform the sensor array was kept active to test the sensor array in these experiments the data was not useable for further training or validation as the external measurement system was not able to calculate the vehicle velocity accurately in all three dimensions and the experiment space was too small for the vehicle to reach a steady speed an in vehicle or external doppler velocity system is required to measure the vehicle speed and allows the post processing functions to be trained acknowledgement the authors thank defence science and technology group for the loan of the vehicle mullaya to the australian maritime college and constant support on

21656,in ports and waterways the impacts of external navigational factors may lead to serious incidents due to limited space for ship maneuvering using nautical traffic models these incidents can be predicted in advance in current studies of nautical traffic models the impacts of wind and current on ship behavior are seldom considered when modeling the ship behavior in a port area the numerical maneuvering models simulate the individual ship behavior under such impacts by calculating the hydrodynamic forces working on the ship s hull however the input maneuvering particulars of individual ships are not available in ports in order to fill the knowledge gap of estimating ship behavior under external impacts without detailed ship maneuvering information the impacts of wind and current on the observed dynamic ship behavior speed over ground and leeway and drift angle in ports and waterways have been investigated by analyzing automatic identification system data showing ship paths over time and the meteorological and hydrological data collected from the port of rotterdam the relation between unhindered speed variation and ship size is revealed the regression analysis results on ships with similar size indicate the differences between wind and current impacts especially for small ships the current impact on speed over ground outweighs the wind while the wind influences the leeway and drift angle more than the current based on the quantified impact variation over ship size the proposed impact mechanism explains the variance of speed over ground and leeway and drift angle some conventional sailing habits based on good seamanship such as a series of small angle alterations rather than direct turning at waypoints are also revealed by the statistical analyses considering the variation of wind and current conditions in the study area the analysis result provides generic quantitative insights into the wind and current impacts on the individual behavior of ships of different sizes these mathematical formulations can be adopted in a microscopic nautical traffic model to include the impacts of external conditions keywords ais data ship behavior external disturbance wind impact current impact ports and waterways 1 introduction seaborne transport has been an important means of international freight transport which accounted for over 80 percent of the global trade by volume and more than 70 percent by value until 2017 and grew by another 4 percent in 2018 united nations conference on trade and development 2018 according to this forecasting of unctad the maritime trade is projected to expand at an annual growth rate of 3 8 percent between 2018 and 2023 due to the large amount of cargo carried by individual ships and the high frequency of ships visiting the hub ports nautical traffic safety in ports has been an important and sensitive issue for nautical traffic management and port authorities unlike the large space for ship maneuvering at sea the maneuverability is restricted under different external conditions such as strong wind and current in ports and inland waterways in such areas the impacts of external navigational factors may lead to more serious consequences such as grounding or collision with vast loss of life and property and damage to the environment and local infrastructure thus the understanding of external navigational impacts on ship behavior in real life situations will benefit the effective management of nautical traffic considering the external conditions in the seaports and inland waterways to analyze and simulate the maritime traffic considering individual ship behavior in an area various models have been developed which are compared by zhou et al 2019a from the ship behavior modeling perspective however external conditions such as wind and current have seldom been considered in the models even though it has been proven that the external factors do influence the ship behavior kepaptsoglou et al 2015 shu et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 in the numerical models to simulate individual ship behavior considering the specific maneuverability the effects of wind tidal current and waves on moving ships are significant due to the hydrodynamic forces and moments working on the ship s hull chen et al 2015 soda et al 2012 using the detailed data of individual ship maneuverability the wind wave and current forces are estimated which provides an accurate prediction of the ship behavior under the external conditions in the nautical traffic models considering external environmental factors two methods have been adopted to indicate such impacts the simplified method is to introduce random variables qi et al 2017 qu and meng 2012 or generic rules almaz et al 2006 camci et al 2009 merrick et al 2003 it shows a generic random variation of ship movement under external impacts which is feasible when describing the traffic flows at an aggregated level however the corresponding mechanism of such impacts is not included when investigating the behavior of individual ships on the contrary the other method is to consider the maneuverability of each individual ship under specific wind and current conditions to model the corresponding behavior beschnidt and gilles 2005 leguit 1999 sarıöz et al 2002 this method specifies the hydrodynamic processes and requires maneuvering particulars for specific ships for model calibration which cannot be used for simulation of generic nautical traffic in an area therefore in the field of nautical traffic modeling considering individual ship behavior the research gap is that neither method can be applied to model the wind and current impacts for different ships in an area where the maneuverability particulars of individual ships are unavailable in order to investigate ship behavior automatic identification system ais data have proven to be a valuable source yang et al 2019 to analyze macroscopic navigation patterns or the nautical traffic characteristics in an area ais data are widely used due to its detailed record of behavior for almost all passing ships altan and otay 2017 gao et al 2017 gunnar aarsæther and moan 2009 silveira et al 2013 to analyze the safety distance during collision avoidance considering ship drift the external forces can be considered by the difference between heading and course in ais data altan 2018 since ais equipment has been mandatory for most of the ships the data can be obtained by all port authorities which can be utilized to analyze the behavior in a port or other area in this research ais data is collected to describe the ship behavior under different external conditions including wind current and visibility thus the meteorological and hydrological data are also collected by comparing the average behavior in hindered and unhindered behavior the impacts of external factors including wind current visibility and encounters are found shu et al 2017 combining ais data with meteorological and hydrological data the impacts of wind and current on ship behavior have been qualitatively analyzed and presented zhou et al 2017 it shows that both ship speed and lateral position in a waterway are affected by wind and current where the wind and current directions are categorized into four directions being from the bow the stern the port side and the starboard side the impacts found are different for ships of different sizes however the qualitative analysis results cannot be used to estimate the behavior of different ships under different wind and current conditions in an area the aim of this paper is to quantitatively analyze and estimate the impacts of external conditions wind and current on ship behavior in ports and waterways where the actual hydrodynamic forces cannot be calculated due to the unavailability of individual ship particulars to focus on the wind and current the impacts of visibility and ship encounter are eliminated by filtering the external navigational conditions based on the previous qualitative analysis results and the theory in dead reckoning to estimate ship position a generic modeling paradigm of wind and current impacts on ship behavior is introduced using the ais data and the meteorological and hydrological data in the same period a regression analysis is performed to quantify the external navigational impacts on ship behavior expressed by speed over ground leeway and drift angle as a function of the ship s own size and the wind and current conditions the originality of this research is to reveal the mathematical formulations of ship behavior under the wind and current impacts without detailed ship particulars these mathematical formulations can thus be used in a microscopic nautical traffic model to include the impacts of external conditions it also provides the port authority with an insight into relations between ship behavior and external factors based on this aim the following research questions are proposed research question 1 what is the mathematical relation between the variation in speed over ground and ship size in unhindered situation research question 2 what is the mathematical formulation of ship behavior under the wind and current impacts considering ship size differences without individual ship maneuvering particulars in this paper the research area and the collected data set are introduced in section 2 section 3 explains the behavior variables and the proposed research approach the analysis results for wind and current impacts are presented in sections 4 section 5 concludes the paper with discussion and recommendations for further research 2 study area and data description in this section the study area is introduced in section 2 1 followed by the description of the data including ais data in section 2 2 and meteorological and hydrological data in section 2 3 these data have been collected for the whole year of 2014 by the port authority of rotterdam the ais data reveal the ship behavior in the study area regarding external conditions the meteorological data describe the condition of visibility and wind and the hydrological condition is represented by current velocity 2 1 study area the study area is a nearly straight waterway nieuwe waterweg located at the entrance of the port of rotterdam the netherlands as shown in fig 1 the reason for choosing an almost straight waterway for external impacts analysis is to eliminate the impact of a specific waterway layout on ship behavior in a curved waterway besides the impact of more complex current conditions due to the curve the bridge team on board also needs to hold the ship position to follow the direction of the waterway it leads to a large variation of ship behavior due to the maneuvering habits of individual officers when passing a curve thus the impacts of wind and current are hardly separated from the resulting trajectories in a curved waterway and a straight waterway is preferable to focus on such impacts however the study area is not exactly straight with parallel banks on both sides the impacts of such slight bending waterway layout may still exist in the analysis results but are considered to be negligible the total direction changes of the waterway stretch in the study area is about 2 the length of the study area is 2300 m and its width is about 650 m the changes the bridge team has to make to follow the waterway layout are therefore assumed to be negligible and all changes visible in the trajectory are attributed to the external conditions the traffic in the maasgeul channel see fig 1 splits into nieuwe waterweg and calandkanaal which are physically separated by a slightly bent mole named the splitsingsdam 2 2 ais data in this research ais data is used to describe the ship behavior under different external conditions the automatic identification system is an automated tracking system onboard ships to automatically transmit information about the ship to other ships and coastal authorities in 2000 the international maritime organization imo issued an amendment adopting a new requirement regarding the introduction of ais system in the international convention for the safety of life at sea international maritime organization 1974 by the end of 2004 the ais system was mandatory for all ships of 300 gross tonnage gt and more engaged on international voyages cargo ships of 500 gt and more not engaged in international voyages and all passenger ships irrespective of size inland ships both commercial and recreational and sailing vessels longer than 20 m are mandatory to use ais since december 1st 2014 according to the resolution by central commission for the navigation of the rhine 2013 the resolution applies to most of the inland vessels in the netherlands in the study area all seagoing ships including the ships below the gt limit of imo regulation have installed ais equipment and used it all the time as required by the local port authority since the year 2014 is a transition period the majority of the collected ais data of 2014 in the study area are seagoing ships the collected ais data in the study area contain 415 121 messages inbound 4300 ship trajectories by 215 926 messages outbound 4732 ship trajectories by 199 195 messages however the exact number of missed inland ship trajectories in ais data can hardly be estimated there could be some inland ships without ais equipment sailing in the area without record in the data which may affect the analyzed ship behavior the focus of this analysis remains to be seagoing ships recorded in the collected ais data one of the possible reasons that the data set contains less ais messages for outbound ships while there are more outbound ships is the different reporting interval of ships at different speed part of the outbound ships will take a left turn directing to calandkanaal and the speed will be low with longer reporting intervals and thus less ais messages compared to other ships according to the guidelines by international maritime organization 2003 the ais data contain three types of information 1 static information maritime mobile service identity number imo number ship name radio call sign ship type overall length beam etc 2 dynamic information utc time ship position speed over ground sog course over ground cog heading navigational status etc and 3 voyage related information draught destination etc the collected data set in text file has been processed from the original messages by an institute authorized by the local port authority the data processing includes the data formatting and the combination of ais data radar data and the ship information in the system of ivs informative verwerkend system in dutch information processing system in english the document of data processing between the institute and the port of rotterdam is not released in public thus no reference can be cited due to confidentiality agreement the format of the collected data after the official processing are listed in table 1 the static information is entered into the ais system by the equipment provider when the equipment is initially installed or after a major change of the ship structure according to the study on ais data reliability by harati mokhtari et al 2007 mmsi number ship name and call sign are fully correct for all ships to ensure the reliability of the ship identity information for the collected data set the mmsi number and the imo number of the ships have been checked with the identification in the system of ivs besides when a ship enters the port a temporary track number for the voyage is marked by the local authority together with this track number the trajectories are uniquely identified in the data set however the information inconsistency problem of vessel type occurs in most of the ships while the information of length and beam is mostly reliable the dynamic information is automatically updated based on the sensor data in the collected data set the x position y position and heading values from the sources of radar and ais are checked while cog only derives from ais data according to the technical recommendations by international telecommunication union 2014 the precision of cog is 0 1 while 1 for heading however as can be seen from table 1 the precision of both cog and heading is 1 in the data set in this research for each message the value of heading is deemed reliable when the data are consistent from the two sources while the value cog is adopted when the other dynamic information are all consistent as indicated by the international telecommunication union 2014 the reporting interval depends on the ship speed and course alteration for the ships in the study area with small course changes the time interval is 6 s when speed is larger than 14 knots 7 2 m s and 10 s for ships at speed lower than the value the dynamic trajectories of inbound and outbound ships in the study area are illustrated in fig 2 besides the layout sketch the bouys in the area are also marked it can be observed that all ships sail within the boundaries marked by the buoys the voyage related information should be manually updated to the real time situation by the officers on board the actual draught may indicate the loading condition of the ship which affects the ship s maneuverability however in the collected data set errors are found in the draught information the draught of most ships in the data set is not updated on each voyage for some ships the value of draught equals the molded draught in the registration other ships are recorded with a draught of 0 m or an unreasonable small value in the data set bailey et al 2008 also show that 31 of the investigated messages have obvious errors in draught information it implies that the data of ship draught are not reliable thus these are not included in the analyses of this paper reliable ship draught data would have indicated the water depth that a ship is involved in since the current direction and speed can be different over the water depth in tidal waterway the impact of current actually working on ship s hull can be analyzed with the draught information 2 3 meteorological and hydrological data to analyze the impacts of wind and current on ship behavior the wind and current conditions during the sailing of the ships are needed i e the velocity of both wind and current thus the meteorological and hydrological data in the study area are collected the meteorological condition refers to wind and visibility both are measured at different stations in the study area see fig 1 the wind velocity is measured at an interval of 5 min while the visibility is measured every minute in non extreme weather conditions there is no sudden change of wind within 5 min thus the measuring frequency of the data is sufficient in presenting the external conditions the wind and visibility can be deemed to be homogeneous for the whole area in the study area there are some artificial dunes and the storage tanks for lng on the south side of the waterway but without any high rise buildings on land considering the scale and distance to the waterway it is assumed that there is no impact on the wind and visibility in the area thus the measuring data at a single station represents the wind and visibility conditions in the whole area the wind direction probability in the study area is visualized by the wind rose diagram in fig 3 it can be observed that the wind direction is changing over the year which is seldom parallel to the direction of the waterway wnw ese it means for ships sailing in the study area besides the wind from the bow or stern direction there is lateral forces on the ship hull by the crosswind for most of the time which causes leeway in the observed ship behavior the complexity of wind conditions is sufficient in the area to analyze the wind impact on ship behavior according to the collected data the time with visibility distance less than 1000 m holds 0 52 of the year while the frequency of visibility less than 2000 m is 4 87 when the visibility is less than 2000 m specific restriction measures are applied by the local port authority port of rotterdam 2014 e g entry restriction specific traffic guidance by vessel traffic service center etc thus the number of ship trajectories in restricted visibility is limited and the reflected ship behavior involves the effects of local restrictions we have removed the trajectories of the ships sailing in restricted visibility as this paper focuses on the impacts of wind and current the data of visibility will be used to filter the sailing situation under restricted visibility i e to exclude the impact of visibility on ship behavior speed as revealed by other researchers shu et al 2017 the hydrological condition is represented by the velocity of the current in the waterway the ship behavior is influenced via the hydrodynamic forces and moments working on the ship s hull under different current conditions unlike wind and visibility the measured current velocity at a specific measuring station is not representative for the whole area due to the propagation of flow and the velocity variation over the water depth thus the current velocity field is calculated by the port authority using the simona model vollebregt et al 2003 using the measured water level from eight stations around the port as input the modeled velocity has been validated by comparing it to the measured velocity at one station in the area the collected data describe the current velocity in 41 7 orthogonal curvilinear grids with a resolution of about 85 m see fig 1 the current velocity in each grid cell is presented by 10 layers with the same depth averaged by the water depth of the grid at an interval of 15 min for most of the ships the length is larger than 85 m so the grid resolution is sufficiently accurate during each movement of the ships the current velocity is instantly updated the current velocity varies among grids and over water depth the studied waterway links the inland waterway and the sea with natural physical boundaries on both sides see fig 1 which is a tidal reach through the ebb and flood of the tides the current directions in all grids at different water depth do not always follow the sailing direction of the ships or the direction of the waterway 3 research approach this research uses ais data to statistically investigate the impact of wind and current on ship behavior via a regression analysis approach in this section the behavior variables in the ais data and the wind and current directions are illustrated in the coordinate system with an introduction of the underlying assumptions of the research the data analysis method is explained in steps including the data preparation and the approach to answer the two research questions proposed in section 1 3 1 behavior variables and their coordinate system the coordinate system to present dynamic ship motion is shown in fig 4 it consists of the space fixed coordinate system o 0 x 0 y 0 and the moving ship fixed coordinate system o x y compared to the geographical coordinate system the x direction points to the true north the ship heading ψ is defined as the angle between x and x 0 axes the behavior variables discussed in this paper are the resulting behavior of all factors see fig 4 rather than the ship maneuvering variables which are not known e g rudder angle and engine rate among the presented behavior variables v s o g ψ and ϕ are directly collected from ais data the difference between ψ and ϕ is defined as γ which is the leeway and drift angle indicating the angular deviation due to the external impacts when the ship moves into the heading direction i e ϕ ψ γ equals to zero which can happen in two situations one situation is that the external conditions do not affect the ship behavior at all the other situation is that the different external impacts on ship behavior compensate each other so the sum of directional impacts is zero this way the combination of v s o g and γ can present the dynamic motion of a ship during sailing similarly to directly represent the ship motion in longitudinal and lateral directions the velocity components of v s o g in x and y directions namely u and v can be calculated these two variables in the ship fixed coordinate system o x y directly describe the ship motion of surge and sway during the data analysis two sets of behavior variables v s o g γ and u v have been tested both sets basically describe the same phenomenon of the ship motion in which one is described in the space fixed coordinate system and the other in the ship fixed coordinate system the results are similar and part of the corresponding results shown in appendix thus in this paper only the results for v s o g and γ which are derived directly from ais data are explained in detail besides the ship behavior variables the directions of wind and current are illustrated in the coordinate system according to common practice the direction of wind θ w describes which direction the wind is from while the direction of current θ c indicates the direction into which the water flows the visibility is indicated by the visibility distance without specific direction indicated 3 2 assumptions and generic expression of the wind and current impact in this paper the following assumptions are applied to simplify the process besides the wind and current impacts analyzed in detail in this paper the ship maneuvering in confined waterways and the human factors of the bridge team will affect the ship behavior variables described in fig 4 however the impacts of human factors are not investigated in this research it is assumed that the waterway layout and sailing direction approach to or departure from a port affect the ship behavior the ships slightly change course to follow the waterway and the inbound ships decelerate when approaching to the terminal thus the behavior of inbound and outbound ships is separately investigated however these two factors are not quantitatively analyzed in this paper due to a lack of data on individual terminals of departure and destination in unhindered situations ships of similar size are assumed to maintain similar behavior considering the inertia of ships the bridge teams onboard ships of similar size are assumed to take similar maneuvering decisions under the impacts of wind and current the resulting behavior of such ships is assumed to be similar thus ship size is the only internal factor to distinguish ships in this paper irrespective of the maneuverability differences among individual ships without an encounter with other ships the behavior of a ship in good visibility is assumed to be affected by the external factors of wind current the bridge teams are expected to take action based on the information of ship size wind and current in line with good seamanship when considering the impacts of wind and current on ship speed the linear combination form has been widely accepted for ship behavior modeling when considering ship as an integral rigid body and using the maneuvering particulars of individual ships beschnidt and gilles 2005 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 in their models considering such impacts the mass or the weights regarding the under and above water parts of the hull for individual ships are needed to estimate the wind and current forces on the hull the method of dead reckoning to estimate ship position is used to calculate the difference between heading and cog as the addition of leeway angle caused by wind and drift angle caused by current ni et al 2010 combining the above assumptions a generic expression of speed over ground and leeway and drift angle under the impacts of wind and current can be formed as follows while the detailed elaboration of each impact is given in section 3 3 3 1 v s o g f s o g s i z e s s f s o g w i n d v w θ w ϕ s s f s o g c u r r e n t v c θ c ϕ s s ε s o g 2 γ f α w i n d v w θ w v s o g ψ s s f β c u r r e n t v c θ c v s o g ψ s s ε γ where s s denotes the size of a ship the functions f behavior variable factor explain the detailed impact mechanisms of each factor γ is the sum of the leeway angle α and the drift angle β ε s o g and ε γ are included in the equations to represent the behavior variation of individual ship due to the bridge team onboard the bank effects on ship behavior or the proactive deceleration acceleration when approaching departing the terminals are not considered either 3 3 data analysis method the flow diagram in fig 5 illustrates the steps of the research approach which are further explained in this section the collected data are first processed to generate the data sets of ship behavior analyzed in this paper then two phases of data analysis are developed to answer the research questions proposed in section 1 respectively the data set of unhindered behavior is used to explain the speed variation of ships due to the size differences based on this result the impacts of wind and current are investigated using the whole data set of ship behavior 3 3 1 data preparation since the port authority of rotterdam only stores the mandatory fields in ais data the ship size characterization is limited to length beam and draught however the information on draught is not reliable since too many errors are found thus in this paper only length and beam are adopted as the proxy for ship size during the data processing the first step of the data preparation the raw ais data are filtered this so called data cleaning is performed using two steps firstly the messages with sensor type marked as radar only are filtered since there are no ais information for these ships the second step is to filter the messages with inconsistent information from radar and ais during this step the values of dynamic information are checked the clean ais data are linked with the meteorological and hydrological data based on the time and ship position in each ais message the drift angle γ is calculated for each ais message the resulting data set contains ship behavior in all external conditions as stated in section 1 to focus on the impacts of wind and current the impacts of visibility and ship encounter should be eliminated in line with the preliminary analysis result visibility 2000 m is defined as good visibility to avoid the impact of restricted visibility on ship behavior zhou et al 2017 in order to exclude the impact of ship encounters the processed data set has filtered the trajectories of ships with any encounter with another ship in the study area the three types of encounters identified in the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs are considered namely head on overtaking and crossing situations if more than two ships are involved the situation is deemed as a combination of several two ships encounters of the above mentioned types the crossing situation can be easily distinguished by the relative position between ships while the overtaking situation is characterized by the speed differences and position changes in between over time a head on situation at sea is defined when one ship is coming towards the other one roughly within 6 on either side of the heading considering the length and width of the waterway in the study area the head on situation is identified and filtered when one ship encountering the other from the opposite direction in the study area so far the resulting data set includes all ship behavior in good visibility and without any encounter of another ship the wind and current conditions are not used to filter any ship behavior data to further elaborate the behavior variation due to ship size a data set in the unhindered situation is prepared the thresholds have been previously analyzed which characterize the situation by visibility 2000 m wind speed 8 m s 15 55 knots and current speed 0 37 m s 0 72 knots zhou et al 2017 however it should be noticed that the weak impacts of wind and current still exist in such a situation thus when analyzing the impacts of wind and current the whole data set including both hindered and unhindered situations will be used since the waterway is not exactly straight with parallel banks on both sides the impacts of the slightly bending waterway layout may affect the ship behavior as stated in the assumptions besides the sailing direction may influence the speed of a ship in the unhindered situation thus the data set of inbound and outbound ships in the study area is separated and analyzed independently by comparing the analysis results of these two data sets it can prove whether the impacts of these two factors can be qualitatively proved 3 3 2 variation of unhindered speed due to ship size in respect of the unhindered ship behavior the speed variations among ships of different sizes have been observed shu et al 2013 zhou et al 2019b 2015 however the direct relationship between ship size and sog is still not revealed which is represented by f s o g s i z e s s in the generic expression of the impact mechanism it is expected to find an isolate function to appropriately describe such a relationship using the data set of ship behavior in the unhindered situation thus during the quantitative analysis of the wind and current impacts on ships of different sizes the unhindered sog of such different ships can be first estimated the detailed steps to analyze speed variation due to ship size are present in fig 6 firstly a correlation analysis between unhindered sog and ship size length and beam is performed it is to indicate the strength of correlation relationship in between and identify which size criterion better characterizes the ship behavior variation using the selected ship size criterion the function to estimate the relationship with ship behavior is tested with monotonic elementary function types which is considering the findings of behavior variation over ship size by shu et al 2013 the function type yielding the highest estimate result is adopted to describe the variation of unhindered ship behavior due to ship size in case of the speed variation that is not monotonic as found in the preliminary analysis zhou et al 2017 a piecewise function will be adopted for ships divided by the size threshold where the variation pattern changes the variation of sog in the unhindered situation due to ship size can be described by f s o g s i z e s s in equation 1 using the determined function form in the following section analyzing the wind and current impact the variation due to ship size will also be considered 3 3 3 impacts of wind and current to quantify the impacts of wind and current on different ships three steps in general will be taken as shown in fig 7 firstly the functions to describe the mechanism of wind and current impacts in equations 1 and 2 need to be determined which specifies the form of regression models secondly the regression analysis will be performed using the subsets of ship behavior with a similar ship size the estimated results of all subsets will indicate whether the wind and current impacts vary among different sizes of ships finally the overall functions to describe the wind and current impacts considering the variation pattern over ship size will be specified with coefficients estimated directly using the whole data set of ship behavior in the following each step will be elaborated upon step 1 specifying the wind and current impact mechanism as explained in the generic expression of the impact mechanism the impacts of wind and current are assumed to be linear this assumption could be tested by the calculation of hydrodynamic forces and moments working on the ship s hull however as the detailed ship particulars of each individual ship cannot be collected from ais data the wind and current impact mechanism are expressed using the generic ship size information and the wind and current velocity as shown in equations 3 and 4 comparing to the estimate using specific information such generic ship particulars may lead to a less accurate estimate result but the method can be applied to estimate the ship behavior in a port where the specific particulars for all visiting ships are unknown 3 v s o g c s o g s f s o g s s s c s o g w f s o g w s s v w cos ϕ θ w c s o g c f s o g c s s v c cos θ c ϕ c s o g 4 γ c α w f α w s s v w v s o g 2 sin ψ θ w c β c f β c s s arcsin v c v s o g sin θ c ψ c γ where f s o g s s s denotes the variation of unhindered speed due to ship size v w v c and θ w θ c describe the speed and direction of wind and current the functions f behavior variable factor s s explain the variation of external impacts for different size of ships the coefficients c behavior variable factor will be estimated by the regression analysis since not all factors affecting ship behavior have been analyzed in the model a constant c s o g and c γ has been added to each model to represent the impacts due to other unexplained factors the unhindered speed that a ship maintains when no effects of wind and current is assumed to be affected by the ship size which is analyzed in section 3 3 2 regarding the external impact on ship s sog it is represented by the projection of wind current velocity on the direction of v s o g in equation 3 the direction of velocity vector has been considered in the projection calculation based on the theory of dead reckoning to estimate the ship position the drift angle γ is the sum of the leeway angle α due to the wind and the drift angle β for the current in equation 4 bowditch 2017 the leeway angle is calculated according to the empirical equation for water surface leeway analysis richardson 1997 however the coefficients are achieved by field experiments for specific physical objects which can be only applied for specific circumstances thus using ais data combining the meteorological and hydrological data the coefficients will be estimated by regression analysis the obtained results can be applied to predict such impacts on the ship behavior in the area the drift angle is calculated in the current triangle adopting the law of sines using the angle between the current direction and heading current speed and sog step 2 estimating the impacts on ship behavior with similar size in the previous analysis the impacts on different sizes of ships are observed to be different as well zhou et al 2017 but it is still unknown whether the cause of such differences is occasional fluctuation or due to the relationship with ship size to answer this question a quantified analysis is performed for ships in bins which groups the ships with the same or similar size the analysis results are compared to identify whether the impacts vary along with the change of ship size the whole data set is split into subsets of ship behavior according to the ship size the variation of unhindered ship behavior due to ship size f s o g s s s has been revealed in section 3 3 1 the regression analysis will be performed based on equations 5 and 6 for each subset of ship behavior data 5 v s o g c s o g s f s o g s s s c s o g w v w cos ϕ θ w c s o g c v c cos θ c ϕ c s o g 6 γ c α w v w v s o g 2 sin ψ θ w c β c arcsin v c v s o g sin θ c ψ c γ compared to equations 3 and 4 the functions to represent impact variation for different ships have been removed since these models will be applied for ships with the same or similar size f test and t test are used to determine the significance of the estimated models and the coefficients a 0 05 significance level is adopted the models are estimated using standardized scores z scores to obtain the standardized coefficients the results of standardized coefficients of wind and current impacts can be compared within each subset the comparison results present the weights of wind and current impacts on ship behavior for this size of ships step 3 estimating the impacts on ship behavior for ships of different sizes to identify whether the external impacts change along with the ship size or not the correlation analysis is performed using the estimated coefficients of wind current impacts with the average ship size of each bin if the correlation is significant at the level of 0 01 p value the impact of the external factor on the behavior variable is deemed as related to the ship size if the correlation is not significant it implies that the wind current impact is not strongly correlated to the ship size it can also be because that the local wind current speed are quite small or the ship size range is limited the correlation in between cannot be revealed based on the data set the function to estimate the relationship between external impact and ship size should be removed in equations 3 and 4 for the impacts significantly correlated to ship size the function type to describe the variation is determined by selecting the function yielding the highest estimate result with the estimated functions f s o g w s s f s o g c s s f α w s s f β c s s the generic regression models of each behavior variable for all ships with different size are determined the models will be estimated using the whole data set of ship behavior the final estimated regression model explains the quantitative impacts of wind and current on ship behavior 4 results and discussions since the ship speed is influenced by the proactive maneuvering for approaching departing a port i e the inbound ships mostly decelerate while the outbound ships accelerate and the course is influenced by the waterway layout the behavior of inbound and outbound ships is independently analyzed during the process to determine the form of the regression model the results are similar for both inbound and outbound ships only the results for inbound ships are presented and explained in detail for the estimation of the final regression model both results will be shown and the reasons for the differences are discussed 4 1 variation of speed due to ship size in order to intuitively estimate the relationship between ship size and speed the speed over ground v s o g in the unhindered situation is visualized as a function of ship size in fig 8 in the boxplot the distribution of ship speed within each bin is shown it can be found for the first several groups of small ships and the last couple of large ship groups the difference between the 25 and 75 percentile is rather small or rather large this is because the number of ships within such groups are small which leads to a large variation of the observations due to individual behavior differences however by comparing the median value of the bins the overall variation pattern can be observed for small ships the speed increases when the ship size grows to maintain the maneuverability in the narrow waterway for large ships the value gradually decreases to a certain stable state when the size becomes larger since the large ships cannot sail too fast in case of emergent maneuvering with big inertia thus to use a single function describe the variation pattern is not feasible in the previous sensitivity analysis for qualitative analysis the threshold to distinguish small or large ships is 150 m for length and 23 m for beam which also holds for the pattern shown in fig 8 zhou et al 2017 it means the length or beam from ais data can be used to categorize the ships as small or large ones to further identify which of the ship size length or beam best describes the speed over ground the correlation analysis between unhindered speed and ship size has been performed as shown in table 2 in the data set the ship length ranges between 24 m and 333 m while the beam varies between 8 m and 60 m according to the correlation analysis results the ship beam is expected to better describe the relationship between v s o g and ship size than ship length thus in the remaining part of this paper the beam is selected as the proxy for ship size during the quantitative analysis of wind and current impacts to estimate the relationship between v s o g and ship beam four types of monotonic elementary functions have been tested for small and large ships respectively the estimated results are presented in table 3 it should be noticed that the low r 2 value of the estimate result is due to ignoring other factors affecting ship behavior even in unhindered situations there is still wind and current influencing ship behavior and other unexplained factors as well ideally the function f s o g s s s to explain the relation between sog and beam adopts the function type yielding the highest estimate result however it leads to different types of functions for small and large ships logarithmic function for small ships and exponential function for large ships which will result in different forms of the regression model for different ship sizes the aim of this paper is to find a generic model form for all ships comparing the overall performance of four function types to different ships the result of logarithmic function ranks the best for small ships and the second best for large ships when estimating the behavior for large ships the difference of r 2 to the best function type exponential function is 0 003 which is acceptable thus the logarithmic function is adopted to describe the relationship between v s o g and the ship beam the function f s o g s s s is included as log b in equation 3 4 2 quantification of wind and current impacts on ship behavior in this section the regression analysis results of wind and current impacts on subsets of ships with similar size are firstly explained the results quantitatively compare the wind and current impacts on similar ships and prove whether the impacts vary with ship size then the analysis results considering the external impact variation among the different sizes of ships are presented 4 2 1 wind and current impacts on similar sized ships the whole data set of ship behavior is split into subsets with the same or similar ship beam the bin size is mostly set as 1 m while for beams smaller than 10 m or larger than 32 m the bin size is set as 5 m to include sufficient data more than 30 ships in each subset the regression models in equations 5 and 6 for v s o g and γ are estimated for each subset of ship behavior with similar beams since the speed of wind is much larger than current in measured values the estimated unstandardized coefficients are not directly comparable however the standardized coefficients are estimated from the standardized regression analysis where the variances of variables are 1 they explain which of wind and current impacts have a greater influence on ship behavior in this multiple regression model these coefficients of wind and current for the two behavior variables in each subset are presented in fig 9 and fig 10 as an example similar results for surge and sway speed u and v are shown in appendix two comparisons are taken to interpret the estimated standardized coefficients when looking at the standardized coefficients for similar size within the same subset the weights of wind and current impacts can be compared for small ships the impact of current on v s o g is dominant compared to the impact of wind but for large ships the impact differences are becoming smaller the speed of a ship is mainly provided by the propeller which is underwater and affected by the current for large ships with high superstructures the wind area is also large the wind impact may outweigh the current while the difference is small however for the impact on leeway and drift angle α and β the impact of wind is mostly larger than current it means in the port area when the officers onboard change heading to prepare leeway and drift angle the wind direction would be the primary factor for their decision for large ships the wind and current impacts are comparable probably due to the large draught underwater the other comparison is between the coefficients for different groups of ships which indicates the variation of the external impacts among ships of different sizes it can be observed that for small ships both impacts of wind and current on sog decrease when the ships get larger for small ships the smaller size usually comes with smaller inertia to maneuver in emergent circumstances thus those ships do not consume extra fuel to compensate the influences of wind and current but the larger ships in this group need to keep their speed either for basic maneuvering requirements or for emergent maneuvering however both impacts on the drift angle slightly increase with the increase of ship size which is due to the larger wind and current forces on ship hull and propeller for large ships the variation of wind and current impacts are not always the same when the ships get larger the impact of wind on sog gradually increases but the impact on the leeway angle fluctuates with a decrease because for very large ships the wind forces on superstructures are large once the maneuvering requirement can be fulfilled the ships will not spend extra effort consumption of more fuel to compensate such impact on speed but for leeway angle such large ships need to avoid collision with banks under the wind forces thus the resulting impact on behavior seems smaller meanwhile for the impact of current the opposite relationship is presented the impact of current on sog for larger ships is smaller and the impact on the drift angle is larger the reasons are the same as for the impact of current on the group of small ships the regression analysis test on ship behavior with similar size proves the external impact variation which is in line with the preliminary qualitative analysis result and follows our expectation zhou et al 2017 the detailed quantification of such variation along with the size change will be determined by statistical analysis in the following section 4 2 2 wind and current impacts considering ship size variation to figure out the impact factors significantly varied among different sizes of ships the relationship between the unstandardized coefficients for wind current impact and ship beam are statistically tested by correlation analysis the correlation coefficients are listed in table 4 the p value of 0 01 is taken as the threshold of significant correlation the positive values indicate positive correlations in between while the negative coefficient refers to the negative correlation from the statistical test perspective for all behavior variables of both small and large ships the impact of wind varies without a strong correlation with ship size such variation can be caused by behavior differences among individual officers on board or other unexplained factors this way the corresponding functions in the regression model to indicate such correlation are removed from models in equations 3 and 4 including f s o g w s s f α w s s however for the impacts of current the coefficients are significantly correlated to the ship s size except for the impact on the drift angle for large ships therefore the functions presenting the relationship f s o g c s s f β c s s need to be elaborated to quantify such impact differences for the three significant correlations the same four types of monotonic elementary functions have been tested for each coefficient as presented in table 5 the ideal situation is to adopt a generic function form for all ships the same as the function to describe the variation of speed due to ship size however the correlation between the current impact on drift angle and the size of large ships is not significant while the one for small ships is significant see table 4 it leads to different forms of functions for small and large ships thus the functions best describing the relationship are adopted in the regression models to consider the impact variation due to ship size the corresponding functions in equations 3 and 4 are elaborated for small ships and large ships respectively as follows in the linear functions two coefficients need to be estimated for small ships ship beam 23 m 7 f s o g c s s s c s o g c s 1 b c s o g c s 2 8 f β c s s s c β c s 1 b c β c s 2 for large ships ship beam 23 m 9 f s o g c l s s c s o g c l b 1 so far the regression models for v s o g and γ to quantitatively analyze the wind and current impacts are generated for small and large ships the impact variation among the different sizes of ships is also included in this paper the models are estimated based on the data set of inbound and outbound ship behavior separately the estimation results of the regression analysis are shown in table 6 and table 7 according to the regression analysis results about 70 of the variance in sog of small ships can be explained by the ship size wind and current r 2 is 0 743 for inbound ships and 0 696 for outbound ships comparing the standardized coefficients the choice of sog in unhindered situation accounts for the major weight of the final sailing speed which is mostly determined due to the size of a ship it means the ships only adjust their speed in unhindered situation when there are the impacts of wind and current looking at the unstandardized coefficients of unhindered sog the estimation results for inbound and outbound ships are different which indicates the sailing direction also affects the speed choice the impact of current on sog of small ships both inbound and outbound ships outweighs the wind impact which is the same when performing the regression analysis for ships in bins with similar size see fig 9 however for large ships the explained variance drops to around 40 r 2 is 0 395 for inbound ships and 0 440 for outbound ships two reasons may explain this result firstly there is a large variation of sog for large ships in the unhindered situation even between the ships with similar size see fig 8 the variance of speed by individual ships cannot be precisely predicted by the generic model it also holds when comparing the results of inbound and outbound ships in which the model performs better for outbound ships than inbound ships when sailing in the study area most of the outbound ships try to reach their desired speed at sea however the inbound ships need to decelerate or keep their speed depending on the distance to their destination terminal which is different for individual ships thus there is more variation in the choice of speed for inbound ships the other reason is that the detailed impacts of wind and current on the speed of large ships need to consider the specific above and under water ship hull which is hard to achieve for ships in an area compared to the explanation of sog the wind and current impacts only account for 25 of the variance in leeway and drift angle which seems that the relationship between external factors and the drift angle is not very strong the standardized coefficients also indicate similar results according to the ordinary practice of seamen the set of leeway and drift angle is based on the surrounding sailing situation including wind current and waterway layout however the instant decision differs among individual officers onboard considering their sailing habit and experience in the same situation some officers may take several degrees of drift angle but the other officers may keep sailing without heading change even with the same wheel order the observed results of leeway and drift angle the difference between heading and cog still depend on the rate of turn of individual ships besides the precision of both heading and cog are the same as 1 in the collected data after the official data processing it can happen that the values are the same while there exist a small difference in actual situation or the leeway and drift angle is calculated where the actual difference is quite small at a precision of 0 1 therefore the explanation of the variance in γ is not as good as sog the signs of the coefficients together with the functions in the regression model explain the relationship between behavior variables and the impact of ship size wind and current the results prove that the theoretical expression of the impact mechanism and the revealed impact variation over ship size by analyzing the subsets of data are correct when analyzing the whole data set consisting of ships with different sizes comparing the weights of wind and current impacts by standardized coefficients in tables 6 and 7 the result for the whole data set is similar to the regression analysis using the subsets of inbound ship behavior with the same size see figs 9 and 10 which follows our expectation regarding the impacts on sog the current impact outweighs the wind however the impact of current on drift angle is slightly larger than the wind on leeway angle for the current impact on small ships c s o g c 2 and c β c 2 represents the generic impacts while c s o g c 1 and c β c 1 indicates the variation due to the size differences comparing their standardized estimates the weight of the direct impact of the current itself is larger than the correction regressor for ship size the constant in the model of sog plays a dual role on the one hand it corrects the unhindered speed due to ship size besides it includes the other impacts of unexplained external factors regarding the constant for γ it is expected to be zero in an ideal sailing situation without wind and current when sailing in the straight waterway however the estimated results are with different signs for inbound and outbound ships which are marked as grey in tables 6 and 7 the main reason is that the study area is not exactly straight with parallel banks see fig 1 for inbound ships the waterway slightly bends to the starboard side the negative sign of c γ indicates that the heading of a ship directs to the starboard side comparing to the o x direction of the ship fixed coordinate system it follows good seamanship that a ship will take a series of small angle alteration to follow the designed route rather than a sharp turning at the waypoint considering the ship maneuverability for outbound ships the positive sign represents the turning direction to the port side to follow the layout of the waterway it also proves that the leeway and drift angle of a ship in inland waterways is affected by the bank besides the wind and current impacts the bending direction of the waterway indicates the sign of the coefficient the estimated regression model provides a quantification of the wind and current impacts some behavior following good seamanship is also statistically revealed by the estimated regression model 5 conclusions this paper proposes a regression model to quantitatively analyze the impact of wind and current on ship behavior speed over ground and drift angle derived from ais data the variations of ship behavior and the external impacts due to the size differences are also included during the analysis the variation of speed over ground in the unhindered situation due to ship size can be observed the correlation analysis shows that the ship beam is better to indicate the relationship with v s o g than length which can be described through a logarithmic function the wind and current impact on ship behavior also vary for ships of different sizes for small ships both wind and current impacts on v s o g decrease when the ships get larger however for large ships the impact of wind on v s o g gradually increases along with growing ship size but the impact on the leeway angle fluctuates with a decrease the current impact on v s o g of larger ships is smaller but the impact on the drift angle is larger for the coefficients that are significantly correlated to the ship s size by correlation analysis the functions best estimate the relationship are adopted in the regression models according to the regression analysis results using the whole data set of ship behavior consisting of different sizes about 70 of the variance in v s o g of small ships can be explained by the factors of ship size wind and current the choice of v s o g in unhindered situation accounts for the major weight of the final sailing speed which is mainly due to the ship size however for large ships the explained variance drops to around 40 possibly due to the large variation in the unhindered situation and the complex interaction of wind and current forces on ship hull compared to v s o g the wind and current impacts only account for 25 of the variance in leeway and drift angle which is due to the instant decision differences between individual officers onboard and the maneuverability of individual ships the results prove that the proposed theoretical expression of the impact mechanism and the revealed impact variation over ship size by analyzing the subsets of data are correct the estimated regression model provides the quantitative relationship of wind and current impacts on ship behavior considering ship size variation some conventional sailing habits of course alteration to follow the designed route in line with good seamanship are also statistically revealed by the estimate results the analysis result could benefit both researchers and the port authority for the researcher a quantification of the impact mechanism of wind and current helps to further simulate ship behavior in such external conditions for the port authority the revealed insight into the relations between ship behavior and external factors will help the ship traffic management under different wind and current conditions and the corresponding risk control in port within this paper a nearly straight waterway is studied which eliminates the impact of the waterway layout on ship behavior as indicated by the estimated result a port area with the more complex layout should be analyzed to identify such impact according to the comparison of inbound and outbound ships the distance to destination or the sailing direction of approaching or departing from a terminal also affects the speed choice which can be further investigated based on a series of quantitative analyses looking into the relationship between the observed ship behavior and the external factors a new nautical traffic model can be expected to predict the ship behavior under different conditions credit authorship contribution statement yang zhou conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation writing original

online at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2020 107774 appendix as stated in section 3 1 the two sets of behavior variables v s o g γ and u v basically describe the same phenomenon of the ship motion

21656,in ports and waterways the impacts of external navigational factors may lead to serious incidents due to limited space for ship maneuvering using nautical traffic models these incidents can be predicted in advance in current studies of nautical traffic models the impacts of wind and current on ship behavior are seldom considered when modeling the ship behavior in a port area the numerical maneuvering models simulate the individual ship behavior under such impacts by calculating the hydrodynamic forces working on the ship s hull however the input maneuvering particulars of individual ships are not available in ports in order to fill the knowledge gap of estimating ship behavior under external impacts without detailed ship maneuvering information the impacts of wind and current on the observed dynamic ship behavior speed over ground and leeway and drift angle in ports and waterways have been investigated by analyzing automatic identification system data showing ship paths over time and the meteorological and hydrological data collected from the port of rotterdam the relation between unhindered speed variation and ship size is revealed the regression analysis results on ships with similar size indicate the differences between wind and current impacts especially for small ships the current impact on speed over ground outweighs the wind while the wind influences the leeway and drift angle more than the current based on the quantified impact variation over ship size the proposed impact mechanism explains the variance of speed over ground and leeway and drift angle some conventional sailing habits based on good seamanship such as a series of small angle alterations rather than direct turning at waypoints are also revealed by the statistical analyses considering the variation of wind and current conditions in the study area the analysis result provides generic quantitative insights into the wind and current impacts on the individual behavior of ships of different sizes these mathematical formulations can be adopted in a microscopic nautical traffic model to include the impacts of external conditions keywords ais data ship behavior external disturbance wind impact current impact ports and waterways 1 introduction seaborne transport has been an important means of international freight transport which accounted for over 80 percent of the global trade by volume and more than 70 percent by value until 2017 and grew by another 4 percent in 2018 united nations conference on trade and development 2018 according to this forecasting of unctad the maritime trade is projected to expand at an annual growth rate of 3 8 percent between 2018 and 2023 due to the large amount of cargo carried by individual ships and the high frequency of ships visiting the hub ports nautical traffic safety in ports has been an important and sensitive issue for nautical traffic management and port authorities unlike the large space for ship maneuvering at sea the maneuverability is restricted under different external conditions such as strong wind and current in ports and inland waterways in such areas the impacts of external navigational factors may lead to more serious consequences such as grounding or collision with vast loss of life and property and damage to the environment and local infrastructure thus the understanding of external navigational impacts on ship behavior in real life situations will benefit the effective management of nautical traffic considering the external conditions in the seaports and inland waterways to analyze and simulate the maritime traffic considering individual ship behavior in an area various models have been developed which are compared by zhou et al 2019a from the ship behavior modeling perspective however external conditions such as wind and current have seldom been considered in the models even though it has been proven that the external factors do influence the ship behavior kepaptsoglou et al 2015 shu et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 in the numerical models to simulate individual ship behavior considering the specific maneuverability the effects of wind tidal current and waves on moving ships are significant due to the hydrodynamic forces and moments working on the ship s hull chen et al 2015 soda et al 2012 using the detailed data of individual ship maneuverability the wind wave and current forces are estimated which provides an accurate prediction of the ship behavior under the external conditions in the nautical traffic models considering external environmental factors two methods have been adopted to indicate such impacts the simplified method is to introduce random variables qi et al 2017 qu and meng 2012 or generic rules almaz et al 2006 camci et al 2009 merrick et al 2003 it shows a generic random variation of ship movement under external impacts which is feasible when describing the traffic flows at an aggregated level however the corresponding mechanism of such impacts is not included when investigating the behavior of individual ships on the contrary the other method is to consider the maneuverability of each individual ship under specific wind and current conditions to model the corresponding behavior beschnidt and gilles 2005 leguit 1999 sarıöz et al 2002 this method specifies the hydrodynamic processes and requires maneuvering particulars for specific ships for model calibration which cannot be used for simulation of generic nautical traffic in an area therefore in the field of nautical traffic modeling considering individual ship behavior the research gap is that neither method can be applied to model the wind and current impacts for different ships in an area where the maneuverability particulars of individual ships are unavailable in order to investigate ship behavior automatic identification system ais data have proven to be a valuable source yang et al 2019 to analyze macroscopic navigation patterns or the nautical traffic characteristics in an area ais data are widely used due to its detailed record of behavior for almost all passing ships altan and otay 2017 gao et al 2017 gunnar aarsæther and moan 2009 silveira et al 2013 to analyze the safety distance during collision avoidance considering ship drift the external forces can be considered by the difference between heading and course in ais data altan 2018 since ais equipment has been mandatory for most of the ships the data can be obtained by all port authorities which can be utilized to analyze the behavior in a port or other area in this research ais data is collected to describe the ship behavior under different external conditions including wind current and visibility thus the meteorological and hydrological data are also collected by comparing the average behavior in hindered and unhindered behavior the impacts of external factors including wind current visibility and encounters are found shu et al 2017 combining ais data with meteorological and hydrological data the impacts of wind and current on ship behavior have been qualitatively analyzed and presented zhou et al 2017 it shows that both ship speed and lateral position in a waterway are affected by wind and current where the wind and current directions are categorized into four directions being from the bow the stern the port side and the starboard side the impacts found are different for ships of different sizes however the qualitative analysis results cannot be used to estimate the behavior of different ships under different wind and current conditions in an area the aim of this paper is to quantitatively analyze and estimate the impacts of external conditions wind and current on ship behavior in ports and waterways where the actual hydrodynamic forces cannot be calculated due to the unavailability of individual ship particulars to focus on the wind and current the impacts of visibility and ship encounter are eliminated by filtering the external navigational conditions based on the previous qualitative analysis results and the theory in dead reckoning to estimate ship position a generic modeling paradigm of wind and current impacts on ship behavior is introduced using the ais data and the meteorological and hydrological data in the same period a regression analysis is performed to quantify the external navigational impacts on ship behavior expressed by speed over ground leeway and drift angle as a function of the ship s own size and the wind and current conditions the originality of this research is to reveal the mathematical formulations of ship behavior under the wind and current impacts without detailed ship particulars these mathematical formulations can thus be used in a microscopic nautical traffic model to include the impacts of external conditions it also provides the port authority with an insight into relations between ship behavior and external factors based on this aim the following research questions are proposed research question 1 what is the mathematical relation between the variation in speed over ground and ship size in unhindered situation research question 2 what is the mathematical formulation of ship behavior under the wind and current impacts considering ship size differences without individual ship maneuvering particulars in this paper the research area and the collected data set are introduced in section 2 section 3 explains the behavior variables and the proposed research approach the analysis results for wind and current impacts are presented in sections 4 section 5 concludes the paper with discussion and recommendations for further research 2 study area and data description in this section the study area is introduced in section 2 1 followed by the description of the data including ais data in section 2 2 and meteorological and hydrological data in section 2 3 these data have been collected for the whole year of 2014 by the port authority of rotterdam the ais data reveal the ship behavior in the study area regarding external conditions the meteorological data describe the condition of visibility and wind and the hydrological condition is represented by current velocity 2 1 study area the study area is a nearly straight waterway nieuwe waterweg located at the entrance of the port of rotterdam the netherlands as shown in fig 1 the reason for choosing an almost straight waterway for external impacts analysis is to eliminate the impact of a specific waterway layout on ship behavior in a curved waterway besides the impact of more complex current conditions due to the curve the bridge team on board also needs to hold the ship position to follow the direction of the waterway it leads to a large variation of ship behavior due to the maneuvering habits of individual officers when passing a curve thus the impacts of wind and current are hardly separated from the resulting trajectories in a curved waterway and a straight waterway is preferable to focus on such impacts however the study area is not exactly straight with parallel banks on both sides the impacts of such slight bending waterway layout may still exist in the analysis results but are considered to be negligible the total direction changes of the waterway stretch in the study area is about 2 the length of the study area is 2300 m and its width is about 650 m the changes the bridge team has to make to follow the waterway layout are therefore assumed to be negligible and all changes visible in the trajectory are attributed to the external conditions the traffic in the maasgeul channel see fig 1 splits into nieuwe waterweg and calandkanaal which are physically separated by a slightly bent mole named the splitsingsdam 2 2 ais data in this research ais data is used to describe the ship behavior under different external conditions the automatic identification system is an automated tracking system onboard ships to automatically transmit information about the ship to other ships and coastal authorities in 2000 the international maritime organization imo issued an amendment adopting a new requirement regarding the introduction of ais system in the international convention for the safety of life at sea international maritime organization 1974 by the end of 2004 the ais system was mandatory for all ships of 300 gross tonnage gt and more engaged on international voyages cargo ships of 500 gt and more not engaged in international voyages and all passenger ships irrespective of size inland ships both commercial and recreational and sailing vessels longer than 20 m are mandatory to use ais since december 1st 2014 according to the resolution by central commission for the navigation of the rhine 2013 the resolution applies to most of the inland vessels in the netherlands in the study area all seagoing ships including the ships below the gt limit of imo regulation have installed ais equipment and used it all the time as required by the local port authority since the year 2014 is a transition period the majority of the collected ais data of 2014 in the study area are seagoing ships the collected ais data in the study area contain 415 121 messages inbound 4300 ship trajectories by 215 926 messages outbound 4732 ship trajectories by 199 195 messages however the exact number of missed inland ship trajectories in ais data can hardly be estimated there could be some inland ships without ais equipment sailing in the area without record in the data which may affect the analyzed ship behavior the focus of this analysis remains to be seagoing ships recorded in the collected ais data one of the possible reasons that the data set contains less ais messages for outbound ships while there are more outbound ships is the different reporting interval of ships at different speed part of the outbound ships will take a left turn directing to calandkanaal and the speed will be low with longer reporting intervals and thus less ais messages compared to other ships according to the guidelines by international maritime organization 2003 the ais data contain three types of information 1 static information maritime mobile service identity number imo number ship name radio call sign ship type overall length beam etc 2 dynamic information utc time ship position speed over ground sog course over ground cog heading navigational status etc and 3 voyage related information draught destination etc the collected data set in text file has been processed from the original messages by an institute authorized by the local port authority the data processing includes the data formatting and the combination of ais data radar data and the ship information in the system of ivs informative verwerkend system in dutch information processing system in english the document of data processing between the institute and the port of rotterdam is not released in public thus no reference can be cited due to confidentiality agreement the format of the collected data after the official processing are listed in table 1 the static information is entered into the ais system by the equipment provider when the equipment is initially installed or after a major change of the ship structure according to the study on ais data reliability by harati mokhtari et al 2007 mmsi number ship name and call sign are fully correct for all ships to ensure the reliability of the ship identity information for the collected data set the mmsi number and the imo number of the ships have been checked with the identification in the system of ivs besides when a ship enters the port a temporary track number for the voyage is marked by the local authority together with this track number the trajectories are uniquely identified in the data set however the information inconsistency problem of vessel type occurs in most of the ships while the information of length and beam is mostly reliable the dynamic information is automatically updated based on the sensor data in the collected data set the x position y position and heading values from the sources of radar and ais are checked while cog only derives from ais data according to the technical recommendations by international telecommunication union 2014 the precision of cog is 0 1 while 1 for heading however as can be seen from table 1 the precision of both cog and heading is 1 in the data set in this research for each message the value of heading is deemed reliable when the data are consistent from the two sources while the value cog is adopted when the other dynamic information are all consistent as indicated by the international telecommunication union 2014 the reporting interval depends on the ship speed and course alteration for the ships in the study area with small course changes the time interval is 6 s when speed is larger than 14 knots 7 2 m s and 10 s for ships at speed lower than the value the dynamic trajectories of inbound and outbound ships in the study area are illustrated in fig 2 besides the layout sketch the bouys in the area are also marked it can be observed that all ships sail within the boundaries marked by the buoys the voyage related information should be manually updated to the real time situation by the officers on board the actual draught may indicate the loading condition of the ship which affects the ship s maneuverability however in the collected data set errors are found in the draught information the draught of most ships in the data set is not updated on each voyage for some ships the value of draught equals the molded draught in the registration other ships are recorded with a draught of 0 m or an unreasonable small value in the data set bailey et al 2008 also show that 31 of the investigated messages have obvious errors in draught information it implies that the data of ship draught are not reliable thus these are not included in the analyses of this paper reliable ship draught data would have indicated the water depth that a ship is involved in since the current direction and speed can be different over the water depth in tidal waterway the impact of current actually working on ship s hull can be analyzed with the draught information 2 3 meteorological and hydrological data to analyze the impacts of wind and current on ship behavior the wind and current conditions during the sailing of the ships are needed i e the velocity of both wind and current thus the meteorological and hydrological data in the study area are collected the meteorological condition refers to wind and visibility both are measured at different stations in the study area see fig 1 the wind velocity is measured at an interval of 5 min while the visibility is measured every minute in non extreme weather conditions there is no sudden change of wind within 5 min thus the measuring frequency of the data is sufficient in presenting the external conditions the wind and visibility can be deemed to be homogeneous for the whole area in the study area there are some artificial dunes and the storage tanks for lng on the south side of the waterway but without any high rise buildings on land considering the scale and distance to the waterway it is assumed that there is no impact on the wind and visibility in the area thus the measuring data at a single station represents the wind and visibility conditions in the whole area the wind direction probability in the study area is visualized by the wind rose diagram in fig 3 it can be observed that the wind direction is changing over the year which is seldom parallel to the direction of the waterway wnw ese it means for ships sailing in the study area besides the wind from the bow or stern direction there is lateral forces on the ship hull by the crosswind for most of the time which causes leeway in the observed ship behavior the complexity of wind conditions is sufficient in the area to analyze the wind impact on ship behavior according to the collected data the time with visibility distance less than 1000 m holds 0 52 of the year while the frequency of visibility less than 2000 m is 4 87 when the visibility is less than 2000 m specific restriction measures are applied by the local port authority port of rotterdam 2014 e g entry restriction specific traffic guidance by vessel traffic service center etc thus the number of ship trajectories in restricted visibility is limited and the reflected ship behavior involves the effects of local restrictions we have removed the trajectories of the ships sailing in restricted visibility as this paper focuses on the impacts of wind and current the data of visibility will be used to filter the sailing situation under restricted visibility i e to exclude the impact of visibility on ship behavior speed as revealed by other researchers shu et al 2017 the hydrological condition is represented by the velocity of the current in the waterway the ship behavior is influenced via the hydrodynamic forces and moments working on the ship s hull under different current conditions unlike wind and visibility the measured current velocity at a specific measuring station is not representative for the whole area due to the propagation of flow and the velocity variation over the water depth thus the current velocity field is calculated by the port authority using the simona model vollebregt et al 2003 using the measured water level from eight stations around the port as input the modeled velocity has been validated by comparing it to the measured velocity at one station in the area the collected data describe the current velocity in 41 7 orthogonal curvilinear grids with a resolution of about 85 m see fig 1 the current velocity in each grid cell is presented by 10 layers with the same depth averaged by the water depth of the grid at an interval of 15 min for most of the ships the length is larger than 85 m so the grid resolution is sufficiently accurate during each movement of the ships the current velocity is instantly updated the current velocity varies among grids and over water depth the studied waterway links the inland waterway and the sea with natural physical boundaries on both sides see fig 1 which is a tidal reach through the ebb and flood of the tides the current directions in all grids at different water depth do not always follow the sailing direction of the ships or the direction of the waterway 3 research approach this research uses ais data to statistically investigate the impact of wind and current on ship behavior via a regression analysis approach in this section the behavior variables in the ais data and the wind and current directions are illustrated in the coordinate system with an introduction of the underlying assumptions of the research the data analysis method is explained in steps including the data preparation and the approach to answer the two research questions proposed in section 1 3 1 behavior variables and their coordinate system the coordinate system to present dynamic ship motion is shown in fig 4 it consists of the space fixed coordinate system o 0 x 0 y 0 and the moving ship fixed coordinate system o x y compared to the geographical coordinate system the x direction points to the true north the ship heading ψ is defined as the angle between x and x 0 axes the behavior variables discussed in this paper are the resulting behavior of all factors see fig 4 rather than the ship maneuvering variables which are not known e g rudder angle and engine rate among the presented behavior variables v s o g ψ and ϕ are directly collected from ais data the difference between ψ and ϕ is defined as γ which is the leeway and drift angle indicating the angular deviation due to the external impacts when the ship moves into the heading direction i e ϕ ψ γ equals to zero which can happen in two situations one situation is that the external conditions do not affect the ship behavior at all the other situation is that the different external impacts on ship behavior compensate each other so the sum of directional impacts is zero this way the combination of v s o g and γ can present the dynamic motion of a ship during sailing similarly to directly represent the ship motion in longitudinal and lateral directions the velocity components of v s o g in x and y directions namely u and v can be calculated these two variables in the ship fixed coordinate system o x y directly describe the ship motion of surge and sway during the data analysis two sets of behavior variables v s o g γ and u v have been tested both sets basically describe the same phenomenon of the ship motion in which one is described in the space fixed coordinate system and the other in the ship fixed coordinate system the results are similar and part of the corresponding results shown in appendix thus in this paper only the results for v s o g and γ which are derived directly from ais data are explained in detail besides the ship behavior variables the directions of wind and current are illustrated in the coordinate system according to common practice the direction of wind θ w describes which direction the wind is from while the direction of current θ c indicates the direction into which the water flows the visibility is indicated by the visibility distance without specific direction indicated 3 2 assumptions and generic expression of the wind and current impact in this paper the following assumptions are applied to simplify the process besides the wind and current impacts analyzed in detail in this paper the ship maneuvering in confined waterways and the human factors of the bridge team will affect the ship behavior variables described in fig 4 however the impacts of human factors are not investigated in this research it is assumed that the waterway layout and sailing direction approach to or departure from a port affect the ship behavior the ships slightly change course to follow the waterway and the inbound ships decelerate when approaching to the terminal thus the behavior of inbound and outbound ships is separately investigated however these two factors are not quantitatively analyzed in this paper due to a lack of data on individual terminals of departure and destination in unhindered situations ships of similar size are assumed to maintain similar behavior considering the inertia of ships the bridge teams onboard ships of similar size are assumed to take similar maneuvering decisions under the impacts of wind and current the resulting behavior of such ships is assumed to be similar thus ship size is the only internal factor to distinguish ships in this paper irrespective of the maneuverability differences among individual ships without an encounter with other ships the behavior of a ship in good visibility is assumed to be affected by the external factors of wind current the bridge teams are expected to take action based on the information of ship size wind and current in line with good seamanship when considering the impacts of wind and current on ship speed the linear combination form has been widely accepted for ship behavior modeling when considering ship as an integral rigid body and using the maneuvering particulars of individual ships beschnidt and gilles 2005 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 in their models considering such impacts the mass or the weights regarding the under and above water parts of the hull for individual ships are needed to estimate the wind and current forces on the hull the method of dead reckoning to estimate ship position is used to calculate the difference between heading and cog as the addition of leeway angle caused by wind and drift angle caused by current ni et al 2010 combining the above assumptions a generic expression of speed over ground and leeway and drift angle under the impacts of wind and current can be formed as follows while the detailed elaboration of each impact is given in section 3 3 3 1 v s o g f s o g s i z e s s f s o g w i n d v w θ w ϕ s s f s o g c u r r e n t v c θ c ϕ s s ε s o g 2 γ f α w i n d v w θ w v s o g ψ s s f β c u r r e n t v c θ c v s o g ψ s s ε γ where s s denotes the size of a ship the functions f behavior variable factor explain the detailed impact mechanisms of each factor γ is the sum of the leeway angle α and the drift angle β ε s o g and ε γ are included in the equations to represent the behavior variation of individual ship due to the bridge team onboard the bank effects on ship behavior or the proactive deceleration acceleration when approaching departing the terminals are not considered either 3 3 data analysis method the flow diagram in fig 5 illustrates the steps of the research approach which are further explained in this section the collected data are first processed to generate the data sets of ship behavior analyzed in this paper then two phases of data analysis are developed to answer the research questions proposed in section 1 respectively the data set of unhindered behavior is used to explain the speed variation of ships due to the size differences based on this result the impacts of wind and current are investigated using the whole data set of ship behavior 3 3 1 data preparation since the port authority of rotterdam only stores the mandatory fields in ais data the ship size characterization is limited to length beam and draught however the information on draught is not reliable since too many errors are found thus in this paper only length and beam are adopted as the proxy for ship size during the data processing the first step of the data preparation the raw ais data are filtered this so called data cleaning is performed using two steps firstly the messages with sensor type marked as radar only are filtered since there are no ais information for these ships the second step is to filter the messages with inconsistent information from radar and ais during this step the values of dynamic information are checked the clean ais data are linked with the meteorological and hydrological data based on the time and ship position in each ais message the drift angle γ is calculated for each ais message the resulting data set contains ship behavior in all external conditions as stated in section 1 to focus on the impacts of wind and current the impacts of visibility and ship encounter should be eliminated in line with the preliminary analysis result visibility 2000 m is defined as good visibility to avoid the impact of restricted visibility on ship behavior zhou et al 2017 in order to exclude the impact of ship encounters the processed data set has filtered the trajectories of ships with any encounter with another ship in the study area the three types of encounters identified in the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs are considered namely head on overtaking and crossing situations if more than two ships are involved the situation is deemed as a combination of several two ships encounters of the above mentioned types the crossing situation can be easily distinguished by the relative position between ships while the overtaking situation is characterized by the speed differences and position changes in between over time a head on situation at sea is defined when one ship is coming towards the other one roughly within 6 on either side of the heading considering the length and width of the waterway in the study area the head on situation is identified and filtered when one ship encountering the other from the opposite direction in the study area so far the resulting data set includes all ship behavior in good visibility and without any encounter of another ship the wind and current conditions are not used to filter any ship behavior data to further elaborate the behavior variation due to ship size a data set in the unhindered situation is prepared the thresholds have been previously analyzed which characterize the situation by visibility 2000 m wind speed 8 m s 15 55 knots and current speed 0 37 m s 0 72 knots zhou et al 2017 however it should be noticed that the weak impacts of wind and current still exist in such a situation thus when analyzing the impacts of wind and current the whole data set including both hindered and unhindered situations will be used since the waterway is not exactly straight with parallel banks on both sides the impacts of the slightly bending waterway layout may affect the ship behavior as stated in the assumptions besides the sailing direction may influence the speed of a ship in the unhindered situation thus the data set of inbound and outbound ships in the study area is separated and analyzed independently by comparing the analysis results of these two data sets it can prove whether the impacts of these two factors can be qualitatively proved 3 3 2 variation of unhindered speed due to ship size in respect of the unhindered ship behavior the speed variations among ships of different sizes have been observed shu et al 2013 zhou et al 2019b 2015 however the direct relationship between ship size and sog is still not revealed which is represented by f s o g s i z e s s in the generic expression of the impact mechanism it is expected to find an isolate function to appropriately describe such a relationship using the data set of ship behavior in the unhindered situation thus during the quantitative analysis of the wind and current impacts on ships of different sizes the unhindered sog of such different ships can be first estimated the detailed steps to analyze speed variation due to ship size are present in fig 6 firstly a correlation analysis between unhindered sog and ship size length and beam is performed it is to indicate the strength of correlation relationship in between and identify which size criterion better characterizes the ship behavior variation using the selected ship size criterion the function to estimate the relationship with ship behavior is tested with monotonic elementary function types which is considering the findings of behavior variation over ship size by shu et al 2013 the function type yielding the highest estimate result is adopted to describe the variation of unhindered ship behavior due to ship size in case of the speed variation that is not monotonic as found in the preliminary analysis zhou et al 2017 a piecewise function will be adopted for ships divided by the size threshold where the variation pattern changes the variation of sog in the unhindered situation due to ship size can be described by f s o g s i z e s s in equation 1 using the determined function form in the following section analyzing the wind and current impact the variation due to ship size will also be considered 3 3 3 impacts of wind and current to quantify the impacts of wind and current on different ships three steps in general will be taken as shown in fig 7 firstly the functions to describe the mechanism of wind and current impacts in equations 1 and 2 need to be determined which specifies the form of regression models secondly the regression analysis will be performed using the subsets of ship behavior with a similar ship size the estimated results of all subsets will indicate whether the wind and current impacts vary among different sizes of ships finally the overall functions to describe the wind and current impacts considering the variation pattern over ship size will be specified with coefficients estimated directly using the whole data set of ship behavior in the following each step will be elaborated upon step 1 specifying the wind and current impact mechanism as explained in the generic expression of the impact mechanism the impacts of wind and current are assumed to be linear this assumption could be tested by the calculation of hydrodynamic forces and moments working on the ship s hull however as the detailed ship particulars of each individual ship cannot be collected from ais data the wind and current impact mechanism are expressed using the generic ship size information and the wind and current velocity as shown in equations 3 and 4 comparing to the estimate using specific information such generic ship particulars may lead to a less accurate estimate result but the method can be applied to estimate the ship behavior in a port where the specific particulars for all visiting ships are unknown 3 v s o g c s o g s f s o g s s s c s o g w f s o g w s s v w cos ϕ θ w c s o g c f s o g c s s v c cos θ c ϕ c s o g 4 γ c α w f α w s s v w v s o g 2 sin ψ θ w c β c f β c s s arcsin v c v s o g sin θ c ψ c γ where f s o g s s s denotes the variation of unhindered speed due to ship size v w v c and θ w θ c describe the speed and direction of wind and current the functions f behavior variable factor s s explain the variation of external impacts for different size of ships the coefficients c behavior variable factor will be estimated by the regression analysis since not all factors affecting ship behavior have been analyzed in the model a constant c s o g and c γ has been added to each model to represent the impacts due to other unexplained factors the unhindered speed that a ship maintains when no effects of wind and current is assumed to be affected by the ship size which is analyzed in section 3 3 2 regarding the external impact on ship s sog it is represented by the projection of wind current velocity on the direction of v s o g in equation 3 the direction of velocity vector has been considered in the projection calculation based on the theory of dead reckoning to estimate the ship position the drift angle γ is the sum of the leeway angle α due to the wind and the drift angle β for the current in equation 4 bowditch 2017 the leeway angle is calculated according to the empirical equation for water surface leeway analysis richardson 1997 however the coefficients are achieved by field experiments for specific physical objects which can be only applied for specific circumstances thus using ais data combining the meteorological and hydrological data the coefficients will be estimated by regression analysis the obtained results can be applied to predict such impacts on the ship behavior in the area the drift angle is calculated in the current triangle adopting the law of sines using the angle between the current direction and heading current speed and sog step 2 estimating the impacts on ship behavior with similar size in the previous analysis the impacts on different sizes of ships are observed to be different as well zhou et al 2017 but it is still unknown whether the cause of such differences is occasional fluctuation or due to the relationship with ship size to answer this question a quantified analysis is performed for ships in bins which groups the ships with the same or similar size the analysis results are compared to identify whether the impacts vary along with the change of ship size the whole data set is split into subsets of ship behavior according to the ship size the variation of unhindered ship behavior due to ship size f s o g s s s has been revealed in section 3 3 1 the regression analysis will be performed based on equations 5 and 6 for each subset of ship behavior data 5 v s o g c s o g s f s o g s s s c s o g w v w cos ϕ θ w c s o g c v c cos θ c ϕ c s o g 6 γ c α w v w v s o g 2 sin ψ θ w c β c arcsin v c v s o g sin θ c ψ c γ compared to equations 3 and 4 the functions to represent impact variation for different ships have been removed since these models will be applied for ships with the same or similar size f test and t test are used to determine the significance of the estimated models and the coefficients a 0 05 significance level is adopted the models are estimated using standardized scores z scores to obtain the standardized coefficients the results of standardized coefficients of wind and current impacts can be compared within each subset the comparison results present the weights of wind and current impacts on ship behavior for this size of ships step 3 estimating the impacts on ship behavior for ships of different sizes to identify whether the external impacts change along with the ship size or not the correlation analysis is performed using the estimated coefficients of wind current impacts with the average ship size of each bin if the correlation is significant at the level of 0 01 p value the impact of the external factor on the behavior variable is deemed as related to the ship size if the correlation is not significant it implies that the wind current impact is not strongly correlated to the ship size it can also be because that the local wind current speed are quite small or the ship size range is limited the correlation in between cannot be revealed based on the data set the function to estimate the relationship between external impact and ship size should be removed in equations 3 and 4 for the impacts significantly correlated to ship size the function type to describe the variation is determined by selecting the function yielding the highest estimate result with the estimated functions f s o g w s s f s o g c s s f α w s s f β c s s the generic regression models of each behavior variable for all ships with different size are determined the models will be estimated using the whole data set of ship behavior the final estimated regression model explains the quantitative impacts of wind and current on ship behavior 4 results and discussions since the ship speed is influenced by the proactive maneuvering for approaching departing a port i e the inbound ships mostly decelerate while the outbound ships accelerate and the course is influenced by the waterway layout the behavior of inbound and outbound ships is independently analyzed during the process to determine the form of the regression model the results are similar for both inbound and outbound ships only the results for inbound ships are presented and explained in detail for the estimation of the final regression model both results will be shown and the reasons for the differences are discussed 4 1 variation of speed due to ship size in order to intuitively estimate the relationship between ship size and speed the speed over ground v s o g in the unhindered situation is visualized as a function of ship size in fig 8 in the boxplot the distribution of ship speed within each bin is shown it can be found for the first several groups of small ships and the last couple of large ship groups the difference between the 25 and 75 percentile is rather small or rather large this is because the number of ships within such groups are small which leads to a large variation of the observations due to individual behavior differences however by comparing the median value of the bins the overall variation pattern can be observed for small ships the speed increases when the ship size grows to maintain the maneuverability in the narrow waterway for large ships the value gradually decreases to a certain stable state when the size becomes larger since the large ships cannot sail too fast in case of emergent maneuvering with big inertia thus to use a single function describe the variation pattern is not feasible in the previous sensitivity analysis for qualitative analysis the threshold to distinguish small or large ships is 150 m for length and 23 m for beam which also holds for the pattern shown in fig 8 zhou et al 2017 it means the length or beam from ais data can be used to categorize the ships as small or large ones to further identify which of the ship size length or beam best describes the speed over ground the correlation analysis between unhindered speed and ship size has been performed as shown in table 2 in the data set the ship length ranges between 24 m and 333 m while the beam varies between 8 m and 60 m according to the correlation analysis results the ship beam is expected to better describe the relationship between v s o g and ship size than ship length thus in the remaining part of this paper the beam is selected as the proxy for ship size during the quantitative analysis of wind and current impacts to estimate the relationship between v s o g and ship beam four types of monotonic elementary functions have been tested for small and large ships respectively the estimated results are presented in table 3 it should be noticed that the low r 2 value of the estimate result is due to ignoring other factors affecting ship behavior even in unhindered situations there is still wind and current influencing ship behavior and other unexplained factors as well ideally the function f s o g s s s to explain the relation between sog and beam adopts the function type yielding the highest estimate result however it leads to different types of functions for small and large ships logarithmic function for small ships and exponential function for large ships which will result in different forms of the regression model for different ship sizes the aim of this paper is to find a generic model form for all ships comparing the overall performance of four function types to different ships the result of logarithmic function ranks the best for small ships and the second best for large ships when estimating the behavior for large ships the difference of r 2 to the best function type exponential function is 0 003 which is acceptable thus the logarithmic function is adopted to describe the relationship between v s o g and the ship beam the function f s o g s s s is included as log b in equation 3 4 2 quantification of wind and current impacts on ship behavior in this section the regression analysis results of wind and current impacts on subsets of ships with similar size are firstly explained the results quantitatively compare the wind and current impacts on similar ships and prove whether the impacts vary with ship size then the analysis results considering the external impact variation among the different sizes of ships are presented 4 2 1 wind and current impacts on similar sized ships the whole data set of ship behavior is split into subsets with the same or similar ship beam the bin size is mostly set as 1 m while for beams smaller than 10 m or larger than 32 m the bin size is set as 5 m to include sufficient data more than 30 ships in each subset the regression models in equations 5 and 6 for v s o g and γ are estimated for each subset of ship behavior with similar beams since the speed of wind is much larger than current in measured values the estimated unstandardized coefficients are not directly comparable however the standardized coefficients are estimated from the standardized regression analysis where the variances of variables are 1 they explain which of wind and current impacts have a greater influence on ship behavior in this multiple regression model these coefficients of wind and current for the two behavior variables in each subset are presented in fig 9 and fig 10 as an example similar results for surge and sway speed u and v are shown in appendix two comparisons are taken to interpret the estimated standardized coefficients when looking at the standardized coefficients for similar size within the same subset the weights of wind and current impacts can be compared for small ships the impact of current on v s o g is dominant compared to the impact of wind but for large ships the impact differences are becoming smaller the speed of a ship is mainly provided by the propeller which is underwater and affected by the current for large ships with high superstructures the wind area is also large the wind impact may outweigh the current while the difference is small however for the impact on leeway and drift angle α and β the impact of wind is mostly larger than current it means in the port area when the officers onboard change heading to prepare leeway and drift angle the wind direction would be the primary factor for their decision for large ships the wind and current impacts are comparable probably due to the large draught underwater the other comparison is between the coefficients for different groups of ships which indicates the variation of the external impacts among ships of different sizes it can be observed that for small ships both impacts of wind and current on sog decrease when the ships get larger for small ships the smaller size usually comes with smaller inertia to maneuver in emergent circumstances thus those ships do not consume extra fuel to compensate the influences of wind and current but the larger ships in this group need to keep their speed either for basic maneuvering requirements or for emergent maneuvering however both impacts on the drift angle slightly increase with the increase of ship size which is due to the larger wind and current forces on ship hull and propeller for large ships the variation of wind and current impacts are not always the same when the ships get larger the impact of wind on sog gradually increases but the impact on the leeway angle fluctuates with a decrease because for very large ships the wind forces on superstructures are large once the maneuvering requirement can be fulfilled the ships will not spend extra effort consumption of more fuel to compensate such impact on speed but for leeway angle such large ships need to avoid collision with banks under the wind forces thus the resulting impact on behavior seems smaller meanwhile for the impact of current the opposite relationship is presented the impact of current on sog for larger ships is smaller and the impact on the drift angle is larger the reasons are the same as for the impact of current on the group of small ships the regression analysis test on ship behavior with similar size proves the external impact variation which is in line with the preliminary qualitative analysis result and follows our expectation zhou et al 2017 the detailed quantification of such variation along with the size change will be determined by statistical analysis in the following section 4 2 2 wind and current impacts considering ship size variation to figure out the impact factors significantly varied among different sizes of ships the relationship between the unstandardized coefficients for wind current impact and ship beam are statistically tested by correlation analysis the correlation coefficients are listed in table 4 the p value of 0 01 is taken as the threshold of significant correlation the positive values indicate positive correlations in between while the negative coefficient refers to the negative correlation from the statistical test perspective for all behavior variables of both small and large ships the impact of wind varies without a strong correlation with ship size such variation can be caused by behavior differences among individual officers on board or other unexplained factors this way the corresponding functions in the regression model to indicate such correlation are removed from models in equations 3 and 4 including f s o g w s s f α w s s however for the impacts of current the coefficients are significantly correlated to the ship s size except for the impact on the drift angle for large ships therefore the functions presenting the relationship f s o g c s s f β c s s need to be elaborated to quantify such impact differences for the three significant correlations the same four types of monotonic elementary functions have been tested for each coefficient as presented in table 5 the ideal situation is to adopt a generic function form for all ships the same as the function to describe the variation of speed due to ship size however the correlation between the current impact on drift angle and the size of large ships is not significant while the one for small ships is significant see table 4 it leads to different forms of functions for small and large ships thus the functions best describing the relationship are adopted in the regression models to consider the impact variation due to ship size the corresponding functions in equations 3 and 4 are elaborated for small ships and large ships respectively as follows in the linear functions two coefficients need to be estimated for small ships ship beam 23 m 7 f s o g c s s s c s o g c s 1 b c s o g c s 2 8 f β c s s s c β c s 1 b c β c s 2 for large ships ship beam 23 m 9 f s o g c l s s c s o g c l b 1 so far the regression models for v s o g and γ to quantitatively analyze the wind and current impacts are generated for small and large ships the impact variation among the different sizes of ships is also included in this paper the models are estimated based on the data set of inbound and outbound ship behavior separately the estimation results of the regression analysis are shown in table 6 and table 7 according to the regression analysis results about 70 of the variance in sog of small ships can be explained by the ship size wind and current r 2 is 0 743 for inbound ships and 0 696 for outbound ships comparing the standardized coefficients the choice of sog in unhindered situation accounts for the major weight of the final sailing speed which is mostly determined due to the size of a ship it means the ships only adjust their speed in unhindered situation when there are the impacts of wind and current looking at the unstandardized coefficients of unhindered sog the estimation results for inbound and outbound ships are different which indicates the sailing direction also affects the speed choice the impact of current on sog of small ships both inbound and outbound ships outweighs the wind impact which is the same when performing the regression analysis for ships in bins with similar size see fig 9 however for large ships the explained variance drops to around 40 r 2 is 0 395 for inbound ships and 0 440 for outbound ships two reasons may explain this result firstly there is a large variation of sog for large ships in the unhindered situation even between the ships with similar size see fig 8 the variance of speed by individual ships cannot be precisely predicted by the generic model it also holds when comparing the results of inbound and outbound ships in which the model performs better for outbound ships than inbound ships when sailing in the study area most of the outbound ships try to reach their desired speed at sea however the inbound ships need to decelerate or keep their speed depending on the distance to their destination terminal which is different for individual ships thus there is more variation in the choice of speed for inbound ships the other reason is that the detailed impacts of wind and current on the speed of large ships need to consider the specific above and under water ship hull which is hard to achieve for ships in an area compared to the explanation of sog the wind and current impacts only account for 25 of the variance in leeway and drift angle which seems that the relationship between external factors and the drift angle is not very strong the standardized coefficients also indicate similar results according to the ordinary practice of seamen the set of leeway and drift angle is based on the surrounding sailing situation including wind current and waterway layout however the instant decision differs among individual officers onboard considering their sailing habit and experience in the same situation some officers may take several degrees of drift angle but the other officers may keep sailing without heading change even with the same wheel order the observed results of leeway and drift angle the difference between heading and cog still depend on the rate of turn of individual ships besides the precision of both heading and cog are the same as 1 in the collected data after the official data processing it can happen that the values are the same while there exist a small difference in actual situation or the leeway and drift angle is calculated where the actual difference is quite small at a precision of 0 1 therefore the explanation of the variance in γ is not as good as sog the signs of the coefficients together with the functions in the regression model explain the relationship between behavior variables and the impact of ship size wind and current the results prove that the theoretical expression of the impact mechanism and the revealed impact variation over ship size by analyzing the subsets of data are correct when analyzing the whole data set consisting of ships with different sizes comparing the weights of wind and current impacts by standardized coefficients in tables 6 and 7 the result for the whole data set is similar to the regression analysis using the subsets of inbound ship behavior with the same size see figs 9 and 10 which follows our expectation regarding the impacts on sog the current impact outweighs the wind however the impact of current on drift angle is slightly larger than the wind on leeway angle for the current impact on small ships c s o g c 2 and c β c 2 represents the generic impacts while c s o g c 1 and c β c 1 indicates the variation due to the size differences comparing their standardized estimates the weight of the direct impact of the current itself is larger than the correction regressor for ship size the constant in the model of sog plays a dual role on the one hand it corrects the unhindered speed due to ship size besides it includes the other impacts of unexplained external factors regarding the constant for γ it is expected to be zero in an ideal sailing situation without wind and current when sailing in the straight waterway however the estimated results are with different signs for inbound and outbound ships which are marked as grey in tables 6 and 7 the main reason is that the study area is not exactly straight with parallel banks see fig 1 for inbound ships the waterway slightly bends to the starboard side the negative sign of c γ indicates that the heading of a ship directs to the starboard side comparing to the o x direction of the ship fixed coordinate system it follows good seamanship that a ship will take a series of small angle alteration to follow the designed route rather than a sharp turning at the waypoint considering the ship maneuverability for outbound ships the positive sign represents the turning direction to the port side to follow the layout of the waterway it also proves that the leeway and drift angle of a ship in inland waterways is affected by the bank besides the wind and current impacts the bending direction of the waterway indicates the sign of the coefficient the estimated regression model provides a quantification of the wind and current impacts some behavior following good seamanship is also statistically revealed by the estimated regression model 5 conclusions this paper proposes a regression model to quantitatively analyze the impact of wind and current on ship behavior speed over ground and drift angle derived from ais data the variations of ship behavior and the external impacts due to the size differences are also included during the analysis the variation of speed over ground in the unhindered situation due to ship size can be observed the correlation analysis shows that the ship beam is better to indicate the relationship with v s o g than length which can be described through a logarithmic function the wind and current impact on ship behavior also vary for ships of different sizes for small ships both wind and current impacts on v s o g decrease when the ships get larger however for large ships the impact of wind on v s o g gradually increases along with growing ship size but the impact on the leeway angle fluctuates with a decrease the current impact on v s o g of larger ships is smaller but the impact on the drift angle is larger for the coefficients that are significantly correlated to the ship s size by correlation analysis the functions best estimate the relationship are adopted in the regression models according to the regression analysis results using the whole data set of ship behavior consisting of different sizes about 70 of the variance in v s o g of small ships can be explained by the factors of ship size wind and current the choice of v s o g in unhindered situation accounts for the major weight of the final sailing speed which is mainly due to the ship size however for large ships the explained variance drops to around 40 possibly due to the large variation in the unhindered situation and the complex interaction of wind and current forces on ship hull compared to v s o g the wind and current impacts only account for 25 of the variance in leeway and drift angle which is due to the instant decision differences between individual officers onboard and the maneuverability of individual ships the results prove that the proposed theoretical expression of the impact mechanism and the revealed impact variation over ship size by analyzing the subsets of data are correct the estimated regression model provides the quantitative relationship of wind and current impacts on ship behavior considering ship size variation some conventional sailing habits of course alteration to follow the designed route in line with good seamanship are also statistically revealed by the estimate results the analysis result could benefit both researchers and the port authority for the researcher a quantification of the impact mechanism of wind and current helps to further simulate ship behavior in such external conditions for the port authority the revealed insight into the relations between ship behavior and external factors will help the ship traffic management under different wind and current conditions and the corresponding risk control in port within this paper a nearly straight waterway is studied which eliminates the impact of the waterway layout on ship behavior as indicated by the estimated result a port area with the more complex layout should be analyzed to identify such impact according to the comparison of inbound and outbound ships the distance to destination or the sailing direction of approaching or departing from a terminal also affects the speed choice which can be further investigated based on a series of quantitative analyses looking into the relationship between the observed ship behavior and the external factors a new nautical traffic model can be expected to predict the ship behavior under different conditions credit authorship contribution statement yang zhou conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation writing original

21657,the work studies the ship structural corrosion degradation allowance analysing several sets of corrosion thickness measurements collected from operating tankers the corrosion degradation process is modelled by a time dependent exponential function with parameters adjusted to real corrosion thickness measurement data corrosion margins of redundant ship structures with severe consequences of failure are derived based on two approaches probabilistic closed form solution and risk based direct approach the developed closed form solutions for the corrosion allowance for different corrosion environments can be used in the design avoiding a complex risk based assessment keywords corrosion degradation thickness allowance probabilistic analysis risk based approach 1 introduction corrosion can cause structural degradation of metal structures and recently many studies focused on this issue a profound analysis of the factors influencing the corrosion wastage of metal structures was presented in melchers 2003 for morphology in montero ocampo and veleva 2002 plate surface conditions and material properties in garbatov et al 2014 maintenance in garbatov et al 2016a 2018a and reliability assessment in garbatov and guedes soares 2009b a very important study of the environmental factors governing marine corrosion led to the identification of the governing corrosion factors for corrosion of ballast and cargo oil tanks was reported in guedes soares et al 2008 2013 many real measurements of corrosion thickness have been analysed and several corrosion models were developed in hart et al 1986 tscf 1992 1997 guedes soares and garbatov 1998 paik et al 1998 yamamoto and ikagaki 1998 guedes soares and garbatov 1999 wang et al 2003 jurišić et al 2017 nowadays special attention is paid to the fact that corrosion is not only reducing the thickness of structural components but also the mechanical properties are changed as observed in garbatov et al 2014 2016a 2018a leading to a severe strength reduction saad eldeen et al 2011a b garbatov et al 2016b woloszyk and garbatov 2020 zayed et al 2013a 2013b analysed the reliability of ship hulls subjected to corrosion and maintenance considering the uncertainties related to the loading conditions and inspection events a risk based framework for ship and structural design accounting for maintenance planning was developed by garbatov et al 2018b determining the maintenance plan of a ship hull structural system which can be used in the early stage of design accounting for different hazard scenarios specific economic environment and degradation severity along with the service life structural reliability assessment of a real tanker ship was performed based on experimentally estimated ultimate strength by woloszyk and garbatov 2019 where the strength estimate of the scaled specimen translation to a real scale tanker ship hull structure was made using the dimensional theory neumann et al 2019 performed conditional failure assessment to describe the required increasing maintenance with age where a rule based failure definition is applied trough the corrosion tolerance levels together with a linear corrosion degradation model a very recent study presented by gong et al 2020 investigated the economically optimal corrosion addition from a life cycle perspective by developing a probabilistic growth model consistent with corrosion additions as stipulated by iacs concluding that in some cases they may be less than that the defined ones initially the international maritime organization imo developed formal safety assessment fsa imo 2005 2006a b 2007 2008 2013 2015 to enhance the maritime safety and was employed in the development of new rules psaraftis 2012 montewka et al 2014 designing of ships in the degradation condition papanikolaou et al 2009 performing a sensitivity analysis on the hull girder safety level of a tanker ship guia et al 2016 and for development of a risk based framework for ship and structural design accounting for maintenance planning garbatov et al 2018b fsa considers the limit state concerning the corrosion deterioration mechanism as an ultimate limit state and its violation may lead to loss of ship cargo etc the corrosion degradation mechanism is a highly uncertain process accompanied with a large scatter leading to a substantial statistical deviation as a function of time as a result of that when the average corrosion thickness arrives at the level of the corrosion allowance as stipulated by iacs on some places the plate thickness reduction can be much severe the main objective in the present study is to define the corrosion allowance of redundant ship structures derived based on the probabilistic closed form solution and risk based direct approach which are only dependent on ship corrosion environments or spaces according to their physical chemical and operational characteristics the concern related to the structural capacity e g bending and yielding is covered by the net thickness plate design of ship structures which is not an objective of this study the present study analyses the structural corrosion degradation of six sets of recently collected corrosion thickness measurements the data sets were collected during various inspection campaigns of tankers in operation and reflected the ages of the ships and their level of degradation the developed closed form solution for the corrosion thickness allowances can be directly used in the ship structural design avoiding the complexity of the risk analysis collecting more data related to the corrosion degradation and information about the economic conditions during the ship life cycle can be easily incorporated and the output of the analysis can be updated 2 time dependent degradation the time dependent structural degradation is an important issue that needs to be accounted for when metal structures are designed its behaviour needs to be identified with respect to how quickly the structure will degrade when the structural deterioration reaches the non acceptable level in general three important approaches are employed in corrosion deterioration modelling the first one considers the corrosion growth with a linear dependence of the time and this is a very crude model the second one depends on the results of experiments in specific conditions leading to a corrosion growth as a function of a number of governing parameters in this case the corrosion model will follow the relationships derived from experiments in specific conditions as is being proposed in melchers 2003 this approach involves difficulties related to the translation of the results from coupons at coastal corrosion stations to full scale conditions and with the general lack of data on the environmental conditions which affect corrosion in a large scale regime garbatov and guedes soares 2008 the third approach which is the one that is used here is to consider that the model provides the trend that is based on the dominating corrosion mechanism and it is fit to the field data two corrosion degradation models based on the third approach are commonly used the one that was developed in guedes soares and garbatov 1998 1999 describing the corrosion thickness as an exponential function and the second developed in paik et al 1998 yamamoto and ikagaki 1998 expressed by a power function of time the study performed by garbatov and guedes soares 2019 analysed the two corroded degradation models of steel plates and their evaluation as best fitted to the real measurement data sets using advanced statistical methods an approach for proper identification of the best fitted model was applied and proved to be also a good option for identifying the time dependent statistical descriptors of the non linear corrosion models very extensive corrosion thickness measurement data sets of different structural components in different corrosive environments and ships garbatov and guedes soares 2008 2009a were analysed and based on the akaike s information criterion the power model paik et al 1998 yamamoto and ikagaki 1998 is identified as 29 more likely to have generated the analysed data and the exponential model guedes soares and garbatov 1999 as 71 respectively the time depended corrosion degradation growth as defined in the model of guedes soares and garbatov 1999 is composed of three stages including the coating life τ c where the corrosion protection system is capable of preventing corrosion degradation the transient time τ t where the corrosion is penetrating the protection system and starts to propagate and the steady state stage where due to the corrosion degradation a corrosion protection layer is created limiting the presence of the oxygen and as a result of that the corrosion degradation slows down in this respect the transient corrosion development starts from zero and goes to the final state and the steady state phase is approached once the time approaches the infinity the corrosion degradation response is divided into two regions associated with the transient time where the corrosion degradation is progressing and a steady state time in which the corrosion degradation is assumed to have reached its final stage d further when the exact starting point of the corrosion degradation is defined τ c coating life the corrosion degradation may be estimated as 1 d t τ c τ t d 1 e t τ c τ t eqn 1 has been proven to be a good solution in defining the corrosion thickness progress as a function of time of different ageing marine structures conditional of the coating life τ c and transitional time τ t as reported in jurišić et al 2017 garbatov and guedes soares 2019 the corrosion degradation model as presented in eqn 1 is seen as a three phase process the first phase no corrosion is observed because of the protection of the metal surface associated with the coating life t o τ c is working properly as can be seen in fig 1 the second phase starts when the corrosion protection fails and the corrosion degradation progress progressively decreases the thickness of the structural component t τ c 4 τ t the third phase is related to the stop in the corrosion degradation process and the corrosion rate becomes close to zero t 4 τ t garbatov and guedes soares 2019 cleaning the surface or any involuntary action that removes the surface corroded layer will restart the non linear corrosion growth process again the mean value of the corrosion degradation thickness as used in the present study is described as 2 e d t τ c τ t d d 1 e t τ c τ t t τ c 0 t τ c where τ c is the coating life τ t is the transition time and d is the maximum corrosion thickness developed during the corrosion degradation process 3 d τ t t a n α where α is the angle defined by oa and ob in fig 1 to calculate the variances of the corrosion thickness σ 2 d t τ c τ t d the first order taylor series expansion is used 4 σ 2 d t τ c τ t d i 1 2 d t τ c τ t d x i 2 σ x i 2 where the standard deviation is calculated as σ x i σ x i 2 and i 1 2 is taking the values of x 1 τ c x 2 τ t and σ x i 2 t is the variance o the stochastic variables x i as a function of time 5 σ x i 2 t x i 1 e t τ c τ x i 2 t τ c ship structural components that act on the boundaries between two spaces may have similar or different corrosion characteristics hence the different ship structural components can be classified according to their surrounding environments the reduction in the thickness of any ship structural components may be defined as a summation of the corrosion thicknesses of each side the prediction of the corrosion allowance for the different ship structural components will be based on the new corrosion thickness data analysed here the ship used for the present study is a double hull tanker with a length between the perpendiculars of 320 m breadth of 58 m depth of 31 m and draft of 22 m the structural arrangements longitudinal divisions and stiffening are presented by the mid ship section in fig 2 left the different ship environments or spaces are classified according to their physical chemical and operational characteristics that affect the corrosion deterioration ship spaces that have similar environmental characteristics have similar corrosion degradation and will belong to the same class this is similar to what is considered in iacs 2012 for the definition of the corrosion wastage allowances for the structural members in different ship spaces based on this classification the different environments around the mid ship section are defined in fig 2 right where each environment is indicated by an alphabetical letter each ship structural component is exposed to two environments one at each side where they can be different or similar hence two alphabetical letters are used to indicate the environments around each plate the corrosion model that was calibrated in garbatov et al 2007 to several corrosion data sets are considered here to represent the double side corrosion models for the environmental classes ad cg gg dd ff and gi six independent sets of real measurements of corrosion thickness of tanker ships are analysed here the ad set of data of deck plates includes 4104 measurements of deck plates from the cargo ballast tanks see fig 3 left the cg set includes 1216 measurements of inner bottom plates between cargo and ballast tanks see fig 3 right the gg set includes 1010 measurements of structural components from ballast tanks see fig 4 left the dd set includes 500 measurements of deck longitudinals of cargo tanks see fig 4 right the af set includes 1226 measurements of deck plates of ballast tanks see fig 5 left and the gi set includes 386 measurements of bottom plates of ballast tanks see fig 5 right the data exhibits a large scatter reflecting the nature of the problem as this is data from many ships that are subjected to various environmental conditions and thus the variability is unavoidable the mean value lower and upper 95 confidence levels of the corrosion thickness as a function of time for different corrosion environments are shown in fig 6 to fig 8 and the corrosion model parameters τ c τ t and d obtained from the analysis are shown in table 1 3 probabilistic corrosion thickness estimate the time dependent corrosion degradation of structural components may reduce the strength of the ship hull structure and can initiate buckling fatigue damage rupture and transformation of the structure into a mechanism in this respect the deterioration mechanism needs to be considered in the ultimate limit state analysis the probabilistic design methods are based on the comparison of the reliability beta index β with its target value β t r moreover it is applied to design so that the design variable is close to the target design values the target values of the reliability index as stipulated in en1990 2002 is defined based on previous reliability studies depending on many factors having a great scatter however the recommended target reliability index may be considered as reasonable average values related to existing structures another definition of the target reliability index is based on the minimum requirement for human safety as defined by iso 2394 iso2394 1998 using the reliability analysis as a decision tool the estimated probability of failure is compared to an accepted target level the target levels depend on different factors as reported by moan 1998 may vary from one industry to another depending on the seriousness of its consequence or public and media sensitivity appropriate values of the target safety and reliability are not readily available and are usually determined by surveys or by examinations of the statistics on failures considering a reference period t r the beta target reliability level β t r corresponding to an arbitrary service life can be derived based on the annual beta reliability index β 1 as 6 β t r φ 1 φ β 1 t r a more detailed recommendation is provided in iso 2394 1998 where the beta target reliability index is given for the service life and related not only to the consequences but also to the relative costs of the safety measures as can be seen as for an example in garbatov et al 2018b the probabilistic optimisation is one possible way of defining the acceptable reliability level in increasing the reliability level the life cycle cost of structures increase but at the same time the consequences cost as a result of structural failure decreases the collapse due to corrosion degradation is identified as an initiating event of failure the risk based ship integrity assessment transforms these initiating event into a risk measure where all possible outcomes for the ship are evaluated the consequences of the overall hull girder failure are defined by the possible human loss loss of cargo contamination with fuel and lubricating oil the probability of failure is defined by corrosion degradation the failure consequences are also time dependent due to the time value of money 3 1 reliability estimate the reliability is defined as the probability of maintaining the ability to fulfil the design purpose for some period the objective is to estimate the reliability based on its capacity when the demand acts the reliability analysis here is using the log normal formulation to identify a set of basic random variables that influence the failure mode or the limit state under consideration it applies that the corrosion thickness and allowance are log normal distributed stochastic variables fsa considers the limit state concerning the corrosion deterioration mechanism as an ultimate limit state and its violation may lead to loss of ship cargo etc the corrosion degradation mechanism is a highly uncertain process accompanied with a large scatter leading to a substantial statistical deviation as a function of time as a result of that when the average corrosion thickness arrives at the level of the corrosion allowance as stipulated by iacs the reduction of the plate thickness can be much severe in some places the limit state function is defined as 7 g t x d u d d t x where d u is the corrosion thickness allowance d d t x d t τ c τ t d φ t is the corrosion thickness demand φ t is the uncertainty related to the corrosion thickness model and x is the vector of parameters involved in the limit state function the limit state function divides the design space into a safe region when g t x 0 and an unsafe one when g t x 0 the reliability index of the corrosion degradation limit state where the stochastic variables associated with the corrosion thickness are also assumed to follow the log normal distribution is defined as kececioglu 1991 8 β t x e l n d u e l n d d t x σ 2 l n d u σ 2 l n d d t x where the mean values and standard deviations of the involved stochastic variables are estimated as 9 e l n d u l n e d u 0 5 σ 2 l n d u 10 σ 2 l n d u l n 1 σ d u e d u 2 11 e l n d d t x l n e d d t x 0 5 σ 2 l n d d t x 12 σ 2 l n d d t x l n 1 e φ t 2 σ 2 d t x d t x 2 σ 2 φ t e d t x e φ t 2 where the mean value e d t x and the variance σ 2 d t x are calculated employing eqns 2 and 5 fitted to the specific dataset of corrosion thickness measurements see figs 6 8 the failure state is defined by g t x 0 leading to the fact that the corrosion thickness growth is bigger than the corrosion allowance the probability of failure is defined as a function of the reliability index β t x as 13 p f t x p g t x 0 φ β t x the violation of the limit state function for any two corrosion environmental classes ad cg gg dd af and gi is defined by employing the two areas at time taat analysis in that case the initial corrosion thickness allowance in n 2 environmental corrosion areas are unchanged and only the corrosion thickness allowance in two classes is varied to analyse its impact on the reliability estimate the taat approach is not accounting for the possible interaction between the pair of the corrosion thickness allowance in different corrosion environmental areas 3 2 risk based corrosion thickness allowance the uncertainties associated with the collapse due to structural corrosion degradation may lead to potential losses of the ship as a result of the structural collapse in different corrosion environment spaces which is expressed as a probability of failure p f j and accounted for in the risk assessment the probability of failure is described as a numeric value and the consequences c f j in a monetary value 14 r i s k t n j 1 n p f j p g t j x 0 c f j t j x where p f j p g t j x 0 is the probability of failure c f j t j x is the impact which defines the consequence cost of failure x is the vector of the involved parameters and t j ε t o t n is the time the probability of failure is derived based on the limit state employing the log normal formulation the consequence costs include the risk measures loss of cargo loss of the ship accidental spill and loss of human life the ship s structural safety level may be established by employing a cost benefit analysis where the goal is to define an acceptable safety and reliability level by using the risk control option in estimating the corrosion thickness allowance for different corrosion environments in ship spaces the cost benefit analysis of the ship is performed based on the total expected risk r i s k t o t a l t n x which is a product of the probability of failure and consequence cost defined as 15 r i s k t o t a l t n x r i s k f a i l u r e t n x r i s k m e a s u r e t n x where r i s k f a i l u r e t n x is the risk associated with the failure and its consequence costs and r i s k m e a s u r e t n x is the cost of the implemented ship risk measures in redefining the corrosion thickness allowance both terms are defined as a function of the reliability index β as this in return influences the estimate of the target beta reliability level β t r a decision about the corrosion thickness allowance can be made analysing the cost associated with the loss of the ship cargo accidental spill and human life and minimising the total expected risk r i s k t o t a l t n x the risk associated with the ship collapse is estimated based on the service life of 25 years accounting for the probability of failure associated cost and the discount rate γ as a function of x and time as r i s k f a i l u r e t n x j 1 n p f j t j x c r e s a l e t j x c c a r g o c s p i l l c h u m a n e γ t j 16 where p f j t j x is the probability of failure c r e s a l e t j x is the resale cost of the ship in the year t j c c a r g o is the cost associated with the loss of cargo c s p i l l is the cost of the accidental spill c h u m a n is the cost associated with the loss of human life on board of the ship the discount rate γ is assumed as 5 the cost of the ship resale c r e s a l e t j x at any time t j is defined as a function of the initial cost of the ship c t o at t o 0 year and the resale value c t n at the t n year estimated as 17 c r e s a l e t j x c t o c t o c t n 1 e t τ s h i p t where τ s h i p t is the transition time of the cost diminution assumed here as seven years the initial cost of the ship c t o 38 m and the resale value c t n is a function of the initial cost and the risk measure where the scrap cost is assumed as 120 ton and structural enhancement as 3000 ton involving the cost of additional material labour and another shipyard cost the cost of the loss of oil cargo c c a r g o is estimated assuming that a part of the oil cargo p c a r g o is lost in the case of ship collapse defined as 18 c c a r g o c c a r g o t o n f c a r g o p c a r g o where c c a r g o t o n is the cost of one ton of oil cargo and f c a r g o is the percentage of the cargo lost the oil cargo is 216 794 tons the percentage assumed of the cargo lost is 5 and the cost of one ton of oil is 108 ton in the case of ship collapse apart f s p i l l of the total amount of oil and fuel p f u e l may be spilt and f s h o r e is the probability of the amount of spill reaching the shoreline sørgard et al 1999 the weight of discharge that needs to be cleaned up is defined as f s p i l l f s h o r e p f u e l and the cost c s p i l l associated with that is 19 c s p i l l f s p i l l f s h o r e c a t s p f u e l where c a t s is the cost of one ton accidently spilt oil and fuel that needs to be cleaned it is assumed that 5 of the total oil cargo is spill and 2 5 of that amount will reach the shoreline the cost of the oil to be cleaned is defined as 8312 ton as stipulated in etkin 1999 assuming the spill is of heavy crude in the european seas with a moderate shoreline oiling and dispersant primary clean up strategy is employed the cost associated with the fatality is based on icaf implied cost of avoiding a fatality which uses a risk model obtained from the average of the ocde countries ocde 2014 the cost of loss of human life here is defined as given in horte et al 2007 20 c h u m a n n c r e w f c r e w i c a f where n c r e w is the number of crew members f c r e w is the probability of loss of human life the crew members are 20 and the crew member loss is assumed as 10 and icaf 3 85 m crew member the cost of enhancing safety by redesign the corrosion thickness allowance including the cost of material and labour is defined as 21 r i s k m e a s u r e t j t o x c s h i p t j t o x c s h i p t j t o x where c s h i p t j t o x is the cost of the ship associated with the reliability level β o without corrosion allowance the risk measure and total risk as a function of corrosion thickness allowance for the corrosion environment ad are shown in fig 9 and the optimum corrosion thickness and target reliability indexes at the first year recalculated from the one at the 25th year for all studied corrosion environmental areas are given in table 2 it can be seen from figs 10 12 that the beta index as a function of the corrosion degradation presents different behaviour following the specific corrosion environmental condition and existing protection system measured by the coating life transition time and the long term corrosion thickness the shortest coating life is observed for the gg corrosion space 3 3 failure based corrosion thickness allowance additionally to the risk analysis a new probabilistic closed form approach is presented here in defining the corrosion thickness allowance independently to any economic criteria considering that d is a fixed effect the coating life τ c is neglected at the first stage of analysis and τ t is assumed as a stochastic variable distributed as l n e l n τ t σ 2 l n τ t the probability that 22 p τ t t u f a i l u r e l n d u f a i l u r e d d φ l l n t u f a i l u r e l n d u f a i l u r e d d e τ t 1 2 σ 2 l n τ t σ l n τ t where 23 σ 2 l n τ t l n 1 σ τ t e τ t 2 and φ is the standard normal distribution function and setting 24 φ l n t u f a i l u r e l n d u f a i l u r e d d e τ t 1 2 σ 2 l n τ t σ l n τ t φ β 25 the corrosion thickness d u f a i l u r e as a function of the time to failure t u f a i l u r e conditional of the acceptable target reliability level β 25 at the end of the service life of t 25 25 years and the coating protection time τ c can be estimated as 25 d u f a i l u r e 1 e t 25 τ c e τ t e σ l n τ t β 25 0 5 σ l n τ t d the corrosion thickness d u f a i l u r e and failure time t u f a i l u r e t 25 τ c for all ship corrosion pair environment spaces analysed here are presented in table 3 including the percentage of the steel lightweight of the ship associated with any corrosion environment space as can be noticed the corrosion thickness for the spaces with less steel lightweight differ significantly concerning the ones defined based on the risk d u r i s k it can also be noticed that once the risk mitigation cost associated with more than 15 of the steel lw cost the probabilistically defined corrosion thickness allowance are approaching the risk based ones as can be seen in fig 13 to adjust the failure based corrosion thickness allowance d u f a i l u r e to the risk based corrosion thickness allowance d u r i s k a calibration function is introduced here as 26 d u r i s k f c d u f a i l u r e where the calibration function is defined as 27 f c 0 678 s t e e l l w 0 249 the probabilistic closed form solutions for the corrosion thickness allowance for different corrosion environments calibrated to the risk based corrosion allowance can be used in the structural design avoiding the complex risk based direct approach 4 design corrosion thickness allowance of tanker ships iacs 2012 defined the corrosion wastage allowances to be added to the structural component net thickness in the different ship corrosion environment spaces these wastage allowances are defined based on the previous corrosion degradation history of the structural component under certain environmental conditions the defined corrosion wastage allowances reflect the experience and resources of all the classification societies to achieve a 25 year design life and they are applied to the design net thickness as can be seen in fig 14 the results of the developed risk based corrosion thickness allowance of a tanker fleet in comparison to the ones stipulated by iacs 2012 are presented in table 4 as can be noticed from table 4 the corrosion thickness allowance matches exactly the ones of ad cg and dd and some noticeable difference can be seen in the case of af gg and gi it can also be seen that the risk mitigation cost in the case of af is very low 1 of the steel lw cost which results in a higher corrosion thickness allowance and more reliable design solution β 25 2 46 on the contrary the classes gg and gi present a high risk mitigation cost about 26 and 15 of the steel lw cost and the encountered design solution at β 25 1 59 and 1 16 results in a corrosion thickness allowance of 2 5 and 2 3 which is lesser than the ones stipulated in iacs 2012 it may be concluded that the encountered solution for the class af is the upper bound and for the classes gg and gi is the lover bound risk based solution for the corrosion thickness allowance applying the probabilistic approach purely see table 3 without considering the consequence cost the defined corrosion thickness allowance is less than the ones as stipulated in iacs 2012 it is noticed that when the risk mitigation cost is more than 15 of the steel lw cost the corrosion thickness allowance defined by the probabilistic approach is approaching the risk based corrosion thickness allowance as defined by the risk based approach 5 conclusion this study presented here two approaches one fully probabilistic closed form solution and the second one is a risk based direct one to define the corrosion thickness allowance of different ship corrosion environment spaces accounting for the two side corrosion degradation both approaches are based on calibrating a non linear time variant corrosion model to the newly collected data and reliability analysis employing the log normal formulation the structural corrosion degradation is identified as an initiating event of failure the risk based ship integrity assessment transforms this initiating event into a risk measure where all possible outcomes for the ship and the consequences of the overall hull girder failure are defined by the possible human loss loss of cargo contamination with fuel and lubricating oil the failure consequences are also time dependent due to the time value of money the corrosion thickness allowance for different corrosion environment spaces is defined and compared to the currently defined by iacs it was concluded that the defined corrosion thickness allowance for the corrosion environment of the class af is the upper bound for the classes gg and gi is the lover bound risk based corrosion thickness allowance applying the probabilistic closed form approach without considering the consequence cost the defined corrosion thickness allowance is less than the ones as stipulated in iacs 2012 probabilistic closed form solutions for the corrosion thickness allowance for different corrosion environments calibrated to the risk based corrosion allowance can be used in the design avoiding the complex risk based direct approach a question that remains for future investigations is the uncertainties related to the loss of cargo accidental spill and human life it has to be pointed out that the developed approaches of defining the corrosion thickness allowance are based on real corrosion depth measurements referring to a specific period type of oil tanker structures and corrosion environment spaces the developed approaches are flexible enough to represent any realistic corrosion environmental conditions and structures in estimating the corrosion allowance any further update of the already analysed data may result in a different trend in the estimated in the present

21657,the work studies the ship structural corrosion degradation allowance analysing several sets of corrosion thickness measurements collected from operating tankers the corrosion degradation process is modelled by a time dependent exponential function with parameters adjusted to real corrosion thickness measurement data corrosion margins of redundant ship structures with severe consequences of failure are derived based on two approaches probabilistic closed form solution and risk based direct approach the developed closed form solutions for the corrosion allowance for different corrosion environments can be used in the design avoiding a complex risk based assessment keywords corrosion degradation thickness allowance probabilistic analysis risk based approach 1 introduction corrosion can cause structural degradation of metal structures and recently many studies focused on this issue a profound analysis of the factors influencing the corrosion wastage of metal structures was presented in melchers 2003 for morphology in montero ocampo and veleva 2002 plate surface conditions and material properties in garbatov et al 2014 maintenance in garbatov et al 2016a 2018a and reliability assessment in garbatov and guedes soares 2009b a very important study of the environmental factors governing marine corrosion led to the identification of the governing corrosion factors for corrosion of ballast and cargo oil tanks was reported in guedes soares et al 2008 2013 many real measurements of corrosion thickness have been analysed and several corrosion models were developed in hart et al 1986 tscf 1992 1997 guedes soares and garbatov 1998 paik et al 1998 yamamoto and ikagaki 1998 guedes soares and garbatov 1999 wang et al 2003 jurišić et al 2017 nowadays special attention is paid to the fact that corrosion is not only reducing the thickness of structural components but also the mechanical properties are changed as observed in garbatov et al 2014 2016a 2018a leading to a severe strength reduction saad eldeen et al 2011a b garbatov et al 2016b woloszyk and garbatov 2020 zayed et al 2013a 2013b analysed the reliability of ship hulls subjected to corrosion and maintenance considering the uncertainties related to the loading conditions and inspection events a risk based framework for ship and structural design accounting for maintenance planning was developed by garbatov et al 2018b determining the maintenance plan of a ship hull structural system which can be used in the early stage of design accounting for different hazard scenarios specific economic environment and degradation severity along with the service life structural reliability assessment of a real tanker ship was performed based on experimentally estimated ultimate strength by woloszyk and garbatov 2019 where the strength estimate of the scaled specimen translation to a real scale tanker ship hull structure was made using the dimensional theory neumann et al 2019 performed conditional failure assessment to describe the required increasing maintenance with age where a rule based failure definition is applied trough the corrosion tolerance levels together with a linear corrosion degradation model a very recent study presented by gong et al 2020 investigated the economically optimal corrosion addition from a life cycle perspective by developing a probabilistic growth model consistent with corrosion additions as stipulated by iacs concluding that in some cases they may be less than that the defined ones initially the international maritime organization imo developed formal safety assessment fsa imo 2005 2006a b 2007 2008 2013 2015 to enhance the maritime safety and was employed in the development of new rules psaraftis 2012 montewka et al 2014 designing of ships in the degradation condition papanikolaou et al 2009 performing a sensitivity analysis on the hull girder safety level of a tanker ship guia et al 2016 and for development of a risk based framework for ship and structural design accounting for maintenance planning garbatov et al 2018b fsa considers the limit state concerning the corrosion deterioration mechanism as an ultimate limit state and its violation may lead to loss of ship cargo etc the corrosion degradation mechanism is a highly uncertain process accompanied with a large scatter leading to a substantial statistical deviation as a function of time as a result of that when the average corrosion thickness arrives at the level of the corrosion allowance as stipulated by iacs on some places the plate thickness reduction can be much severe the main objective in the present study is to define the corrosion allowance of redundant ship structures derived based on the probabilistic closed form solution and risk based direct approach which are only dependent on ship corrosion environments or spaces according to their physical chemical and operational characteristics the concern related to the structural capacity e g bending and yielding is covered by the net thickness plate design of ship structures which is not an objective of this study the present study analyses the structural corrosion degradation of six sets of recently collected corrosion thickness measurements the data sets were collected during various inspection campaigns of tankers in operation and reflected the ages of the ships and their level of degradation the developed closed form solution for the corrosion thickness allowances can be directly used in the ship structural design avoiding the complexity of the risk analysis collecting more data related to the corrosion degradation and information about the economic conditions during the ship life cycle can be easily incorporated and the output of the analysis can be updated 2 time dependent degradation the time dependent structural degradation is an important issue that needs to be accounted for when metal structures are designed its behaviour needs to be identified with respect to how quickly the structure will degrade when the structural deterioration reaches the non acceptable level in general three important approaches are employed in corrosion deterioration modelling the first one considers the corrosion growth with a linear dependence of the time and this is a very crude model the second one depends on the results of experiments in specific conditions leading to a corrosion growth as a function of a number of governing parameters in this case the corrosion model will follow the relationships derived from experiments in specific conditions as is being proposed in melchers 2003 this approach involves difficulties related to the translation of the results from coupons at coastal corrosion stations to full scale conditions and with the general lack of data on the environmental conditions which affect corrosion in a large scale regime garbatov and guedes soares 2008 the third approach which is the one that is used here is to consider that the model provides the trend that is based on the dominating corrosion mechanism and it is fit to the field data two corrosion degradation models based on the third approach are commonly used the one that was developed in guedes soares and garbatov 1998 1999 describing the corrosion thickness as an exponential function and the second developed in paik et al 1998 yamamoto and ikagaki 1998 expressed by a power function of time the study performed by garbatov and guedes soares 2019 analysed the two corroded degradation models of steel plates and their evaluation as best fitted to the real measurement data sets using advanced statistical methods an approach for proper identification of the best fitted model was applied and proved to be also a good option for identifying the time dependent statistical descriptors of the non linear corrosion models very extensive corrosion thickness measurement data sets of different structural components in different corrosive environments and ships garbatov and guedes soares 2008 2009a were analysed and based on the akaike s information criterion the power model paik et al 1998 yamamoto and ikagaki 1998 is identified as 29 more likely to have generated the analysed data and the exponential model guedes soares and garbatov 1999 as 71 respectively the time depended corrosion degradation growth as defined in the model of guedes soares and garbatov 1999 is composed of three stages including the coating life τ c where the corrosion protection system is capable of preventing corrosion degradation the transient time τ t where the corrosion is penetrating the protection system and starts to propagate and the steady state stage where due to the corrosion degradation a corrosion protection layer is created limiting the presence of the oxygen and as a result of that the corrosion degradation slows down in this respect the transient corrosion development starts from zero and goes to the final state and the steady state phase is approached once the time approaches the infinity the corrosion degradation response is divided into two regions associated with the transient time where the corrosion degradation is progressing and a steady state time in which the corrosion degradation is assumed to have reached its final stage d further when the exact starting point of the corrosion degradation is defined τ c coating life the corrosion degradation may be estimated as 1 d t τ c τ t d 1 e t τ c τ t eqn 1 has been proven to be a good solution in defining the corrosion thickness progress as a function of time of different ageing marine structures conditional of the coating life τ c and transitional time τ t as reported in jurišić et al 2017 garbatov and guedes soares 2019 the corrosion degradation model as presented in eqn 1 is seen as a three phase process the first phase no corrosion is observed because of the protection of the metal surface associated with the coating life t o τ c is working properly as can be seen in fig 1 the second phase starts when the corrosion protection fails and the corrosion degradation progress progressively decreases the thickness of the structural component t τ c 4 τ t the third phase is related to the stop in the corrosion degradation process and the corrosion rate becomes close to zero t 4 τ t garbatov and guedes soares 2019 cleaning the surface or any involuntary action that removes the surface corroded layer will restart the non linear corrosion growth process again the mean value of the corrosion degradation thickness as used in the present study is described as 2 e d t τ c τ t d d 1 e t τ c τ t t τ c 0 t τ c where τ c is the coating life τ t is the transition time and d is the maximum corrosion thickness developed during the corrosion degradation process 3 d τ t t a n α where α is the angle defined by oa and ob in fig 1 to calculate the variances of the corrosion thickness σ 2 d t τ c τ t d the first order taylor series expansion is used 4 σ 2 d t τ c τ t d i 1 2 d t τ c τ t d x i 2 σ x i 2 where the standard deviation is calculated as σ x i σ x i 2 and i 1 2 is taking the values of x 1 τ c x 2 τ t and σ x i 2 t is the variance o the stochastic variables x i as a function of time 5 σ x i 2 t x i 1 e t τ c τ x i 2 t τ c ship structural components that act on the boundaries between two spaces may have similar or different corrosion characteristics hence the different ship structural components can be classified according to their surrounding environments the reduction in the thickness of any ship structural components may be defined as a summation of the corrosion thicknesses of each side the prediction of the corrosion allowance for the different ship structural components will be based on the new corrosion thickness data analysed here the ship used for the present study is a double hull tanker with a length between the perpendiculars of 320 m breadth of 58 m depth of 31 m and draft of 22 m the structural arrangements longitudinal divisions and stiffening are presented by the mid ship section in fig 2 left the different ship environments or spaces are classified according to their physical chemical and operational characteristics that affect the corrosion deterioration ship spaces that have similar environmental characteristics have similar corrosion degradation and will belong to the same class this is similar to what is considered in iacs 2012 for the definition of the corrosion wastage allowances for the structural members in different ship spaces based on this classification the different environments around the mid ship section are defined in fig 2 right where each environment is indicated by an alphabetical letter each ship structural component is exposed to two environments one at each side where they can be different or similar hence two alphabetical letters are used to indicate the environments around each plate the corrosion model that was calibrated in garbatov et al 2007 to several corrosion data sets are considered here to represent the double side corrosion models for the environmental classes ad cg gg dd ff and gi six independent sets of real measurements of corrosion thickness of tanker ships are analysed here the ad set of data of deck plates includes 4104 measurements of deck plates from the cargo ballast tanks see fig 3 left the cg set includes 1216 measurements of inner bottom plates between cargo and ballast tanks see fig 3 right the gg set includes 1010 measurements of structural components from ballast tanks see fig 4 left the dd set includes 500 measurements of deck longitudinals of cargo tanks see fig 4 right the af set includes 1226 measurements of deck plates of ballast tanks see fig 5 left and the gi set includes 386 measurements of bottom plates of ballast tanks see fig 5 right the data exhibits a large scatter reflecting the nature of the problem as this is data from many ships that are subjected to various environmental conditions and thus the variability is unavoidable the mean value lower and upper 95 confidence levels of the corrosion thickness as a function of time for different corrosion environments are shown in fig 6 to fig 8 and the corrosion model parameters τ c τ t and d obtained from the analysis are shown in table 1 3 probabilistic corrosion thickness estimate the time dependent corrosion degradation of structural components may reduce the strength of the ship hull structure and can initiate buckling fatigue damage rupture and transformation of the structure into a mechanism in this respect the deterioration mechanism needs to be considered in the ultimate limit state analysis the probabilistic design methods are based on the comparison of the reliability beta index β with its target value β t r moreover it is applied to design so that the design variable is close to the target design values the target values of the reliability index as stipulated in en1990 2002 is defined based on previous reliability studies depending on many factors having a great scatter however the recommended target reliability index may be considered as reasonable average values related to existing structures another definition of the target reliability index is based on the minimum requirement for human safety as defined by iso 2394 iso2394 1998 using the reliability analysis as a decision tool the estimated probability of failure is compared to an accepted target level the target levels depend on different factors as reported by moan 1998 may vary from one industry to another depending on the seriousness of its consequence or public and media sensitivity appropriate values of the target safety and reliability are not readily available and are usually determined by surveys or by examinations of the statistics on failures considering a reference period t r the beta target reliability level β t r corresponding to an arbitrary service life can be derived based on the annual beta reliability index β 1 as 6 β t r φ 1 φ β 1 t r a more detailed recommendation is provided in iso 2394 1998 where the beta target reliability index is given for the service life and related not only to the consequences but also to the relative costs of the safety measures as can be seen as for an example in garbatov et al 2018b the probabilistic optimisation is one possible way of defining the acceptable reliability level in increasing the reliability level the life cycle cost of structures increase but at the same time the consequences cost as a result of structural failure decreases the collapse due to corrosion degradation is identified as an initiating event of failure the risk based ship integrity assessment transforms these initiating event into a risk measure where all possible outcomes for the ship are evaluated the consequences of the overall hull girder failure are defined by the possible human loss loss of cargo contamination with fuel and lubricating oil the probability of failure is defined by corrosion degradation the failure consequences are also time dependent due to the time value of money 3 1 reliability estimate the reliability is defined as the probability of maintaining the ability to fulfil the design purpose for some period the objective is to estimate the reliability based on its capacity when the demand acts the reliability analysis here is using the log normal formulation to identify a set of basic random variables that influence the failure mode or the limit state under consideration it applies that the corrosion thickness and allowance are log normal distributed stochastic variables fsa considers the limit state concerning the corrosion deterioration mechanism as an ultimate limit state and its violation may lead to loss of ship cargo etc the corrosion degradation mechanism is a highly uncertain process accompanied with a large scatter leading to a substantial statistical deviation as a function of time as a result of that when the average corrosion thickness arrives at the level of the corrosion allowance as stipulated by iacs the reduction of the plate thickness can be much severe in some places the limit state function is defined as 7 g t x d u d d t x where d u is the corrosion thickness allowance d d t x d t τ c τ t d φ t is the corrosion thickness demand φ t is the uncertainty related to the corrosion thickness model and x is the vector of parameters involved in the limit state function the limit state function divides the design space into a safe region when g t x 0 and an unsafe one when g t x 0 the reliability index of the corrosion degradation limit state where the stochastic variables associated with the corrosion thickness are also assumed to follow the log normal distribution is defined as kececioglu 1991 8 β t x e l n d u e l n d d t x σ 2 l n d u σ 2 l n d d t x where the mean values and standard deviations of the involved stochastic variables are estimated as 9 e l n d u l n e d u 0 5 σ 2 l n d u 10 σ 2 l n d u l n 1 σ d u e d u 2 11 e l n d d t x l n e d d t x 0 5 σ 2 l n d d t x 12 σ 2 l n d d t x l n 1 e φ t 2 σ 2 d t x d t x 2 σ 2 φ t e d t x e φ t 2 where the mean value e d t x and the variance σ 2 d t x are calculated employing eqns 2 and 5 fitted to the specific dataset of corrosion thickness measurements see figs 6 8 the failure state is defined by g t x 0 leading to the fact that the corrosion thickness growth is bigger than the corrosion allowance the probability of failure is defined as a function of the reliability index β t x as 13 p f t x p g t x 0 φ β t x the violation of the limit state function for any two corrosion environmental classes ad cg gg dd af and gi is defined by employing the two areas at time taat analysis in that case the initial corrosion thickness allowance in n 2 environmental corrosion areas are unchanged and only the corrosion thickness allowance in two classes is varied to analyse its impact on the reliability estimate the taat approach is not accounting for the possible interaction between the pair of the corrosion thickness allowance in different corrosion environmental areas 3 2 risk based corrosion thickness allowance the uncertainties associated with the collapse due to structural corrosion degradation may lead to potential losses of the ship as a result of the structural collapse in different corrosion environment spaces which is expressed as a probability of failure p f j and accounted for in the risk assessment the probability of failure is described as a numeric value and the consequences c f j in a monetary value 14 r i s k t n j 1 n p f j p g t j x 0 c f j t j x where p f j p g t j x 0 is the probability of failure c f j t j x is the impact which defines the consequence cost of failure x is the vector of the involved parameters and t j ε t o t n is the time the probability of failure is derived based on the limit state employing the log normal formulation the consequence costs include the risk measures loss of cargo loss of the ship accidental spill and loss of human life the ship s structural safety level may be established by employing a cost benefit analysis where the goal is to define an acceptable safety and reliability level by using the risk control option in estimating the corrosion thickness allowance for different corrosion environments in ship spaces the cost benefit analysis of the ship is performed based on the total expected risk r i s k t o t a l t n x which is a product of the probability of failure and consequence cost defined as 15 r i s k t o t a l t n x r i s k f a i l u r e t n x r i s k m e a s u r e t n x where r i s k f a i l u r e t n x is the risk associated with the failure and its consequence costs and r i s k m e a s u r e t n x is the cost of the implemented ship risk measures in redefining the corrosion thickness allowance both terms are defined as a function of the reliability index β as this in return influences the estimate of the target beta reliability level β t r a decision about the corrosion thickness allowance can be made analysing the cost associated with the loss of the ship cargo accidental spill and human life and minimising the total expected risk r i s k t o t a l t n x the risk associated with the ship collapse is estimated based on the service life of 25 years accounting for the probability of failure associated cost and the discount rate γ as a function of x and time as r i s k f a i l u r e t n x j 1 n p f j t j x c r e s a l e t j x c c a r g o c s p i l l c h u m a n e γ t j 16 where p f j t j x is the probability of failure c r e s a l e t j x is the resale cost of the ship in the year t j c c a r g o is the cost associated with the loss of cargo c s p i l l is the cost of the accidental spill c h u m a n is the cost associated with the loss of human life on board of the ship the discount rate γ is assumed as 5 the cost of the ship resale c r e s a l e t j x at any time t j is defined as a function of the initial cost of the ship c t o at t o 0 year and the resale value c t n at the t n year estimated as 17 c r e s a l e t j x c t o c t o c t n 1 e t τ s h i p t where τ s h i p t is the transition time of the cost diminution assumed here as seven years the initial cost of the ship c t o 38 m and the resale value c t n is a function of the initial cost and the risk measure where the scrap cost is assumed as 120 ton and structural enhancement as 3000 ton involving the cost of additional material labour and another shipyard cost the cost of the loss of oil cargo c c a r g o is estimated assuming that a part of the oil cargo p c a r g o is lost in the case of ship collapse defined as 18 c c a r g o c c a r g o t o n f c a r g o p c a r g o where c c a r g o t o n is the cost of one ton of oil cargo and f c a r g o is the percentage of the cargo lost the oil cargo is 216 794 tons the percentage assumed of the cargo lost is 5 and the cost of one ton of oil is 108 ton in the case of ship collapse apart f s p i l l of the total amount of oil and fuel p f u e l may be spilt and f s h o r e is the probability of the amount of spill reaching the shoreline sørgard et al 1999 the weight of discharge that needs to be cleaned up is defined as f s p i l l f s h o r e p f u e l and the cost c s p i l l associated with that is 19 c s p i l l f s p i l l f s h o r e c a t s p f u e l where c a t s is the cost of one ton accidently spilt oil and fuel that needs to be cleaned it is assumed that 5 of the total oil cargo is spill and 2 5 of that amount will reach the shoreline the cost of the oil to be cleaned is defined as 8312 ton as stipulated in etkin 1999 assuming the spill is of heavy crude in the european seas with a moderate shoreline oiling and dispersant primary clean up strategy is employed the cost associated with the fatality is based on icaf implied cost of avoiding a fatality which uses a risk model obtained from the average of the ocde countries ocde 2014 the cost of loss of human life here is defined as given in horte et al 2007 20 c h u m a n n c r e w f c r e w i c a f where n c r e w is the number of crew members f c r e w is the probability of loss of human life the crew members are 20 and the crew member loss is assumed as 10 and icaf 3 85 m crew member the cost of enhancing safety by redesign the corrosion thickness allowance including the cost of material and labour is defined as 21 r i s k m e a s u r e t j t o x c s h i p t j t o x c s h i p t j t o x where c s h i p t j t o x is the cost of the ship associated with the reliability level β o without corrosion allowance the risk measure and total risk as a function of corrosion thickness allowance for the corrosion environment ad are shown in fig 9 and the optimum corrosion thickness and target reliability indexes at the first year recalculated from the one at the 25th year for all studied corrosion environmental areas are given in table 2 it can be seen from figs 10 12 that the beta index as a function of the corrosion degradation presents different behaviour following the specific corrosion environmental condition and existing protection system measured by the coating life transition time and the long term corrosion thickness the shortest coating life is observed for the gg corrosion space 3 3 failure based corrosion thickness allowance additionally to the risk analysis a new probabilistic closed form approach is presented here in defining the corrosion thickness allowance independently to any economic criteria considering that d is a fixed effect the coating life τ c is neglected at the first stage of analysis and τ t is assumed as a stochastic variable distributed as l n e l n τ t σ 2 l n τ t the probability that 22 p τ t t u f a i l u r e l n d u f a i l u r e d d φ l l n t u f a i l u r e l n d u f a i l u r e d d e τ t 1 2 σ 2 l n τ t σ l n τ t

corrosion thickness d u f a i l u r e as a function of the time to failure t u f a i l u r e conditional of the acceptable target reliability level β 25 at the end of the service life of t 25 25 years and the coating protection time τ c can be estimated as 25 d u f a i l u r e 1 e t 25 τ c e τ t e σ l n τ t β 25 0 5 σ l n τ t d the corrosion thickness d u f a i l u r e and failure time t u f a i l

environment space as can be noticed the corrosion thickness for the spaces with less steel lightweight differ significantly concerning the ones defined based on the risk d u r i s k it can also be noticed that once the risk mitigation cost associated with more than 15 of the steel lw cost the probabilistically defined corrosion thickness allowance are approaching the risk based ones as can be seen in fig 13 to adjust the failure based corrosion thickness allowance d u f a i l u r e to the risk based corrosion thickness allowance d u r i s k a calibration function is introduced here as 26 d u r i s k f c d u f a i l u r e where the calibration function is defined as 27 f c 0 678 s t e e l l w 0 249 the probabilistic closed form solutions for the corrosion thickness allowance for different corrosion environments calibrated to the risk based corrosion allowance can be used in the structural design avoiding the complex risk based direct approach 4 design corrosion thickness allowance of tanker ships iacs 2012 defined the corrosion wastage allowances to be added to the structural component net thickness in the different ship corrosion environment spaces these wastage allowances are defined based on the previous corrosion degradation history of the structural component under certain environmental conditions the defined corrosion wastage allowances reflect the experience and resources of all the classification societies to achieve a 25 year design life and they are applied to the design net thickness as can be seen in fig 14 the results of the developed risk based corrosion thickness allowance of a tanker fleet in comparison to the ones stipulated by iacs 2012 are presented in table 4 as can be noticed from table 4 the corrosion thickness allowance matches exactly the ones of ad cg and dd and some noticeable difference can be seen in the case of af gg and gi it can also be seen that the risk mitigation cost in the case of af is very low 1 of the steel lw cost which results in a higher corrosion thickness allowance and more reliable design solution β 25 2 46 on the contrary the classes gg and gi present a high risk mitigation cost about 26 and 15 of the steel lw cost and the encountered design solution at β 25 1 59 and 1 16 results in a corrosion thickness allowance of 2 5 and 2 3 which is lesser than the ones stipulated in iacs 2012 it may be concluded that the encountered solution for the class af is the upper bound and for the classes gg and gi is the lover bound risk based solution for the corrosion thickness allowance applying the probabilistic approach purely see table 3 without considering the consequence cost the defined corrosion thickness allowance is less than the ones as stipulated in iacs 2012 it is noticed that when the risk mitigation cost is more than 15 of the steel lw cost the corrosion thickness allowance defined by the probabilistic approach is approaching the risk based corrosion thickness allowance as defined by the risk based approach 5 conclusion this study presented here two approaches one fully probabilistic closed form solution and the second one is a risk based direct one to define the corrosion thickness allowance of different ship corrosion environment spaces accounting for the two side corrosion degradation both approaches are based on calibrating a non linear time variant corrosion model to the newly collected data and reliability analysis employing the log normal formulation the structural corrosion degradation is identified as an initiating event of failure the risk based ship integrity assessment transforms this initiating event into a risk measure where all possible outcomes for the ship and the consequences of the overall hull girder failure are defined by the possible human loss loss of cargo contamination with fuel and lubricating oil the failure consequences are also time dependent due to the time value of money the corrosion thickness allowance for different corrosion environment spaces is defined and compared to the currently defined by iacs it was concluded that the defined corrosion thickness allowance for the corrosion environment of the class af is the upper bound for the classes gg and gi is the lover bound risk based corrosion thickness allowance applying the probabilistic closed form approach without considering the consequence cost the defined corrosion thickness allowance is less than the ones as stipulated in iacs 2012 probabilistic closed form solutions for the corrosion thickness allowance for different corrosion environments calibrated to the risk based corrosion allowance can be used in the design avoiding the complex risk based direct approach a question that remains for future investigations is the uncertainties related to the loss of cargo accidental spill and human life it has to be pointed out that the developed approaches of defining the corrosion thickness allowance are based on real corrosion depth measurements referring to a specific period type of oil tanker structures and corrosion environment spaces the developed approaches are flexible enough to represent any realistic corrosion environmental conditions and structures in estimating the corrosion allowance any further update of the already analysed data may result in a different trend in the estimated in the present study corrosion allowances credit authorship contribution statement yordan garbatov writing original draft declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

21658,this paper introduces the concept of collision avoidance dynamic critical area cadca for onboard decision support systems dss the indicator proposed is derived via identification of a minimum required maneuvering zone in an encounter between two vessels the cadca model accounts for ship maneuvering dynamics and associated hydrodynamic actions emerging from different rudder angles and forward speed effects the method presented is novel as it considers the variability of a critical area due to dynamic changes in operational parameters for both vessels results of the simulations carried out in negligible weather conditions confirm that computed zones may differ significantly in terms of shapes and limits it is demonstrated that the size of the cadca depends on the rudder

operators of shipborne radars the latter evolved over the years and transformed from circles to ellipses or polygons riggs 1975 riggs and o sullivan 1980 zhao lin 1988 another concept known as collision threat parameters ctps was introduced and developed by lenart 2015 1983 to date ctps have been utilized modified and validated by various researchers for instance szlapczynski 2008 szlapczynski and smierzchalski 2009 combined ctp with fuzzy logic while szlapczynska and szlapczynski 2017 szlapczynski and krata 2018 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 applied it to the ship domains smierzchalski 2005 as well as smierzchalski and michalewicz 2000 utilized the concept in evolutionary path planning whereas chen et al 2019 2018 used a similar approach in probabilistic risk analyses despite the progress made the vast majority of existing solutions do not account for the influence of the dynamics of ship operations in a realistic environment accordingly the number of studies focused on close quarter situations considering ship dynamics has been limited colley et al 1983 hilgert 1983 krata et al 2016 montewka et al 2012 ni et al 2019 however the impact of weather conditions on an encounter between two vessels has been taken into account by szlapczynski et al 2018a as well as szlapczynski and krata 2018 it is broadly acknowledged that ship operational parameters interpreted as rudder angle and initial forward speed may differ depending on the encounter therefore the maneuvering area should also vary to provide adequate prediction in real time assessment its shape could respond to the influence of ship dynamics and operational conditions gil et al 2019a 2020a this idea of introducing a zonal indicator aligns with the priorities of the e navigation initiative introduced by the international maritime organization imo 2008 the primary objective of this concept was to boost the level of maritime safety this enhancement could be achieved inter alia by utilizing navigational dsss gil et al 2020b perera et al 2015 2012 weintrit 2013 especially for collision avoidance baldauf et al 2014 baldauf and hong 2016 nevertheless despite the progressive development of technological solutions implemented on merchant ships a collision still remains one of the most common reasons for maritime disasters in european waters collisions comprise almost one quarter of navigational causes of accidents while these represent more than half of all casualty events emsa 2018 therefore providing new and effective methods of ship collision avoidance is essential they could be utilized as a graphical form with a ship vector presented as an overlay to already existing onboard devices like radar ma et al 2015 or ecdis electronic chart display and information system weintrit 2009 furthermore experts with seagoing experience have evaluated the utilization of navigational equipment as essential in the process of ship ship collision avoidance gil et al 2019b this paper introduces the concept of collision avoidance dynamic critical area cadca as a novel safety zone that varies depending on the operational parameters of particular vessels a version dedicated to onboard applications is presented here so the target ship maintains her course and speed during an encounter consequently the paper demonstrates an efficient method for determining cadca in various simulation scenarios thirdly it presents the application of the method in order to verify whether and how the operating parameters of the ship affect the required maneuvering area therefore for the scenarios presented in this paper the presence of wind and waves has been omitted the rest of the paper is organized as follows the methods used in the study are presented in section 2 along with assumptions principles and a novel algorithm to determine cadca section 3 provides an analysis of the results for various operational ship parameters in different simulation scenarios the discussion about the presented solution and the methods used to handle uncertainties is provided in section 4 while section 5 concludes the paper 2 methods the main intention of introducing a novel type of safety zone in the encounter between two vessels is twofold firstly the required maneuvering area for evasive action should be determined for the most critical navigational scenarios secondly the dynamics of a vessel in the process of collision avoidance should be taken into account to keep further reasoning realistic the cadca concept helps to define a minimum distance between encountering vessels which represents the last chance to avoid a collision the own ship is located within the limits of the cadca envelope that changes shape accordingly to the vessel s current operating parameters in this paper the indicator related to the execution of an evasive maneuver and a 6dof motion model have been used to determine the cadca shape and its boundaries in realistic collision scenarios 2 1 the last minute maneuver lmm the concept of cadca is based on a critical navigational scenario known as the last minute also chance or moment maneuver this type of evasive action is strictly related to the requirements of the colregs international regulations for preventing collisions at sea rule 17 imo 2010 several elaborations concerning the action of a stand on vessel and interpretation of this regulation can be found in the literature see e g cockcroft and lameijer 2012 crosbie 2008 rymarz 2007 sweeney 1992 however only a few research papers related to lmm and especially its determination exist koszelew and wołejsza 2017 miloh 1975 montewka and krata 2014 ożoga and montewka 2018 rymarz 2007 szlapczynski et al 2018b according to colreg rule 17 the conduct of a stand on vessel varies during an encounter situation imo 2010 as shown in fig 1 an encounter of vessels approaching on collision courses can be divided into four stages where the ship s action depends on the distance between herself and the give way vessel cockcroft and lameijer 2012 rymarz 2007 lmm refers to a situation when the stand on vessel despite the right of the way is obliged to execute an evasive maneuver that situation occurs if the action of the give way vessel is executed too late or not undertaken at all therefore the stand on vessel is in stage iv and under rule 17 her evasive action is mandatory in such a situation only effective single action undertaken by the stand on vessel or joint operation involving both ships could avoid a collision koszelew and wołejsza 2017 as well as wójcik et al 2016 define lmm as a joint maneuver of both ships involved in an encounter when the single action of the stand on vessel would be insufficient to avoid a collision this approach is fully compliant with the colreg rule 17 b but from the operational point of view a situation when the stand on vessel has to execute a maneuver on her own seems to be even more essential this is because of a lack or incorrect action of the give way ship which results in a larger maneuvering area being required therefore in this paper the target vessel stays passive and maintains her present course and speed throughout the entire encounter 2 2 minimum distance to collision mdtc in the cadca concept mdtc has been utilized since it allows to convert the distance in an encounter between two vessels into the required maneuvering area mdtc was introduced by montewka et al 2010 and further developed by montewka et al 2012 2011a 2011b as depicted in fig 2 this indicator can be defined as the minimum distance between two vessels in a close quarters situation when the execution of successful evasive maneuver is still feasible therefore mdtc allows for the determination of the lmm parameters mdtc is based on a two dimensional coordinate system where the projections of the vessels are plotted interpretation of their positions and headings may lead to the conclusion that in each encounter between two ships only one mdtc exists the indicator is calculated between the hulls for a given bearing and may take the hydrodynamics of the vessels into consideration to this end this paper uses ship trajectories projected by laidyn software 2 3 the laidyn model laidyn is a numerical ship motion model introduced by matusiak 2017 it simulates the behavior of a vessel in regular and irregular waves while also allowing for the combination of seakeeping and maneuvering acanfora et al 2017 matusiak 2007 2011 the ship is represented as a rigid body wherein non linear wave effects as well as restoring and froude krylov forces are included manderbacka et al 2011 the numerical model can be defined as a hybrid non linear model in 6 degrees of freedom 6dof in the time domain with the assumption that the ship is a rigid body the prime coordinate systems used for describing ship motion are presented in fig 3 to these belong the inertial system fixed to earth with the x y plane coincident with the still water level and the body fixed reference frame x y z originating from the ship s center of gravity matusiak 2017 the equations of the

i i are the mass moments of inertia resistance propulsion prop wave and maneuvering man correspond to particular forces and moments acting on ship matusiak 2017 the adopted notation uses the upper case letters for forces and moment components and the lower case letters for co ordinates the stripe theory is applied to obtain the values of elements of the added mass matrix we utilize sealoads software kukkanen 1995 although any other relevant method might be used the radiation and diffraction forces are calculated using the linear model based on the assumption of small amplitude oscillatory motions journée and massie 2001 kukkanen 1995 determining radiation forces one takes into account the history of the past motions by applying the convolution integral representation cummins 1962 see equation 2 2 x r a d t a x t t k t τ x τ d τ where a is the matrix of added masses for an infinite frequency x is response vector k is the retardation function also called memory function which depends on a damping matrix cummins 1962 τ is the time since the impulse initiation whose contribution is modeled by the impulse function while t is the time instant at which the motion is computed the convolution integral functions are used for heave roll and pitch motions only the non linear part of the code includes froude krylov hydrostatic forces as well as maneuvering and propulsion manderbacka et al 2011 matusiak 2011 the maneuvering part of the model is described as presented in equation 3 3 x x v v v 2 x r r r 2 x v v v v v 4 y y v v y r r y v v v v y r r r r y v v

form defined as follows v v u and r r l p p u with v sway velocity u ship initial velocity r yaw velocity and l pp ship length between perpendiculars as given in the formulas equations 1 3 the laidyn model utilizes a set of differential equations of motion which implies a need for solving discrete time equations the runge kutta methods are adopted in the software which is quite a common approach laidyn has been validated by international benchmark studies ittc 2005 2002 and pmm planar motion mechanism model tests matusiak and stigler 2012 the results demonstrated sufficient accuracy especially for ro paxes and container vessels acanfora et al 2017 operating also in severe weather acanfora et al 2018 additionally laidyn has been used in the estimation of dynamic effects of passenger ship flooding manderbacka et al 2011 weather routing of merchant vessels krata and szlapczynska 2018 as well as in a risk assessment and collision avoidance hinz et al 2018 montewka et al 2010 szlapczynski et al 2018a szlapczynski and krata 2018 in the concept of cadca laidyn is utilized to simulate ship motions in 6dof for specific operating and environmental conditions the software generates vessel trajectories including turning circles for various operational parameters as a result the ship s coordinates and values of her translational and rotational motions are delivered 2 4 cadca structure previous studies introduced a simplified critical area for the case of a ro pax vessel krata et al 2016 montewka and krata 2014 in this paper the model and the method have been significantly improved by taking into account ship dynamics cadca shown in fig 4 is designed as a safety zone surrounding the ship in a close quarters situation the shape and limits of the envelope are delimited by mdtc values and the area can be generated for different navigational scenarios these can include cases where one of the vessels involved in the encounter undertakes the single action or if they both act jointly the ships can alter their courses to port or starboard side at various initial speeds using different settings of the rudder nevertheless the oow does not know the maneuverability and hydrodynamics of the target ship or the actual magnitude of her rudder during routine sea passage for this reason in the following sections cadcas are presented for the single maneuver of the own ship while the target remains passive during an approach and only maintains course and speed depending on the final application of cadca the area can be presented in different forms in fig 4 the zone depicts mdtcs obtained for various initial headings of the target to present it in more intuitive way the values are given for the bearings brg ts outer scale instead of the headings therefore cadca can be defined equation 4 as a set of planar positions of the target ship such that for all bearings mdtc exists and is used to determine the coordinates of the envelope 4 c a d c a x y r 2 b r g t s α r 0 α 2 π m d t c x r x 0 x m d t c cos b r g t s y m d t c sin b r g t s where brg ts means a bearing to the target vessel mdtc stands for the minimum distance to collision x and y are planar coordinates of the mdtc boundary positions 2 5 simulation method safety of navigation requires high accuracy indicators for use in collision avoidance as presented in fig 5 the resolution of cadca is an important issue with regards to the reliable estimation of a critical maneuvering area this may result in a massive number of combinations for various operational parameters of ships therefore it was crucial to develop a novel algorithm for efficient determination of cadca that will provide the possibility to filter out navigational scenarios selected by the user see fig 6 the simulator presented in this paper allows for selecting different numerical ship models and their operational parameters separately for the own ship os and the target ship ts configuration files read configs block as per fig 6 represent the database which stores information about the models of the ships used a user can select which vessels will be used for cadca computation important parameters such as rudder angle or forward speed can be defined there they enable the simulations to be narrowed further and the results to be filtered the initial headings and utilized strategies ships positioning hulls projections or vessels moving are then selected consequently the summary of trajectories delivered by laidyn is loaded to determine the simulation cases these may be understood as a set of operating and if applicable environmental parameters of ships involved in the encounter the simulation cases are grouped and filtered according to the user s selection to begin the computation process individual os and ts trajectories are merged into one set this list is called simulation scenarios and contains information about combined cases for both ships with respect to the previous grouping final data are passed to the computation stage of the algorithm the part of the simulator where mdtcs are calculated is the most crucial for the determination of the cadca introduced therefore it is presented more specifically in the sequence diagram in fig 7 the simulator utilizes a similar approach to the top down method used in the analysis of maritime accidents the computer application starts the procedure from the initial collision of two vessels to calculate the mdtc for each encounter the software generates four boundary positions of the hulls as depicted in fig 8 these are represented by tangents to the bow stern and sides of each ship regarding their headings it has been assumed that for any given heading any offset between the hulls will cause a collision therefore it was sufficient to merely consider the critical positions of the ships instead of all possibilities as presented in fig 8 the simulator allows one of three types of simplified ship s hull shapes to be selected such as rectangular a elliptical b and hybrid c the results and examples presented in this paper are based on the hybrid type c as its shape is the most similar to the real hull of the ship from the four boundary ship arrangements shown in fig 8 only the unfavorable one understood as the simulation result with the largest mdtc is considered in the cadca after the ships positioning the sequence of moving astern and ahead is executed as demonstrated in fig 9 where the vessels are moved simultaneously backwards and apart for a given time step the own ship os proceeds along the trajectory loaded from laidyn in the event of a collision the algorithm loops for as long as the first chance to avoid an accident occurs the approach based on simultaneously moving the vessels astern allows an encounter to be reproduced that is compliant with colreg rule 7 risk of collision assumptions imo 2010 the method used for cadca determination faces some limitations mainly related to the accuracy of idealized ship ship interactions ship positioning maneuvering simulations and their associated data intervals to manage these uncertainties a virtual safety margin has been implemented see dashed lines in fig 10 therefore the mdtc between safety margins is calculated rather than the hulls of the vessels the plotting sheet depicting an exemplary simulation scenario with included safety margins is presented see fig 10 all uncertainties identified during the study which affect the size of introduced safety margin are further elaborated in detail in section 4 2 in navigation practice terms course alteration is a key part of a vessel s collision avoidance maneuvers this is because it is more efficient than changing speed especially for large ships with conventional propulsion and steering devices according to colreg rule 8 the alteration of the course should be large enough to be noticeable and transparent for the second vessel either visually or by radar imo 2010 in this statement the term large enough is rather vague although in navigational practice it is assumed that an alteration of at least 30 will be executed depending on the case practical recommendations may suggest even larger changes of the course up to 60 or even 90 e g under restricted visibility conditions cockcroft and lameijer 2012 to keep the alteration of the course large enough and at the same time reasonable the algorithm introduced in this paper alters the os s heading by 60 however as presented in fig 11 the alteration of the course by a fixed value could be inefficient especially when ships proceed at the same speed in certain cases the full ship turning circle should be executed instead of a 60 turn to provide effective evasive action such a situation may occur in scenarios where the mdtc value is exceptionally large due to some unfavorable parameters of the encounter such as mutual headings same speed of ships etc therefore to maintain the operational usefulness of the cadca for onboard applications the algorithm acts in two ways and suggests a course change of either 60 or 360 the results are generated when the overlaying ship trajectory allows for the successful execution of an evasive maneuver the maximum mdtc value for each simulation scenario is taken into account for further analysis finally computed distances are generated along with radar plots depicting the cadca the pseudocode of the described simulator with its generalized mathematical formulation is presented in algorithm 1 algorithm 1 the pseudocode with generalized mathematical formulation of the cadca simulator image 1 3 results to investigate whether and how the operating parameters of encountering vessels affect the size and limits of the cadca a simulation study was carried out for large fig 12 and medium size passenger vessels fig 13 both ships are representative of modern cruise ships previously considered in an eu funded project called floodstand integrated flooding and standard for stability and crises management kujanpää and routi 2009 luhmann 2009 in the simulations presented here these ships were used as os and ts their main particulars are presented in table 1 several data breakdowns have been prepared to investigate how the vessel parameters impact the cadca in negligible weather conditions table 2 outlines a summary of all the conducted simulations to ensure a high level of accuracy all cadcas have been determined for 360 headings of the ts thus for each initial arrangement of the vessels the os was always set on a northern course 000 while the ts heading varies by 1 step within the range of t s h d g 000 360 all figures depicting the cadca were prepared as polar plots with ts brg vs mdtc nm 3 1 magnitude of the rudder angle simulations of evasive maneuvers using different magnitudes of rudder angle were conducted to investigate how this parameter impacts the cadca scenarios when both vessels proceed at an equal speed of 20 kts are presented in fig 14 fsa on the left fsb on the right these were conducted in order to verify the effect of the os rudder setting in the simulations the os rudder was set to the starboard side at one of four different angles from 5 to 35 for a 10 step while the ts maintained her course in cases where the vessels were on parallel courses they could not possibly collide this trivial phenomenon occurred because of negligible external disturbances and the identical speed of both ships consequently these cases were rejected from the analyzed set as presented in fig 14 the cadca may vary for different settings of the rudder however its change in shape mainly differs significantly for a rudder angle of 5 while for other angles it is similar the zones determined for fsa are generally comparable to these obtained for fsb but with proportionally larger limits the maximum mdtcs noticed at this stage of the study were around 2 2 nm for floodstand a and 1 6 nm for floodstand b for both ships the largest mdtcs were noticed within bearings of 320 340 when the ts began the simulations with headings within the range of 090 140 this means that the worst navigational cases occur in crossing scenarios and in that event the evasive maneuvers should be executed beforehand although the maximum mdtc values for each rudder angle are similar the sizes of the areas differ it is necessary to have a maneuvering area almost twice as large for a 5 rudder than for a 35 rudder 1 9 for fsa and 1 8 for fsb thus the smaller rudder angle of the os the larger the cadca the changes in the required maneuvering area for various rudder settings of both analyzed ships are presented in table 3 a significant slip may be observed around the 330 bearing in the vast majority of the simulations this could happen because of changes in the initial arrangements of the vessels as depicted in fig 8 the algorithm that determines the cadca selects the opposite set of initial vessel positions as the worst navigation scenario this issue is elaborated further in section 4 3 where a method that could be used to reduce the impact of this phenomenon is proposed 3 2 initial forward speed the impact of the initial forward speed of the encountering vessels has been verified using a similar approach to the one described in section 3 1 see fig 15 accordingly the rudder angles for both vessels were fixed to investigate solely the effect of the forward speed the os rudder was set to starboard 5 while the ts kept her rudder amidships table 2 at the beginning of the simulation the forward speed of the os was 12 kts which is the minimum value considered in the study the ts speed varied from 12 kts to 16 kts and eventually increased to 20 kts as presented in fig 15 and table 4 the shape and limits of cadca differ significantly compared to the cases where the rudder angle was investigated in these scenarios the os proceeded at the minimum available speed 12 kts so the ts is always a threat maximum mdtc values were noticed in two sectors of bearings namely 120 135 and 305 320 the largest distances for fsa 4 0 and 3 9 nm were determined when the target vessel proceeds at maximum speed 20 kts on courses of 340 overtaking and 110 crossing this implies that the faster the ts proceeds the larger the cadca becomes the shape of the zone as well as general findings concerning the values of bearings courses and speeds are similar for fsb the difference between the cadca for fsa and fsb is mainly its size which is proportionally smaller this is the reason why the maximum observed mdtc for fsb in a comparable case is 3 0 nm the appearance of the cadca abaft of the os leads to significant changes instead of one sector with high mdtcs as in the previous cases the second range of large values can be observed on the opposite side see fig 15 thus when the ts starts the simulation with an initial heading of around 340 at 20 kts it leads to the maximum distance being generated astern of the os the presence of two dangerous sectors arises from the unfavorable speed difference between the vessels and this causes a significant increase in the required maneuvering area because the ts proceeds faster than the os she is always a threat the relative speed seems to be of crucial significance in the analyzed cases this could be confirmed by the shape of the zone for ts sog 12 kts when the encountering ships are equally fast and the cadca has no additional sector abaft the second reason for the additional dangerous sector is the direction of the ship s turn assuming that the os executed a turn to the starboard side the ts may overtake her in the vast majority of analyzed scenarios such a situation would lead to maneuvering toward the ts therefore if the observed ts is faster than the os especially keen monitoring is required not only on forward of the beam but also abaft and particularly on the side where the evasive maneuver will be executed most frequently the starboard side 3 3 comparative analysis in order to compare how the operational parameters of encountering vessels may affect the cadca aggregated results were prepared for both ship models to this end simulations of all remaining cases which are not only limited to the combinations shown in table 2 were conducted then all the determined areas were compared and color coded depending on their impact on the size of the area as shown in fig 16 the cadca for fsa and fsb obtained for maximal mdtc values when all possible parameter combinations are aggregated is presented in fig 17 the surface plots prepared to compare the cadca sizes indicate that the size of the required maneuvering area may also depend on the operating parameters of the vessels visualizations of these charts confirm that the relationship between the rudder angle and relative speed is similar for both analyzed ship models however when comparing areas to the smallest determined cadca it can be noticed that the size of the area may increase multiple times depending on the combination of parameters for example in the most unfavorable conditions the cadca is even 24 6 times larger for fsa and 21 3 times for fsb the conducted analysis indicates that the smaller the os rudder angle and the faster the ts the larger the cadca as part of a more detailed analysis of the mdtc values under cadca one initial heading of the ts ts hdg 110 was selected for crossing scenario ships trajectories for the most unfavorable combination of operational parameters i e lowest rudder angle and os speed are depicted in fig 18 detailed results of computed mdtcs are given in table 5 the tabular data have been color coded with green indices for the lowest mdtc and red the highest mdtc as presented the relation between calculated distance and operating parameters of the vessels is evident also along with the increase of the speed difference between encountering ships the mdtc value rises the analysis of computed values re confirms the trend that when the rudder angle increases the distance between the ships decreases the maximum mdtc noticed when the ts proceeds with a heading of 110 equals 3 9 nm the opposite situation leads to the most advantageous scenario when the value of mdtc is the lowest and the maneuver can be executed at the latest moment when the os proceeds at the maximum speed and she sets the rudder at 35 to starboard the computed mdtc for the analyzed case is 1 nm therefore for the selected ts heading 110 the mdtc is almost four times lower in the best case than in the worst scenario 4 discussion the results of the study confirm that during evasive maneuver planning ship dynamics should be taken into account the introduced collision avoidance dynamic critical area cadca seems to be a valuable indicator for enhancing maritime safety thus the concept presented could be useful within the context of broader applications of practical relevance to maritime safety cadca could be implemented as a component of i existing navigational equipment e g overlay in the arpa ii onboard decision support system dss iii collision avoidance algorithms for mass iv traffic monitoring and risk assessment tools notwithstanding the currently proposed method and the study cases presented face some limitations and may be prone to certain uncertainties as explained below 4 1 limitations limitations and uncertainties identified relate to the minimum consideration of negligible environmental disturbances included in the cadca and the utilization of one software for delivering input files with the ship dynamics modeled essentially the aspect of colregs in the cadca is not a limitation and arises from the assumptions of the presented concept hydrometeorological factors mainly wind and waves should be taken into account in the cadca to reflect real operational conditions the impact of weather could be considered with a more complex approach than a mere observation of vessel drift in trajectory delivered by laidyn it is especially worth considering that preliminary research confirms that a 6dof motion model can be used to verify environmental impact on ship behavior gil et al 2019a excessive values of translational and rotational motions could be detected during an evasive maneuver therefore this may result in the consideration of loading condition or ship stability in a close quarters situation further investigations on how these parameters affect the cadca limits would be valuable for the development of the presented indicator gil et al 2019a with regards to colregs the proposed method of cadca determination seems to be sufficient although these two issues should be explicitly separated even though this approach is directly linked to colreg rule 17 incl action taken by the stand on vessel the algorithm computes parameters for many initial target headings therefore the indicator is not directly related to the colreg rules 13 15 which are used to regulate the conduct of vessels involved in an encounter depending on their mutual arrangement the envelope is calculated regardless of the regulations while its shape is based solely on hydrodynamics and ship maneuvering bearing in mind that the cadca may be determined in situations that may assume compliance with the colregs or not it is crucial to always take the utmost precaution therefore to avoid misinterpretations nautical background and seagoing experience should not be underestimated 4 2 dealing with uncertainties the uncertainties identified in cadca involve the interaction between ships hulls the accuracy of the vessels positions the utilization of laidyn model and the interval of the data therein to reflect the effect of uncertainties on the cadca a virtual safety margin is introduced the example dedicated to large passenger ship floodstand a at a forward speed of 20 kts is depicted in fig 19 and described in table 6 ship ship interaction is a phenomenon that results from hydrodynamic forces acting between the hulls when two vessels proceed alongside each other it is necessary to maintain a relevant passing distance to avoid a collision therefore it was necessary to include the required clearance between the vessels in the process of cadca determination hull interactions may differ depending on the type of encounter vantorre et al 2002 the difference in vessel dimensions yuan et al 2015 as well as their speeds mousaviraad et al 2016 the required distance between two ships is larger for overtaking than for passing lee 2015 pianc 2014 maneuvers therefore in this study the overtaking scenario was selected to assume the worst case the empirical coefficient provided by the world association for waterborne transport infrastructure pianc 2014 was applied in the conducted study this correction factor was selected for the most similar type of the vessel and adjusted to sizes of the ship models used the imo requirements for radio navigational systems divide position accuracy into open sea and areas in the vicinity of the shoreline imo 2011 for ocean waters the position error should be not greater than 100 m while in coastal waters and harbor approaches it should not exceed 10 m imo 2011 however due to the development of supporting systems for ship positioning the expected accuracy is even higher also in a dynamic maritime environment specht et al 2019 therefore the maximum acceptable value of the position error 10 m was applied as a component of the safety margin finally the data interval of ship trajectories delivered by laidyn was 0 6 s for this particular time step the distance covered by the ship at a given speed was applied in the safety margin by enlarging it in further studies the data frequency could be increased as much as the laidyn software or other program allows 4 3 future work further research related to the cadca concept should be focused on two major tasks i reflecting the real operational conditions of the ship ii increasing the accuracy and efficiency of the area determination a better simulation of a vessel s operational conditions could be achieved for instance by considering the presence of environmental disturbances including the impact of wind and waves would appear to be crucial in order to verify how weather affects cadca limits because laidyn software can simulate vessel behavior in various hydrometeorological conditions development of the algorithm presented in section 2 5 could be proposed in further research additionally in the examination of the initial vessel speed conducted only the ts velocity changed while the os maintained the same speed in each simulation as the rudder effect coupling the rudder angle and the ship s speed does exist this part of the study should be thoroughly investigated in further works an increase in ship speed during maneuver execution e g turning circle causes an increase in the lift force acting on the deflected rudder and so the tactical diameter is expected to be affected this relationship could be observed and analyzed in future work by verifying various os speeds for the same rudder angle used during a variety of evasive maneuver scenarios the accuracy of cadca could be refined by improving the numerical and operational inadequacies implemented in the model for example it is believed that the sharp slip observed in the area could be reduced by changing the method of initial ship positioning this might be achieved by increasing the amount of initial positioning of the ships involved in an encounter scenario their number should be linked with the safety margin dimensions in order to provide relevant coverage and maintain cadca shape consistency the safety margin could be dynamic and adjust its dimensions in each simulation to reduce any overestimation the correction resulting from ship ship interaction should vary depending on the type of an encounter taking into account the angles between the heading lines of the ships could improve assumptions and provide different clearances during passing and or overtaking scenarios the use of more ship models and their loading conditions for testing and validating the cadca concept could allow for more conclusive comparisons in terms of cadca size and limits for various types of vessels the implementation of maneuvering trajectories that are reliable using a faster and more practical maneuvering simulator taimuri et al 2019 could reduce the uncertainties caused by the current usage of a single maneuvering program it is believed that all improvements aimed at producing a better simulation of reality could result in the future implementation of the cadca as an indicator for onboard dss in such a situation the particulars of the ts and her speed would be obtained from existing navigational equipment like the ais automatic identification system then approximated ship behavior for these parameters could be sourced from the meta model built using bnn bayesian belief networks for a group of representative ships the use of such a tool could deliver critical maneuvering areas that may change their limits and shapes dynamically in real time 5 conclusions this paper had three main objectives the first was to present a novel indicator used in an encounter between two vessels under negligible environmental disturbances the collision avoidance dynamic critical area cadca was introduced in a version for onboard dss the area surrounds the own ship and changes its limits for various operating parameters of the vessels the results suggest that the introduced zone could be useful for oows in the determination of the critical maneuvering area as well as for planning evasive action it is worth noting that cases where the target ship maintains her course and speed are essential for the navigational safety due to the larger area required additionally in these scenarios knowledge about the maneuvering and hydrodynamics of the target is not necessarily required future work on this concept could result in the development of a fully dynamic version of the cadca which adjusts its limits in real time using data from navigational equipment however this could be used not only as a part of the onboard dss another potential application of the cadca is to create a collision avoidance algorithm for mass the introduced zone could be also used in maritime traffic monitoring and risk assessment as a near miss criterion the second aim of the study was to introduce an algorithm to efficiently determine the cadca the principles of its operation were elaborated along with a description of the mdct calculation process the method of ship positioning in the simulator was presented using four boundary arrangements however this could be improved in order to eliminate identified limitation namely the sharp slip observed in the cadca in future work the software should be also developed to include the remaining operational parameters of the vessels and to consider environmental conditions the third objective was to investigate the impact of the rudder setting initial forward speed for a single evasive action of the own ship the results of the simulations conducted confirmed that the cadca varies in size for different operating parameters of encountering ships thus its dynamics should be considered while planning an evasive maneuver for various magnitudes of rudder angles when the vessels proceed at the same speed the danger zone is located ahead of the beam however for different speeds of the ts the cadca has two sectors of large mdtc values therefore in some navigational scenarios the sector abaft the beam should be likewise considered as a potential threat in certain cases when the own ship sets the rudder to the smallest available angle 5 and proceeds slower than the target it leads to the worst navigational scenario when the largest maneuvering area is required credit authorship contribution statement mateusz gil conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation data curation writing

21658,this paper introduces the concept of collision avoidance dynamic critical area cadca for onboard decision support systems dss the indicator proposed is derived via identification of a minimum required maneuvering zone in an encounter between two vessels the cadca model accounts for ship maneuvering dynamics and associated hydrodynamic actions emerging from different rudder angles and forward speed effects the method presented is novel as it considers the variability of a critical area due to dynamic changes in operational parameters for both vessels results of the simulations carried out in negligible weather conditions confirm that computed zones may differ significantly in terms of shapes and limits it is demonstrated that the size of the cadca depends on the rudder angle forward speed as well as the dimensions of the vessels keywords collision avoidance dynamic critical area cadca evasive maneuver maritime risk and safety ship maneuvering area last minute

navigators and personnel involved with ship operations ashore with modern proven tools that are optimized for good decision support such navigation systems should enhance safe and technologically sustainable ship operations i e should help to improve safety standards and reduce human error in scenarios involving ship encounters in conditions of traffic congestion remoteness or autonomy nowadays the most common indicators used to examine a potential collision threat in an encounter between two vessels are the cpa closest point of approach and tcpa time to closest point of approach these are utilized in the arpa automatic radar plotting aid which is a mandatory piece of equipment for many vessels operating under the solas convention international convention for the safety of life at sea imo 2014 the data of the acquired target is derived from the past observations of its motion moreover the indicators presented in the arpa do not directly translate into the parameters of the evasive maneuver and so they require further elucidation by the oow officer of the watch various concepts on the graphical interpretation of ship vectors emerging from the arpa are presented in literature on the subject bole et al 2014 those suggest more intuitive information for oows for example the ppc potential point of collision and pad predicted area of danger are commonly used by operators of shipborne radars the latter evolved over the years and transformed from circles to ellipses or polygons riggs 1975 riggs and o sullivan 1980 zhao lin 1988 another concept known as collision threat parameters ctps was introduced and developed by lenart 2015 1983 to date ctps have been utilized modified and validated by various researchers for instance szlapczynski 2008 szlapczynski and smierzchalski 2009 combined ctp with fuzzy logic while szlapczynska and szlapczynski 2017 szlapczynski and krata 2018 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 applied it to the ship domains smierzchalski 2005 as well as smierzchalski and michalewicz 2000 utilized the concept in evolutionary path planning whereas chen et al 2019 2018 used a similar approach in probabilistic risk analyses despite the progress made the vast majority of existing solutions do not account for the influence of the dynamics of ship operations in a realistic environment accordingly the number of studies focused on close quarter situations considering ship dynamics has been limited colley et al 1983 hilgert 1983 krata et al 2016 montewka et al 2012 ni et al 2019 however the impact of weather conditions on an encounter between two vessels has been taken into account by szlapczynski et al 2018a as well as szlapczynski and krata 2018 it is broadly acknowledged that ship operational parameters interpreted as rudder angle and initial forward speed may differ depending on the encounter therefore the maneuvering area should also vary to provide adequate prediction in real time assessment its shape could respond to the influence of ship dynamics and operational conditions gil et al 2019a 2020a this idea of introducing a zonal indicator aligns with the priorities of the e navigation initiative introduced by the international maritime organization imo 2008 the primary objective of this concept was to boost the level of maritime safety this enhancement could be achieved inter alia by utilizing navigational dsss gil et al 2020b perera et al 2015 2012 weintrit 2013 especially for collision avoidance baldauf et al 2014 baldauf and hong 2016 nevertheless despite the progressive development of technological solutions implemented on merchant ships a collision still remains one of the most common reasons for maritime disasters in european waters collisions comprise almost one quarter of navigational causes of accidents while these represent more than half of all casualty events emsa 2018 therefore providing new and effective methods of ship collision avoidance is essential they could be utilized as a graphical form with a ship vector presented as an overlay to already existing onboard devices like radar ma et al 2015 or ecdis electronic chart display and information system weintrit 2009 furthermore experts with seagoing experience have evaluated the utilization of navigational equipment as essential in the process of ship ship collision avoidance gil et al 2019b this paper introduces the concept of collision avoidance dynamic critical area cadca as a novel safety zone that varies depending on the operational parameters of particular vessels a version dedicated to onboard applications is presented here so the target ship maintains her course and speed during an encounter consequently the paper demonstrates an efficient method for determining cadca in various simulation scenarios thirdly it presents the application of the method in order to verify whether and how the operating parameters of the ship affect the required maneuvering area therefore for the scenarios presented in this paper the presence of wind and waves has been omitted the rest of the paper is organized as follows the methods used in the study are presented in section 2 along with assumptions principles and a novel algorithm to determine cadca section 3 provides an analysis of the results for various operational ship parameters in different simulation scenarios the discussion about the presented solution and the methods used to handle uncertainties is provided in section 4 while section 5 concludes the paper 2 methods the main intention of introducing a novel type of safety zone in the encounter between two vessels is twofold firstly the required maneuvering area for evasive action should be determined for the most critical navigational scenarios secondly the dynamics of a vessel in the process of collision avoidance should be taken into account to keep further reasoning realistic the cadca concept helps to define a minimum distance between encountering vessels which represents the last chance to avoid a collision the own ship is located within the limits of the cadca envelope that changes shape accordingly to the vessel s current operating parameters in this paper the indicator related to the execution of an evasive maneuver and a 6dof motion model have been used to determine the cadca shape and its boundaries in realistic collision scenarios 2 1 the last minute maneuver lmm the concept of cadca is based on a critical navigational scenario known as the last minute also chance or moment maneuver this type of evasive action is strictly related to the requirements of the colregs international regulations for preventing collisions at sea rule 17 imo 2010 several elaborations concerning the action of a stand on vessel and interpretation of this regulation can be found in the literature see e g cockcroft and lameijer 2012 crosbie 2008 rymarz 2007 sweeney 1992 however only a few research papers related to lmm and especially its determination exist koszelew and wołejsza 2017 miloh 1975 montewka and krata 2014 ożoga and montewka 2018 rymarz 2007 szlapczynski et al 2018b according to colreg rule 17 the conduct of a stand on vessel varies during an encounter situation imo 2010 as shown in fig 1 an encounter of vessels approaching on collision courses can be divided into four stages where the ship s action depends on the distance between herself and the give way vessel cockcroft and lameijer 2012 rymarz 2007 lmm refers to a situation when the stand on vessel despite the right of the way is obliged to execute an evasive maneuver that situation occurs if the action of the give way vessel is executed too late or not undertaken at all therefore the stand on vessel is in stage iv and under rule 17 her evasive action is mandatory in such a situation only effective single action undertaken by the stand on vessel or joint operation involving both ships could avoid a collision koszelew and wołejsza 2017 as well as wójcik et al 2016 define lmm as a joint maneuver of both ships involved in an encounter when the single action of the stand on vessel would be insufficient to avoid a collision this approach is fully compliant with the colreg rule 17 b but from the operational point of view a situation when the stand on vessel has to execute a maneuver on her own seems to be even more essential this is because of a lack or incorrect action of the give way ship which results in a larger maneuvering area being required therefore in this paper the target vessel stays passive and maintains her present course and speed throughout the entire encounter 2 2 minimum distance to collision mdtc in the cadca concept mdtc has been utilized since it allows to convert the distance in an encounter between two vessels into the required maneuvering area mdtc was introduced by montewka et al 2010 and further developed by montewka et al 2012 2011a 2011b as depicted in fig 2 this indicator can be defined as the minimum distance between two vessels in a close quarters situation when the execution of successful evasive maneuver is still feasible therefore mdtc allows for the determination of the lmm parameters mdtc is based on a two dimensional coordinate system where the projections of the vessels are plotted interpretation of their positions and headings may lead to the conclusion that in each encounter between two ships only one mdtc exists the indicator is calculated between the hulls for a given bearing and may take the hydrodynamics of the vessels into consideration to this end this paper uses ship trajectories projected by laidyn software 2 3 the laidyn model laidyn is a numerical ship motion model introduced by matusiak 2017 it simulates the behavior of a vessel in regular and irregular waves while also allowing for the combination of seakeeping and maneuvering acanfora et al 2017 matusiak 2007 2011 the ship is represented as a rigid body wherein non linear wave effects as well as restoring and froude krylov forces are included manderbacka et al 2011 the numerical model can be defined as a hybrid non linear model in 6 degrees of freedom 6dof in the time domain with the assumption that the ship is a rigid body the prime coordinate systems used for describing ship motion are presented in fig 3 to these belong the inertial system fixed to earth with the x y plane coincident with the still water level and the body fixed reference frame x y z originating from the ship s center of gravity matusiak 2017 the equations of the

i i are the mass moments of inertia resistance propulsion prop wave and maneuvering man correspond to particular forces and moments acting on ship matusiak 2017 the adopted notation uses the upper case letters for forces and moment components and the lower case letters for co ordinates the stripe theory is applied to obtain the values of elements of the added mass matrix we utilize sealoads software kukkanen 1995 although any other relevant method might be used the radiation and diffraction forces are calculated using the linear model based on the assumption of small amplitude oscillatory motions journée and massie 2001 kukkanen 1995 determining radiation forces one takes into account the history of the past motions by applying the convolution integral representation cummins 1962 see equation 2 2 x r a d t a x t t k t τ x τ d τ where a is the matrix of added masses for an infinite frequency x is response vector k is the retardation function also called memory function which depends on a damping matrix cummins 1962 τ is the time since the impulse initiation whose contribution is modeled by the impulse function while t is the time instant at which the motion is computed the convolution integral functions are used for heave roll and pitch motions only the non linear part of the code includes froude krylov hydrostatic forces as well as maneuvering and propulsion manderbacka et al 2011 matusiak 2011 the maneuvering part of the model is described as presented in equation 3 3 x x v v v 2 x r r r 2 x v v v v v 4 y y v v y r r y v v v v y r r r r y v v

model utilizes a set of differential equations of motion which implies a need for solving discrete time equations the runge kutta methods are adopted in the software which is quite a common approach laidyn has been validated by international benchmark studies ittc 2005 2002 and pmm planar motion mechanism model tests matusiak and stigler 2012 the results demonstrated sufficient accuracy especially for ro paxes and container vessels acanfora et al 2017 operating also in severe weather acanfora et al 2018 additionally laidyn has been used in the estimation of dynamic effects of passenger ship flooding manderbacka et al 2011 weather routing of merchant vessels krata and szlapczynska 2018 as well as in a risk assessment and collision avoidance hinz et al 2018 montewka et al 2010 szlapczynski et al 2018a szlapczynski and krata 2018 in the concept of cadca laidyn is utilized to simulate ship motions in 6dof for specific operating and environmental conditions the software generates vessel trajectories including turning circles for various operational parameters as a result the ship s coordinates and values of her translational and rotational motions are delivered 2 4 cadca structure previous studies introduced a simplified critical area for the case of a ro pax vessel krata et al 2016 montewka and krata 2014 in this paper the model and the method have been significantly improved by taking into account ship dynamics cadca shown in fig 4 is designed as a safety zone surrounding the ship in a close quarters situation the shape and limits of the envelope are delimited by mdtc values and the area can be generated for different navigational scenarios these can include cases where one of the vessels involved in the encounter undertakes the single action or if they both act jointly the ships can alter their courses to port or starboard side at various initial speeds using different settings of the rudder nevertheless the oow does not know the maneuverability and hydrodynamics of the target ship or the actual magnitude of her rudder during routine sea passage for this reason in the following sections cadcas are presented for the single maneuver of the own ship while the target remains passive during an approach and only maintains course and speed depending on the final application of cadca the area can be presented in different forms in fig 4 the zone depicts mdtcs obtained for various initial headings of the target to present it in more intuitive way the values are given for the bearings brg ts outer scale instead of the headings therefore cadca can be defined equation 4 as a set of planar positions of the target ship such that for all bearings mdtc exists and is used to determine the coordinates of the envelope 4 c a d c a x y r 2 b r g t s α r 0 α 2 π m d t c x r x 0 x m d t c cos b r g t s y m d t c sin b r g t s where brg ts means a bearing to the target vessel mdtc stands for the minimum distance to collision x and y are planar coordinates of the mdtc boundary positions 2 5 simulation method safety of navigation requires high accuracy indicators for use in collision avoidance as presented in fig 5 the resolution of cadca is an important issue with regards to the reliable estimation of a critical maneuvering area this may result in a massive number of combinations for various operational parameters of ships therefore it was crucial to develop a novel algorithm for efficient determination of cadca that will provide the possibility to filter out navigational scenarios selected by the user see fig 6 the simulator presented in this paper allows for selecting different numerical ship models and their operational parameters separately for the own ship os and the target ship ts configuration files read configs block as per fig 6 represent the database which stores information about the models of the ships used a user can select which vessels will be used for cadca computation important parameters such as rudder angle or forward speed can be defined there they enable the simulations to be narrowed further and the results to be filtered the initial headings and utilized strategies ships positioning hulls projections or vessels moving are then selected consequently the summary of trajectories delivered by laidyn is loaded to determine the simulation cases these may be understood as a set of operating and if applicable environmental parameters of ships involved in the encounter the simulation cases are grouped and filtered according to the user s selection to begin the computation process individual os and ts trajectories are merged into one set this list is called simulation scenarios and contains information about combined cases for both ships with respect to the previous grouping final data are passed to the computation stage of the algorithm the part of the simulator where mdtcs are calculated is the most crucial for the determination of the cadca introduced therefore it is presented more specifically in the sequence diagram in fig 7 the simulator utilizes a similar approach to the top down method used in the analysis of maritime accidents the computer application starts the procedure from the initial collision of two vessels to calculate the mdtc for each encounter the software generates four boundary positions of the hulls as depicted in fig 8 these are represented by tangents to the bow stern and sides of each ship regarding their headings it has been assumed that for any given heading any offset between the hulls will cause a collision therefore it was sufficient to merely consider the critical positions of the ships instead of all possibilities as presented in fig 8 the simulator allows one of three types of simplified ship s hull shapes to be selected such as rectangular a elliptical b and hybrid c the results and examples presented in this paper are based on the hybrid type c as its shape is the most similar to the real hull of the ship from the four boundary ship arrangements shown in fig 8 only the unfavorable one understood as the simulation result with the largest mdtc is considered in the cadca after the ships positioning the sequence of moving astern and ahead is executed as demonstrated in fig 9 where the vessels are moved simultaneously backwards and apart for a given time step the own ship os proceeds along the trajectory loaded from laidyn in the event of a collision the algorithm loops for as long as the first chance to avoid an accident occurs the approach based on simultaneously moving the vessels astern allows an encounter to be reproduced that is compliant with colreg rule 7 risk of collision assumptions imo 2010 the method used for cadca determination faces some limitations mainly related to the accuracy of idealized ship ship interactions ship positioning maneuvering simulations and their associated data intervals to manage these uncertainties a virtual safety margin has been implemented see dashed lines in fig 10 therefore the mdtc between safety margins is calculated rather than the hulls of the vessels the plotting sheet depicting an exemplary simulation scenario with included safety margins is presented see fig 10 all uncertainties identified during the study which affect the size of introduced safety margin are further elaborated in detail in section 4 2 in navigation practice terms course alteration is a key part of a vessel s collision avoidance maneuvers this is because it is more efficient than changing speed especially for large ships with conventional propulsion and steering devices according to colreg rule 8 the alteration of the course should be large enough to be noticeable and transparent for the second vessel either visually or by radar imo 2010 in this statement the term large enough is rather vague although in navigational practice it is assumed that an alteration of at least 30 will be executed depending on the case practical recommendations may suggest even larger changes of the course up to 60 or even 90 e g under restricted visibility conditions cockcroft and lameijer 2012 to keep the alteration of the course large enough and at the same time reasonable the algorithm introduced in this paper alters the os s heading by 60 however as presented in fig 11 the alteration of the course by a fixed value could be inefficient especially when ships proceed at the same speed in certain cases the full ship turning circle should be executed instead of a 60 turn to provide effective evasive action such a situation may occur in scenarios where the mdtc value is exceptionally large due to some unfavorable parameters of the encounter such as mutual headings same speed of ships etc therefore to maintain the operational usefulness of the cadca for onboard applications the algorithm acts in two ways and suggests a course change of either 60 or 360 the results are generated when the overlaying ship trajectory allows for the successful execution of an evasive maneuver the maximum mdtc value for each simulation scenario is taken into account for further analysis finally computed distances are generated along with radar plots depicting the cadca the pseudocode of the described simulator with its generalized mathematical formulation is presented in algorithm 1 algorithm 1 the pseudocode with generalized mathematical formulation of the cadca simulator image 1 3 results to investigate whether and how the operating parameters of encountering vessels affect the size and limits of the cadca a simulation study was carried out for large fig 12 and medium size passenger vessels fig 13 both ships are representative of modern cruise ships previously considered in an eu funded project called floodstand integrated flooding and standard for stability and crises management kujanpää and routi 2009 luhmann 2009 in the simulations presented here these ships were used as os and ts their main particulars are presented in table 1 several data breakdowns have been prepared to investigate how the vessel parameters impact the cadca in negligible weather conditions table 2 outlines a summary of all the conducted simulations to ensure a high level of accuracy all cadcas have been determined for 360 headings of the ts thus for each initial arrangement of the vessels the os was always set on a northern course 000 while the ts heading varies by 1 step within the range of t s h d g 000 360 all figures depicting the cadca were prepared as polar plots with ts brg vs mdtc nm 3 1 magnitude of the rudder angle simulations of evasive maneuvers using different magnitudes of rudder angle were conducted to investigate how this parameter impacts the cadca scenarios when both vessels proceed at an equal speed of 20 kts are presented in fig 14 fsa on the left fsb on the right these were conducted in order to verify the effect of the os rudder setting in the simulations the os rudder was set to the starboard side at one of four different angles from 5 to 35 for a 10 step while the ts maintained her course in cases where the vessels were on parallel courses they could not possibly collide this trivial phenomenon occurred because of negligible external disturbances and the identical speed of both ships consequently these cases were rejected from the analyzed set as presented in fig 14 the cadca may vary for different settings of the rudder however its change in shape mainly differs significantly for a rudder angle of 5 while for other angles it is similar the zones determined for fsa are generally comparable to these obtained for fsb but with proportionally larger limits the maximum mdtcs noticed at this stage of the study were around 2 2 nm for floodstand a and 1 6 nm for floodstand b for both ships the largest mdtcs were noticed within bearings of 320 340 when the ts began the simulations with headings within the range of 090 140 this means that the worst navigational cases occur in crossing scenarios and in that event the evasive maneuvers should be executed beforehand although the maximum mdtc values for each rudder angle are similar the sizes of the areas differ it is necessary to have a maneuvering area almost twice as large for a 5 rudder than for a 35 rudder 1 9 for fsa and 1 8 for fsb thus the smaller rudder angle of the os the larger the cadca the changes in the required maneuvering area for various rudder settings of both analyzed ships are presented in table 3 a significant slip may be observed around the 330 bearing in the vast majority of the simulations this could happen because of changes in the initial arrangements of the vessels as depicted in fig 8 the algorithm that determines the cadca selects the opposite set of initial vessel positions as the worst navigation scenario this issue is elaborated further in section 4 3 where a method that could be used to reduce the impact of this phenomenon is proposed 3 2 initial forward speed the impact of the initial forward speed of the encountering vessels has been verified using a similar approach to the one described in section 3 1 see fig 15 accordingly the rudder angles for both vessels were fixed to investigate solely the effect of the forward speed the os rudder was set to starboard 5 while the ts kept her rudder amidships table 2 at the beginning of the simulation the forward speed of the os was 12 kts which is the minimum value considered in the study the ts speed varied from 12 kts to 16 kts and eventually increased to 20 kts as presented in fig 15 and table 4 the shape and limits of cadca differ significantly compared to the cases where the rudder angle was investigated in these scenarios the os proceeded at the minimum available speed 12 kts so the ts is always a threat maximum mdtc values were noticed in two sectors of bearings namely 120 135 and 305 320 the largest distances for fsa 4 0 and 3 9 nm were determined when the target vessel proceeds at maximum speed 20 kts on courses of 340 overtaking and 110 crossing this implies that the faster the ts proceeds the larger the cadca becomes the shape of the zone as well as general findings concerning the values of bearings courses and speeds are similar for fsb the difference between the cadca for fsa and fsb is mainly its size which is proportionally smaller this is the reason why the maximum observed mdtc for fsb in a comparable case is 3 0 nm the appearance of the cadca abaft of the os leads to significant changes instead of one sector with high mdtcs as in the previous cases the second range of large values can be observed on the opposite side see fig 15 thus when the ts starts the simulation with an initial heading of around 340 at 20 kts it leads to the maximum distance being generated astern of the os the presence of two dangerous sectors arises from the unfavorable speed difference between the vessels and this causes a significant increase in the required maneuvering area because the ts proceeds faster than the os she is always a threat the relative speed seems to be of crucial significance in the analyzed cases this could be confirmed by the shape of the zone for ts sog 12 kts when the encountering ships are equally fast and the cadca has no additional sector abaft the second reason for the additional dangerous sector is the direction of the ship s turn assuming that the os executed a turn to the starboard side the ts may overtake her in the vast majority of analyzed scenarios such a situation would lead to maneuvering toward the ts therefore if the observed ts is faster than the os especially keen monitoring is required not only on forward of the beam but also abaft and particularly on the side where the evasive maneuver will be executed most frequently the starboard side 3 3 comparative analysis in order to compare how the operational parameters of encountering vessels may affect the cadca aggregated results were prepared for both ship models to this end simulations of all remaining cases which are not only limited to the combinations shown in table 2 were conducted then all the determined areas were compared and color coded depending on their impact on the size of the area as shown in fig 16 the cadca for fsa and fsb obtained for maximal mdtc values when all possible parameter combinations are aggregated is presented in fig 17 the surface plots prepared to compare the cadca sizes indicate that the size of the required maneuvering area may also depend on the operating parameters of the vessels visualizations of these charts confirm that the relationship between the rudder angle and relative speed is similar for both analyzed ship models however when comparing areas to the smallest determined cadca it can be noticed that the size of the area may increase multiple times depending on the combination of parameters for example in the most unfavorable conditions the cadca is even 24 6 times larger for fsa and 21 3 times for fsb the conducted analysis indicates that the smaller the os rudder angle and the faster the ts the larger the cadca as part of a more detailed analysis of the mdtc values under cadca one initial heading of the ts ts hdg 110 was selected for crossing scenario ships trajectories for the most unfavorable combination of operational parameters i e lowest rudder angle and os speed are depicted in fig 18 detailed results of computed mdtcs are given in table 5 the tabular data have been color coded with green indices for the lowest mdtc and red the highest mdtc as presented the relation between calculated distance and operating parameters of the vessels is evident also along with the increase of the speed difference between encountering ships the mdtc value rises the analysis of computed values re confirms the trend that when the rudder angle increases the distance between the ships decreases the maximum mdtc noticed when the ts proceeds with a heading of 110 equals 3 9 nm the opposite situation leads to the most advantageous scenario when the value of mdtc is the lowest and the maneuver can be executed at the latest moment when the os proceeds at the maximum speed and she sets the rudder at 35 to starboard the computed mdtc for the analyzed case is 1 nm therefore for the selected ts heading 110 the mdtc is almost four times lower in the best case than in the worst scenario 4 discussion the results of the study confirm that during evasive maneuver planning ship dynamics should be taken into account the introduced collision avoidance dynamic critical area cadca seems to be a valuable indicator for enhancing maritime safety thus the concept presented could be useful within the context of broader applications of practical relevance to maritime safety cadca could be implemented as a component of i existing navigational equipment e g overlay in the arpa ii onboard decision support system dss iii collision avoidance algorithms for mass iv traffic monitoring and risk assessment tools notwithstanding the currently proposed method and the study cases presented face some limitations and may be prone to certain uncertainties as explained below 4 1 limitations limitations and uncertainties identified relate to the minimum consideration of negligible environmental disturbances included in the cadca and the utilization of one software for delivering input files with the ship dynamics modeled essentially the aspect of colregs in the cadca is not a limitation and arises from the assumptions of the presented concept hydrometeorological factors mainly wind and waves should be taken into account in the cadca to reflect real operational conditions the impact of weather could be considered with a more complex approach than a mere observation of vessel drift in trajectory delivered by laidyn it is especially worth considering that preliminary research confirms that a 6dof motion model can be used to verify environmental impact on ship behavior gil et al 2019a excessive values of translational and rotational motions could be detected during an evasive maneuver therefore this may result in the consideration of loading condition or ship stability in a close quarters situation further investigations on how these parameters affect the cadca limits would be valuable for the development of the presented indicator gil et al 2019a with regards to colregs the proposed method of cadca determination seems to be sufficient although these two issues should be explicitly separated even though this approach is directly linked to colreg rule 17 incl action taken by the stand on vessel the algorithm computes parameters for many initial target headings therefore the indicator is not directly related to the colreg rules 13 15 which are used to regulate the conduct of vessels involved in an encounter depending on their mutual arrangement the envelope is calculated regardless of the regulations while its shape is based solely on hydrodynamics and ship maneuvering bearing in mind that the cadca may be determined in situations that may assume compliance with the colregs or not it is crucial to always take the utmost precaution therefore to avoid misinterpretations nautical background and seagoing experience should not be underestimated 4 2 dealing with uncertainties the uncertainties identified in cadca involve the interaction between ships hulls the accuracy of the vessels positions the utilization of laidyn model and the interval of the data therein to reflect the effect of uncertainties on the cadca a virtual safety margin is introduced the example dedicated to large passenger ship floodstand a at a forward speed of 20 kts is depicted in fig 19 and described in table 6 ship ship interaction is a phenomenon that results from hydrodynamic forces acting between the hulls when two vessels proceed alongside each other it is necessary to maintain a relevant passing distance to avoid a collision therefore it was necessary to include the required clearance between the vessels in the process of cadca determination hull interactions may differ depending on the type of encounter vantorre et al 2002 the difference in vessel dimensions yuan et al 2015 as well as their speeds mousaviraad et al 2016 the required distance between two ships is larger for overtaking than for passing lee 2015 pianc 2014 maneuvers therefore in this study the overtaking scenario was selected to assume the worst case the empirical coefficient provided by the world association for waterborne transport infrastructure pianc 2014 was applied in the conducted study this correction factor was selected for the most similar type of the vessel and adjusted to sizes of the ship models used the imo requirements for radio navigational systems divide position accuracy into open sea and areas in the vicinity of the shoreline imo 2011 for ocean waters the position error should be not greater than 100 m while in coastal waters and harbor approaches it should not exceed 10 m imo 2011 however due to the development of supporting systems for ship positioning the expected accuracy is even higher also in a dynamic maritime environment specht et al 2019 therefore the maximum acceptable value of the position error 10 m was applied as a component of the safety margin finally the data interval of ship trajectories delivered by laidyn was 0 6 s for this particular time step the distance covered by the ship at a given speed was applied in the safety margin by enlarging it in further studies the data frequency could be increased as much as the laidyn software or other program allows 4 3 future work further research related to the cadca concept should be focused on two major tasks i reflecting the real operational conditions of the ship ii increasing the accuracy and efficiency of the area determination a better simulation of a vessel s operational conditions could be achieved for instance by considering the presence of environmental disturbances including the impact of wind and waves would appear to be crucial in order to verify how weather affects cadca limits because laidyn software can simulate vessel behavior in various hydrometeorological conditions development of the algorithm presented in section 2 5 could be proposed in further research additionally in the examination of the initial vessel speed conducted only the ts velocity changed while the os maintained the same speed in each simulation as the rudder effect coupling the rudder angle and the ship s speed does exist this part of the study should be thoroughly investigated in further works an increase in ship speed during maneuver execution e g turning circle causes an increase in the lift force acting on the deflected rudder and so the tactical diameter is expected to be affected this relationship could be observed and analyzed in future work by verifying various os speeds for the same rudder angle used during a variety of evasive maneuver scenarios the accuracy of cadca could be refined by improving the numerical and operational inadequacies implemented in the model for example it is believed that the sharp slip observed in the area could be reduced by changing the method of initial ship positioning this might be achieved by increasing the amount of initial positioning of the ships involved in an encounter scenario their number should be linked with the safety margin dimensions in order to provide relevant coverage and maintain cadca shape consistency the safety margin could be dynamic and adjust its dimensions in each simulation to reduce any overestimation the correction resulting from ship ship interaction should vary depending on the type of an encounter taking into account the angles between the heading lines of the ships could improve assumptions and provide different clearances during passing and or overtaking scenarios the use of more ship models and their loading conditions for testing and validating the cadca concept could allow for more conclusive comparisons in terms of cadca size and limits for various types of vessels the implementation of maneuvering trajectories that are reliable using a faster and more practical maneuvering simulator taimuri et al 2019 could reduce the uncertainties caused by the current usage of a single maneuvering program it is believed that all improvements aimed at producing a better simulation of reality could result in the future implementation of the cadca as an indicator for onboard dss in such a situation the particulars of the ts and her speed would be obtained from existing navigational equipment like the ais automatic identification system then approximated ship behavior for these parameters could be sourced from the meta model built using bnn bayesian belief networks for a group of representative ships the use of such a tool could deliver critical maneuvering areas that may change their limits and shapes dynamically in real time 5 conclusions this paper had three main objectives the first was to present a novel indicator used in an encounter between two vessels under negligible environmental disturbances the collision avoidance dynamic critical area cadca was introduced in a version for onboard dss the area surrounds the own ship and changes its limits for various operating parameters of the vessels the results suggest that the introduced zone could be useful for oows in the determination of the critical maneuvering area as well as for planning evasive action it is worth noting that cases where the target ship maintains her course and speed are essential for the navigational safety due to the larger area required additionally in these scenarios knowledge about the maneuvering and hydrodynamics of the target is not necessarily required future work on this concept could result in the development of a fully dynamic version of the cadca which adjusts its limits in real time using data from navigational equipment however this could be used not only as a part of the onboard dss another potential application of the cadca is to create a collision avoidance algorithm for mass the introduced zone could be also used in maritime traffic monitoring and risk assessment as a near miss criterion the second aim of the study was to introduce an algorithm to efficiently determine the cadca the principles of its operation were elaborated along with a description of the mdct calculation process the method of ship positioning in the simulator was presented using four boundary arrangements however this could be improved in order to eliminate identified limitation namely the sharp slip observed in the cadca in future work the software should be also developed to include the remaining operational parameters of the vessels and to consider environmental conditions the third objective was to investigate the impact of the rudder setting initial forward speed for a single evasive action of the own ship the results of the simulations conducted confirmed that the cadca varies in size for different operating parameters of encountering ships thus its dynamics should be considered while planning an evasive maneuver for various magnitudes of rudder angles when the vessels proceed at the same speed the danger zone is located ahead of the beam however for different speeds of the ts the cadca has two sectors of large mdtc values therefore in some navigational scenarios the sector abaft the beam should be likewise considered as a potential threat in certain cases when the own ship sets the rudder to the smallest available angle 5 and proceeds slower than the target it leads to the worst navigational scenario

21659,the main objective of this research is to figure out the relationship of the ultimate strength characteristics between the compartment hull girder and the global hull girder especially focusing on the ultimate strength envelope of the global hull girder of a 10 000teu ultra large container ship subjected to combined loads which is one of the most important indexes to quantify the safety margin of the container ship to achieve these aims both the compartment hull girder and the global hull girder are modeled based on true ship hull girder s configurations a series of full scale nonlinear finite element analyses are performed in addition to examine the reliability of the elastic perfectly plastic material models employed in fea similar scale model collapse experiments of a compartment hull girder subjected to pure hogging and pure torsion are also presented finally the ultimate strength envelope of the global hull girder of the 10 000teu ultra large container ship subjected to combined vertical bending and torsion is quantitatively obtained which can characterize the container ship hull girder s ultimate strength interactions between vertical bending and torsion and quantify the safety margin of the global hull girder of the container ship subjected to combined vertical bending and torsion keywords ultimate strength envelope compartment hull girder global hull girder combined vertical bending and torsion ultimate strength interactions 1 introduction 1 1 background with the increasing demand for goods transportation capacity in international trade the shipbuilding design of the modern container ships is now developing towards the large scale and multi purpose trend ultra large container ship e g 10 000teu container ship is one of the high tech ships of great application potential which is featured by larger deck openings larger loading capacity relatively lower torsional rigidity and higher emphasis on stability to keep a more economical cost while an adequate safety tolerance can still be guaranteed ultimate strength of ship hull girders is now widely adopted as the safety design criterion to measure hull girder s maximum loading capacity normally the ultimate longitudinal strength i e ultimate vertical bending strength of the hull girder is always considered as the most important index when evaluating hull girder s ultimate loading capacity for container ships especially for ultra large container ships which are characterized by large deck openings and low torsional rigidity the effect of the torsional moment on the reduction of the ultimate longitudinal strength of the hull girder can not be ignored when ships sail in rough sea and at an oblique heading the internal torsional moment suffered by the hull girder may approach or even exceed the internal vertical bending moment although the torsional moment itself will not directly cause the collapse of the hull girder the warping effect involved in hull girder s torsional behaviors can significantly reduce the ultimate longitudinal strength i e vertical bending strength of the hull girder paik et al 2001 wang et al 2020a b as a result to obtain a better picture of hull girder s ultimate strength envelope ultimate strength analysis of the hull girder subjected to combined loads e g vertical bending and torsion should be conducted 1 2 ultimate strength analysis of hull girders subjected to combined loads as the main structural units of ship hull girder structures stiffened plates have been deeply studied by many researchers to make the ultimate strength predictions of them which can be seen in detail in the review paper by kim et al 2018 representatively both the intact ultimate strength and residual ultimate strength of stiffened plates under axial compression have been investigated and predicted by faulkner 1975 paik and thayamballi 1997 paik et al 2005 2008 zhang and khan 2009 kim et al 2017 xu et al 2018 and ao et al 2019 2020 as for box girders nakai et al 2004 had conducted a series of bending collapse tests of box girders to study the effect of pitting corrosion on the ultimate strength of box girders gordo and soares 2008 2009 had performed a series of ultimate strength experiments of box girders made of both mild steel and high tensile steel developing some valuable insights into the box girder s collapse behaviors for ultimate strength of the hull girder subjected to combined loads ostapenko and moore 1982 ostapenko and vaucher 1980 considered the effect of shear force and torsion when studying the ultimate strength of a hull girder having made a discussion on hull girder s ultimate strength interactions between different loads taking a typical transverse mid ship section of a 4300teu container ship as the study object paik et al 2001 quantitatively obtained the interaction relationship of the ultimate strength between vertical bending and torsion generally the interaction relationship of the ultimate strength between vertical bending and torsion can be expressed as 1 m b m bu α m t m tu β 1 in which m b and m t respectively denotes the internal vertical bending moment and torsional moment suffered by the hull girder m bu and m tu respectively denotes the ultimate strength of the hull girder subjected to vertical bending and torsion alone then kim and yoo 2008 conducted a series of nonlinear finite element analyses of the rectangular box girders subjected to combined loads having made a detailed description of the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of the box girders subjected to combined vertical bending and torsion in addition the effect of shear force and initial geometrical imperfections of the hull girder has also been taken into account tanaka et al 2015 studied the collapse behaviors of a 5250teu container ship subjected to combined bending and torsion with numerical analysis and scale model collapse experiment proposing an analysis method for evaluating the ultimate strength of the hull girder subjected to combined loads for ultra large container ships subjected to combined loads mohammed et al 2016 had numerically studied the ultimate strength of a 10 000teu ol185 container ship subjected to combined vertical bending and torsion having made an evaluation of the safety margin of the ultra large container ship afterwards the ultimate strength of a 10 000teu ultra large container ship subjected to three combined loads i e vertical bending horizontal bending and torsion was numerically studied by wang et al 2018 having obtained a three dimensional ultimate strength envelope of the hull girder more recently tatsum and fujikubo 2020 have made a numerical investigation on the ultimate strength of two large container ships 8000teu and 14000teu subjected to combined hogging moment and bottom local water pressure figuring out the major factors that cause the reduction of the ultimate hogging strength with the bottom local water pressure 1 3 current existing issues currently when evaluating the ultimate strength of ship hull girders a single compartment hull girder between two adjacent transverse bulkheads or even a single segment hull girder between two adjacent transverse frameworks is normally adopted as the study object paik et al 2001 kim and yoo 2008 shi and wang 2012a b tanaka et al 2015 mohammed and benson 2016 ao and wang 2016 cui et al 2017 liu et al 2018 wang et al 2018 tatsumi and fujikubo 2020 in fact such modeling congenitally ignores hull girder s longitudinal dimension and the effect of transverse stiffening members such as transverse bulkheads and transverse frameworks on hull girder s ultimate strength after all the global hull girder is inherently a structure with a very large longitudinal dimension which could affect the distributions of warping torsional moments as follows senjanovic and tomasevic 2008 2 t t t 1 cos h β x cos h β l 3 t w t cos h β x cos h β l 4 β g i t e i w in which x and l is the distance from the mid ship section and the overall length of the hull girder respectively i t i w e and g is the torsional modulus warping modulus young s modulus and shear modulus respectively it can be seen from eq 2 and eq 3 that both the pure torsional moment t t and the warping torsional moment t w strongly depend on hull girder s longitudinal dimension which may significantly affect hull girder s ultimate strength and collapse behaviors when hull girder s collapse process contains torsion it has been experimentally observed that there exist two very different collapse mechanisms of the hull girder under pure torsion of which one is the warping failure mechanism for the global hull girder i e the hull girder with a large longitudinal dimension sun and soares 2003 and the other is the shear failure mechanism for the single compartment hull girder wang et al 2020a b except for the longitudinal dimension there is a group of transverse stiffening members such as transverse bulkheads and transverse frameworks which are densely arranged along hull girder s longitudinal dimension which can contribute a lot to the torsional rigidity of hull girders senjanovic and tomasevic 2008 as a result in this paper to make a more accurate evaluation of the loading capacity of the 10 000teu ultra large container ship in addition to the combined loading condition the global hull girder was also modeled including the transverse bulkheads and transverse frameworks another issue is that the experimental data about the ultimate strength of hull girders subjected to combined loads are not sufficient especially for similar scale model collapse experiments of container ships compared with the collapse tests of plates and stiffened plates hu et al 1997 paik et al 2005 kumar et al 2006 paik 2008 xu and soares 2013 the collapse tests of hull girders are fewer due to their huge cost and the collapse tests of hull girders which are subjected to combined bending and torsion are even much fewer there still exist several significant challenges in the loading techniques to conduct a combined loading e g combined vertical bending and torsion collapse test of a hull girder in addition to the loading capacity of hydro cylinders and the load carrying capacity of laboratory platforms a proper loading scheme has to be made to coordinate the applied bending and torsional loads without producing any other undesired loads of course a proper boundary has to be established to keep the hull girder simply supported while no rigid motion can be made during the loading process in experiment however the loading techniques mentioned above can be easily and perfectly achieved by numerical methods in this paper to validate the reliability and accuracy of the elastic perfectly plastic numerical models employed in hull girder s ultimate strength evaluations based on nonlinear finite element analysis a pure hogging and a pure torsion collapse experiment of the similar scale models of the mid ship compartment of a 10 000teu ultra large container ship were presented it should also be noted here that the ultimate strength analysis is not to pay much attention to the specific magnitude or distribution of the external loads imposed on the hull girder but aims to make an evaluation of the maximum internal force or moments that a structure can bear under the most extreme conditions of course in addition to vertical bending and torsion the horizontal bending moment shear force and lateral water pressure suffered by the hull girder may also weaken hull girder s ultimate longitudinal strength the current focus of this paper is on the effect of the torsional moment alone on the reduction of the ultimate longitudinal strength of the hull girder especially for the global hull girder the obtained ultimate strength envelope of the global hull girder can also be regarded as the ultimate strength interactions between vertical bending and torsion the horizontal bending moment shear force and lateral water pressure are not taken into account in this research 2 fe modeling 2 1 description of the object ship the principal characteristics of the transverse mid ship section of the 10 000teu ultra large container ship are presented in fig 1 from which it can be observed that the true ship hull girder has a very complicated configuration in both geometry and materials the main dimensions and details of the ship are listed in table 1 and table 2 the hull girder structure is assumed to be made of elastic perfectly plastic materials of which the yielding stress young s modulus poisson s ratio and the density is 355 mpa for ah material and 390 mpa for eh material 2 06e 05 mpa 0 3 and 7 85 t m 3 respectively the accuracy and applicability of this assumption and simplification that considers the steel materials as elastic perfectly plastic materials in hull girder s ultimate strength analysis will be validated by physical experiments in section 3 2 as is shown in fig 2 both a 1 2 1 1 2 compartment hull girder model and a global hull girder model are established in which the global hull girder can be considered as the container ship s parallel middle body 2 2 mesh for element type the fe models established with the commercial fe software abaqus 6 14 adopt the 4 node doubly curved general purpose shell element s4r and 3 node triangular general purpose shell element s3 which are able to well model the membrane rigidity bending rigidity and large deflections of hull girders for mesh size the meshes should be fine enough to well capture the buckling behaviors of hull girder s local plates however much greater computation efforts have to be paid to finer meshes especially for the large scale simulations of such a complicated structure as a result a balance between the mesh size and computation capability has to be made the mesh convergence study has been conducted to observe the mesh sensitivity of the numerically obtained hull girder s ultimate strength of which the results of the hogging case have been displayed in detail in fig 3 it can be observed from fig 3 that the obtained load displacement response curves of the numerical models with different mesh refinements have very good consistency in ultimate strength based on this the mesh refinement of 4 elements between two adjacent longitudinal stiffeners is adopted in numerical analysis shown in fig 2 2 3 initial geometric imperfections inevitably initial geometric imperfections and residual stresses will be produced for welded structures which can affect hull girder s ultimate strength and failure behaviors paik et al 2004 in this research the initial geometric imperfections have been imposed into the numerical models of hull girders by modeling the magnitude and shape of the initial deflections two types of initial geometric imperfections are taken into account which are the thin horse mode for the local plates between stiffeners and the sideways initial deflections for the stiffeners respectively ao et al 2019 mohammed and benson 2016 wang et al 2018 the detailed illustrations of the initial geometric imperfections can be referred in wang et al 2018 which are not introduced again here taking a stiffened plate on the outer bottom between two adjacent longitudinal girders as an illustrative example the employed thin horse mode of initial deflections for plates and the sideways initial deflections for stiffeners are shown in fig 4 in which the magnitude of the initial imperfections has been magnified by 50 times to be better visualized residual stresses are not taken into account due to the difficulties in the quantitative control of them although they can also affect the ultimate strength of hull girders in fact according to khan and zhang 2011 10 13 of the ultimate strength for stiffened panels can be decreased due to the effect of the residual stresses relevant information about the effect of residual stresses on the ultimate strength of plates and stiffened plates can also be found in kim et al 2018 and more details can be referred in issc 2009 issc 2012 it should also be noted that during the manufacture process of ship structures the residual stresses of structural components can be partially released by loading and unloading cycles in a small amplitude which can effectively weaken the effect of residual stresses on the overall stiffness of ship structures 2 4 boundary conditions and load applications according to issc 2009 and issc 2012 for the hull girder to efficiently distribute the moment loads across a section it is recommended to tie all nodes in an end section of the model to a central located master node through rigid links or multipoint constraints and apply the moment loads through the master node partially restrained boundary condition is considered to be more representative of true ship hull girders paik et al 2001 which have also been adopted in the nonlinear finite element analysis of hull girder s ultimate strength mohammed and benson 2016 wang et al 2018 kim et al 2013 for partially restrained boundary condition the nodes at the unloaded end are completely fixed with all the other nodes of the fe model free as is shown in fig 5 two rigid body constraints are respectively created for the nodes of the end sections and tied to the reference points locating at the geometric centroid of the end sections by which the load applications can be transmitted to the end sections with the rigid body constraint the master nodes can be placed at any position and will not influence the obtained results cui et al 2017 wang et al 2018 3 ultimate strength of the hull girder subjected to single load component 3 1 numerical results the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of the hull girders subjected to pure sagging pure hogging and pure torsion are respectively displayed in fig 6 fig 7 and fig 8 in conjunction with table 3 in which both the compartment hull girder and the global hull girder are included from the load displacement response curves shown in figs 6 a and fig 7 a it can be observed that for pure sagging and pure hogging the differences of the obtained ultimate strength between compartment hull girder and global hull girder are very small which are 0 95 for pure sagging and 2 48 for pure hogging respectively see table 3 the differences of the obtained ultimate strength between compartment hull girder and global hull girder are evaluated by 5 difference m u compartment hull m u global hull m u global hull 100 in which m u compartment hull and m u global hull are the numerically obtained ultimate strength of the compartment hull girder and the global hull girder respectively also as is shown in figs 6 b and fig 7 b for pure sagging and pure hogging the global hull girder and the compartment hull girder exhibit an identical collapse behavior therefore for pure sagging and pure hogging a compartment hull girder can well represent the global hull girder in ultimate strength and collapse behaviors as is known the main support members to carry and resist the normal stresses induced by bending moments are the transverse components such as web frames bottom floors and transverse bulkheads of the hull girder as a result when evaluating hull girder s ultimate bending strength even a single cross section can well represent the global hull girder however for torsion the main support members to carry and resist the shear stresses induced by torsional moments are the longitudinal components e g double side shell structures stringers longitudinals and longitudinal girders of the hull girder more importantly in hull girder s torsional collapse process warping effect will be developed which strongly depends on the longitudinal dimension of the hull girder senjanovic and tomasevic 2008 and will have a significant effect on hull girder s ultimate strength it can be observed from fig 8 a that the obtained ultimate torsional strength of the global hull girder is much smaller than that of the compartment hull girder the difference of the obtained ultimate torsional strength between compartment hull girder and global hull girder can reach up to 133 33 see table 3 compared with the compartment hull girder due to warping effect a much larger longitudinal out of plane deformation has happened to the cross sections of the global hull girder see fig 8 b causing a more severe buckling damage at two ends of the global hull girder see fig 8 c this is the main reason for such a large discrepancy of the ultimate torsional strength between compartment hull girder and global hull girder 3 2 experimental examination of the reliability of the elastic perfectly plastic models it is unrealistic to conduct a full scale collapse test of such a large dimension hull girder structure scale models have to be designed to represent the true ship hull girder in ultimate strength experiments reflecting the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of true ship hull girders two 1 25 scale models have been designed and manufactured to represent the mid ship compartment of this 10 000teu ultra large container ship of which two typical cross sections are displayed in fig 9 the detailed design method and manufacture process of the scale models have been specially demonstrated in wang et al 2019a b what should be specially mentioned here is that the geometric similarity and strength similarity between scale models and true ship have been satisfied to have numerically achieved the consistency of the progressive collapse process between scale models and true ship which means that the designed scale models can represent the true mid ship compartment of the 10 000teu ultra large container ship in ultimate strength with these two 1 25 scale hull girders both a pure hogging and a pure torsion collapse experiment of the compartment hull girder were presented as is shown in fig 10 a a four point bending loading scheme was adopted to conduct the hull girder s pure hogging collapse test and for the pure torsion one end of the test model was clamped by a strong reaction frame and the other end was provided with a pair of forces of the same magnitude but opposite in direction to produce a pure torsional moment on the hull girder see fig 10 b more detailed experiment procedures can be referred in wang et al 2019a b for the pure hogging collapse test and in wang et al 2020a b for the pure torsion collapse test due to the convenience and low cost in engineering elastic perfectly plastic material models are widely employed in nonlinear finite element analysis to evaluate hull girder s ultimate strength paik et al 2001 kim and yoo 2008 shi and wang 2012a b tanaka et al 2015 mohammed and benson 2016 cui et al 2017 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2019a b tatsumi and fujikubo 2020 wang et al 2020a b neglecting the hardening effect of materials the assumption that simplifies the steel materials to elastic perfectly plastic materials in hull girder s ultimate strength analysis still needs to be experimentally validated especially for the structures with a complicated configuration e g a container ship hull girder which is also the main purpose of presenting these two hull girder s collapse experiments here in this paper what should be noted here that to the best of the authors knowledge few investigations have been experimentally conducted to make an examination of the accuracy of the elastic perfectly plastic material models employed in hull girder s ultimate strength evaluations based on nfem however this is a very important issue which concerns the reliability of the fem results obtained with the elastic perfectly plastic material models herein combined with both the pure hogging and pure torsion collapse experiments a discussion on the accuracy and reliability of the elastic perfectly plastic material models in hull girder s ultimate strength evaluations based on nfem is conducted which was never made in wang et al 2019 or wang et al 2020 to obtain the properties of the steel materials employed in the physical test hull girder standard specimen tensile tests were conducted as is shown in fig 9 the hull girder in the physical collapse test is fabricated with the plates of different thickness 8 mm 5 mm 4 mm 3 mm correspondingly standard specimens of 8 mm 5 mm 4 mm and 3 mm are respectively made to conduct the tensile tests to obtain the stress strain relationship of the material the dimensions of the standard specimens are shown in fig 11 in specimen tensile tests the original load displacement curves of the standard specimens of different thickness are shown in fig 12 at the very early stage of the tensile loading process due to the slip of jigs it is normally difficult to accurately detect the resultant displacement of the specimens when converting the original load displacement curve into the stress strain relationship the linear elastic stage of the stress strain relationship can be modified with young s modulus it can be observed from fig 12 that the specimens of different thickness show good consistency in the obtained load displacement curves especially for the linear elastic stage and the obtained yielding stress based on these standard specimen tensile tests the load displacement curve of the specimen of 5 mm thickness was chosen to establish the stress strain relationship of the material as is shown in fig 13 the engineering stress strain relationship which was directly obtained in standard specimen tensile tests should be converted into the true stress strain relationship which can be employed in fem analysis the applicability and rationality of the employment of the elastic perfectly plastic models in hull girder s ultimate strength analysis can be examined in two aspects of which one is the progressive collapse process of the hull girder and the other is the hull girder s macroscopic collapse behaviors firstly as is shown in fig 14 before ultimate limit state the numerically obtained progressive collapse process i e load displacement response curve of the hull girder with the elastic perfectly plastic material constitutive model is in very good consistency with that of the hull girder with the true stress strain constitutive model which means that the elastic perfectly plastic material constitutive model can perform very well in predicting hull girder s elastic limit strength and ultimate limit strength after ultimate limit state discrepancies of the progressive collapse process between the hull girder with the elastic perfectly plastic material constitutive model and the one with the true stress strain constitutive model start to emerge which means that the hardening effect of materials mainly affect the post ultimate strength stage of the hull girder structure s collapse process it is not hard to understand this phenomenon the ultimate strength of hull girders is a buckling based failure mechanism at the critical failure point of the hull girder i e hull girder s ultimate limit state hardening effect of the materials in yielding regions may not yet start to effectively work it can also be observed from fig 14 that there exists a difference of the obtained ultimate strength of the hull girder between numerical analysis and experiment on the one hand in the experiment when loading process was very close to hull girder s ultimate strength at that short time period it was quite difficult to make an accurate data collection because the deformations of the hull girder were too large to be accurately measured on the other hand for the numerical models employed in numerical analysis it is impossible to fully rebuild the geometrical imperfections and welding residual stresses which are inevitable during the manufacturing process of the physical test model the ultimate strength of the hull girder can be significantly affected by the manufacturing defects which will cause the difference of the ultimate strength between experimental and numerical results in fact according to khan and zhang 2011 due to the existence of the residual stresses the ultimate strength for stiffened plates can be decreased by 10 13 in addition from the perspective of hull girder s macroscopic collapse behaviors it can be observed from fig 15 a 1 a 3 and fig 16 a 1 a 3 that for both hogging and torsion case at ultimate limit state the numerically obtained hull girder s collapse behaviors based on elastic perfectly plastic material constitutive model have little difference with those based on true stress strain relationship however at post ultimate strength stage similar to the predicted progressive collapse process there exist obvious discrepancies of the numerically obtained collapse behaviors between the hull girder with the elastic perfectly plastic material constitutive model and the one with the true stress strain constitutive model see fig 15 a 2 a 4 and fig 16 a 2 a 4 it should also be specially noted here that the fem results obtained with the elastic perfectly plastic material constitutive model can well predict the final collapse behaviors of the hull girder for both hogging case see fig 15 a 4 and fig 15 b and torsion case see fig 16 a 4 and fig 16 b of which the buckling behaviors have been well reappeared for numerical analysis based on fem the hardening effect of materials does have a significant effect on the post ultimate strength behaviors of the hull girder therefore from the perspective of engineering applications if engineers only focus on the ultimate strength of hull girders not paying attention to hull girder s post ultimate strength behaviors elastic perfectly plastic material constitutive models can perform very well in evaluating hull girder s ultimate strength with nonlinear finite element analysis 4 ultimate strength of the hull girder subjected to combined loads 4 1 combined loading schemes to model hull girder s combined loading conditions of vertical bending and torsion two loading schemes can be adopted the first loading scheme is to respectively apply the desired torsional and bending moment to the hull girder in a sequenced way as is shown in fig 17 two loading steps are established and each loading step is set to be 5s which is long enough to deal with a quasi static problem of such a hull girder structure with explicit dynamic analysis in the first loading step pure torsional moment is incrementally applied to the hull girder until the torsional moment reaches a given level while the bending moment is kept at zero all the time during this loading step see fig 17 a and b then in the second loading step the vertical bending moment is applied by incrementally increasing the vertical bending angle of the loaded end section see fig 17 d and b until the hull girder collapses while the torsional moment is kept as a constant at the given level see fig 17 a it can be observed from fig 17 c that the torsional rotation angle of the loaded end section follows a linear incremental increase in the first loading step and then exhibits a nonlinear growth behavior in the second loading step in the second loading step to maintain a constant torsional moment the torsional rotation angle of the loaded end section will be constantly adjusted to keep the equilibrium with the increasing bending moment this is why the torsional rotation angle of the loaded end section exhibits a nonlinear growth with the incremental increase of the applied bending moment which phenomenon is also a sign of the interactions between internal bending and torsional moment of the hull girder the other loading scheme is to simultaneously and proportionally apply the combined torsional and bending moment to the hull girder to guarantee that the applied torsional and bending moment are kept at a given proportion of the magnitude during the whole loading process moment loads have to be directly applied to the hull girder rather than forced rotational displacement loads based on the experimentally validated simplified scale hull girder models in section 3 2 and taking a single segment hull girder between two adjacent transverse frameworks as an illustrative example three typical proportions of the applied torsional moment and bending moment are chosen to be displayed in fig 18 in which m bending m torsion and m magnitude denote the applied bending moment torsional moment and the magnitude of the combined two moments respectively it can be observed from fig 18 that the applied bending and torsional moment are kept at a given proportion of the magnitude during the whole loading process with the increase of the applied torsional moment the damage of hull girder s side shell structures is severer and severer it should be specially mentioned that the first loading scheme mentioned above is based on a basic assumption that different load components imposed on the hull girder can be freely combined with each other which means that there is no priority of the loading sequences between the bending and torsional moment this is why the torsional and bending moment can be independently and respectively applied in a sequenced way however physically speaking there doesn t exist a sequence between the bending moment and torsional moment imposed on the hull girder therefore the second loading scheme is more physical and easier to understand in the next section the ultimate strength envelope of the global hull girder subjected to combined vertical bending and torsion was obtained based on the second loading scheme which is to simultaneously and proportionally apply the combined torsional and bending moment to the hull girder herein to make an examination of the basic assumption mentioned above and to see if the simultaneous acting of these two moments could be more dangerous compared with maximum bending moment and torsional moment acting separately three loading sequences are numerically tested to make a comparison of the obtained ultimate strength envelopes of the hull girder under different loading sequences see fig 19 t b b t and t b in fig 19 respectively denotes the loading sequence of torsion first then bending to collapse bending first then torsion to collapse and torsion and bending simultaneously applied to collapse it can be observed from the obtained ultimate strength envelopes of the hull girders under these three different loading sequences that the loading sequence between vertical bending and torsion has little effect on the numerically obtained ultimate strength envelope and collapse behaviors of the hull girder subjected to combined vertical bending and torsion which means that for numerical analysis based on fem different load components imposed on the hull girder can be freely combined with each other and the loading sequences of different load components have little effect on the numerically obtained ultimate strength of the hull girder subjected to combined loads and this basic assumption has been widely employed by many researchers in ultimate strength analysis of the hull girder subjected to combined loads paik et al 2001 kim and yoo 2008 tanaka et al 2015 mohammed and benson 2016 wang et al 2018 tatsumi and fujikubo 2020 4 2 ultimate strength envelope of the global hull girder subjected to combined loads the ultimate strength envelopes of the compartment hull girder and the global hull girder subjected to combined vertical bending and torsion are displayed in fig 20 a and b for sagging and hogging case respectively for the compartment hull girder subjected to combined vertical bending and torsion the following eq 6 was numerically and empirically obtained by wang et al 2018 to quantify hull girder s ultimate strength envelope however based on the fem results in this paper eq 7 is developed with the nonlinear curve fitting method to quantify the ultimate strength envelope of the global hull girder subjected to combined vertical bending and torsion it can be observed from fig 20 that there exists a large discrepancy of the ultimate strength envelope between the compartment hull girder and the global hull girder of which the ultimate strength envelope of the global hull girder is much lower than that of the compartment hull girder which means that under combined vertical bending and torsion the safety margin of the global hull girder is much smaller than that of the compartment hull girder due to the weakening effect of the torsional moments on the ultimate bending strength of the hull girder 6 m b m bu 1 42 m t m tu 5 03 1 for sagging case m b m bu 1 56 m t m tu 5 26 1 for hogging case 7 m b m bu 2 01 m t m tu 0 85 1 for sagging case m b m bu 1 76 m t m tu 1 29 1 for hogging case for the global hull girder the warping effect induced by torsion is much severer which can be observed in fig 21 that both ends of the global hull girder have been severely damaged with buckling largely weakening the ultimate bending strength of the global hull girder by torsional moments 5 conclusions in this paper both the compartment hull girder and the global hull girder of an ultra large container ship have been modeled to investigate the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of the container ship s hull girder subjected to pure bending pure torsion and combined loads performing a series of full scale nonlinear large deflection elastoplastic finite element analyses also the elastic perfectly plastic material models established based on nfem are experimentally validated by physical collapse tests of the scale models of a mid ship compartment of the ultra large container ship subjected to pure hogging and pure torsion finally the ultimate strength envelope of the global hull girder of the 10 000teu ultra large container ship subjected to combined vertical bending and torsion is quantitatively obtained based on the obtained results and discussions in this paper the following conclusions can be drawn 1 for pure bending a compartment hull girder can well represent the global hull girder in ultimate strength and collapse behaviors however for torsion due to warping effect the ultimate torsional strength of the global hull girder is much smaller than that of the compartment hull girder the compartment hull girder could largely overestimate the ultimate torsional strength of the global hull girder 2 for numerical analysis based on fem the elastic perfectly plastic material constitutive model can perform very well in predicting hull girder s ultimate strength and collapse behaviors however the hardening effect of materials could have a significant effect on the post ultimate strength behaviors of the hull girder 3 under combined bending and torsion the safety margin of the global hull girder is much smaller than that of the compartment hull girder due to the weakening effect of the torsional moments on the ultimate bending strength of the hull girder it would largely overestimate the safety margin of the global hull girder with a compartment hull girder model 4 eq 7 was developed in this paper to quantify the interactions between ultimate bending strength and ultimate torsional strength of the global hull girder of the 10 000teu ultra large container ship subjected to combined vertical bending and torsion credit authorship contribution

21659,the main objective of this research is to figure out the relationship of the ultimate strength characteristics between the compartment hull girder and the global hull girder especially focusing on the ultimate strength envelope of the global hull girder of a 10 000teu ultra large container ship subjected to combined loads which is one of the most important indexes to quantify the safety margin of the container ship to achieve these aims both the compartment hull girder and the global hull girder are modeled based on true ship hull girder s configurations a series of full scale nonlinear finite element analyses are performed in addition to examine the reliability of the elastic perfectly plastic material models employed in fea similar scale model collapse experiments of a compartment hull girder subjected to pure hogging and pure torsion are also presented finally the ultimate strength envelope of the global hull girder of the 10 000teu ultra large container ship subjected to combined vertical bending and torsion is quantitatively obtained which can characterize the container ship hull girder s ultimate strength interactions between vertical bending and torsion and quantify the safety margin of the global hull girder of the container ship subjected to combined vertical bending and torsion keywords ultimate strength envelope compartment hull girder global hull girder combined vertical bending and torsion ultimate strength interactions 1 introduction 1 1 background with the increasing demand for goods transportation capacity in international trade the shipbuilding design of the modern container ships is now developing towards the large scale and multi purpose trend ultra large container ship e g 10 000teu container ship is one of the high tech ships of great application potential which is featured by larger deck openings larger loading capacity relatively lower torsional rigidity and higher emphasis on stability to keep a more economical cost while an adequate safety tolerance can still be guaranteed ultimate strength of ship hull girders is now widely adopted as the safety design criterion to measure hull girder s maximum loading capacity normally the ultimate longitudinal strength i e ultimate vertical bending strength of the hull girder is always considered as the most important index when evaluating hull girder s ultimate loading capacity for container ships especially for ultra large container ships which are characterized by large deck openings and low torsional rigidity the effect of the torsional moment on the reduction of the ultimate longitudinal strength of the hull girder can not be ignored when ships sail in rough sea and at an oblique heading the internal torsional moment suffered by the hull girder may approach or even exceed the internal vertical bending moment although the torsional moment itself will not directly cause the collapse of the hull girder the warping effect involved in hull girder s torsional behaviors can significantly reduce the ultimate longitudinal strength i e vertical bending strength of the hull girder paik et al 2001 wang et al 2020a b as a result to obtain a better picture of hull girder s ultimate strength envelope ultimate strength analysis of the hull girder subjected to combined loads e g vertical bending and torsion should be conducted 1 2 ultimate strength analysis of hull girders subjected to combined loads as the main structural units of ship hull girder structures stiffened plates have been deeply studied by many researchers to make the ultimate strength predictions of them which can be seen in detail in the review paper by kim et al 2018 representatively both the intact ultimate strength and residual ultimate strength of stiffened plates under axial compression have been investigated and predicted by faulkner 1975 paik and thayamballi 1997 paik et al 2005 2008 zhang and khan 2009 kim et al 2017 xu et al 2018 and ao et al 2019 2020 as for box girders nakai et al 2004 had conducted a series of bending collapse tests of box girders to study the effect of pitting corrosion on the ultimate strength of box girders gordo and soares 2008 2009 had performed a series of ultimate strength experiments of box girders made of both mild steel and high tensile steel developing some valuable insights into the box girder s collapse behaviors for ultimate strength of the hull girder subjected to combined loads ostapenko and moore 1982 ostapenko and vaucher 1980 considered the effect of shear force and torsion when studying the ultimate strength of a hull girder having made a discussion on hull girder s ultimate strength interactions between different loads taking a typical transverse mid ship section of a 4300teu container ship as the study object paik et al 2001 quantitatively obtained the interaction relationship of the ultimate strength between vertical bending and torsion generally the interaction relationship of the ultimate strength between vertical bending and torsion can be expressed as 1 m b m bu α m t m tu β 1 in which m b and m t respectively denotes the internal vertical bending moment and torsional moment suffered by the hull girder m bu and m tu respectively denotes the ultimate strength of the hull girder subjected to vertical bending and torsion alone then kim and yoo 2008 conducted a series of nonlinear finite element analyses of the rectangular box girders subjected to combined loads having made a detailed description of the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of the box girders subjected to combined vertical bending and torsion in addition the effect of shear force and initial geometrical imperfections of the hull girder has also been taken into account tanaka et al 2015 studied the collapse behaviors of a 5250teu container ship subjected to combined bending and torsion with numerical analysis and scale model collapse experiment proposing an analysis method for evaluating the ultimate strength of the hull girder subjected to combined loads for ultra large container ships subjected to combined loads mohammed et al 2016 had numerically studied the ultimate strength of a 10 000teu ol185 container ship subjected to combined vertical bending and torsion having made an evaluation of the safety margin of the ultra large container ship afterwards the ultimate strength of a 10 000teu ultra large container ship subjected to three combined loads i e vertical bending horizontal bending and torsion was numerically studied by wang et al 2018 having obtained a three dimensional ultimate strength envelope of the hull girder more recently tatsum and fujikubo 2020 have made a numerical investigation on the ultimate strength of two large container ships 8000teu and 14000teu subjected to combined hogging moment and bottom local water pressure figuring out the major factors that cause the reduction of the ultimate hogging strength with the bottom local water pressure 1 3 current existing issues currently when evaluating the ultimate strength of ship hull girders a single compartment hull girder between two adjacent transverse bulkheads or even a single segment hull girder between two adjacent transverse frameworks is normally adopted as the study object paik et al 2001 kim and yoo 2008 shi and wang 2012a b tanaka et al 2015 mohammed and benson 2016 ao and wang 2016 cui et al 2017 liu et al 2018 wang et al 2018 tatsumi and fujikubo 2020 in fact such modeling congenitally ignores hull girder s longitudinal dimension and the effect of transverse stiffening members such as transverse bulkheads and transverse frameworks on hull girder s ultimate strength after all the global hull girder is inherently a structure with a very large longitudinal dimension which could affect the distributions of warping torsional moments as follows senjanovic and tomasevic 2008 2 t t t 1 cos h β x cos h β l 3 t w t cos h β x cos h β l 4 β g i t e i w in which x and l is the distance from the mid ship section and the overall length of the hull girder respectively i t i w e and g is the torsional modulus warping modulus young s modulus and shear modulus respectively it can be seen from eq 2 and eq 3 that both the pure torsional moment t t and the warping torsional moment t w strongly depend on hull girder s longitudinal dimension which may significantly affect hull girder s ultimate strength and collapse behaviors when hull girder s collapse process contains torsion it has been experimentally observed that there exist two very different collapse mechanisms of the hull girder under pure torsion of which one is the warping failure mechanism for the global hull girder i e the hull girder with a large longitudinal dimension sun and soares 2003 and the other is the shear failure mechanism for the single compartment hull girder wang et al 2020a b except for the longitudinal dimension there is a group of transverse stiffening members such as transverse bulkheads and transverse frameworks which are densely arranged along hull girder s longitudinal dimension which can contribute a lot to the torsional rigidity of hull girders senjanovic and tomasevic 2008 as a result in this paper to make a more accurate evaluation of the loading capacity of the 10 000teu ultra large container ship in addition to the combined loading condition the global hull girder was also modeled including the transverse bulkheads and transverse frameworks another issue is that the experimental data about the ultimate strength of hull girders subjected to combined loads are not sufficient especially for similar scale model collapse experiments of container ships compared with the collapse tests of plates and stiffened plates hu et al 1997 paik et al 2005 kumar et al 2006 paik 2008 xu and soares 2013 the collapse tests of hull girders are fewer due to their huge cost and the collapse tests of hull girders which are subjected to combined bending and torsion are even much fewer there still exist several significant challenges in the loading techniques to conduct a combined loading e g combined vertical bending and torsion collapse test of a hull girder in addition to the loading capacity of hydro cylinders and the load carrying capacity of laboratory platforms a proper loading scheme has to be made to coordinate the applied bending and torsional loads without producing any other undesired loads of course a proper boundary has to be established to keep the hull girder simply supported while no rigid motion can be made during the loading process in experiment however the loading techniques mentioned above can be easily and perfectly achieved by numerical methods in this paper to validate the reliability and accuracy of the elastic perfectly plastic numerical models employed in hull girder s ultimate strength evaluations based on nonlinear finite element analysis a pure hogging and a pure torsion collapse experiment of the similar scale models of the mid ship compartment of a 10 000teu ultra large container ship were presented it should also be noted here that the ultimate strength analysis is not to pay much attention to the specific magnitude or distribution of the external loads imposed on the hull girder but aims to make an evaluation of the maximum internal force or moments that a structure can bear under the most extreme conditions of course in addition to vertical bending and torsion the horizontal bending moment shear force and lateral water pressure suffered by the hull girder may also weaken hull girder s ultimate longitudinal strength the current focus of this paper is on the effect of the torsional moment alone on the reduction of the ultimate longitudinal strength of the hull girder especially for the global hull girder the obtained ultimate strength envelope of the global hull girder can also be regarded as the ultimate strength interactions between vertical bending and torsion the horizontal bending moment shear force and lateral water pressure are not taken into account in this research 2 fe modeling 2 1 description of the object ship the principal characteristics of the transverse mid ship section of the 10 000teu ultra large container ship are presented in fig 1 from which it can be observed that the true ship hull girder has a very complicated configuration in both geometry and materials the main dimensions and details of the ship are listed in table 1 and table 2 the hull girder structure is assumed to be made of elastic perfectly plastic materials of which the yielding stress young s modulus poisson s ratio and the density is 355 mpa for ah material and 390 mpa for eh material 2 06e 05 mpa 0 3 and 7 85 t m 3 respectively the accuracy and applicability of this assumption and simplification that considers the steel materials as elastic perfectly plastic materials in hull girder s ultimate strength analysis will be validated by physical experiments in section 3 2 as is shown in fig 2 both a 1 2 1 1 2 compartment hull girder model and a global hull girder model are established in which the global hull girder can be considered as the container ship s parallel middle body 2 2 mesh for element type the fe models established with the commercial fe software abaqus 6 14 adopt the 4 node doubly curved general purpose shell element s4r and 3 node triangular general purpose shell element s3 which are able to well model the membrane rigidity bending rigidity and large deflections of hull girders for mesh size the meshes should be fine enough to well capture the buckling behaviors of hull girder s local plates however much greater computation efforts have to be paid to finer meshes especially for the large scale simulations of such a complicated structure as a result a balance between the mesh size and computation capability has to be made the mesh convergence study has been conducted to observe the mesh sensitivity of the numerically obtained hull girder s ultimate strength of which the results of the hogging case have been displayed in detail in fig 3 it can be observed from fig 3 that the obtained load displacement response curves of the numerical models with different mesh refinements have very good consistency in ultimate strength based on this the mesh refinement of 4 elements between two adjacent longitudinal stiffeners is adopted in numerical analysis shown in fig 2 2 3 initial geometric imperfections inevitably initial geometric imperfections and residual stresses will be produced for welded structures which can affect hull girder s ultimate strength and failure behaviors paik et al 2004 in this research the initial geometric imperfections have been imposed into the numerical models of hull girders by modeling the magnitude and shape of the initial deflections two types of initial geometric imperfections are taken into account which are the thin horse mode for the local plates between stiffeners and the sideways initial deflections for the stiffeners respectively ao et al 2019 mohammed and benson 2016 wang et al 2018 the detailed illustrations of the initial geometric imperfections can be referred in wang et al 2018 which are not introduced again here taking a stiffened plate on the outer bottom between two adjacent longitudinal girders as an illustrative example the employed thin horse mode of initial deflections for plates and the sideways initial deflections for stiffeners are shown in fig 4 in which the magnitude of the initial imperfections has been magnified by 50 times to be better visualized residual stresses are not taken into account due to the difficulties in the quantitative control of them although they can also affect the ultimate strength of hull girders in fact according to khan and zhang 2011 10 13 of the ultimate strength for stiffened panels can be decreased due to the effect of the residual stresses relevant information about the effect of residual stresses on the ultimate strength of plates and stiffened plates can also be found in kim et al 2018 and more details can be referred in issc 2009 issc 2012 it should also be noted that during the manufacture process of ship structures the residual stresses of structural components can be partially released by loading and unloading cycles in a small amplitude which can effectively weaken the effect of residual stresses on the overall stiffness of ship structures 2 4 boundary conditions and load applications according to issc 2009 and issc 2012 for the hull girder to efficiently distribute the moment loads across a section it is recommended to tie all nodes in an end section of the model to a central located master node through rigid links or multipoint constraints and apply the moment loads through the master node partially restrained boundary condition is considered to be more representative of true ship hull girders paik et al 2001 which have also been adopted in the nonlinear finite element analysis of hull girder s ultimate strength mohammed and benson 2016 wang et al 2018 kim et al 2013 for partially restrained boundary condition the nodes at the unloaded end are completely fixed with all the other nodes of the fe model free as is shown in fig 5 two rigid body constraints are respectively created for the nodes of the end sections and tied to the reference points locating at the geometric centroid of the end sections by which the load applications can be transmitted to the end sections with the rigid body constraint the master nodes can be placed at any position and will not influence the obtained results cui et al 2017 wang et al 2018 3 ultimate strength of the hull girder subjected to single load component 3 1 numerical results the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of the hull girders subjected to pure sagging pure hogging and pure torsion are respectively displayed in fig 6 fig 7 and fig 8 in conjunction with table 3 in which both the compartment hull girder and the global hull girder are included from the load displacement response curves shown in figs 6 a and fig 7 a it can be observed that for pure sagging and pure hogging the differences of the obtained ultimate strength between compartment hull girder and global hull girder are very small which are 0 95 for pure sagging and 2 48 for pure hogging respectively see table 3 the differences of the obtained ultimate strength between compartment hull girder and global hull girder are evaluated by 5 difference m u compartment hull m u global hull m u global hull 100 in which m u compartment hull and m u global hull are the numerically obtained ultimate strength of the compartment hull girder and the global hull girder respectively also as is shown in figs 6 b and fig 7 b for pure sagging and pure hogging the global hull girder and the compartment hull girder exhibit an identical collapse behavior therefore for pure sagging and pure hogging a compartment hull girder can well represent the global hull girder in ultimate strength and collapse behaviors as is known the main support members to carry and resist the normal stresses induced by bending moments are the transverse components such as web frames bottom floors and transverse bulkheads of the hull girder as a result when evaluating hull girder s ultimate bending strength even a single cross section can well represent the global hull girder however for torsion the main support members to carry and resist the shear stresses induced by torsional moments are the longitudinal components e g double side shell structures stringers longitudinals and longitudinal girders of the hull girder more importantly in hull girder s torsional collapse process warping effect will be developed which strongly depends on the longitudinal dimension of the hull girder senjanovic and tomasevic 2008 and will have a significant effect on hull girder s ultimate strength it can be observed from fig 8 a that the obtained ultimate torsional strength of the global hull girder is much smaller than that of the compartment hull girder the difference of the obtained ultimate torsional strength between compartment hull girder and global hull girder can reach up to 133 33 see table 3 compared with the compartment hull girder due to warping effect a much larger longitudinal out of plane deformation has happened to the cross sections of the global hull girder see fig 8 b causing a more severe buckling damage at two ends of the global hull girder see fig 8 c this is the main reason for such a large discrepancy of the ultimate torsional strength between compartment hull girder and global hull girder 3 2 experimental examination of the reliability of the elastic perfectly plastic models it is unrealistic to conduct a full scale collapse test of such a large dimension hull girder structure scale models have to be designed to represent the true ship hull girder in ultimate strength experiments reflecting the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of true ship hull girders two 1 25 scale models have been designed and manufactured to represent the mid ship compartment of this 10 000teu ultra large container ship of which two typical cross sections are displayed in fig 9 the detailed design method and manufacture process of the scale models have been specially demonstrated in wang et al 2019a b what should be specially mentioned here is that the geometric similarity and strength similarity between scale models and true ship have been satisfied to have numerically achieved the consistency of the progressive collapse process between scale models and true ship which means that the designed scale models can represent the true mid ship compartment of the 10 000teu ultra large container ship in ultimate strength with these two 1 25 scale hull girders both a pure hogging and a pure torsion collapse experiment of the compartment hull girder were presented as is shown in fig 10 a a four point bending loading scheme was adopted to conduct the hull girder s pure hogging collapse test and for the pure torsion one end of the test model was clamped by a strong reaction frame and the other end was provided with a pair of forces of the same magnitude but opposite in direction to produce a pure torsional moment on the hull girder see fig 10 b more detailed experiment procedures can be referred in wang et al 2019a b for the pure hogging collapse test and in wang et al 2020a b for the pure torsion collapse test due to the convenience and low cost in engineering elastic perfectly plastic material models are widely employed in nonlinear finite element analysis to evaluate hull girder s ultimate strength paik et al 2001 kim and yoo 2008 shi and wang 2012a b tanaka et al 2015 mohammed and benson 2016 cui et al 2017 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2019a b tatsumi and fujikubo 2020 wang et al 2020a b neglecting the hardening effect of materials the assumption that simplifies the steel materials to elastic perfectly plastic materials in hull girder s ultimate strength analysis still needs to be experimentally validated especially for the structures with a complicated configuration e g a container ship hull girder which is also the main purpose of presenting these two hull girder s collapse experiments here in this paper what should be noted here that to the best of the authors knowledge few investigations have been experimentally conducted to make an examination of the accuracy of the elastic perfectly plastic material models employed in hull girder s ultimate strength evaluations based on nfem however this is a very important issue which concerns the reliability of the fem results obtained with the elastic perfectly plastic material models herein combined with both the pure hogging and pure torsion collapse experiments a discussion on the accuracy and reliability of the elastic perfectly plastic material models in hull girder s ultimate strength evaluations based on nfem is conducted which was never made in wang et al 2019 or wang et al 2020 to obtain the properties of the steel materials employed in the physical test hull girder standard specimen tensile tests were conducted as is shown in fig 9 the hull girder in the physical collapse test is fabricated with the plates of different thickness 8 mm 5 mm 4 mm 3 mm correspondingly standard specimens of 8 mm 5 mm 4 mm and 3 mm are respectively made to conduct the tensile tests to obtain the stress strain relationship of the material the dimensions of the standard specimens are shown in fig 11 in specimen tensile tests the original load displacement curves of the standard specimens of different thickness are shown in fig 12 at the very early stage of the tensile loading process due to the slip of jigs it is normally difficult to accurately detect the resultant displacement of the specimens when converting the original load displacement curve into the stress strain relationship the linear elastic stage of the stress strain relationship can be modified with young s modulus it can be observed from fig 12 that the specimens of different thickness show good consistency in the obtained load displacement curves especially for the linear elastic stage and the obtained yielding stress based on these standard specimen tensile tests the load displacement curve of the specimen of 5 mm thickness was chosen to establish the stress strain relationship of the material as is shown in fig 13 the engineering stress strain relationship which was directly obtained in standard specimen tensile tests should be converted into the true stress strain relationship which can be employed in fem analysis the applicability and rationality of the employment of the elastic perfectly plastic models in hull girder s ultimate strength analysis can be examined in two aspects of which one is the progressive collapse process of the hull girder and the other is the hull girder s macroscopic collapse behaviors firstly as is shown in fig 14 before ultimate limit state the numerically obtained progressive collapse process i e load displacement response curve of the hull girder with the elastic perfectly plastic material constitutive model is in very good consistency with that of the hull girder with the true stress strain constitutive model which means that the elastic perfectly plastic material constitutive model can perform very well in predicting hull girder s elastic limit strength and ultimate limit strength after ultimate limit state discrepancies of the progressive collapse process between the hull girder with the elastic perfectly plastic material constitutive model and the one with the true stress strain constitutive model start to emerge which means that the hardening effect of materials mainly affect the post ultimate strength stage of the hull girder structure s collapse process it is not hard to understand this phenomenon the ultimate strength of hull girders is a buckling based failure mechanism at the critical failure point of the hull girder i e hull girder s ultimate limit state hardening effect of the materials in yielding regions may not yet start to effectively work it can also be observed from fig 14 that there exists a difference of the obtained ultimate strength of the hull girder between numerical analysis and experiment on the one hand in the experiment when loading process was very close to hull girder s ultimate strength at that short time period it was quite difficult to make an accurate data collection because the deformations of the hull girder were too large to be accurately measured on the other hand for the numerical models employed in numerical analysis it is impossible to fully rebuild the geometrical imperfections and welding residual stresses which are inevitable during the manufacturing process of the physical test model the ultimate strength of the hull girder can be significantly affected by the manufacturing defects which will cause the difference of the ultimate strength between experimental and numerical results in fact according to khan and zhang 2011 due to the existence of the residual stresses the ultimate strength for stiffened plates can be decreased by 10 13 in addition from the perspective of hull girder s macroscopic collapse behaviors it can be observed from fig 15 a 1 a 3 and fig 16 a 1 a 3 that for both hogging and torsion case at ultimate limit state the numerically obtained hull girder s collapse behaviors based on elastic perfectly plastic material constitutive model have little difference with those based on true stress strain relationship however at post ultimate strength stage similar to the predicted progressive collapse process there exist obvious discrepancies of the numerically obtained collapse behaviors between the hull girder with the elastic perfectly plastic material constitutive model and the one with the true stress strain constitutive model see fig 15 a 2 a 4 and fig 16 a 2 a 4 it should also be specially noted here that the fem results obtained with the elastic perfectly plastic material constitutive model can well predict the final collapse behaviors of the hull girder for both hogging case see fig 15 a 4 and fig 15 b and torsion case see fig 16 a 4 and fig 16 b of which the buckling behaviors have been well reappeared for numerical analysis based on fem the hardening effect of materials does have a significant effect on the post ultimate strength behaviors of the hull girder therefore from the perspective of engineering applications if engineers only focus on the ultimate strength of hull girders not paying attention to hull girder s post ultimate strength behaviors elastic perfectly plastic material constitutive models can perform very well in evaluating hull girder s ultimate strength with nonlinear finite element analysis 4 ultimate strength of the hull girder subjected to combined loads 4 1 combined loading schemes to model hull girder s combined loading conditions of vertical bending and torsion two loading schemes can be adopted the first loading scheme is to respectively apply the desired torsional and bending moment to the hull girder in a sequenced way as is shown in fig 17 two loading steps are established and each loading step is set to be 5s which is long enough to deal with a quasi static problem of such a hull girder structure with explicit dynamic analysis in the first loading step pure torsional moment is incrementally applied to the hull girder until the torsional moment reaches a given level while the bending moment is kept at zero all the time during this loading step see fig 17 a and b then in the second loading step the vertical bending moment is applied by incrementally increasing the vertical bending angle of the loaded end section see fig 17 d and b until the hull girder collapses while the torsional moment is kept as a constant at the given level see fig 17 a it can be observed from fig 17 c that the torsional rotation angle of the loaded end section follows a linear incremental increase in the first loading step and then exhibits a nonlinear growth behavior in the second loading step in the second loading step to maintain a constant torsional moment the torsional rotation angle of the loaded end section will be constantly adjusted to keep the equilibrium with the increasing bending moment this is why the torsional rotation angle of the loaded end section exhibits a nonlinear growth with the incremental increase of the applied bending moment which phenomenon is also a sign of the interactions between internal bending and torsional moment of the hull girder the other loading scheme is to simultaneously and proportionally apply the combined torsional and bending moment to the hull girder to guarantee that the applied torsional and bending moment are kept at a given proportion of the magnitude during the whole loading process moment loads have to be directly applied to the hull girder rather than forced rotational displacement loads based on the experimentally validated simplified scale hull girder models in section 3 2 and taking a single segment hull girder between two adjacent transverse frameworks as an illustrative example three typical proportions of the applied torsional moment and bending moment are chosen to be displayed in fig 18 in which m bending m torsion and m magnitude denote the applied bending moment torsional moment and the magnitude of the combined two moments respectively it can be observed from fig 18 that the applied bending and torsional moment are kept at a given proportion of the magnitude during the whole loading process with the increase of the applied torsional moment the damage of hull girder s side shell structures is severer and severer it should be specially mentioned that the first loading scheme mentioned above is based on a basic assumption that different load components imposed on the hull girder can be freely combined with each other which means that there is no priority of the loading sequences between the bending and torsional moment this is why the torsional and bending moment can be independently and respectively applied in a sequenced way however physically speaking there doesn t exist a sequence between the bending moment and torsional moment imposed on the hull girder therefore the second loading scheme is more physical and easier to understand in the next section the ultimate strength envelope of the global hull girder subjected to combined vertical bending and torsion was obtained based on the second loading scheme which is to simultaneously and proportionally apply the combined torsional and bending moment to the hull girder herein to make an examination of the basic assumption mentioned above and to see if the simultaneous acting of these two moments could be more dangerous compared with maximum bending moment and torsional moment acting separately three loading sequences are numerically tested to make a comparison of the obtained ultimate strength envelopes of the hull girder under different loading sequences see fig 19 t b b t and t b in fig 19 respectively denotes the loading sequence of torsion first then bending to collapse bending first then torsion to collapse and torsion and bending simultaneously applied to collapse it can be observed from the obtained ultimate strength envelopes of the hull girders under these three different loading sequences that the loading sequence between vertical bending and torsion has little effect on the numerically obtained ultimate strength envelope and collapse behaviors of the hull girder subjected to combined vertical bending and torsion which means that for numerical analysis based on fem different load components imposed on the hull girder can be freely combined with each other and the loading sequences of different load components have little effect on the numerically obtained ultimate strength of the hull girder subjected to combined loads and this basic assumption has been widely employed by many researchers in ultimate strength analysis of the hull girder subjected to combined loads paik et al 2001 kim and yoo 2008 tanaka et al 2015 mohammed and benson 2016 wang et al 2018 tatsumi and fujikubo 2020 4 2 ultimate strength envelope of the global hull girder subjected to combined loads the ultimate strength envelopes of the compartment hull girder and the global hull girder subjected to combined vertical bending and torsion are displayed in fig 20 a and b for sagging and hogging case respectively for the compartment hull girder subjected to combined vertical bending and torsion the following eq 6 was numerically and empirically obtained by wang et al 2018 to quantify hull girder s ultimate strength envelope however based on the fem results in this paper eq 7 is developed with the nonlinear curve fitting method to quantify the ultimate strength envelope of the global hull girder subjected to combined vertical bending and torsion it can be observed from fig 20 that there exists a large discrepancy of the ultimate strength envelope between the compartment hull girder and the global hull girder of which the ultimate strength envelope of the global hull girder is much lower than that of the compartment hull girder which means that under combined vertical bending and torsion the safety margin of the global hull girder is much smaller than that of the compartment hull girder due to the weakening effect of the torsional moments on the ultimate bending strength of the hull girder 6 m b m bu 1 42 m t m tu 5 03 1 for sagging case m b m bu 1 56 m t m tu 5 26 1 for hogging case 7 m b m bu 2 01 m t m tu 0 85 1 for sagging case m b m bu 1 76 m t m tu 1 29 1 for hogging case for the global hull girder the warping effect induced by torsion is much severer which can be observed in fig 21 that both ends of the global hull girder have been severely damaged with buckling largely weakening the ultimate bending strength of the global hull girder by torsional moments 5 conclusions in this paper both the compartment hull girder and the global hull girder of an ultra large container ship have been modeled to investigate the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of the container ship s hull girder subjected to pure bending pure torsion and combined loads performing a series of full scale nonlinear large deflection elastoplastic finite element analyses also the elastic perfectly plastic material models established based on nfem are experimentally validated by physical collapse tests of the scale models of a mid ship compartment of the ultra large container ship subjected to pure hogging and pure torsion finally the ultimate strength envelope of the global hull girder of the 10 000teu ultra large container ship subjected to combined vertical bending and torsion is quantitatively obtained based on the obtained results and discussions in this paper the following conclusions can be drawn 1 for pure bending a compartment hull girder can well represent the global hull girder in ultimate strength and collapse behaviors however for torsion due to warping effect the ultimate torsional strength of the global hull girder is much smaller than that of the compartment hull girder the compartment hull girder could largely overestimate the ultimate torsional strength of the global hull girder 2 for numerical analysis based on fem the elastic perfectly plastic material constitutive model can perform very well in predicting hull girder s ultimate strength and collapse behaviors however the hardening effect of materials could have a significant effect on the post ultimate strength behaviors of the hull girder 3 under combined bending and torsion the safety margin of the global hull girder is much smaller than that of the compartment hull girder due to the weakening effect of the torsional moments on the ultimate bending strength of the hull girder it would largely overestimate the safety margin of the global hull girder with a compartment hull girder model 4 eq 7 was developed in this paper to quantify the interactions between ultimate bending strength and ultimate torsional strength of the global hull girder of the 10 000teu ultra large container ship subjected to combined vertical bending and torsion credit authorship contribution
