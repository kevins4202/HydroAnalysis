1395,unplanned pumping of groundwater in the past two decades has caused many regional problems and tensions leading to seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers the main objective of this paper is the use of a multi criteria decision making mcdm approach combining with numerical simulation for reducing seawater intrusion in the tajan coastal aquifer located on the southern seashores of the caspian sea iran taking into account economic social and environmental issues the modflow code was used to simulate the groundwater flow mt3dms and seawat codes were used to simulate the solute transport and seawater intrusion a 10 year period from 2010 to 2020 was simulated for evaluating the current conditions and forecasting the future conditions of the aquifer the results indicated an increase in the extent of seawater intrusion to assess the proposed eleven curative solutions the economic social and environmental criteria such as efficiency of applying of curative solutions in improvement of the aquifer s water level and efficiency of applying of curative solutions on reduction in the extent of the seawater intrusion were weighted using the analytic hierarchy process ahp method the results of the ahp method showed that the criterion of efficiency of applying of curative solutions in improvement of the aquifer s water level with the weight of 0 311 was the most important one three multi criteria decision making methods namely simple additive weighting saw technique for order performance by similarity topsis and vise kriterijumska optimizacija kompromisno resenje vikor were utilized to select the best curative solution the solution of 10 reduction of pumping rate and the construction of gelvard dam in the saw and topsis methods and the solution of 3 reduction of pumping rate and the construction of gelvard dam in the vikor method ranked first combined techniques namely the rank average method borda s method and copeland s method were used to develop a consensus on prioritizing curative solutions for the tajan aquifer the results of these techniques showed that the solution of 10 reduction in pumping rate along with the construction of the gelvard dam was the best the results of simulating this solution demonstrated a 1 91 m improvement in the groundwater level of the aquifer in the modflow code and a 361 5 m recede in seawater intrusion length along the coast in the seawat code keywords groundwater flow seawat code solute transport reduction of groundwater extraction 1 intruduction at present one third of the world s freshwater consumption is dependent on groundwater and during the second half of the 20th century groundwater extractions have increased due to population and economic growth loss of surface water because of pollution easy access and high quality compared to surface water essink 2001 technological advancements in the exploitation of groundwater resources and lack of proper groundwater management have led to an imbalance between aquifer recharge and discharge this has caused a drawdown in groundwater levels and environmental problems especially in coastal aquifers given the high potential for water utilization in the agriculture sector kardan moghaddam et al 2017 movement of saline water toward freshwater aquifers commonly is known as seawater intrusion swi which has been one of the most environmental problems in coastal aquifers caused by changes in coastal hydrology due to over exploitation of groundwater ranjbar and mahjouri 2020 janardhana and khairy 2019 lack of management of groundwater resources in the coastal sector and reduction of aquifer groundwater level is the most important factor in this phenomenon that climate change can accelerate seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers huang and chiu 2018 seawater intrusion will cause the degradation or loss of the groundwater resource hamidi and sabbagh yazdi 2008 hamidi et al 2006 therefore it is crucial to develop curative solutions to control seawater intrusion nowadays these solutions are evaluated using numerical groundwater modeling ebeling et al 2019 considering the diversity in the hydrogeological conditions of aquifers various curative solutions have been evaluated each for a unique area in the previous studies various methods have been proposed to reduce of seawater intrusion include reduction of pumping rates sherif et al 2014 rejani et al 2008 narayan et al 2003 relocation of the pumping wells datta et al 2009 mantoglou and papantoniou 2008 subsurface dam chang et al 2019 ru et al 2001 cutoff walls shen et al 2020 abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017 artificial recharge yang et al 2021 yang et al 2018 hussain et al 2015 vandenbohede et al 2009 shammas 2008 and adr abstraction desalination and recharge methodology javadi et al 2013 abd elhamid and javadi 2011 numerous studies were conducted for modeling and control of saltwater intrusion in iran ghorbanpour landi et al 2019 examined three methods such as reduced groundwater harvesting increased aquifer feeding plans and construction of ground dams in babolrood river plain in order to decide about the factors influencing the increase or decrease of seawater intrusion into the coast janardhana and khairy 2019 used seawat to assessment of the impacts of sea level oscillations and withdrawals from the amol ghaemshahr aquifer northern iran on seawater intrusion ranjbar and mahjouri 2020 proposed a novel stochastic framework for management of aquifers threatened by seawater intrusion in the qom aquifer in central iran considering the uncertainties related to the key parameters of aquifer according to the above mentioned studies the management of coastal aquifers and selecting the best alternative for reducing of seawater intrusion in these areas is an important task in general selecting an appropriate alternative is challenging one due to the involvement of criteria such as technical social economic and environmental in this situation multi criteria decision making mcdm methods can be used to choosing the best alternative among a set of feasible alternatives with respect to the multiple conflicting criteria in the multi criteria analysis there is an evaluation matrix x with m alternatives and n criteria the score of the ith alternative under the jth criterion is represented by xij the importance of each criterion is shown by a one dimensional vector of weights w that includes n weights with am representing the alternatives therefore an mcdm problem is defined as the function si f a w in which si expresses the overall score of the ith alternative garcia cascales and lamata 2012 the mcdm model has one or more decision makers each with a different attitude toward the decision making problem there have been several researches on the application of various mcdm methods in coastal aquifers for example zghibi et al 2020 used two mcdm approaches namely the analytical hierarchy process ahp and the multi influencing factors mif to map groundwater recharge zones gwrzs in the korba unconfined aquifer in northeastern tunisia in another study by kazakis 2018 a multi criteria index named susam developed to delineate suitable zones for managed aquifer recharge mar application in a semi arid mediterranean coastal aquifer also a method for assessing coastal vulnerability to sea level rise and marine floods using ahp method was proposed by sekovski et al 2020 klein and manda 2019 used ahp to stablish weights of groundwater management criteria pourebrahim and mokhtar 2016 used fuzzy topsis and ahp method for conservation priority assessment of the coastal area in malaysia due to the high potential of exploitation in the coastal strip and the severe dependence of the subsistence of exploiters on agriculture in this region the volume of exploitation of groundwater resources has increased this increase in exploitation has also been accompanied by climate stress and lack of management which has led to a decline in groundwater levels in the aquifer especially in the coastal sector the fall of the aquifer caused a change in the hydraulic gradient of the groundwater flow and due to the density of the salt water of the sea caused the influx of saline water from the lower layers of the aquifer into the aquifer in order to reduce the invasion of saline water structural and managerial scenarios need to be developed to reduce this destructive environmental impact on the other hand the development of different treatment scenarios should be in line with the economic social and environmental goals sustainable development of users and managers therefore multi criteria decision models are used in order to consider these criteria and rank the scenarios to select the best scenario the use of mcdm with the aim of sustainable development has not been used to prioritize management and structural scenarios in order to reduce the invasion of seawater 2 methodology to evaluate and predict the extent of seawater intrusion and develop curative solutions the research was performed as shown in fig 1 the simulation of groundwater flow was carried out using the modflow code and the qualitative status of the aquifer was simulated at the surface and depth of the aquifer using the mt3dms and seawat codes finally the curative solutions were prioritized by employing the mcdm approach in the framework of sustainable development 2 1 study area for the present study the tajan aquifer was selected the study domain 35 56 36 42 n 52 43 54 44 e is located in the southern seashores of caspian sea fig 2 the annual rainfall rate for the region averages 664 mm the mean annual evaporation is 1176 4 mm and the mean annual temperature is 20 c the study area covers 6938 5 km2 of which 977 87 km2 lies in the plains and the rest 5877 8 km2 in the highlands its maximum and minimum elevations are 3836 m and 27 m at the basin outlet the water level varies from 35 m south of sari county the aquifer inlet to 25 m near the coast the direction of groundwater flow in the plains is from south to north based on the available data the study area which forms part of the northern strip of iran has a mediterranean climate with warm relatively dry summers and cold humid winters the examination of the geological formations of the region shows that alluvial sediments cover the northern part of the study area which includes the alluvial aquifer limestone structures make up the bulk of the study area which is the main source of groundwater supply through groundwater fronts the eastern and southern parts of the study area include mostly geological formations from the jurassic period and they are one of the sources of surface and groundwater recharge and snow accumulation in the basin study of the water resources exploitation in this aquifer shows that the volume of groundwater exploitation has increased and has caused a decrease in groundwater levels in the northern parts of this region in addition the study of the status of existing wells shows that the unlicensed well drilling especially in the northern part which has been drilled for tourist activities in addition to agricultural purposes has played an important role in the groundwater level decline especially in the coastal strip this unplanned pumping of groundwater has caused a further decline in groundwater level in this coastal part a change in the hydraulic gradient and seawater intrusion one of the most important environmental problems in recent years is the salinity of deep wells in the region and the increase in the concentration of salts in other wells therefore this area has been selected for the study with the aim of reducing seawater intrusion and developing curative scenarios using mcdm methods based on sustainable development criteria 2 2 numerical model 2 2 1 groundwater flow and contaminant transport model selection the computer codes that were used in the study are modflow harbaugh et al 2000 mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 and seawat guo and bennett 1998 the mt3dms uses from modflow code outputs groundwater level the direction of flow lines and velocities of water to solute transport simulation armanyous et al 2016 the seawat code which is a combined version of modflow and mt3dms is used to solve the numerical model for the density dependent groundwater flow and solute transport 2 2 2 governing equations the partial differential equation for three dimensional movement of groundwater flow through the porous medium can be formulated as follows asghar et al 2002 1 x k x h h x y k y h h y z k z h h z w s c h t where kx ky kz are the values of hydraulic conductivity l t in x y z cartesian coordinates l h is the potentiometric head l w is flux per unit volume l3 t s c is specific storage dimensionless and t is time t the partial differential equation for three dimensional transport of contaminants in the groundwater can be expressed as follows asghar et al 2002 2 x i d i c x i x i v i c q s θ c s c t where x i and d i are the distance l and hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient l2 t along the respective cartesian coordinate axis respectively also c is the concentration of dissolved solute in the groundwater ml 3 c s is the concentration of the source or sink flux ml 3 v i is the groundwater flow velocity lt 1 q s is the flow rate per unit volume of sources positive or sinks negative t 1 θ is the porosity dimensionless and t is the time t during the simulation of seawater intrusion using the seawat code it is assumed that the fluid density is only a function of the solute concentration and the effects of changes in pressure and heat on the fluid density are neglected langevin et al 2003 a linear equation of state which converts solute concentration to fluid density is used by the seawat can be written as lin et al 2015 3 ρ ρ f ρ c c where ρ c represents slop of given equation and its corresponding value is entered by the user c salt concentration ml 3 and ρ f is density of freshwater ml 3 2 2 3 simulation of groundwater flow the necessary data for modeling of groundwater flow can be categorized into water resources data meteorological data hydrodynamic characterization and topographic maps moghaddam et al 2019 water resources data include groundwater and surface water resources data the data on head stage bed conductance and bottom elevation for the rivers located in the aquifer tajan nekarud and siahrud are assigned to the model to build the flow model flow type initial conditions groundwater level in september 2010 for the steady state and type of boundary conditions general head boundary flow package lpf package temporal discretization 48 monthly stress periods from september 2010 to august 2014 in transient condition and monthly time steps were assigned to the model 2 2 4 simulation of solute transport in the modeling of groundwater qualitative two general categories of data were used i e hydrological and hydrochemical data of the study area and the observation data the first category included geological physical and chemical parameters of the aquifer such as specific storage specific yield porosity and dispersivity the second category consisted of information on concentrations of total dissolved solids tds in 17 qualitative observation wells that were used in the calibration the tds concentration measured from 17 observation wells in september 2010 was used as the initial condition for the transport model the model area and grid discretization used in this study were the same for both the modflow and mt3dms the initial input data for modflow and mt3dms is presented in table 1 the caspian sea bordering the study area in the north was represented by a constant tds concentration of 13 000 mg l fig 3 shows all the parameters of the simulation models the transport model was simulated in 8 six month stress periods from september 2010 to august 2014 the simulation period was similar to that of the flow model only with a difference in the time period finally validation of the model was carried out in 2 six month stress periods from september 2014 to august 2015 following simulation the solute concentration at the surface of the aquifer was determined using the mt3dms model after ensuring the verifiability of the flow and solute transport model simulation of the density dependent groundwater flow and solute transport was carried out along the coast using the seawat considering the geometry of the aquifer and the occurrence of seawater intrusion along the coast an area with a distance of 1500 m from the coastline was selected for three dimensional seawat simulation in the mt3dms model this area included locations with tds concentrations exceeding 1000 mg l the spatial discretization of the seawat code included finite difference grids with the dimensions of 250 250 m consisting of 808 active cells in 5 layers in this model the southern and northern boundaries of the aquifer were modeled as the general head boundary in the seawat code as in the mt3dms model in the southern boundary of the aquifer bordering on the caspian sea the tds concentration 13 000 mg l which is the tds concentration of seawater was assigned as the outflow boundary fig 4 shows the conceptual model of the flow and solute transport in the seawat model 2 3 development of curative solutions reducing groundwater extraction and compensating for the extracted water by constructing dams to utilize surface water can be a good solution for improving the status of aquifers and preventing the reduction in groundwater reserves therefore in order to quantitative and qualitative management of groundwater resources in tajan aquifer 11 curative solutions were considered in addition to the basic scenario continuation of the current trend in curative solutions 1 5 it was assumed that groundwater extraction would decrease by 1 3 5 7 and 10 respectively in curative solution 6 the effects of the gelvard dam upstream of the aquifer on the neka river were assessed and the effects of the gelvard dam together with 1 3 5 7 and 10 reduction in groundwater extraction were evaluated in curative solutions 7 11 2 4 development of multi criteria decision making taking the sustainable development approach into account the following four main criteria were selected for evaluating and prioritizing the curative solutions in this study c1 socio cultural acceptance and participation of stakeholders social criterion c2 cost of implementation of the curative solutions economic criterion c3 efficiency of applying of curative solutions in the improvement of groundwater level environmental criterion c4 efficiency of applying of curative solutions on reduction in the extent of the seawater intrusion environmental criterion these criteria were evaluated by 40 decision makers the weights of the criteria were then obtained using the ahp method 2 4 1 ahp ahp method proposed by saaty 1980 was used to assess the weight values of criteria based on the experience and judgment of experts by a pairwise comparison matrix the relative importance of criteria is calculated 2 4 2 saw in the saw method an overall rating score for each alternative can be obtained by multiplying the scaled value given to the alternative of that attribute with the weights of relative preferences assigned by decision maker followed by summing of the products for all criteria afshari et al 2010 the process of the saw method is carried out using the following steps ameri et al 2018 1 calculate the normalized decision matrix by eq 4 4 r ij x ij 1 m x ij where rij is the normalized weight of the criterion j m is the number of the criteria and xij is the initial weight 2 determinate the values rij rij min or rij rij max rij xij min for negative attribute and rij rij max for positive attribute 3 calculate the normalized decision matrix for positive and negative attributes as eqs 5 and 6 respectively 5 r ij x ij x ij max 6 r ij x ij min x ij 4 compute the weighted normalized decision matrix by eq 7 7 v ij r ij w j where vij is a weighted normalized decision

a i r ij w j where ai is the final weight of each alternative rij is the score of the ith alternative with respect to the j th criteria and wj is the value of weight for jth criteria using the ahp model 2 4 3 topsis the topsis method bases upon the concepts of ideal and anti ideal solutions and calculates the relative distances of each alternative from ideal and anti ideal solutions radulescu et al 2017 the compromise ranking algorithm of the topsis method is listed below jahanshahloo et al 2006 1 compute the normalized decision matrix as eq 9 9 n ij x ij i 1 m x ij 2 i 1 m j 1 n 2

5 compute the relative closeness to the ideal solution through 15 15 r i d i d i d i i 1 m since d i 0 and d i 0 then clearly r i 0 1 6 rank the alternatives based on the descending order of the value ofr 2 4 4 vikor the vikor technique emphasizes on choosing and ranking of alternative sets and determines compromise solutions to a problem with conflicting criteria so that it is can help decision makers reach a final decision this compromise solution provides a multi criteria ranking index based on closeness to the ideal solution opricovic 1998 the vikor method process can be expressed in the following steps opricovic and tzeng 2004 1 determine the best value f i and the worst value f i of all criteria i 1 2 n if the ith criterion is a benefit then 16 f i m a x f i j j f i m i n f i j j 2

alternatives for a compromise solution by sorting the values of s r and q in descending order the best alternative ranked by q is the one with the minimum value of q 2 4 5 combined techniques in the mcdm problem different methods were used and their assessments are not usually identical therefore the best alternative is not always clear dortaj et al 2020 in this situation methods are applied to combine mcdm methods that are azar and rajabzadeh 2012 1 rank average method in this method the average of rankings using different mcdm methods is the basis of the final choice 2 borda s method in this technique a non empty matrix m m is constructed if the number of wins in the techniques in the row is higher than the techniques in the column it is coded with m and if the number of wins in the column is higher than the row it is coded with x finally the total number of wins in each row is used as the basis for ranking 3 copeland s method the copeland s method computes the number of both wins and losses for each alternative to evaluate the final rank in this method the basis for the ranking is the difference between the number of wins σc and the number of losses σr 3 results 3 1 evaluation of groundwater flow simulation the calibration of the flow model was carried out for both steady and transient conditions by using the trial and error approach monthly groundwater level data from 14 observation wells were used for calibration purposes steady state calibration for the flow model was performed by comparing the observed groundwater levels and calculated values of groundwater levels in september 2010 during calibration hydraulic conductivity values were modified until to groundwater level values simulated by modflow match the observed values within an adequate level of certainty after steady state calibration the transient model was simulated for the 4 year period between september 2010 and august 2014 that was divided into 48 stress periods with a monthly time step the transient model was calibrated by changing the specific yield values the comparison of the observed versus calculated groundwater level at the end of transient calibration is presented in fig 5 at the end of flow model calibration the resulting hydraulic conductivity range from 5 3 to 21 6 m day while the resulting specific yield values from 0 034 to 0 059 the validation flow model was simulated for the period between september 2014 and august 2015 12 stress periods table 3 shows a summary of the flow model calibration and validation results the results demonstrate a good agreement between the observed and calculated groundwater levels 3 2 evaluation of solute transport simulation the solute transport model was calibrated using tds concentration data from september 2010 to august 2014 8 stress periods by adjusting parameters affecting the dispersion process in fig 6 comparison between the calculated tds concentration and observed values is indicated to confirm the correctness of the model tds concentration data from august 2014 to september 2015 was used for validation purposes the results of the calibration and validation transport model are shown in table 2 3 3 prediction of groundwater level fluctuations and seawater intrusion after validation of the model it was possible to investigate the effects of different curative solutions on groundwater level fluctuations and the extent of seawater intrusion since the main purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of curative solutions on groundwater resources of the tajan aquifer it was necessary to use modflow and seawat numerical codes for the prediction period assuming that the current trend in groundwater extraction continued the curative solution was not used and also assuming that the curative solution was used for this purpose a 5 year prediction period was considered at the end of the validation period from september 2015 to august 2020 seawat was carried out based on the effect of the continuation of the current trend in groundwater extraction on the extent of seawater intrusion over the following 5 years at a yearly time step its results were extracted along an arbitrary cross section x x for the tds concentration figs 7 and 8 show the simulated extent of seawater intrusion into the tajan aquifer over time it is clear that with the continuation of the current trend in groundwater extraction we will see further seawater intrusion toward the aquifer at the end of the prediction period in this study the 50 isoconcentration contour tds 6500 mg l was considered as the fresh saline water interface according to figs 7 and 8 this interface will move toward the aquifer about 400 m more than the first year of the prediction period one of the curative solutions for preventing groundwater level drawdown and controlling the propagation of seawater intrusion in the study area is to reduce water extraction from the wells therefore the modflow and seawat codes were carried out when water extraction from the wells was reduced by 1 3 5 7 and 10 the solutions of constructing the gelvard dam alone and of constructing it together with 1 3 5 7 and 10 reduction in water extracted from the wells were then simulated table 3 presents the results of the implementation of curative solutions the results show that the increase in groundwater level will be between 0 09 and 1 91 m on average and the decrease in seawater intrusion length measured as tds concentration contour of 6500 mg l i e 50 of seawater will vary from 235 25 to 361 5 m compared to the end of the prediction period in the model since the selection of the appropriate solution for quantitative and qualitative management of aquifers is influenced by economic social and environmental factors these factors must be taken into account when introducing such solutions therefore using multi criteria decision making techniques the best alternative should be selected considering sustainable development criteria 3 4 mcdm results forty questionnaires were used for weighting the criteria these questionnaires were filled by the participation of experts table 4 presents the importance of each criterion determined based on experts judgment in selecting the best management solution by using the ahp method according to the results the criterion of improvement of the aquifer s water level c3 with a weight of 0 311 was selected as the most important criterion furthermore criteria of reduction in the extent of the seawater intrusion c4 economic c2 and social c1 were ranked the second to fourth respectively table 5 shows the prioritization of the curative solutions based on the weighting of the criteria in this table priorities were calculated based on three methods saw topsis and vikor in the saw method the curative solution a11 was considered the best alternative with a score of 0 118 the curative solutions a10 and a9 with the scores of 0 009 and 0 098 were considered the second and third alternatives respectively according to the results of the topsis method the curative solutions a11 a10 and a9 with the highest relative closeness to the ideal solution 0 645 0 572 and 0 561 were located in the first to third rank respectively moreover the a6 curative solution was located in the last rank with the lowest relative closeness to the ideal solution 0 246 in the vikor method the curative solution a8 with the lowest q value 0 160 was ranked first after prioritizing the defined curative solutions the results were combined using the rank average method borda s method and copeland s method to present a unique response for choosing the best solution in the rank average method the solutions were prioritized based on their average rankings in the three mcdm methods table 6 shows that the curative solutions a11 and a6 with the average ranks of 1 33 and 11 were identified as the first and last priorities respectively in the borda s method the curative solutions were compared based on table 6 and the results were listed in table 7 the three superior alternatives were a11 a10 and a9 in copeland s method the number of wins c and the number of losses r for each curative solution were listed in table 7 the final rank in this method was obtained from the difference between the number of losses and the number of wins for each curative solution in table 8 the results of combined techniques were presented considering the results of the combined techniques and ranking of the solutions in all three methods the rank average method the borda s method and the copeland s method the solution a11 is selected as first ranked curative solution to improve the quantity and quality of the groundwater this solution which includes a 10 reduction in groundwater extraction with the construction of the gelvard dam provides the best situation for the studied aquifer based on the alternatives and criteria considered for it table 9 shows that implementing this solution in the modflow will increase the groundwater level by 1 91 m on average in the entire aquifer at the end of the prediction period compared to the continuation of the current trend in groundwater extraction the highest increase in groundwater level 5 65 m was observed in the observation well no 8 fig 9 presents the trend of groundwater level changes from september 2015 to august 2020 in two sample observation wells after implementing the selected solution a11 the results show that the groundwater level increased in both observation wells and this increase was in good agreement with the seasonal fluctuations in aquifer recharge and discharge so that that the oscillating trend of groundwater level drawdown happened in exactly months 12 24 36 and 48 and at the end of the period according to fig 9 in the long term by providing economic and social contexts and combining several management solutions with improving the aquifer the trend of groundwater resources will be increased taking the implementation of the selected solution in the quantitative model of the aquifer into account qualitative simulation of the aquifer at the seawater intrusion boundary was evaluated figs 10 and 11 the extracted results indicate that the hydraulic gradient between the aquifer and the sea level increased with increases in the groundwater level this increase in hydraulic gradient reduces seawater intrusion as confirmed by the results of the qualitative model based on the results the implementation of this curative solution decreased the seawater intrusion length by 361 5 m compared to the continuation of the current trend in groundwater extraction 4 conclusion the issue of seawater intrusion has become an environmental problem considering the increasing trend in groundwater extraction from coastal aquifers increased groundwater exploitation and lack of management of coastal aquifers have caused seawater intrusion into coastal aquifer the intrusion has led to the salinization of aquifers causing many problems in the exploitation of water resources moreover unplanned development in recent years has made seawater intrusion the source of economic and social conflicts and has turned decision making on coastal aquifers into a challenge for evaluating the status of seawater intrusion in a coastal aquifer in this study numerical simulation of groundwater flow and solute transport was performed using the modflow and mt3dms codes respectively and simulation of seawater intrusion was carried out using the seawat code to determine the extent of seawater intrusion economic social and environmental criteria were used to find the best solution for qualitative and quantitative management of the aquifer considering the flexibility and simplicity of calculations and the possibility of the final ranking of the alternatives the mcdm method was used the ahp method was employed to determine the weights of the criteria the results demonstrated that the criterion of efficiency of applying of curative solutions in the improvement of groundwater level with the weight of 0 311 had the most effect and the social criterion with the weight of 0 17 the least effect on selecting the best solution for quantitative and qualitative management of the aquifer different methods were compared using a multi criteria decision making model by defining eleven curative solutions for the aquifer three methods saw topsis and vikor were used to prioritize the employed solutions and finally the best solution was determined using the three combined techniques of rank average method borda s method and copeland s method based on the results the solution a11 construction of the gelvard dam together with a 10 reduction in groundwater extraction was selected as the best solution the results of simulating this solution showed that its implementation would improve the quantitative status of the aquifer by 1 91 m on average and the highest increase in groundwater level 5 6 m would be observed in observation well number 8 the increasing trend would happen in the entire aquifer also the results of this solution in the seawat code indicated that it would cause seawater intrusion to recede and would also improve the qualitative status of the aquifer along the coast the seawater intrusion length would decrease by 361 5 m there was also a very close relationship between reduction in groundwater extraction and decreases in seawater intrusion length and decision makers have to use the reduction in groundwater extraction or the increase in aquifer recharge solution to manage the coastal aquifer declaration of competing interest the aim of this study was to evaluation of saline seawater invasion strategies this research is based on simulation using modflow mt3d and seawat codes and finally different strategies for reducing seawater invasion by sea have been evaluated using multi criteria decision methods the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
1395,unplanned pumping of groundwater in the past two decades has caused many regional problems and tensions leading to seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers the main objective of this paper is the use of a multi criteria decision making mcdm approach combining with numerical simulation for reducing seawater intrusion in the tajan coastal aquifer located on the southern seashores of the caspian sea iran taking into account economic social and environmental issues the modflow code was used to simulate the groundwater flow mt3dms and seawat codes were used to simulate the solute transport and seawater intrusion a 10 year period from 2010 to 2020 was simulated for evaluating the current conditions and forecasting the future conditions of the aquifer the results indicated an increase in the extent of seawater intrusion to assess the proposed eleven curative solutions the economic social and environmental criteria such as efficiency of applying of curative solutions in improvement of the

the construction of gelvard dam in the vikor method ranked first combined techniques namely the rank average method borda s method and copeland s method were used to develop a consensus on prioritizing curative solutions for the tajan aquifer the results of these techniques showed that the solution of 10 reduction in pumping rate along with the construction of the gelvard dam was the best the results of simulating this solution demonstrated a 1 91 m improvement in the groundwater level of the aquifer in the modflow code and a 361 5 m recede in seawater intrusion length along the coast in the seawat code keywords groundwater flow seawat code solute transport reduction of groundwater extraction 1 intruduction at present one third of the world s freshwater consumption is dependent on groundwater and during the second half of the 20th century groundwater extractions have increased due to population and economic growth loss of surface water because of pollution easy access and high quality compared to surface water essink 2001 technological advancements in the exploitation of groundwater resources and lack of proper groundwater management have led to an imbalance between aquifer recharge and discharge this has caused a drawdown in groundwater levels and environmental problems especially in coastal aquifers given the high potential for water utilization in the agriculture sector kardan moghaddam et al 2017 movement of saline water toward freshwater aquifers commonly is known as seawater intrusion swi which has been one of the most environmental problems in coastal aquifers caused by changes in coastal hydrology due to over exploitation of groundwater ranjbar and mahjouri 2020 janardhana and khairy 2019 lack of management of groundwater resources in the coastal sector and reduction of aquifer groundwater level is the most important factor in this phenomenon that climate change can accelerate seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers huang and chiu 2018 seawater intrusion will cause the degradation or loss of the groundwater resource hamidi and sabbagh yazdi 2008 hamidi et al 2006 therefore it is crucial to develop curative solutions to control seawater intrusion nowadays these solutions are evaluated using numerical groundwater modeling ebeling et al 2019 considering the diversity in the hydrogeological conditions of aquifers various curative solutions have been evaluated each for a unique area in the previous studies various methods have been proposed to reduce of seawater intrusion include reduction of pumping rates sherif et al 2014 rejani et al 2008 narayan et al 2003 relocation of the pumping wells datta et al 2009 mantoglou and papantoniou 2008 subsurface dam chang et al 2019 ru et al 2001 cutoff walls shen et al 2020 abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017 artificial recharge yang et al 2021 yang et al 2018 hussain et al 2015 vandenbohede et al 2009 shammas 2008 and adr abstraction desalination and recharge methodology javadi et al 2013 abd elhamid and javadi 2011 numerous studies were conducted for modeling and control of saltwater intrusion in iran ghorbanpour landi et al 2019 examined three methods such as reduced groundwater harvesting increased aquifer feeding plans and construction of ground dams in babolrood river plain in order to decide about the factors influencing the increase or decrease of seawater intrusion into the coast janardhana and khairy 2019 used seawat to assessment of the impacts of sea level oscillations and withdrawals from the amol ghaemshahr aquifer northern iran on seawater intrusion ranjbar and mahjouri 2020 proposed a novel stochastic framework for management of aquifers threatened by seawater intrusion in the qom aquifer in central iran considering the uncertainties related to the key parameters of aquifer according to the above mentioned studies the management of coastal aquifers and selecting the best alternative for reducing of seawater intrusion in these areas is an important task in general selecting an appropriate alternative is challenging one due to the involvement of criteria such as technical social economic and environmental in this situation multi criteria decision making mcdm methods can be used to choosing the best alternative among a set of feasible alternatives with respect to the multiple conflicting criteria in the multi criteria analysis there is an evaluation matrix x with m alternatives and n criteria the score of the ith alternative under the jth criterion is represented by xij the importance of each criterion is shown by a one dimensional vector of weights w that includes n weights with am representing the alternatives therefore an mcdm problem is defined as the function si f a w in which si expresses the overall score of the ith alternative garcia cascales and lamata 2012 the mcdm model has one or more decision makers each with a different attitude toward the decision making problem there have been several researches on the application of various mcdm methods in coastal aquifers for example zghibi et al 2020 used two mcdm approaches namely the analytical hierarchy process ahp and the multi influencing factors mif to map groundwater recharge zones gwrzs in the korba unconfined aquifer in northeastern tunisia in another study by kazakis 2018 a multi criteria index named susam developed to delineate suitable zones for managed aquifer recharge mar application in a semi arid mediterranean coastal aquifer also a method for assessing coastal vulnerability to sea level rise and marine floods using ahp method was proposed by sekovski et al 2020 klein and manda 2019 used ahp to stablish weights of groundwater management criteria pourebrahim and mokhtar 2016 used fuzzy topsis and ahp method for conservation priority assessment of the coastal area in malaysia due to the high potential of exploitation in the coastal strip and the severe dependence of the subsistence of exploiters on agriculture in this region the volume of exploitation of groundwater resources has increased this increase in exploitation has also been accompanied by climate stress and lack of management which has led to a decline in groundwater levels in the aquifer especially in the coastal sector the fall of the aquifer caused a change in the hydraulic gradient of the groundwater flow and due to the density of the salt water of the sea caused the influx of saline water from the lower layers of the aquifer into the aquifer in order to reduce the invasion of saline water structural and managerial scenarios need to be developed to reduce this destructive environmental impact on the other hand the development of different treatment scenarios should be in line with the economic social and environmental goals sustainable development of users and managers therefore multi criteria decision models are used in order to consider these criteria and rank the scenarios to select the best scenario the use of mcdm with the aim of sustainable development has not been used to prioritize management and structural scenarios in order to reduce the invasion of seawater 2 methodology to evaluate and predict the extent of seawater intrusion and develop curative solutions the research was performed as shown in fig 1 the simulation of groundwater flow was carried out using the modflow code and the qualitative status of the aquifer was simulated at the surface and depth of the aquifer using the mt3dms and seawat codes finally the curative solutions were prioritized by employing the mcdm approach in the framework of sustainable development 2 1 study area for the present study the tajan aquifer was selected the study domain 35 56 36 42 n 52 43 54 44 e is located in the southern seashores of caspian sea fig 2 the annual rainfall rate for the region averages 664 mm the mean annual evaporation is 1176 4 mm and the mean annual temperature is 20 c the study area covers 6938 5 km2 of which 977 87 km2 lies in the plains and the rest 5877 8 km2 in the highlands its maximum and minimum elevations are 3836 m and 27 m at the basin outlet the water level varies from 35 m south of sari county the aquifer inlet to 25 m near the coast the direction of groundwater flow in the plains is from south to north based on the available data the study area which forms part of the northern strip of iran has a mediterranean climate with warm relatively dry summers and cold humid winters the examination of the geological formations of the region shows that alluvial sediments cover the northern part of the study area which includes the alluvial aquifer limestone structures make up the bulk of the study area which is the main source of groundwater supply through groundwater fronts the eastern and southern parts of the study area include mostly geological formations from the jurassic period and they are one of the sources of surface and groundwater recharge and snow accumulation in the basin study of the water resources exploitation in this aquifer shows that the volume of groundwater exploitation has increased and has caused a decrease in groundwater levels in the northern parts of this region in addition the study of the status of existing wells shows that the unlicensed well drilling especially in the northern part which has been drilled for tourist activities in addition to agricultural purposes has played an important role in the groundwater level decline especially in the coastal strip this unplanned pumping of groundwater has caused a further decline in groundwater level in this coastal part a change in the hydraulic gradient and seawater intrusion one of the most important environmental problems in recent years is the salinity of deep wells in the region and the increase in the concentration of salts in other wells therefore this area has been selected for the study with the aim of reducing seawater intrusion and developing curative scenarios using mcdm methods based on sustainable development criteria 2 2 numerical model 2 2 1 groundwater flow and contaminant transport model selection the computer codes that were used in the study are modflow harbaugh et al 2000 mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 and seawat guo and bennett 1998 the mt3dms uses from modflow code outputs groundwater level the direction of flow lines and velocities of water to solute transport simulation armanyous et al 2016 the seawat code which is a combined version of modflow and mt3dms is used to solve the numerical model for the density dependent groundwater flow and solute transport 2 2 2 governing equations the partial differential equation for three dimensional movement of groundwater flow through the porous medium can be formulated as follows asghar et al 2002 1 x k x h h x y k y h h y z k z h h z w s c h t where kx ky kz are the values of hydraulic conductivity l t in x y z cartesian coordinates l h is the potentiometric head l w is flux per unit volume l3 t s c is specific storage dimensionless and t is time t the partial differential equation for three dimensional transport of contaminants in the groundwater can be expressed as follows asghar et al 2002 2 x

concentration of dissolved solute in the groundwater ml 3 c s is the concentration of the source or sink flux ml 3 v i is the groundwater flow velocity lt 1 q s is the flow rate per unit volume of sources positive or sinks negative t 1 θ is the porosity dimensionless and t is the time t during the simulation of seawater intrusion using the seawat code it is assumed that the fluid density is only a function of the solute concentration and the effects of changes in pressure and heat on the fluid density are neglected langevin et al 2003 a linear equation of state which converts solute concentration to fluid density is used by the seawat can be written as lin et al 2015 3 ρ ρ f ρ c c where ρ c represents slop of given equation and its corresponding value is entered by the user c salt concentration ml 3 and ρ f is density of freshwater ml 3 2 2 3 simulation of groundwater flow the necessary data for modeling of groundwater flow can be categorized into water resources data meteorological data hydrodynamic characterization and topographic maps moghaddam et al 2019 water resources data include groundwater and surface water resources data the data on head stage bed conductance and bottom elevation for the rivers located in the aquifer tajan nekarud and siahrud are assigned to the model to build the flow model flow type initial conditions groundwater level in september 2010 for the steady state and type of boundary conditions general head boundary flow package lpf package temporal discretization 48 monthly stress periods from september 2010 to august 2014 in transient condition and monthly time steps were assigned to the model 2 2 4 simulation of solute transport in the modeling of groundwater qualitative two general categories of data were used i e hydrological and hydrochemical data of the study area and the observation data the first category included geological physical and chemical parameters of the aquifer such as specific storage specific yield porosity and dispersivity the second category consisted of information on concentrations of total dissolved solids tds in 17 qualitative observation wells that were used in the calibration the tds concentration measured from 17 observation wells in september 2010 was used as the initial condition for the transport model the model area and grid discretization used in this study were the same for both the modflow and mt3dms the initial input data for modflow and mt3dms is presented in table 1 the caspian sea bordering the study area in the north was represented by a constant tds concentration of 13 000 mg l fig 3 shows all the parameters of the simulation models the transport model was simulated in 8 six month stress periods from september 2010 to august 2014 the simulation period was similar to that of the flow model only with a difference in the time period finally validation of the model was carried out in 2 six month stress periods from september 2014 to august 2015 following simulation the solute concentration at the surface of the aquifer was determined using the mt3dms model after ensuring the verifiability of the flow and solute transport model simulation of the density dependent groundwater flow and solute transport was carried out along the coast using the seawat considering the geometry of the aquifer and the occurrence of seawater intrusion along the coast an area with a distance of 1500 m from the coastline was selected for three dimensional seawat simulation in the mt3dms model this area included locations with tds concentrations exceeding 1000 mg l the spatial discretization of the seawat code included finite difference grids with the dimensions of 250 250 m consisting of 808 active cells in 5 layers in this model the southern and northern boundaries of the aquifer were modeled as the general head boundary in the seawat code as in the mt3dms model in the southern boundary of the aquifer bordering on the caspian sea the tds concentration 13 000 mg l which is the tds concentration of seawater was assigned as the outflow boundary fig 4 shows the conceptual model of the flow and solute transport in the seawat model 2 3 development of curative solutions reducing groundwater extraction and compensating for the extracted water by constructing dams to utilize surface water can be a good solution for improving the status of aquifers and preventing the reduction in groundwater reserves therefore in order to quantitative and qualitative management of groundwater resources in tajan aquifer 11 curative solutions were considered in addition to the basic scenario continuation of the current trend in curative solutions 1 5 it was assumed that groundwater extraction would decrease by 1 3 5 7 and 10 respectively in curative solution 6 the effects of the gelvard dam upstream of the aquifer on the neka river were assessed and the effects of the gelvard dam together with 1 3 5 7 and 10 reduction in groundwater extraction were evaluated in curative solutions 7 11 2 4 development of multi criteria decision making taking the sustainable development approach into account the following four main criteria were selected for evaluating and prioritizing the curative solutions in this study c1 socio cultural acceptance and participation of stakeholders social criterion c2 cost of implementation of the curative solutions economic criterion c3 efficiency of applying of curative solutions in the improvement of groundwater level environmental criterion c4 efficiency of applying of curative solutions on reduction in the extent of the seawater intrusion environmental criterion these criteria were evaluated by 40 decision makers the weights of the criteria were then obtained using the ahp method 2 4 1 ahp ahp method proposed by saaty 1980 was used to assess the weight values of criteria based on the experience and judgment of experts by a pairwise comparison matrix the relative importance of criteria is calculated 2 4 2 saw in the saw method an overall rating score for each alternative can be obtained by multiplying the scaled value given to the alternative of that attribute with the weights of relative preferences assigned by decision maker followed by summing of the products for all criteria afshari et al 2010 the process of the saw method is carried out using the following steps ameri et al 2018 1 calculate the normalized decision matrix by eq 4 4 r ij x ij 1 m x ij where rij is the normalized weight of the criterion j m is the number of the criteria and xij is the initial weight 2

alternatives for a compromise solution by sorting the values of s r and q in descending order the best alternative ranked by q is the one with the minimum value of q 2 4 5 combined techniques in the mcdm problem different methods were used and their assessments are not usually identical therefore the best alternative is not always clear dortaj et al 2020 in this situation methods are applied to combine mcdm methods that are azar and rajabzadeh 2012 1 rank average method in this method the average of rankings using different mcdm methods is the basis of the final choice 2 borda s method in this technique a non empty matrix m m is constructed if the number of wins in the techniques in the row is higher than the techniques in the column it is coded with m and if the number of wins in the column is higher than the row it is coded with x finally the total number of wins in each row is used as the basis for ranking 3 copeland s method the copeland s method computes the number of both wins and losses for each alternative to evaluate the final rank in this method the basis for the ranking is the difference between the number of wins σc and the number of losses σr 3 results 3 1 evaluation of groundwater flow simulation the calibration of the flow model was carried out for both steady and transient conditions by using the trial and error approach monthly groundwater level data from 14 observation wells were used for calibration purposes steady state calibration for the flow model was performed by comparing the observed groundwater levels and calculated values of groundwater levels in september 2010 during calibration hydraulic conductivity values were modified until to groundwater level values simulated by modflow match the observed values within an adequate level of certainty after steady state calibration the transient model was simulated for the 4 year period between september 2010 and august 2014 that was divided into 48 stress periods with a monthly time step the transient model was calibrated by changing the specific yield values the comparison of the observed versus calculated groundwater level at the end of transient calibration is presented in fig 5 at the end of flow model calibration the resulting hydraulic conductivity range from 5 3 to 21 6 m day while the resulting specific yield values from 0 034 to 0 059 the validation flow model was simulated for the period between september 2014 and august 2015 12 stress periods table 3 shows a summary of the flow model calibration and validation results the results demonstrate a good agreement between the observed and calculated groundwater levels 3 2 evaluation of solute transport simulation the solute transport model was calibrated using tds concentration data from september 2010 to august 2014 8 stress periods by adjusting parameters affecting the dispersion process in fig 6 comparison between the calculated tds concentration and observed values is indicated to confirm the correctness of the model tds concentration data from august 2014 to september 2015 was used for validation purposes the results of the calibration and validation transport model are shown in table 2 3 3 prediction of groundwater level fluctuations and seawater intrusion after validation of the model it was possible to investigate the effects of different curative solutions on groundwater level fluctuations and the extent of seawater intrusion since the main purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of curative solutions on groundwater resources of the tajan aquifer it was necessary to use modflow and seawat numerical codes for the prediction period assuming that the current trend in groundwater extraction continued the curative solution was not used and also assuming that the curative solution was used for this purpose a 5 year prediction period was considered at the end of the validation period from september 2015 to august 2020 seawat was carried out based on the effect of the continuation of the current trend in groundwater extraction on the extent of seawater intrusion over the following 5 years at a yearly time step its results were extracted along an arbitrary cross section x x for the tds concentration figs 7 and 8 show the simulated extent of seawater intrusion into the tajan aquifer over time it is clear that with the continuation of the current trend in groundwater extraction we will see further seawater intrusion toward the aquifer at the end of the prediction period in this study the 50 isoconcentration contour tds 6500 mg l was considered as the fresh saline water interface according to figs 7 and 8 this interface will move toward the aquifer about 400 m more than the first year of the prediction period one of the curative solutions for preventing groundwater level drawdown and controlling the propagation of seawater intrusion in the study area is to reduce water extraction from the wells therefore the modflow and seawat codes were carried out when water extraction from the wells was reduced by 1 3 5 7 and 10 the solutions of constructing the gelvard dam alone and of constructing it together with 1 3 5 7 and 10 reduction in water extracted from the wells were then simulated table 3 presents the results of the implementation of curative solutions the results show that the increase in groundwater level will be between 0 09 and 1 91 m on average and the decrease in seawater intrusion length measured as tds concentration contour of 6500 mg l i e 50 of seawater will vary from 235 25 to 361 5 m compared to the end of the prediction period in the model since the selection of the appropriate solution for quantitative and qualitative management of aquifers is influenced by economic social and environmental factors these factors must be taken into account when introducing such solutions therefore using multi criteria decision making techniques the best alternative should be selected considering sustainable development criteria 3 4 mcdm results forty questionnaires were used for weighting the criteria these questionnaires were filled by the participation of experts table 4 presents the importance of each criterion determined based on experts judgment in selecting the best management solution by using the ahp method according to the results the criterion of improvement of the aquifer s water level c3 with a weight of 0 311 was selected as the most important criterion furthermore criteria of reduction in the extent of the seawater intrusion c4 economic c2 and social c1 were ranked the second to fourth respectively table 5 shows the prioritization of the curative solutions based on the weighting of the criteria in this table priorities were calculated based on three methods saw topsis and vikor in the saw method the curative solution a11 was considered the best alternative with a score of 0 118 the curative solutions a10 and a9 with the scores of 0 009 and 0 098 were considered the second and third alternatives respectively according to the results of the topsis method the curative solutions a11 a10 and a9 with the highest relative closeness to the ideal solution 0 645 0 572 and 0 561 were located in the first to third rank respectively moreover the a6 curative solution was located in the last rank with the lowest relative closeness to the ideal solution 0 246 in the vikor method the curative solution a8 with the lowest q value 0 160 was ranked first after prioritizing the defined curative solutions the results were combined using the rank average method borda s method and copeland s method to present a unique response for choosing the best solution in the rank average method the solutions were prioritized based on their average rankings in the three mcdm methods table 6 shows that the curative solutions a11 and a6 with the average ranks of 1 33 and 11 were identified as the first and last priorities respectively in the borda s method the curative solutions were compared based on table 6 and the results were listed in table 7 the three superior alternatives were a11 a10 and a9 in copeland s method the number of wins c and the number of losses r for each curative solution were listed in table 7 the final rank in this method was obtained from the difference between the number of losses and the number of wins for each curative solution in table 8 the results of combined techniques were presented considering the results of the combined techniques and ranking of the solutions in all three methods the rank average method the borda s method and the copeland s method the solution a11 is selected as first ranked curative solution to improve the quantity and quality of the groundwater this solution which includes a 10 reduction in groundwater extraction with the construction of the gelvard dam provides the best situation for the studied aquifer based on the alternatives and criteria considered for it table 9 shows that implementing this solution in the modflow will increase the groundwater level by 1 91 m on average in the entire aquifer at the end of the prediction period compared to the continuation of the current trend in groundwater extraction the highest increase in groundwater level 5 65 m was observed in the observation well no 8 fig 9 presents the trend of groundwater level changes from september 2015 to august 2020 in two sample observation wells after implementing the selected solution a11 the results show that the groundwater level increased in both observation wells and this increase was in good agreement with the seasonal fluctuations in aquifer recharge and discharge so that that the oscillating trend of groundwater level drawdown happened in exactly months 12 24 36 and 48 and at the end of the period according to fig 9 in the long term by providing economic and social contexts and combining several management solutions with improving the aquifer the trend of groundwater resources will be increased taking the implementation of the selected solution in the quantitative model of the aquifer into account qualitative simulation of the aquifer at the seawater intrusion boundary was evaluated figs 10 and 11 the extracted results indicate that the hydraulic gradient between the aquifer and the sea level increased with increases in the groundwater level this increase in hydraulic gradient reduces seawater intrusion as confirmed by the results of the qualitative model based on the results the implementation of this curative solution decreased the seawater intrusion length by 361 5 m compared to the continuation of the current trend in groundwater extraction 4 conclusion the issue of seawater intrusion has become an environmental problem considering the increasing trend in groundwater extraction from coastal aquifers increased groundwater exploitation and lack of management of coastal aquifers have caused seawater intrusion into coastal aquifer the intrusion has led to the salinization of aquifers causing many problems in the exploitation of water resources moreover unplanned development in recent years has made seawater intrusion the source of economic and social conflicts and has turned decision making on coastal aquifers into a challenge for evaluating the status of seawater intrusion in a coastal aquifer in this study numerical simulation of groundwater flow and solute transport was performed using the modflow and mt3dms codes respectively and simulation of seawater intrusion was carried out using the seawat code to determine the extent of seawater intrusion economic social and environmental criteria were used to find the best solution for qualitative and quantitative management of the aquifer considering the flexibility and simplicity of calculations and the possibility of the final ranking of the alternatives the mcdm method was used the ahp method was employed to determine the weights of the criteria the results demonstrated that the criterion of efficiency of applying of curative solutions in the improvement of groundwater level with the weight of 0 311 had the most effect and the social criterion with the weight of 0 17 the least effect on selecting the best solution for quantitative and qualitative management of the aquifer different methods were compared using a multi criteria decision making model by defining eleven curative solutions for the aquifer three methods saw topsis and vikor were used to prioritize the employed solutions and finally the best solution was determined using the three combined techniques of rank average method borda s method and copeland s method based on the results the solution a11 construction of the gelvard dam together with a 10 reduction in groundwater extraction was selected as the best solution the results of simulating this solution showed that its implementation would improve the quantitative status of the aquifer by 1 91 m on average and the highest increase in groundwater level 5 6 m would be observed in observation well number 8 the increasing trend would happen in the entire aquifer also the results of this solution in the seawat code indicated that it would cause seawater intrusion to recede and would also improve the qualitative status of the aquifer along the coast the seawater intrusion length would decrease by 361 5 m there was also a very close relationship between reduction in groundwater extraction and decreases in seawater intrusion length and decision makers have to use the reduction in groundwater extraction or the increase in aquifer recharge solution to manage the coastal aquifer declaration of competing interest the aim of this study was to evaluation of saline seawater invasion strategies this research is based on simulation using modflow mt3d and seawat codes and finally different strategies for reducing seawater invasion by sea have been evaluated using multi criteria decision methods the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
1396,hexavalent chromium cr vi in groundwater impose serious health problems for human society this study investigates the potential of using calcium ca bentonite amended with sodium hexametaphosphate shmp as a backfill constituent material in the soil bentonite slurry trench wall to envelop the cr vi impacted groundwater the hydraulic conductivity k and consolidation of backfill comprising of 80 wt sand and 20 wt shmp amended ca bentonite were determined via flexible wall permeameter tests and oedometer tests respectively microstructure characterizations of the amended bentonites before and after contamination were also explored the results indicated that when the permeated liquid changed from tap water to cr vi solution the tested specimens exhibited a 1 0 to 1 2 fold variation in short term k with all k values fall in range of 2 1 10 10 to 2 5 10 10 m s this mild variation may be attributed to terminate the tests without achieving chemical equilibrium on the other hand the cr vi solution had insignificant effect on consolidation of the amended backfill which is attributed to the dominated incompressible sand matrix skeleton in the backfill that withstood the consolidation pressure and shield the negative effects of the contaminated solution the microstructure images revealed that the cr vi resulted in relatively strong interlink between particles overall the shmp

soils during construction and post construction conditions evans 1994 evans et al 1995 sodium bentonite na bentonite is preferred in sb walls due to its excellent swelling capacity in water and

available as a source material for sb wall construction u s epa 1984 koch 2002 du et al 2015a 2015b 2015c ca bentonite exhibits a thinner diffuse double layer and lower swelling ability compared to na bentonite that can lead to unsatisfactory performance in the slurry and high hydraulic conductivity in backfill gleason et al 1997 yang et al 2017a 2017b 2018a therefore appropriate modification of locally available ca bentonite is required to enhance workability and containment performance polymer amended ca bentonites with or without sodium activation have gained attention for use in the containment barrier design such as geosynthetic clay liners gcls to improve its containment performance razakamanantsoa et al 2012 di emidio and verastegui flores 2013 di emidio et al 2014 sato et al 2017 fan 2018 and shen and wei 2018 investigated hydraulic conductivity of the sb backfills containing polymer amended sodium activated ca bentonite the polymers used in these studies included sodium carboxymethylcellulose polyelectrolyte polymers and a polyanionic cellulose moreover other additives such as loess are used as a sorption agent to improve attenuation capacity of the sb backfill for heavy metals wang et al 2016 recently the authors have found that sodium hexametaphosphate shmp a non toxic phosphate dispersant is effective in improving the ca bentonite slurry and sand ca bentonite backfill in sb wall applications du et al 2015c yang et al 2017a 2017b 2018a 2018b 2019 the hydraulic conductivity and consolidation characteristics of the sb backfill containing shmp amended ca bentonite have been investigated using tap water coal combustion residual impacted groundwater and pb solution as permeants and these results demonstrated that shmp amendment is effective for maintaining the low hydraulic conductivity of shmp amended sb backfills yang et al 2018a 2018b 2020 however performance of sb backfills composed of shmp amended ca bentonite and sandy soil to cr vi contamination has not been addressed this study investigates for the first time the influence of cr vi on the hydraulic conductivity and consolidation of the sb backfill containing shmp amended ca bentonite laboratory hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted using tap water and cr vi contaminated solution as permeants in oedometer consolidation tests the specimens were prepared using either tap water or cr vi contaminated solution the microstructures of the amended bentonite before and after contamination were explored by scanning electron microscopy sem the results of this investigation are invaluable in assessing the application of soil shmp amended ca bentonite slurry trench walls for containing cr vi contaminated groundwater all the tests were conducted for this study were conducted by the first author in the geotechnical and geoenvironmental engineering laboratory at the university of illinois at chicago 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the fine mortar sand named three river sand powdered ca bentonite cab with trade name of panther creek 200 yang et al 2017a 2017b and the crystalline shmp provided by the humboldt manufacturing company elgin il usa were used in this study the sand was classified as a poorly graded sand sp with d 60 of 0 39 mm d 30 of 0 25 mm d 10 of 0 16 mm and coefficient uniformity c u and coefficient of curvature c c values of 2 44 and 1 00 respectively yang et al 2018b the calcium bentonite possessed 99 7 and 90 particles passing the 0 25 mm and the 0 075 mm sieves respectively and was classified as high plasticity silt mh with a liquid limit of 103 and a plasticity index of 55 as described by yang et al 2018b the shmp amended ca bentonite shmp cab was prepared in laboratory and the optimum shmp content of 2 dry weight ratio of shmp to cab was used for the shmp cab yang et al 2017a 2017b 2018a 2018b first the cab was mixed with shmp solution to form a moist mixture which was allowed to cure for 24 h at 20 c room temperature the optimum shmp content was ensured by employing the shmp solution with a shmp concentration of 10 g l and the moist bentonite and shmp solution mixture with a solid to liquid ratio of 1 g 2 ml after curing the moist bentonite and shmp solution mixture was oven dried for 24 h under 105 c milled using pestle and mortar and screened through no 200 0 075 mm standard sieve the contaminated solution used in this study was 1000 mg l 19 mm cr vi solution prepared by dissolving predetermined mass of k2cr2o7 in deionized water tap water was also used in this study for comparison purpose properties of the tested liquids are summarized in table 1 2 2 preparation of backfills the clean backfill was composed of sand dry shmp cab and shmp cab slurry first the powdered shmp cab and the tap water were mixed thoroughly using a high speed blender to create a slurry with bentonite content of 20 as recommended by yang et al 2017a 2017b following the american petroleum institute api recommended specification 13b 1 api 2003 marsh viscosity filtrate loss volume and density of the slurry were determined to be 39 s 22 6 ml and 1 15 g cm3 using a model 201 marsh funnel viscometer a series 300 api filter press and a model 140 mud balance all from fann instrument company houston texas respectively the ph of the slurry was measured to be 6 8 using a model 720a ph meter cole parmer instrument company vernon hills il these properties satisfied the desired slurry rheological properties for preparing sb backfills u s epa 1984 evans 1993 malusis et al 2010 then a mixture of sand and dry shmp cab at a dry weight ratio of 8 2 was prepared and its moisture content was adjusted using the prepared bentonite slurry until a slump height of 125 mm astm 2012 was satisfied as per typical slump requirements for the sb backfill evans 1993 malusis and mckeehan 2013 bohnhoff and shackelford 2014 to ensure a total bentonite content of 20 in the final backfill predetermined mass of additional sand was added along with the bentonite slurry during the slump test and the moisture content of the resultant backfill was measured to be 30 this resultant backfill containing 20 shmp amended ca bentonite is denoted by shmp 20cab in the following sections to compare with the clean backfill a contaminated backfill was prepared specifically for the consolidation test using the following procedures first dry sand and pre prepared shmp cab at a dry weight ratio of 8 2 were blended with cr vi solution to achieve a moisture content of 30 corresponding to the target slump of 125 mm of the clean backfill the moist backfill was then sealed in vinyl bags and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature 20 c for 15 days as recommended by fan et al 2016 the weight of the backfill plus the vinyl bag was measured at the beginning and end of the equilibration and the evaporation loss was compensated by adding extra amount of distilled water 2 3 hydraulic conductivity tests hydraulic conductivity experiments were performed on duplicate with sample designations shmp 20cab 1 and shmp 20cab 2 using flexible wall permeameters in accordance with the method c falling headwater and rising tailwater method stipulated in astm d5084 astm 2010 schematic diagram of the hydraulic conductivity test apparatus is shown in fig 1 specially it contained two bladder accumulators between the flow burette system and the permeameter cell astm 2011b preventing the cr vi solution from polluting the inflow outflow reservoirs the inflow and outflow volumes q in and q out were measured from the inflow and outflow burettes considering the high slump characteristic of the backfill i e 125 mm a fabricated acrylic cylinder see fig 1 was employed to provide a lateral support and to transfer the cell pressure for each specimen malusis et al 2009 yang et al 2017b 2018b each specimen was saturated by back pressure method astm 2010 using de aired tap water under an effective confining stress of 34 5 kpa during this stage the cell pressure bottom i e inflow and top i e outflow pressures of the specimen were gradually increased from 34 5 kpa 0 kpa and 0 kpa to 310 5 kpa 276 0 kpa and 276 0 kpa respectively and the pore water pressure was monitored via a pressure sensor the specimen was considered saturated when the pore water pressure coefficient i e ratio of the increment in pore water pressure to the increment in confining pressure reaches 0 95 the permeation process was initiated by simultaneous increase in the cell pressure and bottom pressure to 319 5 kpa and 293 9 kpa while maintaining the top pressure as 276 0 kpa therefore an average effective confining stress of 34 5 kpa and an upward hydraulic gradient of about 26 were ensured during the permeation all specimens were first permeated using tap water to obtain a baseline hydraulic conductivity k w the testing was continued until the following termination criteria achieved astm 2010 1 the ratio of outflow to inflow volumes q in q out was in the range of 0 75 and 1 25 2 at least four consecutive k w values fell within 25 of their mean value and 3 the k w versus time curve showed insignificant upward or downward trend to determine hydraulic conductivity of the backfill specimens with cr vi solution k c the permeant liquid of each specimen was changed from tap water to cr vi solution and the tests were continued at each interval of about 20 days the effluent sample was collected from the bladder accumulator at the outflow end and ph ec and contaminant concentration of the resultant effluent samples were tested for each specimen the tap water permeation testing stage duration was 58 days and the cr vi solutions permeation stage duration was for 40 days 2 4 consolidation tests backfill specimens prepared with tap water clean backfill and cr vi solution contaminated backfill were used for one dimensional consolidation tests in accordance with astm d2435 astm 2011a each backfill was placed in a stainless steel oedometer ring with a diameter of 6 3 cm and a height of 2 5 cm the saturation of specimen was realized by soaking each specimen along with the ring in de aired tap water for 3 days with upper and lower openings of the ring covered with respective filter paper and porous stone the saturated specimen was then assembled in the oedometer cell immersed by adding additional de aired tap water into the cell and loaded with a 1 3 kpa seating load for 24 h consolidation of the specimen was trigged immediately by applying incremental loading sequence that began at 24 kpa and doubled after each stage lasted for 24 h up to a maximum applied stress of 1 532 kpa the specimen was then unloaded in a stepwise fashion by reducing the loading with a factor of four relative to the previous loading void ratio at each loading level was calculated based on size dry mass and specific gravity of the specimen and density of the pore water as per astm d2435 astm 2011a it should be noted that the specimen specific gravity of the backfill 2 68 and pore water density 1 g cm3 were assumed unchanged in different tested solutions 2 5 scanning electron microscopy sem tests variation in microstructure of the shmp amended cab before and after cr vi contamination was investigated by conducting sem analysis the specimens were prepared by placing 2 g of shmp cab and 20 ml of either distilled water or cr vi solution in a 50 ml plastic centrifuge tube the centrifuge tube with sample were sealed shaken for 24 h using an overhead shaker and allowed to settle undisturbed for 80 days yang et al 2018a the supernatant within the tube was then carefully extracted and discarded and the remaining sediment was subsequently treated with the freeze dry method that was commonly employed for sem specimen preparation du et al 2014 fan et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 2020 liquid nitrogen was used first to quickly freeze the sediment after which the sediment was placed in a vacuum freeze drying system and the frozen water was sublimated under a temperature of 80 c the resultant freeze dried sediment was plated with a thin gold layer and then subjected to sem tests using a scanning electron microscope leo 1530 vp leo germany 3 results and analysis 3 1 short term hydraulic conductivity equilibrium status of the inflow volume q in and outflow volume q out during flexible wall hydraulic conductivity tests are presented in figs 2 to 3 in which the replicate specimens are denoted as shmp 20cab 1 and shmp 20cab 2 fig 2 shows the variation of measured volumetric flow ratio q out q in with increasing pore volumes of flow it is seen in fig 2 that q out q in values of all the backfill specimens fall between 0 75 and 1 25 during the permeation of tap water and cr vi solutions satisfying the hydraulic equilibrium condition of astm d5084 astm 2010 however ph ec and metal concentration of the inflow and outflow liquids did not reach chemical equilibrium condition at the end of testing as shown in fig 3 therefore the measured hydraulic conductivities using the contaminant solutions are valid for the short term conditions i e without reaching chemical equilibrium conditions additional tests are warranted for assessing the long term hydraulic conductivity after reaching chemical equilibrium conditions fig 4 shows results of the short term hydraulic conductivity versus pore volumes of flow pvf tested with tap water and cr vi solutions the term pvf is defined as ratio of cumulative volume of the effluent liquid to the total volume of voids in the tested specimen astm 2011b for the two permeating liquids all the tested specimens possess short term hydraulic conductivity lower than 10 9 m s which is a commonly targeted limit for sb slurry trench cutoff walls the duplicate specimens shmp 20cab 1 and shmp 20cab 2 show very close short term hydraulic conductivity values under the testing condition of this study with insignificant variation is seen in the log k pvf plot as the permeant liquid changed from tap water to cr vi solution short term hydraulic conductivity of the duplicate specimens varied from 2 1 10 10 m s and 2 1 10 10 m s k w to 2 1 10 10 m s and 2 5 10 10 m s k c respectively see fig 4 these short term hydraulic conductivities are calculated as the average value of the last four consecutive data points under a given permeating liquid for each specimen as compared to the tap water the cr vi solution caused insignificant change in short term hydraulic conductivity in the shmp 20cab 1 and an increase of 20 in short term hydraulic conductivity of the shmp 20cab 2 as a result the k c k w values of the shmp 20cab 1 and shmp 20cab 2 are respectively 1 0 and 1 2 in the cr vi solution in general the cr vi solution resulted in short term hydraulic conductivity variation of 0 to 20 for the tested specimens this variation in short term hydraulic conductivity falls within the maximum measuring error of 25 as per astm d5084 and astm d7100 astm 2011b for specimen with k 1 10 10 m s therefore the cr vi solution is considered to induce an insignificant change or slight increase in the short term hydraulic conductivity of the tested specimens at the end of test duration 3 2 consolidation characteristics fig 5 shows the void ratio e effective consolidation stress σ curves of the tested specimens on a semi logarithm scale the e log σ curves exhibit an inverse s shape pattern with a remolded yield stress of approximately 48 kpa as per definition of previous studies hong et al 2012 du et al 2015a such an inverse s shape curve agrees with those reported in previous studies dealing with consolidation of bentonite or backfills possessing bentonite content higher than 8 sreedharan and puvvadi 2013 fan 2018 at the same effective stress level the e value of the backfill prepared with tap water is slightly higher than that prepared using the cr vi solution this is consistent with the sequential order of initial moisture content of tested specimens for example the measured initial moisture content is in the order of shmp 20cab tap water 33 1 shmp 20cab cr vi 30 6 the compression index c c and swell index c s are determined respectively from slopes of the loading and unloading segments of the e log σ curves as shown in fig 5 a c c value of 0 18 and 0 17 is found for the shmp 20cab tap water backfill and the shmp 20cab cr vi backfill respectively similarly the c s value for both shmp 20cab tap water backfill and shmp 20cab cr vi backfill is found to be 0 017 the c c and c s results indicate insignificant influence of the cr vi solutions on compressibility and swelling of the tested backfills this phenomenon seems inconsistent with common knowledge that multivalent cations cause shrinkage in the diffused double layer of bentonite and variable compressibility of the bentonite materials as a consequence du et al 2015a fan et al 2017 the reasons for this finding will be discussed in the following section 4 discussion the results obtained from this study indicate that the cr vi solution yield negligible influence on the short term hydraulic conductivity and consolidation characteristics of the shmp 20cab backfill although the cr vi solution induces a 1 0 to 1 2 times increase in short term hydraulic conductivity of the tested backfill as compared to the tap water permeation condition there are two reasons responsible for a slight increase in hydraulic conductivity of the tested specimen to the cr vi solution in this study 1 cr vi in pore water is presented primarily as an anionic complex such as cro 4 2 and cr 2 o 7 2 devulapalli and reddy 1996 which adsorb less on the bentonite particles and presents little affinity to the shmp therefore its electrolyte property results in slight compression of diffused double layer of the bentonite particles 2 due to smaller hydrated ionic radius of the potassium ion k than the sodium ion na i e 0 3 nm versus 0 45 nm domenico and schwartz 1998 cation exchange between the k in the pore water introduced by k2cr2o7 and the na on the bentonite particle derived from the shmp also generate shrinkage in the diffused double layer of bentonite jo et al 2001 as a result slight increase in hydraulic conductivity observed with the cr vi solution as compared to the tap water permeation scenario it is observed in fig 4 that the variation of log k for tap water is larger than that for the cr vi solution to analyze the standard deviation sd range the k values versus pvf plotted on a regular scale see fig 6 the sd for the cr vi permeation period is found respectively 49 and 24 lower than that permeated with tap water for the two samples this significant variation on k testing with tap water is resulted from the action of re filling the inflow burette less frequently 2 to 3 days during the tests which yielded transient hydraulic gradient therefore influenced the stability of the k value in contrast during the cr vi permeation period the inflow burette was filled every day hence the hydraulic gradient was relatively stable yielding relatively stable k value based on the consolidation test result fig 5 the negligible influence of cr vi solution on consolidation properties of the backfill may be attributed to reason that 80 of the backfill consisted of sand matrix which forms a skeleton to bear the loading pressure the dominance of the less compressible sand then shields the adverse effects of the cr vi solution on the diffuse double layer of the bentonite the sem images fig 7 provide insight into microstructure variation of the amended bentonite immersed in different solutions deionized water and cr vi solution it is found that deionized water and cr vi solution exposure conditions induce similar microstructure of shmp cab with homogeneous surface and loosely connected particles as observed in fig 7 this similar microstructure agrees well with results of insignificant difference in hydraulic conductivity and consolidation properties of the shmp 20cab backfill permeated or prepared with deionized water and cr vi solution see figs 4 and 5 three important interactions between shmp and the calcium bentonite occur as reported by yang et al 2018a 1 substitution of ca2 on the bentonite particles by na provided by the shmp 2 forming a steric stabilization layer on the bentonite particles by sorption of the hexametaphosphate anion hmp and 3 increasing negative surface charge density due to sorption of the multivalent anion hmp combination of these three mechanisms results in an expanded diffuse double layer of the bentonite and a less chemical sensitivity of the clay system in contrast the polymers amended bentonites are reported to induce different mechanisms di emidio 2010 1 intercalation of the polymer chains into the clay sheets 2 blocking of the flow channel by hydrophilic and gel forming polymer and 3 polymer compounds surrounding the bentonite particle avoid ion exchange between the bentonite and the pore solution as compared to the polymer amendment shmp amendment is advantageous 1 low shmp dosage is required i e 2 shmp dosage used in this study as compared to 2 to 25 polymer dosage used in previous research studies di emidio 2010 malusis and mckeehan 2013 bohnhoff and shackelford 2014 fan 2018 shen and wei 2018 2 the shmp amendment procedure is much more easier than that followed for the polymer amendment that requires a polymerized process and 3 low risk of shmp amendment elution from the specimen as compared to high potential for polymer elution as demonstrated in previous research studies scalia et al 2014 the authors have investigated the un amended backfill containing raw calcium bentonite and found that it possesses unacceptably high hydraulic conductivity yang et al 2017b for example the un amended backfill composed of sand and 15 to 25 raw calcium bentonite was found to possess hydraulic conductivity ranging from 2 8 10 9 to 1 4 10 8 m s using tap water as permeant and the same hydraulic gradient conditions as used in this study specifically the backfill containing 20 calcium bentonite had hydraulic conductivity of 7 6 10 9 m s which exceeds commonly targeted upper limit of 1 0 10 9 m s for slurry walls depending on solute concentration of the electrolyte solution hydraulic conductivity of sb backfill could slightly to moderately increase as compared to tap water permeation scenario gleason et al 1997 thus exposure to cr vi solution is considered to maintain or increase hydraulic conductivity of the un amended backfill relative to tap water permeation condition further deviating from the targeted hydraulic conductivity value required for vertical barrier application therefore the un amended backfill is considered unsuitable for slurry wall construction and not included in the testing program it should be mentioned that the flexible wall permeability experiments were terminated in this study were terminated before reaching all of the chemical equilibrium requirements setforth in astm d7100 therefore additional testing with longer test duration until reaching the chemical equilibrium conditions is warranted to evaluate the long term hydraulic conductivity response of the sb backfill containing shmp amended cab when exposed to cr vi contaminated groundwater future studies could also involve control tests with un amended backfill and tests using other types of contaminant solutions as permeants to systematically explore compatibility and contaminant performance of the backfills made of shmp cab 5 conclusions for the first time this study presented the results of hydraulic conductivity tests and consolidation experiments conducted to evaluate the potential for using shmp amended ca bentonite in a soil bentonite slurry trench wall for containing cr vi impacted groundwater the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the short term hydraulic conductivity k tests revealed that 1000 mg l cr vi solution exhibited slight increase in k of the shmp amended backfill the slightly increased k with the cr vi solution was attributed to electrolyte characteristics as well as smaller ionic radius in k of the cr vi solution than the na from the bentonite thus leading to compression of diffuse double layer of the bentonite additional tests with longer testing duration is necessary in future research for evaluating chemical compatibility of the backfill containing shmp amended ca bentonite for cr vi containment 2 based on the results derived from consolidation experiments the shmp backfills prepared with either tap water or cr vi solution presented an inverse s shape void ratio effective consolidation stress curve the cr vi solution had insignificant effect on consolidation characteristics including compression and swell indices of the amended backfill this may be attributed to dominance of less compressible sand matrix that shields the adverse effects of cr vi on the diffuse double layer of the bentonite particles 3 in general variation trends in hydraulic conductivity and compression characteristics of the tested backfill due to cr vi contamination agreed well with findings of sem imagines that indicated a similar microstructure of the specimen prepared using distilled water and cr vi solution

1396,hexavalent chromium cr vi in groundwater impose serious health problems for human society this study investigates the potential of using calcium ca bentonite amended with sodium hexametaphosphate shmp as a backfill constituent material in the soil bentonite slurry trench wall to envelop the cr vi impacted groundwater the hydraulic conductivity k and consolidation of backfill comprising of 80 wt sand and 20 wt shmp amended ca bentonite were determined via flexible wall permeameter tests and oedometer tests respectively microstructure characterizations of the amended bentonites before and after contamination were also explored the results indicated that when the permeated liquid changed from tap water to cr vi solution the tested specimens exhibited a 1 0 to 1 2 fold variation in short term k with all k values fall in range of 2 1 10 10 to 2 5 10 10 m s this mild variation may be attributed to terminate the tests without achieving chemical equilibrium on the other hand the cr vi solution had insignificant effect on consolidation of the amended backfill which is attributed to the dominated incompressible sand matrix skeleton in the backfill that withstood the consolidation pressure and shield the negative effects of the contaminated solution the microstructure images revealed that the cr vi resulted in relatively strong interlink between particles overall the shmp amended bentonite is promising for enhancing cr vi containment performance of the soil bentonite slurry trench wall backfills keywords bentonite heavy metal hydraulic conductivity slurry trench wall contaminated groundwater 1 introduction groundwater has been found contaminated by toxic heavy metals at numerous contaminated sites around the world posing significant risk to public health and the

series 300 api filter press and a model 140 mud balance all from fann instrument company houston texas respectively the ph of the slurry was measured to be 6 8 using a model 720a ph meter cole parmer instrument company vernon hills il these properties satisfied the desired slurry rheological properties for preparing sb backfills u s epa 1984 evans 1993 malusis et al 2010 then a mixture of sand and dry shmp cab at a dry weight ratio of 8 2 was prepared and its moisture content was adjusted using the prepared bentonite slurry until a slump height of 125 mm astm 2012 was satisfied as per typical slump requirements for the sb backfill evans 1993 malusis and mckeehan 2013 bohnhoff and shackelford 2014 to ensure a total bentonite content of 20 in the final backfill predetermined mass of additional sand was added along with the bentonite slurry during the slump test and the moisture content of the resultant backfill was measured to be 30 this resultant backfill containing 20 shmp amended ca bentonite is denoted by shmp 20cab in the following sections to compare with the clean backfill a contaminated backfill was prepared specifically for the consolidation test using the following procedures first dry sand and pre prepared shmp cab at a dry weight ratio of 8 2 were blended with cr vi solution to achieve a moisture content of 30 corresponding to the target slump of 125 mm of the clean backfill the moist backfill was then sealed in vinyl bags and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature 20 c for 15 days as recommended by fan et al 2016 the weight of the backfill plus the vinyl bag was measured at the beginning and end of the equilibration and the evaporation loss was compensated by adding extra amount of distilled water 2 3 hydraulic conductivity tests hydraulic conductivity experiments were performed on duplicate with sample designations shmp 20cab 1 and shmp 20cab 2 using flexible wall permeameters in accordance with the method c falling headwater and rising tailwater method stipulated in astm d5084 astm 2010 schematic diagram of the hydraulic conductivity test apparatus is shown in fig 1 specially it contained two bladder accumulators between the flow burette system and the permeameter cell astm 2011b preventing the cr vi solution from polluting the inflow outflow reservoirs the inflow and outflow volumes q in and q out were measured from the inflow and outflow burettes considering the high slump characteristic of the backfill i e 125 mm a fabricated acrylic cylinder see fig 1 was employed to provide a lateral support and to transfer the cell pressure for each specimen malusis et al 2009 yang et al 2017b 2018b each specimen was saturated by back pressure method astm 2010 using de aired tap water under an effective confining stress of 34 5 kpa during this stage the cell pressure bottom i e inflow and top i e outflow pressures of the specimen were gradually increased from 34 5 kpa 0 kpa and 0 kpa to 310 5 kpa 276 0 kpa and 276 0 kpa respectively and the pore water pressure was monitored via a pressure sensor the specimen was considered saturated when the pore water pressure coefficient i e ratio of the increment in pore water pressure to the increment in confining pressure reaches 0 95 the permeation process was initiated by simultaneous increase in the cell pressure and bottom pressure to 319 5 kpa and 293 9 kpa while maintaining the top pressure as 276 0 kpa therefore an average effective confining stress of 34 5 kpa and an upward hydraulic gradient of about 26 were ensured during the permeation all specimens were first permeated using tap water to obtain a baseline hydraulic conductivity k w the testing was continued until the following termination criteria achieved astm 2010 1 the ratio of outflow to inflow volumes q in q out was in the range of 0 75 and 1 25 2 at least four consecutive k w values fell within 25 of their mean value and 3 the k w versus time curve showed insignificant upward or downward trend to determine hydraulic conductivity of the backfill specimens with cr vi solution k c the permeant liquid of each specimen was changed from tap water to cr vi solution and the tests were continued at each interval of about 20 days the effluent sample was collected from the bladder accumulator at the outflow end and ph ec and contaminant concentration of the resultant effluent samples were tested for each specimen the tap water permeation testing stage duration was 58 days and the cr vi solutions permeation stage duration was for 40 days 2 4 consolidation tests backfill specimens prepared with tap water clean backfill and cr vi solution contaminated backfill were used for one dimensional consolidation tests in accordance with astm d2435 astm 2011a each backfill was placed in a stainless steel oedometer ring with a diameter of 6 3 cm and a height of 2 5 cm the saturation of specimen was realized by soaking each specimen along with the ring in de aired tap water for 3 days with upper and lower openings of the ring covered with respective filter paper and porous stone the saturated specimen was then assembled in the oedometer cell immersed by adding additional de aired tap water into the cell and loaded with a 1 3 kpa seating load for 24 h consolidation of the specimen was trigged immediately by applying incremental loading sequence that began at 24 kpa and doubled after each stage lasted for 24 h up to a maximum applied stress of 1 532 kpa the specimen was then unloaded in a stepwise fashion by reducing the loading with a factor of four relative to the previous loading void ratio at each loading level was calculated based on size dry mass and specific gravity of the specimen and density of the pore water as per astm d2435 astm 2011a it should be noted that the specimen specific gravity of the backfill 2 68 and pore water density 1 g cm3 were assumed unchanged in different tested solutions 2 5 scanning electron microscopy sem tests variation in microstructure of the shmp amended cab before and after cr vi contamination was investigated by conducting sem analysis the specimens were prepared by placing 2 g of shmp cab and 20 ml of either distilled water or cr vi solution in a 50 ml plastic centrifuge tube the centrifuge tube with sample were sealed shaken for 24 h using an overhead shaker and allowed to settle undisturbed for 80 days yang et al 2018a the supernatant within the tube was then carefully extracted and discarded and the remaining sediment was subsequently treated with the freeze dry method that was commonly employed for sem specimen preparation du et al 2014 fan et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 2020 liquid nitrogen was used first to quickly freeze the sediment after which the sediment was placed in a vacuum freeze drying system and the frozen water was sublimated under a temperature of 80 c the resultant freeze dried sediment was plated with a thin gold layer and then subjected to sem tests using a scanning electron microscope leo 1530 vp leo germany 3 results and analysis 3 1 short term hydraulic conductivity equilibrium status of the inflow volume q in and outflow volume q out during flexible wall hydraulic conductivity tests are presented in figs 2 to 3 in which the replicate specimens are denoted as shmp 20cab 1 and shmp 20cab 2 fig 2 shows the variation of measured volumetric flow ratio q out q in with increasing pore volumes of flow it is seen in fig 2 that q out q in values of all the backfill specimens fall between 0 75 and 1 25 during the permeation of tap water and cr vi solutions satisfying the hydraulic equilibrium condition of astm d5084 astm 2010 however ph ec and metal concentration of the inflow and outflow liquids did not reach chemical equilibrium condition at the end of testing as shown in fig 3 therefore the measured hydraulic conductivities using the contaminant solutions are valid for the short term conditions i e without reaching chemical equilibrium conditions additional tests are warranted for assessing the long term hydraulic conductivity after reaching chemical equilibrium conditions fig 4 shows results of the short term hydraulic conductivity versus pore volumes of flow pvf tested with tap water and cr vi solutions the term pvf is defined as ratio of cumulative volume of the effluent liquid to the total volume of voids in the tested specimen astm 2011b for the two permeating liquids all the tested specimens possess short term hydraulic conductivity lower than 10 9 m s which is a commonly targeted limit for sb slurry trench cutoff walls the duplicate specimens shmp 20cab 1 and shmp 20cab 2 show very close short term hydraulic conductivity values under the testing condition of this study with insignificant variation is seen in the log k pvf plot as the permeant liquid changed from tap water to cr vi solution short term hydraulic conductivity of the duplicate specimens varied from 2 1 10 10 m s and 2 1 10 10 m s k w to 2 1 10 10 m s and 2 5 10 10 m s k c respectively see fig 4 these short term hydraulic conductivities are calculated as the average value of the last four consecutive data points under a given permeating liquid for each specimen as compared to the tap water the cr vi solution caused insignificant change in short term hydraulic conductivity in the shmp 20cab 1 and an increase of 20 in short term hydraulic conductivity of the shmp 20cab 2 as a result the k c k w values of the shmp 20cab 1 and shmp 20cab 2 are respectively 1 0 and 1 2 in the cr vi solution in general the cr vi solution resulted in short term hydraulic conductivity variation of 0 to 20 for the tested specimens this variation in short term hydraulic conductivity falls within the maximum measuring error of 25 as per astm d5084 and astm d7100 astm 2011b for specimen with k 1 10 10 m s therefore the cr vi solution is considered to induce an insignificant change or slight increase in the short term hydraulic conductivity of the tested specimens at the end of test duration 3 2 consolidation characteristics fig 5 shows the void ratio e effective consolidation stress σ curves of the tested specimens on a semi logarithm scale the e log σ curves exhibit an inverse s shape pattern with a remolded yield stress of approximately 48 kpa as per definition of previous studies hong et al 2012 du et al 2015a such an inverse s shape curve agrees with those reported in previous studies dealing with consolidation of bentonite or backfills possessing bentonite content higher than 8 sreedharan and puvvadi 2013 fan 2018 at the same effective stress level the e value of the backfill prepared with tap water is slightly higher than that prepared using the cr vi solution this is consistent with the sequential order of initial moisture content of tested specimens for example the measured initial moisture content is in the order of shmp 20cab tap water 33 1 shmp 20cab cr vi 30 6 the compression index c c and swell index c s are determined respectively from slopes of the loading and unloading segments of the e log σ curves as shown in fig 5 a c c value of 0 18 and 0 17 is found for the shmp 20cab tap water backfill and the shmp 20cab cr vi backfill respectively similarly the c s value for both shmp 20cab tap water backfill and shmp 20cab cr vi backfill is found to be 0 017 the c c and c s results indicate insignificant influence of the cr vi solutions on compressibility and swelling of the tested backfills this phenomenon seems inconsistent with common knowledge that multivalent cations cause shrinkage in the diffused double layer of bentonite and variable compressibility of the bentonite materials as a consequence du et al 2015a fan et al 2017 the reasons for this finding will be discussed in the following section 4 discussion the results obtained from this study indicate that the cr vi solution yield negligible influence on the short term hydraulic conductivity and consolidation characteristics of the shmp 20cab backfill although the cr vi solution induces a 1 0 to 1 2 times increase in short term hydraulic conductivity of the tested backfill as compared to the tap water permeation condition there are two reasons responsible for a slight increase in hydraulic conductivity of the tested specimen to the cr vi solution in this study 1 cr vi in pore water is presented primarily as an anionic complex such as cro 4 2 and cr 2 o 7 2 devulapalli and reddy 1996 which adsorb less on the bentonite particles and presents little affinity to the shmp therefore its electrolyte property results in slight compression of diffused double layer of the bentonite particles 2 due to smaller hydrated ionic radius of the potassium ion k than the sodium ion na i e 0 3 nm versus 0 45 nm domenico and schwartz 1998 cation exchange between the k in the pore water introduced by k2cr2o7 and the na on the bentonite particle derived from the shmp also generate shrinkage in the diffused double layer of bentonite jo et al 2001 as a result slight increase in hydraulic conductivity observed with the cr vi solution as compared to the tap water permeation scenario it is observed in fig 4 that the variation of log k for tap water is larger than that for the cr vi solution to analyze the standard deviation sd range the k values versus pvf plotted on a regular scale see fig 6 the sd for the cr vi permeation period is found respectively 49 and 24 lower than that permeated with tap water for the two samples this significant variation on k testing with tap water is resulted from the action of re filling the inflow burette less frequently 2 to 3 days during the tests which yielded transient hydraulic gradient therefore influenced the stability of the k value in contrast during the cr vi permeation period the inflow burette was filled every day hence the hydraulic gradient was relatively stable yielding relatively stable k value based on the consolidation test result fig 5 the negligible influence of cr vi solution on consolidation properties of the backfill may be attributed to reason that 80 of the backfill consisted of sand matrix which forms a skeleton to bear the loading pressure the dominance of the less compressible sand then shields the adverse effects of the cr vi solution on the diffuse double layer of the bentonite the sem images fig 7 provide insight into microstructure variation of the amended bentonite immersed in different solutions deionized water and cr vi solution it is found that deionized water and cr vi solution exposure conditions induce similar microstructure of shmp cab with homogeneous surface and loosely connected particles as observed in fig 7 this similar microstructure agrees well with results of insignificant difference in hydraulic conductivity and consolidation properties of the shmp 20cab backfill permeated or prepared with deionized water and cr vi solution see figs 4 and 5 three important interactions between shmp and the calcium bentonite occur as reported by yang et al 2018a 1 substitution of ca2 on the bentonite particles by na provided by the shmp 2 forming a steric stabilization layer on the bentonite particles by sorption of the hexametaphosphate anion hmp and 3 increasing negative surface charge density due to sorption of the multivalent anion hmp combination of these three mechanisms results in an expanded diffuse double layer of the bentonite and a less chemical sensitivity of the clay system in contrast the polymers amended bentonites are reported to induce different mechanisms di emidio 2010 1 intercalation of the polymer chains into the clay sheets 2 blocking of the flow channel by hydrophilic and gel forming polymer and 3 polymer compounds surrounding the bentonite particle avoid ion exchange between the bentonite and the pore solution as compared to the polymer amendment shmp amendment is advantageous 1 low shmp dosage is required i e 2 shmp dosage used in this study as compared to 2 to 25 polymer dosage used in previous research studies di emidio 2010 malusis and mckeehan 2013 bohnhoff and shackelford 2014 fan 2018 shen and wei 2018 2 the shmp amendment procedure is much more easier than that followed for the polymer amendment that requires a polymerized process and 3 low risk of shmp amendment elution from the specimen as compared to high potential for polymer elution as demonstrated in previous research studies scalia et al 2014 the authors have investigated the un amended backfill containing raw calcium bentonite and found that it possesses unacceptably high hydraulic conductivity yang et al 2017b for example the un amended backfill composed of sand and 15 to 25 raw calcium bentonite was found to possess hydraulic conductivity ranging from 2 8 10 9 to 1 4 10 8 m s using tap water as permeant and the same hydraulic gradient conditions as used in this study specifically the backfill containing 20 calcium bentonite had hydraulic conductivity of 7 6 10 9 m s which exceeds commonly targeted upper limit of 1 0 10 9 m s for slurry walls depending on solute concentration of the electrolyte solution hydraulic conductivity of sb backfill could slightly to moderately increase as compared to tap water permeation scenario gleason et al 1997 thus exposure to cr vi solution is considered to maintain or increase hydraulic conductivity of the un amended backfill relative to tap water permeation condition further deviating from the targeted hydraulic conductivity value required for vertical barrier application therefore the un amended backfill is considered unsuitable for slurry wall construction and not included in the testing program it should be mentioned that the flexible wall permeability experiments were terminated in this study were terminated before reaching all of the chemical equilibrium requirements setforth in astm d7100 therefore additional testing with longer test duration until reaching the chemical equilibrium conditions is warranted to evaluate the long term hydraulic conductivity response of the sb backfill containing shmp amended cab when exposed to cr vi contaminated groundwater future studies could also involve control tests with un amended backfill and tests using other types of contaminant solutions as permeants to systematically explore compatibility and contaminant performance of the backfills made of shmp cab 5 conclusions for the first time this study presented the results of hydraulic conductivity tests and consolidation experiments conducted to evaluate the potential for using shmp amended ca bentonite in a soil bentonite slurry trench wall for containing cr vi impacted groundwater the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the short term hydraulic conductivity k tests revealed that 1000 mg l cr vi solution exhibited slight increase in k of the shmp amended backfill the slightly increased k with the cr vi solution was attributed to electrolyte characteristics as well as smaller ionic radius in k of the cr vi solution than the na from the bentonite thus leading to compression of diffuse double layer of the bentonite additional tests with longer testing duration is necessary in future research for evaluating chemical compatibility of the backfill containing shmp amended ca bentonite for cr vi containment 2 based on the results derived from consolidation experiments the shmp backfills prepared with either tap water or cr vi solution presented an inverse s shape void ratio effective consolidation stress curve the cr vi solution had insignificant effect on consolidation characteristics including compression and swell indices of the amended backfill this may be attributed to dominance of less compressible sand matrix that shields the adverse effects of cr vi on the diffuse double layer of the bentonite particles 3 in general variation trends in hydraulic conductivity and compression characteristics of the tested backfill due to cr vi contamination agreed well with findings of sem imagines that indicated a similar microstructure of the specimen prepared using distilled water and cr vi solution

1397,nanobubbles have recently attracted much interest for their practical use and potential applications in environmental issues the pre existence of deposited colloidal particles in porous media commonly occurs when nanobubbles applied to porous media interact with deposited colloidal particles however the current understanding of the effect of the interactions with pre deposited colloidal particles on nanobubble transport in saturated porous media remains incomplete and the effects are often overlooked therefore we performed 1d column experiments with sequential injections of colloidal and nanobubble suspensions to study the effect of pre deposited materials on the retention and release of colloids and nanobubbles in packed glass beads in this study we used resonant mass measurements to measure the number concentrations of colloids and nanobubbles during transport experiments for the first time to distinguish between coexisting solid colloidal particles and nanobubbles with different buoyancies in mixed effluent during transport the nanobubble retention increased because of the pre existence of deposited colloidal particles indicating that the deposited colloidal particles act as additional deposition sites and physical obstacles for nanobubbles through physicochemical including hydrophobic interactions this study also provides a future reference for the applicability of resonant mass measurement to cotransport experiments of different buoyant particles including colloids nanobubbles and oil droplets graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nanobubble transport colloid transport deposited particles sequential injection resonant mass measurement 1 introduction the surface reactivity of nanobubbles has recently attracted much interest due to their large specific surface area and surface charges potential nanobubble applications in industrial and environmental issues include enhancement of metabolism in vegetables water treatment with flotation and enhanced water purification burns et al 1997 khuntia et al 2012 li and tsuge 2006 park and kurata 2009 additionally nanobubbles have shown considerable potential for the soil remediation of organic chemicals choi et al 2008 hu and xia 2018 jauregi and varley 1999 jenkins et al 1993 therefore understanding the nanobubble transport characteristics in soils is required for successful soil remediation and agricultural applications however fundamental studies on nanobubble behavior in porous media are limited hamamoto et al 2019 wan et al 2001 applying nanobubbles in the natural subsurface environment requires considering the interactions between nanobubbles and porous media and between nanobubbles and solid colloidal particles with various organic and inorganic sources e g clay minerals iron and aluminum oxides and humic substances bradford and torkzaban 2008 mccarthy and zachara 1989 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 interactions between various types of solid colloidal particles and bubbles are well studied from the perspective of particle separation in the flotation process ducker et al 1989 fan et al 2004 fielden et al 1996 nguyen 2007 that involves van der waals electrical double layer hydration and hydrophobic forces recent studies report that the interactions between nanobubbles and solid colloidal particles could play an important role in the stability of bulk nanobubbles in water alheshibri and craig 2019 eklund and swenson 2018 sugano et al 2017 additionally impurities such as organic substances in nanobubble suspensions could greatly contribute to nanobubble stability alheshibri and craig 2019 eklund and swenson 2018 sugano et al 2017 alheshibri and craig 2019 proposed that the compression of insoluble materials at the air water interface leads to an effective negative surface tension that counteracts the laplace pressure thereby removing the driving force to dissolve the gas within a nanobubble the transport behavior of colloidal particles in porous media depends on the flow conditions and particle grain sizes ma et al 2013 molnar et al 2015 nelson and ginn 2011 rajagopalan and tien 1976 tufenkji and elimelech 2004a yao et al 1971 and on the solution chemistry including the ph ionic strength is and ionic composition elimelech 1992 ryan et al 1999 tufenkji and elimelech 2004b zhou et al 2011 in addition ubiquitous nanoscale roughness and chemical heterogeneity on the grain surfaces in porous media locally reduce and eliminate the energy barrier to the attachment of solid colloids on the grain surfaces thereby affecting colloidal transport in porous media bradford and torkzaban 2013 ma et al 2011 recently hamamoto et al applied this concept for nanobubble transport through packed glass beads by calculating the interaction energy between nanobubbles and glass bead surfaces and considering the van der waals electrical double layer and hydrophobic interactions with surface roughness hamamoto et al 2019 they showed that the inclusion of surface roughness reduces the energy barrier between nanobubbles and glass beads which is considered a reason for the deposition of nanobubbles on the glass bead surface thus the deposition of colloidal particles onto the grain surface could influence the surface roughness and chemical heterogeneity thereby affecting nanobubble transport in porous media however experimental information regarding how the presence of the deposited solid colloidal particles affects the transport behavior of nanobubbles in a porous medium and vice versa remains insufficient several techniques are used to distinguish differently labeled solid nanoparticles vitorge et al 2014 however investigating the transport of nanobubbles with the coexistence of solid colloidal particles requires techniques to separately measure individual concentrations and sizes in a mixture of nanobubbles and solid particles the resonant mass measurement method detects and counts fine particles including bubbles in suspension kobayashi et al 2014 the center of this instrument is a microelectromechanical system mems sensor equipped with a resonant cantilever with an embedded microfluidic channel if any solid particles with a density higher than the liquid water in this case pass through the channel to reach the tip of the cantilever the resonant frequency of the cantilever shifts toward a lower frequency because of the mass change associated with the replacement of the water inside by the particles the resonant mass measurement gives opposite responses for bubbles with a density lower than that of the liquid therefore the resonant frequency shifts higher when the bubbles pass through the channel thus the resonant mass measurement distinguishes between nanobubbles and solid colloidal particles based on their buoyancy difference therefore the resonant mass measurement allows separate measurements of the number concentration and size of each nanobubble and solid colloidal particle in the mixture in this sense the resonant mass measurement method is more promising for studies on nanobubble transport with the coexistence of solid colloidal particles than widely used techniques e g dynamic light scattering laser diffraction and particle tracking analysis that cannot distinguish between nanobubbles and solid colloidal particles to our knowledge several previous studies have suggested the effectiveness of the resonant mass measurement method for investigating nanobubbles alheshibri et al 2016 azevedo et al 2019 kobayashi et al 2014 however few studies have applied the method to nanobubble transport in the presence of colloidal solid particles in a porous medium therefore this study uses resonant mass measurements and examines the effects of the presence of deposited colloidal solid particles on nanobubble transport in a porous medium and vice versa we performed one dimensional column transport experiments with sequential injections of o2 nanobubbles and carboxylated polystyrene latex particles as model microplastic particles the collected data were also compared and described with the simulated data using a mathematical model including advective and dispersive transport first order kinetic retention and transient release the findings from this study help understand the roles of nanoscale roughness and the interaction between nanobubbles and solid colloidal particles in controlling the retention and release of nanobubbles in porous media furthermore by demonstrating the applicability of resonant mass measurement to the cotransport of colloids and nanobubbles we demonstrate that resonant mass measurement is a strong tool for tackling other environmentally related cotransport problems involving contaminant particles e g micro and nano plastics metal particles and oil droplets 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials nanobubbles were generated using a pressurized dissolution instrument fzin 10 i idec co ltd japan with a supply of purified oxygen gas and ion exchanged water autostill wa53 yamato scientific co ltd japan following the same procedure as in a previous study hamamoto et al 2019 here we refer to nanobubbles as o2 nanobubbles the applied pressure of approximately 300 kpa allowed the supplied o2 gas to dissolve in water under supersaturated conditions the o2 saturated water flowed out from the instrument into a water pool under atmospheric conditions the pressure reduction causes the release of the supersaturated condition and the subsequent formation of bubbles composed of the supplied o2 gas the nanobubble generation procedure was continuously operated for approximately 1 h with 10 l of water to obtain the number concentration of nanobubbles carboxylated polystyrene latex particles colloids thermo fisher scientific were employed as model colloidal particles representing microplastic particles the colloids had ph dependent negative charges due to deprotonation of the carboxyl groups on the particle surface the diameter and density were 0 5 0 015 μm and 1 055 g cm3 respectively nacl and nahco3 jis special grade wako pure chemical industries were used to prepare the electrolyte solutions as background solution milli q water merck millipore was used for sample preparation the nacl and nahco3 concentrations were adjusted to 1 0 and 0 4 mm in the sample dispersions respectively the 0 4 mm nahco3 was also used as a ph buffer to control the ph to 7 8 the input number concentration c 0 of the nanobubbles was adjusted to approximately c 0 1 0 2 0 105 ml 1 whereas the input number concentration c 0 of carboxyl latex particles was set to c 0 1 0 and 10 0 106 ml 1 the number concentrations of each nanobubble and colloid dispersion were confirmed using a resonant mass measurement archimedes malvern instruments ltd the resonant mass measurement also provided the size distributions of the nanobubble and colloid dispersions fig 1 shows the number fraction as a percentage plotted against the diameters of the nanobubble and colloid dispersions used in this study the red solid and black dotted lines represent the colloids with concentrations of 1 0 and 10 0 106 ml 1 denoted as colloids and colloids10x respectively and the blue broken line represents the nanobubbles we used the value of 1 055 g cm3 provided by the manufacturer as the colloid density for the number concentration measurements and particle diameter calculations the nanobubble density was assumed to be the same as that of air to quantify the nanobubble number concentration and size distribution hamamoto et al 2019 the mode sizes of the nanobubbles and colloids were approximately 0 18 and 0 5 μm respectively the mode sizes of the colloids were almost the same irrespective of the number concentration as indicated by the consistency between the red solid and black dotted lines in fig 1 glass beads toshin riko co ltd japan with a diameter of 0 1 mm were used to build a model porous medium in the column transport experiments the chemical compositions of the glass beads were reported as sio2 70 73 na2o and k2o 13 16 cao 7 12 mgo 1 4 al2o3 0 5 1 5 fe2o3 0 1 0 15 and residuals 1 0 the density of the glass beads was measured as 2 48 g cm3 with a pycnometer before use the glass beads were thoroughly cleaned to remove organic and other impurities using the same method as in a previous study tufenkji and elimelech 2004b we measured the zeta potentials of the colloids nanobubbles and glass beads under the same solution conditions of the column transport experiments namely 1 mm nacl and 0 4 mm nahco3 the zeta potentials of the colloids and nanobubbles were measured by electrophoretic measurements zeecom microtec co ltd streaming potential measurements zetacad cad instruments france were used to measure the zeta potential of the glass beads the measured zeta potentials of the colloids nanobubbles and glass beads were 46 9 31 3 and 89 4 mv respectively 2 2 column transport experiments with sequential injection we used a column setup composed of an acrylic cylinder with a height of 6 05 cm and diameter of 5 0 cm fig 2 we followed the procedure described in the literature to prepare the setup hamamoto et al 2019 2018 2017 nylon fiber with a mesh spacing of 70 μm was positioned at the bottom and top of each column to keep the packed glass beads within the column the thickness of the nylon membrane of a few micrometers was much thinner than the column height the test to measure colloid and nanobubble effluent concentrations from the same column setup with the membranes without packing glass beads showed no attachment of colloids and nanobubbles to the membranes the column was packed with glass beads under water saturation with a dry bulk density of 1 57 g cm3 which corresponds to a porosity of 0 37 cm3 cm3 the packed column was flushed with 1 mm hcl aqueous solution ph 3 to allow the dissolution of na2o and cao near the surface of the glass beads without raising the solution ph to levels where the silica matrix could dissolve litton and olson 1993 the background electrolyte solution was injected using a peristaltic pump until the ph electrical conductivity ec and effluent turbidity were equilibrated then the colloidal suspension or nanobubble suspension was injected into the column for six pore volumes and followed by the background solution for another five pore volumes subsequently the nanobubble or colloid suspension was injected into the column after the injection of the colloid or nanobubble suspension and the followed background solution to examine the effects of the deposited nanobubbles or colloids on the subsequent transport of the colloids and nanobubbles here we refer to the experiment as nanobubbles colloids when the nanobubble suspension was injected before the colloid suspension we refer to the experiments as colloids nanobubbles and colloids10x nanobubbles when the colloid suspension at the concentrations of 1 0 and 10 0 106 ml 1 respectively was injected before the nanobubble suspension the background solution was injected into the column for five pore volumes then deionized di water was injected into the column to investigate the effects of reducing the salt concentration upon release of the nanobubbles and colloids the sequential injection experiments were conducted under a constant water flux of 6 2 10 3 cm s the effluents were collected at intervals of approximately 0 3 pore volumes throughout the experiments the ph ec and turbidity were measured for all samples the number concentration and size distribution of colloids and nanobubbles were measured with the resonant mass instrument for selected samples and are crucial for investigating the transport phenomena in the presence of nanobubbles and colloids the resonant mass measurement distinguished between the different buoyancies of the colloids and nanobubbles in the mixed effluent from the column during transport experiments with sequential injection these breakthrough curve experiments were replicated three times to check the reproducibility of the experiments 2 3 mathematical modeling for colloid and nanobubble transport the transport of colloids and nanobubbles through porous media can be described by considering advection hydrodynamic dispersion and deposition hamamoto et al 2019 torkzaban et al 2013 during the nanobubble and colloid injection phases we employed the following aqueous and solid phase mass balance equations with a first order kinetic term for the deposition of colloids and nanobubbles 1 θ w c t z θ w d h c z v c z k d θ w c 2 ρ b s t k d θ w c where c cm 3 is the number concentration of colloids or nanobubbles in the liquid phase θ w is the volumetric water content t s is time z cm is the spatial position along the flow direction v cm s is the applied water flux d h λv cm2 s is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient λ cm is the dispersivity and k d min 1 is the deposition rate coefficient for colloids or nanobubbles from the liquid phase onto the grains we denote k d as k d nb for nanobubbles and k d cl for colloids s is the concentration of colloids or nanobubbles on the grains and ρ b is the dry bulk density of the packed column the following calculations used the dispersivity value λ 0 1 cm which is based on the tracer experiments reported in a previous work hamamoto et al 2019 here in eqs 1 and 2 we did not include the blocking effect used in the literature hamamoto et al 2019 torkzaban et al 2013 to simplify our analysis because we did not observe such an effect throughout our experiments a similar formula to express the attachment term is widely accepted in the transport model for colloidal particles hamamoto et al 2017 tufenkji and elimelech 2004b the release of deposited colloids and nanobubbles is expected during the injection of deionized water due to the reduction of ionic strength and the subsequent increase of electrical double layer repulsion between colloids nanobubbles and grains at the front between displacing deionized water and displaced background salt solution to model this process we employed a set of equations by combining the mass balance equations for ions colloids and nanobubbles including their release kinetics as follows hamamoto et al 2019 torkzaban et al 2013 3 θ w c ion t z θ w d h c ion z v c ion z 4 θ w c t z θ w d h c z v c z ρ b k rel s f nr s i 5 ρ b s t ρ b k rel s f nr s i 6 k rel k sw h 0 s f nr s i h 0 0 5 c ion i c ion where c ion is the bulk concentration of the ions in the liquid phase k rel and k sw min 1 are the release rate and mass transfer coefficient for colloids or nanobubbles from the grains to the liquid phase respectively f nr is the fraction of deposited colloids or nanobubbles that are not released irrespective of the reducing ionic strength we denote the values of k sw and f nr for nanobubbles and colloids as k sw nb k sw cl f nr nb and f nr cl in the same manner as for k d s i is the value of s for colloids and nanobubbles at the beginning of the injection of deionized water namely after the sequential injection of colloids and nanobubbles c ion i is the ion concentration of the background salt solution h 0 x is the heaviside function h 0 s f nr s i in eq 6 is equal to 1 when s f nr s i and 0 when s f nr s i thereby stopping the release of nanobubbles and colloids after s reaches f nr s i and all releasable fractions are released moreover h 0 0 5c ion i c ion is equal to 1 when c ion 0 5c ion i and 0 when c ion 0 5c ion i thereby starting the release of nanobubbles and colloids after c ion declines to 0 5c ion i due to the reduction of ionic strength by displacement of the background salt solution to the deionized di water we determined the value of f nr as f nr s eq s i where s eq is the value of s at the equilibrium i e the end of the deionized water injection where we assume that there is no further release of colloids and nanobubbles at a given position hence determining the value of f nr from the mass balance calculation throughout the column transport experiments is straightforward table 1 we used comsol multiphysics version 5 4 comsol inc to solve eqs 1 6 the parameters k d and k sw for the colloids and nanobubbles were estimated by fitting the simulated effluent concentrations of the colloids and nanobubbles to the experimental values with the software optimization module we represented the ion concentration as the measured value of ec in the effluent we set the initial concentrations in the liquid phase and on the grains for colloids and nanobubbles to zero before sequential injection a flux boundary condition corresponding to the supplied suspensions for a given period was imposed on the inlet boundary a zero concentration gradient was imposed on the outlet boundary 3 results and discussion 3 1 transport of colloids and nanobubbles during sequential injection the relative number concentrations of colloids and nanobubbles at the effluent scaled by the input concentration c c 0 were plotted against the pore volume in figs 3 and 4 the symbols represent the experimental values measured using the resonant mass instrument the lines in figs 3 and 4 represent the calculations based on eqs 1 and 2 respectively the calculated breakthrough curves in figs 3 and 4 appropriately describe the experimental results with the fitted values of k d k d nb for the nanobubbles or k d cl for the colloids and the pearson correlation coefficient for the goodness of fit r 2 table 2 table 1 provides the fractions of retention for the colloids and nanobubbles during the first injection phases with the colloids for colloids nanobubbles red closed circles and colloids10x nanobubbles black closed diamonds fig 3 a the breakthrough and breakdown of the colloids occurred at approximately 1 0 pore volume after the injection of the colloids and background solution and showed no colloid retardation the maximum relative effluent concentration c c 0 of approximately 0 5 was comparable to the concentrations obtained under experimental conditions this result means that half of the injected colloids were trapped in the porous medium whereas the input concentration of the colloids did not affect the transport of the colloids in the porous medium however the dependence of colloidal transport on the input concentration has been reported in the literature bradford et al 2011 2009 liu et al 1995 tan et al 1994 the retention of colloidal particles in a porous medium decreases owing to the blocking phenomena with increasing input number concentration and increase the effluent concentration however bradford et al also showed that the concentration dependency becomes less significant when the input number concentration is lower than 108 ml 1 based on a numerical simulation with a particle size of 500 nm which is similar to the one employed in this study bradford et al 2011 this simulation rationalizes our observed insignificance of concentration dependency in the breakthrough curves because the injected number concentrations of the colloids were 106 and 107 ml 1 in colloids nanobubbles and colloids10x nanobubbles respectively the absolute amount of the retained colloids in the case of colloids10x nanobubbles should be 10 times higher than that in the case of colloids nanobubbles even though the relative effluent concentrations showed similar values among the two different colloid input concentrations the resonant mass measurements also confirmed that the effluent colloid concentrations were quite low during the second injection phases with the nanobubbles after the first colloid injection for colloids nanobubbles red closed circles and colloids10x nanobubbles black closed diamonds in fig 3 b thus the nanobubbles injected after the colloids did not cause significant detachment of the deposited colloids therefore the removal of polystyrene latex particles from the porous medium was barely enhanced by nanobubble injection in this study consequently enhancing the removal effect of nanobubbles requires functionalizing nanobubbles with surfactants and other combinations of target colloidal particles e g other microplastic or metal oxide colloids to tune the surface properties of nanobubbles and their interactions with colloids another option could be increasing the flow velocity and nanobubble concentration to enhance the possibility of collision between colloids and nanobubbles due to the increased flux towards the glass beads these aspects can be addressed with a resonant mass instrument in future studies the breakthrough curve of the colloids during the second injection phase with the colloids after the first nanobubble injection for nanobubbles colloids red open circles fig 3 b was similar to those for colloids nanobubbles and colloids10x nanobubbles fig 3 a indicating that the deposited nanobubbles did not influence the transport behavior of the colloids this observation was also supported by the similar values of k d cl in the calculations for the different conditions because the size and injected concentration of the nanobubbles were smaller than those of colloids the deposited nanobubbles might not be sufficient to affect solid surface characteristics such as surface roughness we do not currently have direct evidence to clarify why the deposited nanobubbles did not affect the transport behavior of the colloids thus the characteristics of deposited nanobubbles i e shape and location should be further investigated by measuring the surface roughness of glass beads using atomic force microscopy in future studies elzbieciak wodka et al 2014 during the first nanobubble injection phase blue open squares for nanobubbles colloids the breakthrough and breakdown occurred at 1 0 pore volume after the injection of the nanobubbles and background solution showed no nanobubble retardation fig 4 a similar to the transport of colloids shown in fig 3 a the maximum relative effluent concentration was 0 5 1 0 indicating that the nanobubbles were partially deposited in the porous medium thus both pre injected colloids and nanobubbles were partially deposited inside the column during the first injection phase with colloids or nanobubbles moreover the breakthrough curve of colloids for colloids nanobubbles in fig 3 a was similar to that of nanobubbles for nanobubbles colloids fig 4 a the zeta potential of colloids 46 9 mv was lower than that of nanobubbles 31 3 mv suggesting that the electrical double layer interaction between the colloids and the surface of the glass beads is more repulsive than that between the nanobubbles and glass bead surfaces however the filtration theory predicts that smaller colloids i e nanobubbles approximately 180 nm in size are more efficiently removed from the liquid phase than larger colloids i e colloids measuring approximately 500 nm because of the greater rates of mass transfer to the solid phase nelson and ginn 2011 tufenkji and elimelech 2004a the resonant mass measurements also showed that no nanobubbles were present in the effluents during the second injection phase with the colloids for nanobubbles colloids blue open squares in fig 4 b suggesting that the colloids injected after the nanobubbles did not significantly cause the detachment of the deposited nanobubbles comparing the results for the nanobubbles reveals that the breakthrough curve during the first nanobubble injection blue open squares in fig 4 a exhibited a higher maximum relative concentration c c 0 than those during the second nanobubble injection after the colloid injection for colloids nanobubbles blue closed squares and colloids10x nanobubbles black opened diamonds fig 4 b this result suggests that the deposited colloids inhibited nanobubble transport in the porous medium the calculations describe the inhibited transport of the nanobubbles with increased k d nb for the nanobubbles the increase in k d nb is rationalized by the increased surface roughness of the glass beads due to the deposited colloids thus increasing the surface roughness reduces the energy barrier between colloidal particles and the grain surface as reported in the literature bradford and torkzaban 2013 hamamoto et al 2019 in addition colloid deposition could enhance the physical trapping of nanobubbles e g by straining effects the relative maximum nanobubble concentrations c c 0 are similar between colloids nanobubbles and colloids10x nanobubbles fig 4 b although the absolute number of the deposited colloids before nanobubble injection for colloids10x nanobubbles was larger than that for colloids nanobubbles the results indicate that the number of deposited colloids is not counted as an additional site for nanobubble attachment 3 2 release of colloids and nanobubbles during deionized water injection fig 5 a and a show the relative number concentrations of colloids and nanobubbles on the left and the relative electrical conductivity on the right axis during the deionized di water injection as a function of the pore volumes for the colloids and for the nanobubbles respectively table 2 lists the fractions of the released amount on the deposited material before deionized water injection the peak concentrations of colloids and nanobubbles were observed when the measured effluent electrical conductivity suddenly dropped light green open triangles in fig 5 because reduced ionic strength in the pore water enhances the release of deposited substances hamamoto et al 2019 torkzaban et al 2013 the release occurred simultaneously for the deposited colloids and nanobubbles which were separately and simultaneously captured by the resonant mass measurement as plotted in fig 5 a and b respectively the calculated values for the colloid and nanobubble release based on eqs 3 6 in fig 5 explain the experimental values with the fitted values of k sw listed in table 1 and with the pearson correlation coefficient for the goodness of fit r 2 the peak concentration of colloids was highest for colloids nanobubbles followed by nanobubbles colloids and colloids10x nanobubbles table 2 shows that the peak concentration is expressed well by f nr for each condition with the highest f nr value for colloids10x nanobubbles thus the findings suggest that the colloids were more irreversibly trapped on the glass bead surfaces as the input colloid concentration increased inducing physical trapping at the contacts between glass spheres e g straining table 1 shows that the higher k sw cl value for the colloids were obtained for colloids10x nanobubbles than nanobubbles colloids and colloids nanobubbles this likely indicates that the chemical disturbance more readily induced the release of the colloids interacting with other colloids as expressed by the higher values of k sw cl in the employed model similar nanobubble release behaviors were observed during the deionized water injection for colloids nanobubbles colloids10x nanobubbles and nanobubbles colloids fig 5 b the similar values of f nr among all the conditions but relatively higher values of k sw nb for nanobubbles colloids suggest that the nanobubbles deposited directly onto the glass bead surfaces are more readily released than those with and onto the deposited colloids table 1 this is likely because the zeta potential of the surface of the glass beads 89 42 mv is lower than that of the colloids 46 9 mv resulting in a stronger repulsive double layer force between the nanobubbles and glass bead surfaces than that between the nanobubbles and colloids 3 3 mode size of the effluent colloids and nanobubbles fig 6 plots the mode size of the nanobubbles blue closed squares and colloids red closed circles in the effluents as a function of the pore volumes for the colloids nanobubbles experiments during a the first injection with the colloids b second injection with the nanobubbles and c the deionized di water injection during the first and second injection phases the average mode sizes of the colloids and nanobubbles in the effluents were approximately 500 nm and 180 nm respectively lines in fig 6 a b the same findings not shown here were obtained for colloids10x nanobubbles and nanobubbles colloids the average mode sizes were the same as those of the injected colloids and nanobubbles indicating that the size change of colloids or nanobubbles possibly caused by aggregation or shrinkage is insignificant during the sequential injection of colloids and nanobubbles the same findings were also observed for the deionized di water injection in fig 6 c and support that the deposited colloids and nanobubbles were simultaneously released owing to the chemical disturbance in the pore water during the deionized di water injection the obtained mode sizes were based on the mass of each colloidal particle or nanobubble within the resonant mass measurements therefore the mode sizes close to those for the injected colloids and nanobubbles indicate the significance of the use of the resonant mass measurement on the cotransport of colloids and nanobubbles and the negligible complex formation between the colloids and nanobubbles throughout the experiments 4 conclusions this study examined the transport of nanobubbles and colloids in the presence of either deposited colloids or nanobubbles based on one dimensional column transport experiments with the sequential injection of colloids and nanobubbles we adopted resonant mass measurements to separately and simultaneously quantify nanobubbles and colloids in the mixed effluents separately the increased deposition of nanobubbles in the presence of the deposited colloids indicates that the deposited colloids likely enhanced the trapping of nanobubbles due to increased surface roughness on the glass bead and the associated decrease in the repulsive force between the nanobubbles and the solid surface the models employed for colloid and nanobubble transport successfully described the obtained effluent curves of colloids and nanobubbles during their sequential injection followed by deionized water injection the fitted model parameters also suggested that the rate of mass transfer for nanobubbles from the solid to the bulk aqueous phase during deionized water injection slowed when the nanobubbles were deposited on the glass beads and the colloid surfaces a lower zeta potential in the magnitude for the colloids than for the glass bead surfaces may decrease in the overall repulsive force between the nanobubbles and the solid surface these findings demonstrated the applicability of resonant mass measurement to investigate the cotransport problem with the coexistence of nanobubbles and colloids for the first time therefore this study

1397,nanobubbles have recently attracted much interest for their practical use and potential applications in environmental issues the pre existence of deposited colloidal particles in porous media commonly occurs when nanobubbles applied to porous media interact with deposited colloidal particles however the current understanding of the effect of the interactions with pre deposited colloidal particles on nanobubble transport in saturated porous media remains incomplete and the effects are often overlooked therefore we performed 1d column experiments with sequential injections of colloidal and nanobubble suspensions to study the effect of pre deposited materials on the retention and release of colloids and nanobubbles in packed glass beads in this study we used resonant mass measurements to measure the number concentrations of colloids and nanobubbles during transport experiments for the first time to distinguish between coexisting solid colloidal particles and nanobubbles with different buoyancies in mixed effluent during transport the nanobubble retention increased because of the pre existence of deposited colloidal particles indicating that the deposited colloidal particles act as additional deposition sites and physical obstacles for nanobubbles through physicochemical including hydrophobic interactions this study also provides a future reference for the applicability of resonant mass measurement to cotransport experiments of different buoyant particles including colloids nanobubbles and oil droplets graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nanobubble transport colloid transport deposited particles sequential injection resonant mass measurement 1 introduction the surface reactivity of nanobubbles has recently attracted much interest due to their large specific surface area and surface charges potential nanobubble applications in industrial and environmental issues include enhancement of metabolism in vegetables water treatment with flotation and enhanced water purification burns et al 1997 khuntia et al 2012 li and tsuge 2006 park and kurata 2009 additionally nanobubbles have shown considerable potential for the soil remediation of organic chemicals choi et al 2008 hu and xia 2018 jauregi and varley 1999 jenkins et al 1993 therefore understanding the nanobubble transport characteristics in soils is required for successful soil remediation and agricultural applications however fundamental studies on nanobubble behavior in porous media are limited hamamoto et al 2019 wan et al 2001 applying nanobubbles in the natural subsurface environment requires considering the interactions between nanobubbles and porous media and between nanobubbles and solid colloidal particles with various organic and inorganic sources e g clay minerals iron and aluminum oxides and humic substances bradford and torkzaban 2008 mccarthy and zachara 1989 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 interactions between various types of solid colloidal particles and bubbles are well studied from the perspective of particle separation in the flotation process ducker et al 1989 fan et al 2004 fielden et al 1996 nguyen 2007 that involves van der waals electrical double layer hydration and hydrophobic forces recent studies report that the interactions between nanobubbles and solid colloidal particles could play an important role in the stability of bulk nanobubbles in water alheshibri and craig 2019 eklund and swenson 2018 sugano et al 2017 additionally impurities such as organic substances in nanobubble suspensions could greatly contribute to nanobubble stability alheshibri and craig 2019 eklund and swenson 2018 sugano et al 2017 alheshibri and craig 2019 proposed that the compression of insoluble materials at the air water interface leads to an effective negative surface tension that counteracts the laplace pressure thereby removing the driving force to dissolve the gas within a nanobubble the transport behavior of colloidal particles in porous media depends on the flow conditions and particle grain sizes ma et al 2013 molnar et al 2015 nelson and ginn 2011 rajagopalan and tien 1976 tufenkji and elimelech 2004a yao et al 1971 and on the solution chemistry including the ph ionic strength is and ionic composition elimelech 1992 ryan et al 1999 tufenkji and elimelech 2004b zhou et al 2011 in addition ubiquitous nanoscale roughness and chemical heterogeneity on the grain surfaces in porous media locally reduce and eliminate the energy barrier to the attachment of solid colloids on the grain surfaces thereby affecting colloidal transport in porous media bradford and torkzaban 2013 ma et al 2011 recently hamamoto et al applied this concept for nanobubble transport through packed glass beads by calculating the interaction energy between nanobubbles and glass bead surfaces and considering the van der waals electrical double layer and hydrophobic interactions with surface roughness hamamoto et al 2019 they showed that the inclusion of surface roughness reduces the energy barrier between nanobubbles and glass beads which is considered a reason for the deposition of nanobubbles on the glass bead surface thus the deposition of colloidal particles onto the grain surface could influence the surface roughness and chemical heterogeneity thereby affecting nanobubble transport in porous media however experimental information regarding how the presence of the deposited solid colloidal particles affects the transport behavior of nanobubbles in a porous medium and vice versa remains insufficient several techniques are used to distinguish differently labeled solid nanoparticles vitorge et al 2014 however investigating the transport of nanobubbles with the coexistence of solid colloidal particles requires techniques to separately measure individual concentrations and sizes in a mixture of nanobubbles and solid particles the resonant mass measurement method detects and counts fine particles including bubbles in suspension kobayashi et al 2014 the center of this instrument is a microelectromechanical system mems sensor equipped with a resonant cantilever with an embedded microfluidic channel if any solid particles with a density higher than the liquid water in this case pass through the channel to reach the tip of the cantilever the resonant frequency of the cantilever shifts toward a lower frequency because of the mass change associated with the replacement of the water inside by the particles the resonant mass measurement gives opposite responses for bubbles with a density lower than that of the liquid therefore the resonant frequency shifts higher when the bubbles pass through the channel thus the resonant mass measurement distinguishes between nanobubbles and solid colloidal particles based on their buoyancy difference therefore the resonant mass measurement allows separate measurements of the number concentration and size of each nanobubble and solid colloidal particle in the mixture in this sense the resonant mass measurement method is more promising for studies on nanobubble transport with the coexistence of solid colloidal particles than widely used techniques e g dynamic light scattering laser diffraction and particle tracking analysis that cannot distinguish between nanobubbles and solid colloidal particles to our knowledge several previous studies have suggested the effectiveness of the resonant mass measurement method for investigating nanobubbles alheshibri et al 2016 azevedo et al 2019 kobayashi et al 2014 however few studies have applied the method to nanobubble transport in the presence of colloidal solid particles in a porous medium therefore this study uses resonant mass measurements and examines the effects of the presence of deposited colloidal solid particles on nanobubble transport in a porous medium and vice versa we performed one dimensional column transport experiments with sequential injections of o2 nanobubbles and carboxylated polystyrene latex particles as model microplastic particles the collected data were also compared and described with the simulated data using a mathematical model including advective and dispersive transport first order kinetic retention and transient release the findings from this study help understand the roles of nanoscale roughness and the interaction between nanobubbles and solid colloidal particles in controlling the retention and release of nanobubbles in porous media furthermore by demonstrating the applicability of resonant mass measurement to the cotransport of colloids and nanobubbles we demonstrate that resonant mass measurement is a strong tool for tackling other environmentally related cotransport problems involving contaminant particles e g micro and nano plastics metal particles and oil droplets 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials nanobubbles were generated using a pressurized dissolution instrument fzin 10 i idec co ltd japan with a supply of purified oxygen gas and ion exchanged water autostill wa53 yamato scientific co ltd japan following the same procedure as in a previous study hamamoto et al 2019 here we refer to nanobubbles as o2 nanobubbles the applied pressure of approximately 300 kpa allowed the supplied o2 gas to dissolve in water under supersaturated conditions the o2 saturated water flowed out from the instrument into a water pool under atmospheric conditions the pressure reduction causes the release of the supersaturated condition and the subsequent formation of bubbles composed of the supplied o2 gas the nanobubble generation procedure was continuously operated for approximately 1 h with 10 l of water to obtain the number concentration of nanobubbles carboxylated polystyrene latex particles colloids thermo fisher scientific were employed as model colloidal particles representing microplastic particles the colloids had ph dependent negative charges due to deprotonation of the carboxyl groups on the particle surface the diameter and density were 0 5 0 015 μm and 1 055 g cm3 respectively nacl and nahco3 jis special grade wako pure chemical industries were used to prepare the electrolyte solutions as background solution milli q water merck millipore was used for sample preparation the nacl and nahco3 concentrations were adjusted to 1 0 and 0 4 mm in the sample dispersions respectively the 0 4 mm nahco3 was also used as a ph buffer to control the ph to 7 8 the input number concentration c 0 of the nanobubbles was adjusted to approximately c 0 1 0 2 0 105 ml 1 whereas the input number concentration c 0 of carboxyl latex particles was set to c 0 1 0 and 10 0 106 ml 1 the number concentrations of each nanobubble and colloid dispersion were confirmed using a resonant mass measurement archimedes malvern instruments ltd the resonant mass measurement also provided the size distributions of the nanobubble and colloid dispersions fig 1 shows the number fraction as a percentage plotted against the diameters of the nanobubble and colloid dispersions used in this study the red solid and black dotted lines represent the colloids with concentrations of 1 0 and 10 0 106 ml 1 denoted as colloids and colloids10x respectively and the blue broken line represents the nanobubbles we used the value of 1 055 g cm3 provided by the manufacturer as the colloid density for the number concentration measurements and particle diameter calculations the nanobubble density was assumed to be the same as that of air to quantify the nanobubble number concentration and size distribution hamamoto et al 2019 the mode sizes of the nanobubbles and colloids were approximately 0 18 and 0 5 μm respectively the mode sizes of the colloids were almost the same irrespective of the number concentration as indicated by the consistency between the red solid and black dotted lines in fig 1 glass beads toshin riko co ltd japan with a diameter of 0 1 mm were used to build a model porous medium in the column transport experiments the chemical compositions of the glass beads were reported as sio2 70 73 na2o and k2o 13 16 cao 7 12 mgo 1 4 al2o3 0 5 1 5 fe2o3 0 1 0 15 and residuals 1 0 the density of the glass beads was measured as 2 48 g cm3 with a pycnometer before use the glass beads were thoroughly cleaned to remove organic and other impurities using the same method as in a previous study tufenkji and elimelech 2004b we measured the zeta potentials of the colloids nanobubbles and glass beads under the same solution conditions of the column transport experiments namely 1 mm nacl and 0 4 mm nahco3 the zeta potentials of the colloids and nanobubbles were measured by electrophoretic measurements zeecom microtec co ltd streaming potential measurements zetacad cad instruments france were used to measure the zeta potential of the glass beads the measured zeta potentials of the colloids nanobubbles and glass beads were 46 9 31 3 and 89 4 mv respectively 2 2 column transport experiments with sequential injection we used a column setup composed of an acrylic cylinder with a height of 6 05 cm and diameter of 5 0 cm fig 2 we followed the procedure described in the literature to prepare the setup hamamoto et al 2019 2018 2017 nylon fiber with a mesh spacing of 70 μm was positioned at the bottom and top of each column to keep the packed glass beads within the column the thickness of the nylon membrane of a few micrometers was much thinner than the column height the test to measure colloid and nanobubble effluent concentrations from the same column setup with the membranes without packing glass beads showed no attachment of colloids and nanobubbles to the membranes the column was packed with glass beads under water saturation with a dry bulk density of 1 57 g cm3 which corresponds to a porosity of 0 37 cm3 cm3 the packed column was flushed with 1 mm hcl aqueous solution ph 3 to allow the dissolution of na2o and cao near the surface of the glass beads without raising the solution ph to levels where the silica matrix could dissolve litton and olson 1993 the background electrolyte solution was injected using a peristaltic pump until the ph electrical conductivity ec and effluent turbidity were equilibrated then the colloidal suspension or nanobubble suspension was injected into the column for six pore volumes and followed by the background solution for another five pore volumes subsequently the nanobubble or colloid suspension was injected into the column after the injection of the colloid or nanobubble suspension and the followed background solution to examine the effects of the deposited nanobubbles or colloids on the subsequent transport of the colloids and nanobubbles here we refer to the experiment as nanobubbles colloids when the nanobubble suspension was injected before the colloid suspension we refer to the experiments as colloids nanobubbles and colloids10x nanobubbles when the colloid suspension at the concentrations of 1 0 and 10 0 106 ml 1 respectively was injected before the nanobubble suspension the background solution was injected into the column for five pore volumes then deionized di water was injected into the column to investigate the effects of reducing the salt concentration upon release of the nanobubbles and colloids the sequential injection experiments were conducted under a constant water flux of 6 2 10 3 cm s the effluents were collected at intervals of approximately 0 3 pore volumes throughout the experiments the ph ec and turbidity were measured for all samples the number concentration and size distribution of colloids and nanobubbles were measured with the resonant mass instrument for selected samples and are crucial for investigating the transport phenomena in the presence of nanobubbles and colloids the resonant mass measurement distinguished between the different buoyancies of the colloids and nanobubbles in the mixed effluent from the column during transport experiments with sequential injection these breakthrough curve experiments were replicated three times to check the reproducibility of the experiments 2 3 mathematical modeling for colloid and nanobubble transport the transport of colloids and nanobubbles through porous media can be described by considering advection hydrodynamic dispersion and deposition hamamoto et al 2019 torkzaban et al 2013 during the nanobubble and colloid injection phases we employed the following aqueous and solid phase mass balance equations with a first order kinetic term for the deposition of colloids and nanobubbles 1 θ w c t z θ w d h c z v c z k d θ w c 2 ρ b s t k d θ w c where c cm 3 is the number concentration of colloids or nanobubbles in the liquid phase θ w is the volumetric water content t s is time z cm is the spatial position along the flow direction v cm s is the applied water flux d h λv cm2 s is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient λ cm is the dispersivity and k d min 1 is the deposition rate coefficient for colloids or nanobubbles from the liquid phase onto the grains we denote k d as k d nb for nanobubbles and k d cl for colloids s is the concentration of colloids or nanobubbles on the grains and ρ b is the dry bulk density of the packed column the following calculations used the dispersivity value λ 0 1 cm which is based on the tracer experiments reported in a previous work hamamoto et al 2019 here in eqs 1 and 2 we did not include the blocking effect used in the literature hamamoto et al 2019 torkzaban et al 2013 to simplify our analysis because we did not observe such an effect throughout our experiments a similar formula to express the attachment term is widely accepted in the transport model for colloidal particles hamamoto et al 2017 tufenkji and elimelech 2004b the release of deposited colloids and nanobubbles is expected during the injection of deionized water due to the reduction of ionic strength and the subsequent increase of electrical double layer repulsion between colloids nanobubbles and grains at the front between displacing deionized water and displaced background salt solution to model this process we employed a set of equations by combining the mass balance equations for ions colloids and nanobubbles including their release kinetics as follows hamamoto et al 2019 torkzaban et al 2013 3 θ w c ion t z θ w d h c ion z v c ion z 4 θ w c t z θ w d h c z v c z ρ b k rel s f nr s i 5 ρ b s t ρ b k rel s f nr s i 6 k rel k sw h 0 s f nr s i h 0 0 5 c ion i c ion where c ion is the bulk concentration of the ions in the liquid phase k rel and k sw min 1 are the release rate and mass transfer coefficient for colloids or nanobubbles from the grains to the liquid phase respectively f nr is the fraction of deposited colloids or nanobubbles that are not released irrespective of the reducing ionic strength we denote the values of k sw and f nr for nanobubbles and colloids as k sw nb k sw cl f nr nb and f nr cl in the same manner as for k d s i is the value of s for colloids and nanobubbles at the beginning of the injection of deionized water namely after the sequential injection of colloids and nanobubbles c ion i is the ion concentration of the background salt solution h 0 x is the heaviside function h 0 s f nr s i in eq 6 is equal to 1 when s f nr s i and 0 when s f nr s i thereby stopping the release of nanobubbles and colloids after s reaches f nr s i and all releasable fractions are released moreover h 0 0 5c ion i c ion is equal to 1 when c ion 0 5c ion i and 0 when c ion 0 5c ion i thereby starting the release of nanobubbles and colloids after c ion declines to 0 5c ion i due to the reduction of ionic strength by displacement of the background salt solution to the deionized di water we determined the value of f nr as f nr s eq s i where s eq is the value of s at the equilibrium i e the end of the deionized water injection where we assume that there is no further release of colloids and nanobubbles at a given position hence determining the value of f nr from the mass balance calculation throughout the column transport experiments is straightforward table 1 we used comsol multiphysics version 5 4 comsol inc to solve eqs 1 6 the parameters k d and k sw for the colloids and nanobubbles were estimated by fitting the simulated effluent concentrations of the colloids and nanobubbles to the experimental values with the software optimization module we represented the ion concentration as the measured value of ec in the effluent we set the initial concentrations in the liquid phase and on the grains for colloids and nanobubbles to zero before sequential injection a flux boundary condition corresponding to the supplied suspensions for a given period was imposed on the inlet boundary a zero concentration gradient was imposed on the outlet boundary 3 results and discussion 3 1 transport of colloids and nanobubbles during sequential injection the relative number concentrations of colloids and nanobubbles at the effluent scaled by the input concentration c c 0 were plotted against the pore volume in figs 3 and 4 the symbols represent the experimental values measured using the resonant mass instrument the lines in figs 3 and 4 represent the calculations based on eqs 1 and 2 respectively the calculated breakthrough curves in figs 3 and 4 appropriately describe the experimental results with the fitted values of k d k d nb for the nanobubbles or k d cl for the colloids and the pearson correlation coefficient for the goodness of fit r 2 table 2 table 1 provides the fractions of retention for the colloids and nanobubbles during the first injection phases with the colloids for colloids nanobubbles red closed circles and colloids10x nanobubbles black closed diamonds fig 3 a the breakthrough and breakdown of the colloids occurred at approximately 1 0 pore volume after the injection of the colloids and background solution and showed no colloid retardation the maximum relative effluent concentration c c 0 of approximately 0 5 was comparable to the concentrations obtained under experimental conditions this result means that half of the injected colloids were trapped in the porous medium whereas the input concentration of the colloids did not affect the transport of the colloids in the porous medium however the dependence of colloidal transport on the input concentration has been reported in the literature bradford et al 2011 2009 liu et al 1995 tan et al 1994 the retention of colloidal particles in a porous medium decreases owing to the blocking phenomena with increasing input number concentration and increase the effluent concentration however bradford et al also showed that the concentration dependency becomes less significant when the input number concentration is lower than 108 ml 1 based on a numerical simulation with a particle size of 500 nm which is similar to the one employed in this study bradford et al 2011 this simulation rationalizes our observed insignificance of concentration dependency in the breakthrough curves because the injected number concentrations of the colloids were 106 and 107 ml 1 in colloids nanobubbles and colloids10x nanobubbles respectively the absolute amount of the retained colloids in the case of colloids10x nanobubbles should be 10 times higher than that in the case of colloids nanobubbles even though the relative effluent concentrations showed similar values among the two different colloid input concentrations the resonant mass measurements also confirmed that the effluent colloid concentrations were quite low during the second injection phases with the nanobubbles after the first colloid injection for colloids nanobubbles red closed circles and colloids10x nanobubbles black closed diamonds in fig 3 b thus the nanobubbles injected after the colloids did not cause significant detachment of the deposited colloids therefore the removal of polystyrene latex particles from the porous medium was barely enhanced by nanobubble injection in this study consequently enhancing the removal effect of nanobubbles requires functionalizing nanobubbles with surfactants and other combinations of target colloidal particles e g other microplastic or metal oxide colloids to tune the surface properties of nanobubbles and their interactions with colloids another option could be increasing the flow velocity and nanobubble concentration to enhance the possibility of collision between colloids and nanobubbles due to the increased flux towards the glass beads these aspects can be addressed with a resonant mass instrument in future studies the breakthrough curve of the colloids during the second injection phase with the colloids after the first nanobubble injection for nanobubbles colloids red open circles fig 3 b was similar to those for colloids nanobubbles and colloids10x nanobubbles fig 3 a indicating that the deposited nanobubbles did not influence the transport behavior of the colloids this observation was also supported by the similar values of k d cl in the calculations for the different conditions because the size and injected concentration of the nanobubbles were smaller than those of colloids the deposited nanobubbles might not be sufficient to affect solid surface characteristics such as surface roughness we do not currently have direct evidence to clarify why the deposited nanobubbles did not affect the transport behavior of the colloids thus the characteristics of deposited nanobubbles i e shape and location should be further investigated by measuring the surface roughness of glass beads using atomic force microscopy in future studies elzbieciak wodka et al 2014 during the first nanobubble injection phase blue open squares for nanobubbles colloids the breakthrough and breakdown occurred at 1 0 pore volume after the injection of the nanobubbles and background solution showed no nanobubble retardation fig 4 a similar to the transport of colloids shown in fig 3 a the maximum relative effluent concentration was 0 5 1 0 indicating that the nanobubbles were partially deposited in the porous medium thus both pre injected colloids and nanobubbles were partially deposited inside the column during the first injection phase with colloids or nanobubbles moreover the breakthrough curve of colloids for colloids nanobubbles in fig 3 a was similar to that of nanobubbles for nanobubbles colloids fig 4 a the zeta potential of colloids 46 9 mv was lower than that of nanobubbles 31 3 mv suggesting that the electrical double layer interaction between the colloids and the surface of the glass beads is more repulsive than that between the nanobubbles and glass bead surfaces however the filtration theory predicts that smaller colloids i e nanobubbles approximately 180 nm in size are more efficiently removed from the liquid phase than larger colloids i e colloids measuring approximately 500 nm because of the greater rates of mass transfer to the solid phase nelson and ginn 2011 tufenkji and elimelech 2004a the resonant mass measurements also showed that no nanobubbles were present in the effluents during the second injection phase with the colloids for nanobubbles colloids blue open squares in fig 4 b suggesting that the colloids injected after the nanobubbles did not significantly cause the detachment of the deposited nanobubbles comparing the results for the nanobubbles reveals that the breakthrough curve during the first nanobubble injection blue open squares in fig 4 a exhibited a higher maximum relative concentration c c 0 than those during the second nanobubble injection after the colloid injection for colloids nanobubbles blue closed squares and colloids10x nanobubbles black opened diamonds fig 4 b this result suggests that the deposited colloids inhibited nanobubble transport in the porous medium the calculations describe the inhibited transport of the nanobubbles with increased k d nb for the nanobubbles the increase in k d nb is rationalized by the increased surface roughness of the glass beads due to the deposited colloids thus increasing the surface roughness reduces the energy barrier between colloidal particles and the grain surface as reported in the literature bradford and torkzaban 2013 hamamoto et al 2019 in addition colloid deposition could enhance the physical trapping of nanobubbles e g by straining effects the relative maximum nanobubble concentrations c c 0 are similar between colloids nanobubbles and colloids10x nanobubbles fig 4 b although the absolute number of the deposited colloids before nanobubble injection for colloids10x nanobubbles was larger than that for colloids nanobubbles the results indicate that the number of deposited colloids is not counted as an additional site for nanobubble attachment 3 2 release of colloids and nanobubbles during deionized water injection fig 5 a and a show the relative number concentrations of colloids and nanobubbles on the left and the relative electrical conductivity on the right axis during the deionized di water injection as a function of the pore volumes for the colloids and for the nanobubbles respectively table 2 lists the fractions of the released amount on the deposited material before deionized water injection the peak concentrations of colloids and nanobubbles were observed when the measured effluent electrical conductivity suddenly dropped light green open triangles in fig 5 because reduced ionic strength in the pore water enhances the release of deposited substances hamamoto et al 2019 torkzaban et al 2013 the release occurred simultaneously for the deposited colloids and nanobubbles which were separately and simultaneously captured by the resonant mass measurement as plotted in fig 5 a and b respectively the calculated values for the colloid and nanobubble release based on eqs 3 6 in fig 5 explain the experimental values with the fitted values of k sw listed in table 1 and with the pearson correlation coefficient for the goodness of fit r 2 the peak concentration of colloids was highest for colloids nanobubbles followed by nanobubbles colloids and colloids10x nanobubbles table 2 shows that the peak concentration is expressed well by f nr for each condition with the highest f nr value for colloids10x nanobubbles thus the findings suggest that the colloids were more irreversibly trapped on the glass bead surfaces as the input colloid concentration increased inducing physical trapping at the contacts between glass spheres e g straining table 1 shows that the higher k sw cl value for the colloids were obtained for colloids10x nanobubbles than nanobubbles colloids and colloids nanobubbles this likely indicates that the chemical disturbance more readily induced the release of the colloids interacting with other colloids as expressed by the higher values of k sw cl in the employed model similar nanobubble release behaviors were observed during the deionized water injection for colloids nanobubbles colloids10x nanobubbles and nanobubbles colloids fig 5 b the similar values of f nr among all the conditions but relatively higher values of k sw nb for nanobubbles colloids suggest that the nanobubbles deposited directly onto the glass bead surfaces are more readily released than those with and onto the deposited colloids table 1 this is likely because the zeta potential of the surface of the glass beads 89 42 mv is lower than that of the colloids 46 9 mv resulting in a stronger repulsive double layer force between the nanobubbles and glass bead surfaces than that between the nanobubbles and colloids 3 3 mode size of the effluent colloids and nanobubbles fig 6 plots the mode size of the nanobubbles blue closed squares and colloids red closed circles in the effluents as a function of the pore volumes for the colloids nanobubbles experiments during a the first injection with the colloids b second injection with the nanobubbles and c the deionized di water injection during the first and second injection phases the average mode sizes of the colloids and nanobubbles in the effluents were approximately 500 nm and 180 nm respectively lines in fig 6 a b the same findings not shown here were obtained for colloids10x nanobubbles and nanobubbles colloids the average mode sizes were the same as those of the injected colloids and nanobubbles indicating that the size change of colloids or nanobubbles possibly caused by aggregation or shrinkage is insignificant during the sequential injection of colloids and nanobubbles the same findings were also observed for the deionized di water injection in fig 6 c and support that the deposited colloids and nanobubbles were simultaneously released owing to the chemical disturbance in the pore water during the deionized di water injection the obtained mode sizes were based on the mass of each colloidal particle or nanobubble within the resonant mass measurements therefore the mode sizes close to those for the injected colloids and nanobubbles indicate the significance of the use of the resonant mass measurement on the cotransport of colloids and nanobubbles and the negligible complex formation between the colloids and nanobubbles throughout the experiments 4 conclusions this study examined the transport of nanobubbles and colloids in the presence of either deposited colloids or nanobubbles based on one dimensional column transport experiments with the sequential injection of colloids and nanobubbles we adopted resonant mass measurements to separately and simultaneously quantify nanobubbles and colloids in the mixed effluents separately the increased deposition of nanobubbles in the presence of the deposited colloids indicates that the deposited colloids likely enhanced the trapping of nanobubbles due to increased surface roughness on the glass bead and the associated decrease in the repulsive force between the nanobubbles and the solid surface the models employed for colloid and nanobubble transport successfully described the obtained effluent curves of colloids and nanobubbles during their sequential injection followed by deionized water injection the fitted model parameters also suggested that the rate of mass transfer for nanobubbles from the solid to the bulk aqueous phase during deionized water injection slowed when the nanobubbles were deposited on the glass beads and the colloid surfaces a lower zeta potential in the magnitude for the colloids than for the glass bead surfaces may decrease in the overall repulsive force between the nanobubbles and the solid surface these findings demonstrated the applicability of resonant mass measurement to investigate the cotransport problem with the coexistence of nanobubbles and colloids for the first time therefore this study

1398,heavy metal hv pollutants may migrate to the groundwater environment through leaching causing groundwater pollution compared with surface water pollution groundwater pollution is complex and hidden existing methods for treating hv pollution in the vadose zone have had limited application owing to various problems in recent years microorganisms have been used in the field of pollution control and remediation owing to their outstanding adsorption and degradation properties and low cost but their environmental safety and behavior in porous media are still poorly understood this study aimed to investigate the migration behavior and mechanisms of copper ions in saturated porous media under the action of copper resistant microorganisms and to establish a corresponding numerical model to simulate the results the key parameters of adsorption and migration were determined through batch adsorption and soil column experiments a one dimensional soil column was used to conduct a co migration experiment using copper resistant microorganisms and cu2 in water saturated quartz sand and a co migration mathematical model was constructed it was found that the existence of microorganisms had an inhibitory effect on the migration of cu2 in quartz sand and cu2 promoted the migration of microorganisms reduced their adsorption and increased their concentration in the column experiment effluent the selected solute transport mathematical model had a good fitting effect on the breakthrough curves of copper ion and copper resistant microorganisms during their co migration the results can provide parameters and a theoretical basis for the risk assessment and prevention of hv pollution in the saturated zone or aquifers keywords microorganisms copper ions co migration column experiment numerical simulation 1 introduction with the development of science and technology and the improvement in people s living standards our environment has inevitably become polluted by contaminants such as heavy metals hvs and toxic organics these contaminants can considerably degrade soil and groundwater quality owing to their low rates of degradation ease of accumulation and potential health impacts in particular high concentrations of hvs in soil affect soil fertility ecosystems and human health hence their remediation has attracted considerable attention gustave et al 2020 järup 2003 kampa and castanas 2008 soil pollution treatment is a topic of global importance and various experimental studies have been conducted in this regard babel and kurniawan 2003 fu and wang 2011 hua et al 2012 min et al 2020 wang et al 2020b at present the methods used to remediate contaminated soil include physical chemical electrochemical and biological remediation technologies mohan and pittman 2007 muya et al 2015 muyzer and stams 2008 for instance sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops have attracted increasing attention for the removal of organic contaminants in recent years xiao et al 2020 some emerging materials have also been applied to soil remediation carbon nanomaterials cnms can adsorb hvs antibiotics and harmful gases however their environmental toxicity remains to be determined peng et al 2020 photocatalysts are also a research hotspot and are widely used in environmental remediation liang et al 2021a wu et al 2020 pan et al 2020 fan et al 2021 copper is a major hv contaminant in a small amounts it is important for the health of plants and human bodies civardi et al 2015 kumar et al 2020 liu et al 2020 however once it exceeds a certain concentration copper can cause plant dysplasia and irreparable organ damage and physiological diseases in humans nagajyoti et al 2010 tapiero et al 2003 wang et al 2020a in recent years with the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production hv pollution in the environment has become increasingly severe and the copper content in industrial and agricultural soils often exceeds the acceptable background levels many times over the extensive use of copper containing fungicides mining of copper ore and discharge of wastewater waste gas and waste residues in industrial production have caused the copper content in soils to exceed environmental standards and far exceed the carrying capacity of the soil environment the use of copper containing sludge irrigation using copper containing wastewater and spraying of copper containing pesticides in agricultural production can all cause copper to accumulate in the soil resulting in soil degradation and pollution researchers have found that the migration of hvs in natural porous media is affected by many factors such as fertilization adsorption desorption the physical and chemical properties of the media and the antagonistic and synergistic effects of metal elements cai et al 2020 li et al 2019 ranieri and young 2012 xu and liu 2008 xu et al 2019 owing to the strong adsorption of copper ions copper in soil is traditionally regarded as largely immobile and some copper ions are considered likely to be retained in the soil medium liu et al 2019 shahrashoub and bakhtiari 2020 when using traditional soil remediation technology to treat hv pollution in soil the engineering challenges involved and the risk of secondary pollution have prompted researchers to seek new remediation technologies bioremediation a method that uses plants animals and especially microorganisms to degrade or inhibit hv pollution in soils is of increasing interest in the field microorganisms can be used to remediate contaminated sites control the migration of pollutants and decompose toxic substances in both soil and groundwater microbial remediation technology has attracted public attention due to its advantages of safety thoroughness low cost and lack of secondary pollution ahluwalia and goyal 2007 gustave et al 2020 malik 2004 microorganisms especially bacteria are charged large in number and specific surface area and have strong metabolic activities which can affect hv adsorption in addition the pollutants that are strongly adsorbed on the surface of the microorganisms will vary depending on the movement and retention of the microorganisms therefore studying the co migration mechanism of hvs and microorganisms is an important research direction for the remediation of hv pollution at present and in the future for this reason in the present study to investigate the migration behavior and mechanisms of copper ions in saturated porous media under the action of copper resistant microorganisms bulk adsorption experiments were performed after screening out copper resistant microorganisms a static test was carried out using low reactivity quartz sand as the test medium to simulate the common porous medium in the saturated zone an isothermal batch adsorption test was used to determine the type of adsorption an adsorption kinetics test was used to obtain the mass transfer kinetic parameters and distribution coefficient and an adsorption thermodynamics test was used to understand the extent and driving force of the adsorption process based on the static test a one dimensional saturated quartz sand column was used to conduct a co migration test of copper resistant microorganisms and cu2 and a co migration mathematical model was constructed to investigate the migration and transformation mechanisms of microorganisms and copper in the saturated zone copper behavior in the saturated zone was then quantitatively evaluated to provide a scientific basis for the establishment of theories and methods for evaluating the remediation behavior of soil hv pollution microbial remediation of hv pollution and environmentally safe transformation of engineering bacteria within a saturated zone or aquifer 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials quartz sand copper ions and copper resistant microorganisms were the main research objects and materials for the batch adsorption and column experiments in this study the use of low reactivity quartz sand as a medium during the experiments not only precludes the influence of organic matter in the soil but also maintains the particle size as homogeneously as possible quartz sand with a sio2 content of near 100 and fe2o3 content of less than 0 005 was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd it has stable chemical properties and strong corrosion resistance the sieved particle size ranged from 0 25 to 0 54 mm with a d50 of 0 31 mm after 2 h of soaking in deionized water and 24 h of soaking in dilute hydrochloric acid the quartz sand was washed with deionized water until the ph of the supernatant was neutral and then sterilized three times at 121 c for 3 h with a sterilization time interval of 24 h copper ions were selected as the metal solute in this study since they contribute to a wide range of pollution and have low toxicity single valence and stable properties the results can provide a reference for related research on highly toxic hvs with similar migration characteristics to copper ions indigenous microorganisms in the subsurface are more adaptable to the underground environment and are more capable of inhibiting soil hv pollution than exogenous microorganisms the target bacteria were screened from farmland soil with elevated copper concentrations to improve the tolerance of copper resistant microorganisms the gradient pressure domestication method was first used to remove non target bacteria thereafter the bacterial culture was removed diluted separated and finally purified repeatedly a copper resistant strain was isolated and identified as klebsiella oxytoca by 16srdna sequence identification fig 1 and called klebsiella oxytoca ly the strain characteristics are listed in table 1 2 2 batch adsorption experiments static batch adsorption experiments including equilibrium adsorption and adsorption kinetics experiments were carried out using microorganisms quartz sand and copper ions the results were fitted with isothermal adsorption models table 2 and adsorption kinetic models table 3 to obtain the distribution coefficient adsorption coefficient desorption coefficient and other parameters required for numerical simulation of the co transport of microorganisms and copper ions 2 3 column experiments to explore the co migration mechanisms of microorganisms and copper in the saturated zone a soil column experimental device was designed fig 2 the device consisted of a water supply system a soil column system and a sampling system the water supply system included a liquid container a peristaltic pump and a silicone tube the soil column was made of plexiglass and the effective soil column length was 20 cm with an inner diameter of 5 cm lewis and sjöstrom 2010 a layer of filter paper and a layer of 70 mesh nylon yarn were placed on the top and bottom of the simulation column to ensure the uniformity of the water flow the columns were placed upright in an incubator with an ambient temperature of 4 c the basic parameters of the columns are listed in table 4 one dimensional dispersion experiments were conducted using nacl as a tracer to obtain parameters such as the dispersion coefficient of the soil column soil column experiments were also conducted to simulate the migration behavior of microorganisms and pollutant copper ions to reduce the effect of gravity on the experimental results the experiment used a bottom up water flow and the temperature was controlled at 4 0 5 c sterile deionized water saturated the soil column from the bottom to the top when the outflow of the column remained stable the inlet fluid was quickly switched to add four pore volumes of a bacterial suspension of known concentration a copper ion solution or a mixed solution of both during flow the outflow was measured and effluent was collected after 1 h the inflow was switched to sterile deionized water the initial injection concentration of the bacterial suspension was 1 107 cfu ml and the copper concentration in the copper ion solution was 50 mg l as the bacteria we used in the experiment were acid resistant we added kh2po4 into the bacterial suspension to control ph to around 5 5 chloride ion concentration was measured by ion chromatography cu2 concentration was measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer and turbidimetry was used for microorganism measurements foppen et al 2005 2 4 numerical simulation 2 4 1 hydrodynamic model the galerkin finite element

the microorganism transport model was based on the traditional microbial cde eq 4 compere et al 2001 4 θ w c c t ρ s c t θ w d c 2 c c x 2 q c c c x where θw is the water content that the

hvs in the soil is complicated by environmental factors and conditions and because their break through curves btcs are asymmetric with evident tailing phenomena it cannot be described by a simple

migration of microorganisms and copper ion in saturated porous media the co migration of microorganisms and hvs can be conceptualized as a two phase six component system as shown in fig 3 the two

equation solving and model validation three steps were adopted to verify the reliability of model simulation results 1 cxtfit software was used to obtain the pore water flow velocity v k rw and the dispersion coefficient d based on the tracer ion breakthrough curve tang et al 2010 toride 1995 2 the adsorption analytical model and the internal optimization process of hydrus 1d were used to analyze the microbial breakthrough curve to estimate the characteristics of water flow and microbial migration simunek 2005 in general the dispersion coefficient d c of microorganisms is larger than the dispersion coefficient d of the tracer in the soil however because the size of the microorganisms is smaller than the size of the pores in the medium the particle diameters of the microorganisms and tracer ions are essentially the same therefore the pore water velocity and dispersion coefficient of the tracer ions were used to analyze the breakthrough curve of microorganisms to obtain parameters such as k ac d c k dc and k rc 3 the breakthrough curves of cu2 were used to fit and verify the migration model parameters such as k rw d k ac k dc k amc and k dmc were obtained from breakthrough curves of tracer ions and microorganisms as well as batch adsorption experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth curve of copper resistant microorganisms klebsiella oxytoca ly was in a low activity period from 0 to 1 5 h when cultured at 37 c fig 4 during this period because the bacteria had just been inoculated into the culture medium adaptation to the new environment was needed so the strains grew slowly after 1 5 h klebsiella oxytoca ly entered the logarithmic phase during which time the bacteria grew more rapidly from 10 to 20 h klebsiella oxytoca ly was in a stable period and the reproduction and decay rates were equal after 20 h the bacteria began to decay according to the growth characteristics of the bacteria the bacterial solution in the later logarithmic phase 10 15 h was selected for the adsorption experiments moreover under the condition of 4 c the metabolic activity of the bacteria was extremely slow and its growth curve was stable with almost no quantitative changes this demonstrated that in this experiment with ambient temperature maintained at 4 c significant bacterial reproduction and death were avoided 3 2 results of batch adsorption experiments 3 2 1 microorganisms and quartz sand the measured regression curves of the four types of equilibrium adsorption are shown in fig 5 the corresponding adsorption parameters for the four groups of equilibrium are shown in table 5 as shown in fig 5 and table 5 the adsorption of microorganisms in soil is more consistent with the equilibrium adsorption characteristics of the freundlich adsorption equation with a correlation of 99 4 experiments with soil water ratios of 1 1 and 1 2 mccaulou et al 1994 were repeated from which the ranges of the distribution coefficient k of the bacteria were found to be from 0 127 to 0 3 ml g huysman and verstraete 1993 and the exponential constants n were mostly between 0 96 and 1 07 the equilibrium adsorption coefficient values obtained from repeated experiments were not the same which may have been caused by the different properties such as charge hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the bacteria and soil some results indicated that the soil water ratio also had a great impact on the determination of the adsorption coefficient during the experiment therefore an appropriate soil water ratio should be selected in this experiment the soil water ratio was set as 1 2 adsorption kinetics experiments showed that the soil adsorption of microorganisms basically reached equilibrium in 1 h fig 6 the microbial adsorption kinetics were investigated before the microorganisms reached adsorption equilibrium the linear relationship between ln c c0 ξ 1 c c0 k in the quartz sand and time t was obtained with a correlation coefficient of 93 60 the reversible adsorption constant was 0 334 s 1 the reversible desorption constant was 0 06 s 1 and r2 was 0 8717 as calculated from the physical properties of the quartz sand and theta value therefore microorganisms should be retained in the porous media 3 2 2 copper and quartz sand the langmuir equation provided a good fit to the batch adsorption experiments data for evaluation of the adsorption affinity of quartz sand for cu with a correlation coefficient of 0 91 and a distribution coefficient k of 0 092 mg l fig 7 table 6 the retention and release of copper in the soil had a large variation range reflecting a complex retention mechanism therefore not all the retention effects and migration behaviors of copper in the soil under different initial concentration conditions can be modelled with a good fit in addition it was found that copper adsorption capacity of the medium was not reached during the experiment therefore it is necessary to take appropriate physical chemical and biological measures to promote the absorption of copper by the soil and to maintain its stability only when the transport of copper in the soil is properly controlled can the hazards caused by copper to the environment be reduced and curbed 3 2 3 copper and microorganisms the temkin equation provided a good fit to the experimental data and could be used to evaluate the adsorption

matlab 3 3 breakthrough curve as shown in fig 10 the soil column experiment showed that the penetration time of the bacteria was shorter than for the tracer cl which agrees with the findings of sinton et al 2010 this was mainly due to the large number of negative charges carried on the surface of the microorganisms and the soil the same charges repel each other which makes the bacteria penetrate earlier meanwhile the size exclusion effect of the soil medium pang et al 2005 causes the microorganisms to move only in larger pores resulting in the actual velocity of the microorganisms being faster than the non reactive solute cl in addition to the reversible adsorption process when the bacterial liquid is transported alone in the soil there will also be an irreversible retention phenomenon the specific manifestation is that the btc peak of the microorganism is significantly lower than that of the tracer the retention phenomenon can be explained by the theory of pore bridge

of asymmetry the adsorption stage of the early half becomes steeper while the desorption stage of the later half flattens and has a longer tail this is caused by a larger adsorption capacity slower desorption rate and differences in chemical adsorption sites in the case of the co migration of microbes and copper it can be observed that the presence of microbes increases the penetration time of cu2 and decreases the peak concentration of cu2 in the outflow indicating that the presence of microbes has an inhibitory effect on the migration of cu2 in the porous medium the mixture of microorganisms and cu2 enters the quartz sand which reduces the electrokinetic potential chargeability repulsion potential and aggregation stability of the microorganisms so that it forms a co precipitate with cu2 and separates cu2 from the mobile phase because cu2 can undergo complex chelation reactions with microorganisms some microorganisms and the adsorbed cu2 coagulate on the surface of the quartz sand hence reducing the outflow concentration further because of co migration the adsorption sites on the surface of the quartz sand are limited the competitive adsorption of cu2 and

1398,heavy metal hv pollutants may migrate to the groundwater environment through leaching causing groundwater pollution compared with surface water pollution groundwater pollution is complex and hidden existing methods for treating hv pollution in the vadose zone have had limited application owing to various problems in recent years microorganisms have been used in the field of pollution control and remediation owing to their outstanding adsorption and degradation properties and low cost but their environmental safety and behavior in porous media are still poorly understood this study aimed to investigate the migration behavior and mechanisms of copper ions in saturated porous media under the action of copper resistant microorganisms and to establish a corresponding numerical model to simulate the results the key parameters of adsorption and migration were determined through batch adsorption and soil column experiments a one dimensional soil column was used to conduct a co migration experiment using copper resistant microorganisms and cu2 in water saturated quartz sand and a co migration mathematical model was constructed it was found that the existence of microorganisms had an inhibitory effect on the migration of cu2 in quartz sand and cu2 promoted the migration of microorganisms reduced their adsorption and increased their concentration in the column experiment effluent the selected solute transport mathematical model had a good fitting effect on the breakthrough curves of copper ion and copper resistant microorganisms during their co migration the results can provide parameters and a theoretical basis for the risk assessment and prevention of hv pollution in the saturated zone or aquifers keywords microorganisms copper ions co migration column experiment numerical simulation 1 introduction with the development of science and technology and the improvement in people s living standards our environment has inevitably become polluted by contaminants such as heavy metals hvs and toxic organics these contaminants can considerably degrade soil and groundwater quality owing to their low rates of degradation ease of accumulation and potential health impacts in particular high concentrations of hvs in soil affect soil fertility ecosystems and human health hence their remediation has attracted considerable attention gustave et al 2020 järup 2003 kampa and castanas 2008 soil pollution treatment is a topic of global importance and various experimental studies have been conducted in this regard babel and kurniawan 2003 fu and wang 2011 hua et al 2012 min et al 2020 wang et al 2020b at present the methods used to remediate contaminated soil include physical chemical electrochemical and biological remediation technologies mohan and pittman 2007 muya et al 2015 muyzer and stams 2008 for instance sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops have attracted increasing attention for the removal of organic contaminants in recent years xiao et al 2020 some emerging materials have also been applied to soil remediation carbon nanomaterials cnms can adsorb hvs antibiotics and harmful gases however their environmental toxicity remains to be determined peng et al 2020 photocatalysts are also a research hotspot and are widely used in environmental remediation liang et al 2021a wu et al 2020 pan et al 2020 fan et al 2021 copper is a major hv contaminant in a small amounts it is important for the health of plants and human bodies civardi et al 2015 kumar et al 2020 liu et al 2020 however once it exceeds a certain concentration copper can cause plant dysplasia and irreparable organ damage and physiological diseases in humans nagajyoti et al 2010 tapiero et al 2003 wang et al 2020a in recent years with the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production hv pollution in the environment has become increasingly severe and the copper content in industrial and agricultural soils often exceeds the acceptable background levels many times over the extensive use of copper containing fungicides mining of copper ore and discharge of wastewater waste gas and waste residues in industrial production have caused the copper content in soils to exceed environmental standards and far exceed the carrying capacity of the soil environment the use of copper containing sludge irrigation using copper containing wastewater and spraying of copper containing pesticides in agricultural production can all cause copper to accumulate in the soil resulting in soil degradation and pollution researchers have found that the migration of hvs in natural porous media is affected by many factors such as fertilization adsorption desorption the physical and chemical properties of the media and the antagonistic and synergistic effects of metal elements cai et al 2020 li et al 2019 ranieri and young 2012 xu and liu 2008 xu et al 2019 owing to the strong adsorption of copper ions copper in soil is traditionally regarded as largely immobile and some copper ions are considered likely to be retained in the soil medium liu et al 2019 shahrashoub and bakhtiari 2020 when using traditional soil remediation technology to treat hv pollution in soil the engineering challenges involved and the risk of secondary pollution have prompted researchers to seek new remediation technologies bioremediation a method that uses plants animals and especially microorganisms to degrade or inhibit hv pollution in soils is of increasing interest in the field microorganisms can be used to remediate contaminated sites control the migration of pollutants and decompose toxic substances in both soil and groundwater microbial remediation technology has attracted public attention due to its advantages of safety thoroughness low cost and lack of secondary pollution ahluwalia and goyal 2007 gustave et al 2020 malik 2004 microorganisms especially bacteria are charged large in number and specific surface area and have strong metabolic activities which can affect hv adsorption in addition the pollutants that are strongly adsorbed on the surface of the microorganisms will vary depending on the movement and retention of the microorganisms therefore studying the co migration mechanism of hvs and microorganisms is an important research direction for the remediation of hv pollution at present and in the future for this reason in the present study to investigate the migration behavior and mechanisms of copper ions in saturated porous media under the action of copper resistant microorganisms bulk adsorption experiments were performed after screening out copper resistant microorganisms a static test was carried out using low reactivity quartz sand as the test medium to simulate the common porous medium in the saturated zone an isothermal batch adsorption test was used to determine the type of adsorption an adsorption kinetics test was used to obtain the mass transfer kinetic parameters and distribution coefficient and an adsorption thermodynamics test was used to understand the extent and driving force of the adsorption process based on the static test a one dimensional saturated quartz sand column was used to conduct a co migration test of copper resistant microorganisms and cu2 and a co migration mathematical model was constructed to investigate the migration and transformation mechanisms of microorganisms and copper in the saturated zone copper behavior in the saturated zone was then quantitatively evaluated to provide a scientific basis for the establishment of theories and methods for evaluating the remediation behavior of soil hv pollution microbial remediation of hv pollution and environmentally safe transformation of engineering bacteria within a saturated zone or aquifer 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials quartz sand copper ions and copper resistant microorganisms were the main research objects and materials for the batch adsorption and column experiments in this study the use of low reactivity quartz sand as a medium during the experiments not only precludes the influence of organic matter in the soil but also maintains the particle size as homogeneously as possible quartz sand with a sio2 content of near 100 and fe2o3 content of less than 0 005 was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd it has stable chemical properties and strong corrosion resistance the sieved particle size ranged from 0 25 to 0 54 mm with a d50 of 0 31 mm after 2 h of soaking in deionized water and 24 h of soaking in dilute hydrochloric acid the quartz sand was washed with deionized water until the ph of the supernatant was neutral and then sterilized three times at 121 c for 3 h with a sterilization time interval of 24 h copper ions were selected as the metal solute in this study since they contribute to a wide range of pollution and have low toxicity single valence and stable properties the results can provide a reference for related research on highly toxic hvs with similar migration characteristics to copper ions indigenous microorganisms in the subsurface are more adaptable to the underground environment and are more capable of inhibiting soil hv pollution than exogenous microorganisms the target bacteria were screened from farmland soil with elevated copper concentrations to improve the tolerance of copper resistant microorganisms the gradient pressure domestication method was first used to remove non target bacteria thereafter the bacterial culture was removed diluted separated and finally purified repeatedly a copper resistant strain was isolated and identified as klebsiella oxytoca by 16srdna sequence identification fig 1 and called klebsiella oxytoca ly the strain characteristics are listed in table 1 2 2 batch adsorption experiments static batch adsorption experiments including equilibrium adsorption and adsorption kinetics experiments were carried out using microorganisms quartz sand and copper ions the results were fitted with isothermal adsorption models table 2 and adsorption kinetic models table 3 to obtain the distribution coefficient adsorption coefficient desorption coefficient and other parameters required for numerical simulation of the co transport of microorganisms and copper ions 2 3 column experiments to explore the co migration mechanisms of microorganisms and copper in the saturated zone a soil column experimental device was designed fig 2 the device consisted of a water supply system a soil column system and a sampling system the water supply system included a liquid container a peristaltic pump and a silicone tube the soil column was made of plexiglass and the effective soil column length was 20 cm with an inner diameter of 5 cm lewis and sjöstrom 2010 a layer of filter paper and a layer of 70 mesh nylon yarn were placed on the top and bottom of the simulation column to ensure the uniformity of the water flow the columns were placed upright in an incubator with an ambient temperature of 4 c the basic parameters of the columns are listed in table 4 one dimensional dispersion experiments were conducted using nacl as a tracer to obtain parameters such as the dispersion coefficient of the soil column soil column experiments were also conducted to simulate the migration behavior of microorganisms and pollutant copper ions to reduce the effect of gravity on the experimental results the experiment used a bottom up water flow and the temperature was controlled at 4 0 5 c sterile deionized water saturated the soil column from the bottom to the top when the outflow of the column remained stable the inlet fluid was quickly switched to add four pore volumes of a bacterial suspension of known concentration a copper ion solution or a mixed solution of both during flow the outflow was measured and effluent was collected after 1 h the inflow was switched to sterile deionized water the initial injection concentration of the bacterial suspension was 1 107 cfu ml and the copper concentration in the copper ion solution was 50 mg l as the bacteria we used in the experiment were acid resistant we added kh2po4 into the bacterial suspension to control ph to around 5 5 chloride ion concentration was measured by ion chromatography cu2 concentration was measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer and turbidimetry was used for microorganism measurements foppen et al 2005 2 4 numerical simulation 2 4 1 hydrodynamic model the galerkin finite element method was used to numerically solve the modified richards equation s convection dispersion equation cde eq 1 to obtain the basic equation of water flow in the saturated zone eq 2 is the boundary condition 1 θ t x k h x cos α s 2 h x t h x 0 t 0 h x t h 0 x 0 t 0 h n n t 0 n l t 0 where α is the angle between the direction of the water flow and the longitudinal axis in this study the water

saturated hydraulic conductivity m a n is the normal line direction 2 4 2 conservative chloride transport model the one dimensional cde of the tracer chloride ion transport is as follows eq 3 3 c t d

in the solid phase mg cm3 t is time min and x is the space coordinate in cm the origin of the coordinate is on the surface of the soil column downward is positive 2 4 3 microorganism transport model the microorganism transport model was based on the traditional microbial cde eq 4 compere et al 2001 4 θ w c c t ρ s c t θ w d c 2 c c x 2 q c c c x where θw is the water content that the microorganism can reach cm3 cm3 cc is the concentration of the microorganism in the liquid phase mg cm3 t is the time min ρ is the bulk density g cm 3 sc is the concentration of microorganisms in the solid phase mg g dc is the diffusion coefficient of the microorganisms cm2 min x is the distance cm and qc and is the water flow flux cm min 2 4 4 copper ion transport model because the transport of hvs in the soil is complicated by environmental factors and conditions and because their break through curves btcs are asymmetric with evident tailing phenomena it cannot be described by a simple equilibrium cde thus a non equilibrium cde is proposed eq 5 which includes hydrodynamic dispersion and chemical non equilibrium adsorption processes 5 1 f ρk d θ c t ρ θ s 2 t d 2 c x 2 ν c x 2 4 5 co migration of microorganisms and copper ion in saturated porous media the co migration of microorganisms and hvs can be conceptualized as a two phase six component system as shown in fig 3 the two phases are mobile liquid and immobile solid and the six components are the corresponding numbers 1 6 in the figure the model includes the mass balance equation for adsorption and desorption of copper ions by mobile and immobile microorganisms and by quartz sand and the effects of quartz sand on mobile and immobile microorganisms eq 6 6 θc t ρ s t θ w c c s mc t ρ s c s ic t θd 2 c x 2 q c x θ w d

mg mg c is the cu2 concentration in the solution mg cm3 s is the adsorption concentration of cu2 in soil mg g d is the dispersion coefficient cm2 min and q is the darcy flow velocity cm min 2 5 equation solving and model validation three steps were adopted to verify the reliability of model simulation results 1 cxtfit software was used to obtain the pore water flow velocity v k rw and the dispersion coefficient d based on the tracer ion breakthrough curve tang et al 2010 toride 1995 2 the adsorption analytical model and the internal optimization process of hydrus 1d were used to analyze the microbial breakthrough curve to estimate the characteristics of water flow and microbial migration simunek 2005 in general the dispersion coefficient d c of microorganisms is larger than the dispersion coefficient d of the tracer in the soil however because the size of the microorganisms is smaller than the size of the pores in the medium the particle diameters of the microorganisms and tracer ions are essentially the same therefore the pore water velocity and dispersion coefficient of the tracer ions were used to analyze the breakthrough curve of microorganisms to obtain parameters such as k ac d c k dc and k rc 3 the breakthrough curves of cu2 were used to fit and verify the migration model parameters such as k rw d k ac k dc k amc and k dmc were obtained from breakthrough curves of tracer ions and microorganisms as well as batch adsorption experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth curve of copper resistant microorganisms klebsiella oxytoca ly was in a low activity period from 0 to 1 5 h when cultured at 37 c fig 4 during this period because the bacteria had just been inoculated into the culture medium adaptation to the new environment was needed so the strains grew slowly after 1 5 h klebsiella oxytoca ly entered the logarithmic phase during which time the bacteria grew more rapidly from 10 to 20 h klebsiella oxytoca ly was in a stable period and the reproduction and decay rates were equal after 20 h the bacteria began to decay according to the growth characteristics of the bacteria the bacterial solution in the later logarithmic phase 10 15 h was selected for the adsorption experiments moreover under the condition of 4 c the metabolic activity of the bacteria was extremely slow and its growth curve was stable with almost no quantitative changes this demonstrated that in this experiment with ambient temperature maintained at 4 c significant bacterial reproduction and death were avoided 3 2 results of batch adsorption experiments 3 2 1 microorganisms and quartz sand the measured regression curves of the four types of equilibrium adsorption are shown in fig 5 the corresponding adsorption parameters for the four groups of equilibrium are shown in table 5 as shown in fig 5 and table 5 the adsorption of microorganisms in soil is more consistent with the equilibrium adsorption characteristics of the freundlich adsorption equation with a correlation of 99 4 experiments with soil water ratios of 1 1 and 1 2 mccaulou et al 1994 were repeated from which the ranges of the distribution coefficient k of the bacteria were found to be from 0 127 to 0 3 ml g huysman and verstraete 1993 and the exponential constants n were mostly between 0 96 and 1 07 the equilibrium adsorption coefficient values obtained from repeated experiments were not the same which may have been caused by the different properties such as charge hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the bacteria and soil some results indicated that the soil water ratio also had a great impact on the determination of the adsorption coefficient during the experiment therefore an appropriate soil water ratio should be selected in this experiment the soil water ratio was set as 1 2 adsorption kinetics experiments showed that the soil adsorption of microorganisms basically reached equilibrium in 1 h fig 6 the microbial adsorption kinetics were investigated before the microorganisms reached adsorption equilibrium the linear relationship between ln c c0 ξ 1 c c0 k in the quartz sand and time t was obtained with a correlation coefficient of 93 60 the reversible adsorption constant was 0 334 s 1 the reversible desorption constant was 0 06 s 1 and r2 was 0 8717 as calculated from the physical properties of the quartz sand and theta value therefore microorganisms should be retained in the porous media 3 2 2 copper and quartz sand the langmuir equation provided a good fit to the batch adsorption experiments data for evaluation of the adsorption affinity of quartz sand for cu with a correlation coefficient of 0 91 and a distribution coefficient k of 0 092 mg l fig 7 table 6 the retention and release of copper in the soil had a large variation range reflecting a complex retention mechanism therefore not all the retention effects and migration behaviors of copper in the soil under different initial concentration conditions can be modelled with a good fit in addition it was found that copper adsorption capacity of the medium was not reached during the experiment therefore it is necessary to take appropriate physical chemical and biological measures to promote the absorption of copper by the soil and to maintain its stability only when the transport of copper in the soil is properly controlled can the hazards caused by copper to the environment be reduced and curbed 3 2 3 copper and microorganisms the temkin equation provided a good fit to the experimental data and could be used to evaluate the adsorption affinity of microorganisms for cu producing a correlation coefficient 0 986 and a distribution coefficient k of 19 612 mg l fig 8 table 7 by fitting the data of the kinetic experiment with matlab according to eq 7 fig 9 we observed that the adsorption coefficient of copper in the bacterial solution was kamc 1 67 and the analytical coefficient kdmc 1 07 7 c c 0 k dmc k amc exp k amc k dmc t k amc k dmc where c 0 is the initial concentration of copper mg l eq 7 is fitted with the relationship between concentration and time and the function is optimized by the least square method using matlab 3 3 breakthrough curve as shown in fig 10 the soil column experiment showed that the penetration time of the bacteria was shorter than for the tracer cl which agrees with the findings of sinton

hydrocarbons tph at a crude oil release site orbitrap mass spectrometry was used to characterize ococ in samples of the oil water from upgradient of the release source area and downgradient wells and a local lake chemical characterization factors included carbon number oxygen number formulae similarity double bond equivalents dbe and radiocarbon dating oil samples were dominated by formulae with less than 30 carbons four or fewer oxygens and a dbe of less than four in water samples formulae were identified with more than 30 carbons more than 10 oxygens and a dbe exceeding 30 these characteristics are consistent with doc found in unimpacted water between 65 and 92 of the formulae found in samples collected within the elevated ococ plume were also found in the upgradient or surface water samples evidence suggests that many of the ococ are not petroleum degradation intermediates but microbial products generated as a result of de novo synthesis by organisms growing on carbon supplied by the oil implications of these results for understanding the fate and managing the risk of hydrocarbons in the subsurface are discussed 1 introduction high resolution mass

of carbon in unimpacted ecosystems hawkes et al 2016 kellerman et al 2018 lian et al 2021 valle et al 2018 xu et al 2019 hrms provides a powerful tool for investigating interactions between dissolved organic compounds and microorganisms islam et al 2016 kellerman et al 2018 mohler et al 2020 valle et al 2018 incorporating each of these topics this paper describes the results of orbitrap with electrospray ion source mass spectrometry orbitrap analysis of water and crude oil oil samples collected from a crude oil release site this study continues an investigation into the nature and risk of

mohler et al 2013 2020 o reilly et al 2019 zemo et al 2013 zemo et al 2017 in earlier papers ococ were called petroleum metabolites mohler et al 2013 zemo et al 2017 or polar metabolites zemo et al 2013 and were assumed to be compounds within hydrocarbon biodegradation pathways we recommend the use of ococ because a number of the compounds have been identified in wells upgradient of any hydrocarbon release and have structures suggesting that some may not be metabolites of hydrocarbon degradation mohler et al 2020 o reilly et al 2019 in this paper petroleum metabolites is defined as a subclass of ococ that are degradation pathway intermediates or other oxidized hydrocarbons petroleum metabolites have carbon structures consistent with those found in oil the term microbial products another subclass of ococ is used to describe compounds generated by de novo synthesis as a result of biological activity so they have chemical structures unrelated to the growth substrate the terms petroleum metabolites and microbial products are consistent with the concepts of substrate utilization associated products and biomass associated products used in wastewater engineering laspidou and rittmann 2002 the use of orbitrap was inspired in part by the work of bekins et al 2016 in that paper questions were raised about the chemical characteristics of non volatile dissolved organic carbon doc in groundwater at the u s geological survey s usgs s bemidji minnesota crude oil release research site because doc methods measure a broader range of compounds than those that may pass through a gas chromatograph gc an alternative analytical approach was warranted limited results of hrms analysis of groundwater from this site are available islam et al 2016 mohler et al 2020 podgorski et al 2021 as applied in this study orbitrap uses direct injection of the sample extract so compounds that are too large to pass through a gc are detected and a larger fraction of the doc is characterized whereas gcxgc separates compounds by boiling point and polarity orbitrap separates ionizable compounds by ion mass so it is not limited by compound volatility mohler et al 2020 the tradeoff is that orbitrap identifies only chemical formulae while gcxgc tofms can identify the structure of compounds found in mass spectra libraries due to technical limitations of mass spectrometry neither method detects all the compounds present in a sample published results of orbitrap and other hrms analysis of oxidation products associated with marine oils spills chen et al 2016 islam et al 2016 lemkau et

results with other occurrences of hydrocarbon associated ococ the national crude oil spill fate and natural attenuation research site near bemidji minnesota usgs s bemidji site has been extensively studied and is ideal for characterizing the chemistry and sources of ococ crude oil was released as the result of a pipeline rupture in 1979 eganhouse et al 1993 usgs s efforts have resulted in

magnetic resonance excitation emission fluorescence and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms baedecker et al 2018 cozzarelli et al 1994 essaid et al 2011 islam et al 2016 mohler et al 2020 podgorski et al 2018 thorn and aiken 1998 while ococ and doc components have been assumed to be primarily petroleum metabolites bekins et al 2016 podgorski et al 2018 thorn and aiken 1998 the hypothesis that they may also be microbial products has not been tested mohler et al 2020 the distinction between petroleum metabolites and microbial products is critical for developing an accurate understanding of the fate of hydrocarbons in the environment and managing associated risks the assumption that ococ associated with a hydrocarbon plume are primarily petroleum metabolites is based on a conceptual model that some oil components are bioactive enough to be oxidized by bacteria but the compounds generated are slower to degrade the relative rates of these reactions are such that the concentration of the ococ can exceed that of dissolved hydrocarbon substrates more importantly it suggests that biogeochemical processes and doc chemistry at petroleum release sites are distinct from those of unimpacted sites on the other hand if the ococ are primarily microbial products it suggests that the more degradable fraction of oil serves as a carbon source that supports an active microbial community as the products of de novo microbial synthesis these ococ are less likely to be unique to hydrocarbon impacted sites and the biogeochemical processes are more consistent with unimpacted sites an issue with many publications focused on contaminant degradation is that they are often insular and fail to consider the broader scientific literature in this study we integrate research related to hydrocarbon fate with that from the rapidly growing field of doc chemistry understanding whether ococ are petroleum metabolites or microbial products is especially important if sample concentrations are measured using broad non specific analytical methods such as doc podgorski et al 2021 three recent papers describe bioactivity tests conducted on groundwater samples collected from the bemidji site bekins et al 2020 mcguire et al 2018 podgorski et al 2018 while the results are presented relative to doc concentrations the authors claim they evaluated the risk of petroleum derived dissolved organic matter podgorski et al 2018 transformation products mcguire et al 2018 or hydrocarbon degradation intermediates bekins et al 2020 in each case the assays were not adequately controlled for common doc constituents dissolved hydrocarbons and or microbial products even though these have been shown to generate positive results bittner et al 2006 blackwell et al 2019 eisman et al 1991 regulators have also assumed that ococ found at hydrocarbon release sites are petroleum metabolites in developing guidance for what they call hydrocarbon oxidation products san francisco bay regional water quality board sfrwqcb 2019 intermediate degradation products kmet 2016 or tph derived polar breakdown products state of hawaiʻi s o 2014 a clear understanding of the ococ and their potential sources is necessary to ensure that appropriate risk management strategies are employed at petroleum release sites goals of this study include characterizing complex mixtures of ococ found in oil and water associated with a crude oil release and evaluating the hypothesis that some ococ are microbial products not petroleum metabolites chemical characterization factors include the distribution of formulae based on carbon number oxygen number and double bond equivalence dbe similarities and differences in these distributions are compared between samples collected from monitoring wells upgradient of the oil release within the location of the crude oil source zone downgradient of the source and from the surface of a local lake individual formulae were compared between sample types to determine what fraction of formulae may be unique to the hydrocarbon plume chemical characteristics of the ococ formulae identified were compared to expected metabolites of the site oil and published values for doc from unimpacted aquatic systems finally biological processes that may be the primary source of ococ are discussed 2 methods 2 1 study site samples were collected at the usgs bemidji site a release of a light crude oil occurred at the site as the result of a pipeline rupture in 1979 eganhouse et al 1993 when released the oil s fractional composition was about 60 alkanes 35 aromatics and the remainder resins and asphaltenes ng et al 2014 following emergency response approximately 150 m3 of oil remained in the subsurface forming three oil bodies baedecker et al 2018 within the north pool oil on the water table extends 50 m upgradient and 25 m downgradient from the center of the oil body fig 1 essaid et al 2011 the resultant dissolved hydrocarbon plume has extended downgradient as far as 150 m eganhouse et al 1993 the aquifer is composed primarily of coarse grained glacial outwash with interbedded lower permeability layers natural attenuation processes have been documented in the groundwater and vadose zone resulting in changes to the oil composition and aquifer geochemistry eganhouse et al 1993 ng et al 2014 sihota et al 2011 in the vicinity of residual oil the primary attenuation processes are fermentation and methanogenesis baedecker et al 2018 bekins et al 2005 over 90 of the oil loss in the saturated zone is associated with the biodegradation of alkanes at the oil water interface while there has been a minor loss of mono aromatic compounds baedecker et al 2018 bekins et al 2005 ng et al 2014 there is no evidence of degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs resins or asphaltenes baedecker et al 2018 2 2 samples and sample locations samples for orbitrap analysis were collected in july 2016 june 2017 and october 2018 monitoring well locations are identified by their distance from the center of the oil body bekins et al 2016 groundwater samples were collected from two wells situated about 200 m upgradient of the release ten wells between 35 and 328 m downgradient of the release and an unimpacted cross gradient well fig 1 oil samples were collected from two wells during the 2017 and 2018 sampling events in 2018 two surface water samples were collected from a lake downgradient of the release the two numbers at the end of each sample name indicates the year the sample was collected staff from the usgs water science center mounds view minnesota analyzed groundwater samples for geochemical parameters related to natural attenuation dissolved oxygen so4 fe2 ch4 alkalinity specific conductance and doc cozzarelli et al 2016 podgorski et al 2021 in 2018 radiocarbon analysis of doc and dissolved inorganic carbon was conducted a e lalonde ams laboratory ottawa ontario for evaluation of tph and ococ 5 l water samples were shipped to a state certified commercial laboratory eurofins lancaster laboratories lancaster pennsylvania and unfiltered groundwater was extracted with dichloromethane dcm following epa method 3510 one dcm extract for each groundwater sample was subjected to sgc epa method 3630 to separate the hydrocarbons from the polar compounds mohler et al 2013 each extract was analyzed using gc fid epa method 8015 to measure tph c10 to c40 concentration with and without sgc the extracts were shipped to chevron s laboratory in richmond california for further analysis 2 3 orbitrap analysis the ltq orbitrap xl instrument used in this study is capable of 100 000 resolving power at m z 200 with a mass accuracy of five parts per million mohler et al 2020 the combination of the high resolution and the high mass accuracy allows elemental compositions to be accurately assigned to the mass spectral peaks samples consisting of either groundwater dcm extracts without sgc or untreated crude oil were diffused directly into the ltq orbitrap xl with an electrospray ion source esi at 5 μl per minute the mass spectrometer was tuned to m z 400 the center of the mass distribution of the samples and kept constant for all samples the mass spectra were collected using a mass range of 125 2000 da with the resolving power set to 60 000 at m z 200 separate injections were made with the detector operated in negative and positive ion mode petroorg petroleomics software corilo 2013 was used to assign the elemental composition and chemical formulae the response or peak height for each formula was reported as the relative abundance these were converted to fractional response by dividing each formula s relative abundance by the sum of the relative abundance of all formulae identified in a sample hawkes et al 2016 sleighter et al 2010 subdiaga et al 2020 relative abundance and fractional response are used because concentrations of the thousands of individual formulae identified cannot be determined without the use chemical standards chemical characteristics derived from the formula include the numbers of carbons hydrogens oxygens nitrogens and sulfurs information on the structural complexity of the carbon skeleton is indicated by a formula s dbe which is calculated as 1 dbe c 1 h 2 n 2 where c h and n equal the number of carbon hydrogen and nitrogens in the formula one goal of this study is to identify formulae that may be unique to petroleum release sites first lists of formulae identified in background samples i e upgradient wells cross gradient wells and surface water were compiled formulae identified in source area or downgradient samples were screened against these lists for each of the source area or downgradient samples the percentage of formulae also found in background samples was determined as the number of formulae in both the plume well and background samples divided by the total number of formulae identified in the plume well sample 2 number of formulae in sample x that are also in a background sample number of formulae in sample x the percentage of the fractional response associated with formulae also found in background samples was calculated using the same approach 3 results 3 1 geochemical composition of the plume results of hydrocarbon concentrations and geochemical analyses of the natural attenuation parameters table 1 are consistent with previously published data from this site essaid et al 2011 ng et al 2014 the source area or dissolved hydrocarbon plume defined by samples with measurable tph in silica gel treated extracts extends to about 110 m samples with dissolved hydrocarbons from wells 518a 531a and 9315b have doc concentrations exceeding 15 mg l and geochemical characteristics consistent with anaerobic petroleum biodegradation one well within the source area well 533c did not have measurable tph and appears to be screened below the dissolved hydrocarbon plume mohler et al 2020 samples downgradient of the hydrocarbon plume but within the ococ plume wells 801a 9316a 954a 925d 1217c and 1217e have detectable tph without sgc no detectable tph with sgc and doc concentrations that exceed those of upgradient samples by between 2 and 5 mg l tph with sgc was non detect in the surface water samples the surface water s doc concentration of about 10 mg l exceeded those of either upgradient or downgradient groundwater samples radiocarbon analysis indicated that doc in upgradient groundwater and surface water consists of 100 modern carbon while doc in plume samples likely contained oil derived carbon table 1 for downgradient samples the fraction of modern carbon was consistent with the upgradient doc concentration as a fraction of the total doc the decrease in fraction of modern carbon in the dissolved inorganic carbon dic indicates that some hydrocarbons are being completely mineralized while the detection of methane in the source area wells suggests methanogenesis is on going 3 2 comparison to upgradient and surface water samples the number of orbitrap identified formulae per sample ranged from 104 to 2336 table 2 the median was 1595 and the average was 1460 over 8900 unique formulae were identified across the 28 samples results for each sample are summarized in table 3 the fractional response of individual formulae ranged from a few percent to less than 0 001 additional results for the 2016 samples are presented in mohler et al 2020 to identify formulae that might be unique to petroleum impacted sites the formulae found in oil source area and downgradient samples were screened against those found in upgradient and surface water samples formulae found in the latter are more likely to be doc components that are not unique to petroleum impacted waters while formulae found only in the oil influenced sample may warrant further investigation the comparisons were done on a number of formulae and fractional response basis only about 5 of the formulae identified in oil samples were also in either upgradient or surface water samples these account for less than 1 of the fractional response for the source area samples between 64 and 87 of the formulae were also found in one or more upgradient or surface water samples table 3 fig 2 these accounted for between 78 and 96 of the response for the downgradient samples the formulae also found in background samples were between 78 and 92 of the total formulae and 88 and 99 of the response 3 3 chemical characterization oil was collected from the same two wells in 2017 and 2018 the 2018 samples were analyzed in duplicate the results for all oil samples are consistent the carbon distribution indicates few formulae with less than c15 most formulae at around c20 and a decreasing trend through about c40 table 3 about 45 of the formulae contained three oxygens and one sulfur these so3 formulae accounted for about 90 of the fractional response of the ococ without sulfur 80 had two oxygens and the remaining had four oxygens over 80 of the response resulted from non aromatic formulae with less than four dbe the average dbe c of 0 07 is consistent with oxidized alkanes for the groundwater samples there are three carbon number distributions noted with some samples having all three table 3 the lighter group of formulae ranges from about c10 to c20 with a maxima at c15 the medium group ranges in the c20s while the heaviest group peaks in the c30s or beyond upgradient and downgradient samples with only the lighter group of formulae were collected in 2017 the medium and heavier groups were more common in source area and downgradient samples collected in 2016 and 2018 the carbon number distribution of the surface water samples which were only collected in 2018 overlapped with the medium and heavier formulae identified in groundwater formulae identified by orbitrap in groundwater extracts did not contain sulfur or nitrogen it is unknown whether this is due to issues with the extraction method or ionization efficiency the number of oxygens and dbes trended with carbon number fig 3 fig sm 1 while formulae with up to 12 oxygens were identified most formulae in the lighter carbon number group had between two and five oxygens formulae in the heavier group commonly had five or more oxygens while formulae in the lighter group tended to have fewer oxygens they had higher o c ratios formulae in the lighter group tended to have fewer than 10 dbes while those in the heavier groups tended to have between 10 and 20 dbes some formulae had over 30 dbes the dbe results indicate that formulae have some aromatic components due to the relationship between carbon number and dbe dbe c is used to compare compounds of different sizes the average dbe c for all water samples ranged from 0 35 to 0 51 a van krevelen diagram is a common approach for visualizing and evaluating data sets generated by the hrms analysis of complex mixtures kew et al 2017 kim et al 2003 in fig 4 the x axis is the o c ratio so formulae with higher oxygen numbers trend towards the right the y axis is the h c ratio so compounds with fewer dbe plot higher h c trends inversely with dbe c oil formulae with the greatest response plot between 0 1 and 0 2 on the o c axis and 1 5 and 2 0 on the h c axis formulae in the lighter group plot between 0 1 and 0 5 on the o c axis and 1 0 and 2 0 on the h c axis those in the heavier groups plot between 0 15 and 0 3 on the o c axis and 0 5 and 1 3 on the h c axis the van krevelen diagrams in fig 4 highlight differences in ococ formulae identified in oil and water samples formulae identified in the oil samples have high h c and low o c which is consistent with expected intermediates of alkane biodegradation for both background samples 9021 18 and sw1 18 and within plume samples 518a 16 and 925d 18 most formulae plot between 0 5 and 1 5 on the h c axis and 0 40 on the o c axis the lower h c ratios are consistent with higher dbe aromatic formulae degradation of complex aromatic hydrocarbons has not been demonstrated at this site baedecker et al 2018 similarities between the plume and surface water doc is highlighted by comparing the plots of sw1 18 and 518a 16 and 925d 18 4 discussion the carbon number distribution and low dbes of formulae identified in the oil samples are consistent with hydrocarbon structure of the alkane rich crude oil at the bemidji site formulae with less than four dbe indicating they are not aromatic accounted for about 80 of the response the dominance of so3 formulae in the oil samples may suggest the production of sulfonic esters sulfonate biosurfactants to aid in degradation at the oil water interface volkering et al 1997 sulfur free ococ typically had either two oxygens suggestive of organic acids or four oxygens suggestive of diacids such organic acids are consistent with expected petroleum biodegradation intermediates zemo et al 2013 the chemistry of the formulae identified in the water samples differs from those found in the oil samples average carbon numbers are 24 for the oil 14 for the lighter water sample group and 35 for the heavier water group the number of oxygens especially in the heavier group often exceeds four ococ in the oil samples were primarily alkyl as indicated by an average dbe c of 0 07 while those in the water samples had aromatic characteristics as indicated by average dbe c in the range of 0 35 to 0 51 there was not a consistent trend between the chemical characteristics of the ococ and plume location differing by sample upgradient wells had evidence of light medium and heavy formulae groups wells 531a and 9315b are in the core of the source area with elevated doc concentrations dissolved hydrocarbons and strongly reducing conditions samples from these wells were dominated by the heavier group of formulae well 533c is within the footprint of the dissolved hydrocarbon plume but it may be screened below the dissolved hydrocarbon plume as tph were non detect the sample from well 533c showed formulae from each group for downgradient wells all but one sample collected in 2017 954a 17 had only the lighter group all downgradient samples collected in 2016 and 2018 had the heavier group while some also had the lighter and medium group the reason for the difference in results between 2017 samples and those from the other two years is unknown while both source area and surface water samples were dominated by heavier formulae 14c results indicate doc in the source area derives from the oil but doc in the surface water derives from modern photosynthesis based only on carbon and oxygen numbers hydrocarbon biotransformation could theoretically account for formulae in the lighter group but the observation that formulae in the heavier group are larger than those in the oil suggest factors other than hydrocarbon degradation are involved in their production the observation that formulae with five or greater oxygens are at higher concentrations than those with four or fewer is more consistent with ococ found in unimpacted groundwater than expected for degradation intermediates ahad et al 2013 qiao et al 2020 zemo et al 2013 the dbe c range of formulae in both groups 0 35 to 0 51 is inconsistent with petroleum metabolites of the alkane dominated degradation detected at bemidji dbe c should be less than 0 10 for alkanes the mono aromatic acids identified by gc ms in groundwater at this site by cozzarelli et al 1994 had 10 or fewer carbons and dbe c of between 0 50 and 0 71 the range of measured dbe c values are consistent with typical doc constituents identified in natural waters using hrms hughes et al 2017 lian et al 2021 maizel et al 2017 valle et al 2018 while the o c ratios are lower than that of humic substances isolated from groundwater the average dbe c are similar artinger et al 2000 comparing formulae found in source area and downgradient samples with those identified in the upgradient and surface water samples indicates similarities in the nature of the doc inside and outside the plume upgradient samples had ococ in both the light and heavy group while the surface water was dominated by those in the heavier group 14c results for these samples indicate that their doc is modern and does not contain oil derived carbon still 78 to 96 of the fractional response of source samples and 88 to 99 of the response of downgradient samples consists of formula found in either upgradient or surface water islam et al 2016 used hrms to analyze xad resin extracts of bemidji site groundwater samples collected from an upgradient well 310 a well within the oil spray zone with elevated doc 603 and a well at the downgradient edge of the dissolved hydrocarbon plume 530 based on the data presented with the paper between 79 and 97 of the fractional response of well 530 and well 603 samples were also found in samples from the upgradient well 310 over 50 of the fractional response of both upgradient and dissolved plume samples consisted of formulae identified in standard mixtures of humic acids subdiaga et al 2020 it is important to note these comparisons are based only on formulae so differences in the chemical structures present are not known while podgorski et al 2021 conducted hrms analysis on samples of some of the wells we investigated only general results such sample averaged molecular weights o c and h c were presented formulae specific comparisons were not conducted but the authors noted a biodegradation continuum with doc chemistry becoming more similar to upstream samples as groundwater moved downgradient although formulae identified in background and plume samples are consistent differences between samples are to be expected background groundwater is carbon poor and aerobic carbon availability and redox conditions vary across the plume while surface water is carbon rich and aerobic table 1 in aquatic systems and sediments such geochemical factors are known to result in shifts in ococ mixtures characterized by hrms herzsprung et al 2017 valle et al 2018 still the product of chemical cycling and microbial processes is doc consisting of a common pool of chemical formulae zark and dittmar 2018 the compounds detected within a complex mixture depend on the analytical methods no single method will identify every constituent in paired analysis of some of the samples described in this paper mohler et al 2020 noted little overlap between the compounds identified by gcxgc ms and formulae identified by orbitrap while solid phase extraction is typically used to concentrate doc for hrms analysis dcm extraction was used in the current study because the research program is focused on ococ that may be measured as tph by method 8015 due to differences in extraction methods and the ionization efficiency of different hrms technologies comparisons between studies is challenging for example islam et al 2016 used fticr ms to analyze organics extracted from 120 l samples of bemidji groundwater using xad 4 and xad 8 and reported more formulae per sample than we identified by orbitrap in dcm extracts of 5 l samples the difference in extraction methods and 24 times greater sample volume may account for the detection of s and n containing heteroatoms by islam et al 2016 while we identified s containing compounds in the oil samples neither s nor n containing formulae were identified in the dcm groundwater extracts another difference between islam and the current study is the age of the release when the samples were collected as the extracts analyzed by islam in 2016 were prepared by usgs scientists in 1986 1987 and 1998 the carbon range distribution of ococs identified in the two studies also varied the response averaged carbon number for the seven islam samples ranged from 17 to 22 while it ranged from 27 to 34 for orbitrap analyzed samples dominated by the heavy formulae group a potential mechanism for the generation of elevated doc concentrations is microbial growth associated with methanogenesis at the oil water interface at bemidji methanogenesis and fermentation are dominant alkane degradation processes in the oil source zone bekins et al 2005 and much of the methane production occurs where oil contacts water ng et al 2014 sufficient gas is produced that exsolution occurs and bubbles containing methane and co2 are generated amos et al 2005 hydrocarbon degradation mediated by methanogens and fermenters growing at the oil water interface has been noted at other sites irianni renno et al 2016 fermentation converts organic molecules into a pool of fatty acids and alcohols that can serve as the carbon source for microorganisms including methanogens and other anaerobes irianni renno et al 2016 valle et al 2018 stable isotopic ratios of carbon and hydrogen in dissolved methane and carbon in dic in bemidji groundwater suggest that methanogenesis is linked to acetate fermentation revesz et al 1995 our 14c results indicate that oil is a source of carbon in dic table 1 concentrations of fermentation associated c4 organic acids exceeding 1000 mg l have been detected in groundwater at a gas condensate release site amos et al 2005 bacteria growing on simple substrates such as a single sugar or amino acid are known to produce complex mixtures of organic compounds with characteristics similar to those identified by orbitrap lechtenfeld et al 2015 lian et al 2021 valle et al 2017 described the generation of complex chemical mixtures linked to methanogenesis in anaerobic sediments under this hypothesis the generation of doc as a result of fermentation and methanogenesis is summarized by the informal equation 3 alkanes h 2 o ch 4 co 2 cxhyoz cxhyoz represents fermentation products biomass petroleum metabolites and microbial products microbial products measured as doc include those that are released from cells due to lysis diffusion through the cell membrane predation or excretion for some purpose laspidou and rittmann 2002 the biochemically produced fraction of doc may include simple chemicals such as sugars and fatty acids larger biopolymers such as polysaccharides and proteins and complex compounds characterized as humic acids lechtenfeld et al 2015 anaerobic bacteria can synthesize and secrete fulvic acid a common doc constituent wang et al 2020 organic carbon is cycled between biomass and doc as microorganisms degrade and grow on the microbial products lost by other organisms lechtenfeld et al 2015 repeta 2015 as such the compounds have structures that are distinct from the initial carbon source and are not unique to a petroleum release site bacterial transformation of organic matter to a common pool of compounds as water moves downgradient from inputs of organic matter is consistent with doc behavior in other aquatic systems kellerman et al 2018 scavia 1988 as noted by zark and dittmar 2018 doc from different sources consisting of compounds with identical structural features is likely the result of a cascade of common synthetic and degradation processes that ultimately lead to the formation of a universal background regardless of origin and history of the organic material the fraction of 14c depleted or oil derived carbon is greatest in the source area samples and decreases as groundwater moves downgradient table 1 the decrease is likely due to loss of more labile freshly produced ococs relative to the background doc that consists of modern carbon while 14c results indicate that carbon in the excess doc is derived from oil it does not distinguish between petroleum metabolites or the product of microbial synthesis compounds synthesized by organisms growing on oil or its degradation products will be depleted in 14c in defense of the hypothesis that ococ in bemidji groundwater are primarily petroleum metabolites ng et al 2014 proposed that doc is generated through the oxidation of precursors to doc pre doc including alkylated polyaromatics resins and asphaltenes this is not supported by our data to account for the carbon number and dbes of the formulae identified by orbitrap the hydrocarbons in the pre doc fraction would need to consist of alkyl aromatic compounds with up to 30 carbons thorn and aiken 1998 proposed c19 alkyl aromatics as potential precursors to doc in bemidji groundwater analysis of oil from the site indicates the loss of alkyl aromatics with more than eight carbons and pahs has been so low that it could not be quantified baedecker et al 2018 making it unlikely to be the source of the measured concentrations of doc on the other hand the same study indicated losses of c6 c30 n alkanes exceeding 90 podgorski et al 2021 suggested that resins and asphaltenes may be doc precursors even though they are minor component of the oil are considered to be recalcitrant and no evidence for their degradation at this site has been presented baedecker et al 2018 a specific mechanism for the biological oxidation of the pre doc that would account for greater than four oxygens per molecule has not been proposed two common approaches for incorporating oxygen into a hydrocarbon under anaerobic conditions are through the addition of fumarate c2h2o4 2 or co2 mosher et al 2015 in either case products have an even number of oxygens but the formulae identified in groundwater samples are equally split between those with even and odd numbers of oxygens also these oxygen addition mechanisms require an investment of either energy with carboxylation or a central metabolite with fumarate addition such a process would not seem to be sustainable if the organism lost the product as doc before recouping the investment while doc consisting of oxidized hydrocarbons made sense when it was initially proposed in the 1990s eganhouse et al 1993 thorn and aiken 1998 the hypothesis needs to be reassessed given current understandings of doc chemistry and concepts of anaerobic biotransformation when assessing and managing risk it is important to understand whether petroleum associated ococ are unique degradation intermediates or consistent with microbially produced doc from unimpacted sites using transcription receptor assays bekins et al 2020 evaluated the bioactivity of doc extracted from bemidji site groundwater while the term petroleum degradation intermediates is defined as compounds within a biodegradation pathway or those generated directly through the microbial oxidation of hydrocarbon molecules o reilly et al 2019 the authors used it to be synonymous with the doc isolated from downgradient wells of the 46 molecular targets tested upregulation was noted for two the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr and pregnane x receptor pxr transcription factors the extent of the response trended with doc concentration both genes have been described as promiscuous as they are activated by a wide range of structurally diverse naturally occurring compounds including surface water doc blackwell et al 2019 humic acids common constituents of doc have been shown to activate ahr at similar concentrations to those tested by bekins et al 2020 given the aromatic nature of the formulae identified by orbitrap upregulation of ahr and pxp is expected the gene response is appropriate given the functions of the associated enzymes the claim that these results indicate hydrocarbon degradation intermediates pose a risk cannot be supported without understanding what the active agents in the tested mixture are and whether they actually are degradation intermediates bekins et al 2020 to date hrms has been more commonly used to study transformations of oil associated with marine spills than subsurface releases chen et al 2016 lemkau et al 2014 ray et al 2014 vaughan et al 2016 while photooxidation is often the focus in marine environments the role of biodegradation cannot be excluded direct comparisons are difficult as results often presented in plots and figures but there are general differences between the crude oil oxidation products described and ococ identified in bemidji groundwater illumination of dissolved constitutes from a gulf of mexico crude oil resulted in a reduction of o2 compounds relative to o3 and o4 compounds but those with two oxygens remained in highest concentrations vaughan et al 2016 a similar study described a change in oxygen number distribution from o2 o3 o4 o5 o6 to o5 o4 o6 o3 o2 following illumination ray et al 2014 results consistent with vaughan et al 2016 vaughan et al 2016 were noted with oil collected from exposed sediments over 43 months chen et al 2016 these changes were concurrent with reductions in molecular weight and dbes of the oxidation products identified samples of a heavy fuel oil were collected up to 617 days after its release lemkau et al 2014 the oxygen number distribution was o1 o2 o3 o4 o5 for the fresh oil and o2 o3 o4 o5 o1for the weathered samples while the bemidji ococ had a greater number of dbe than those associated with the crude there was little change in the average dbe resulting from oxidation of the heavy fuel oil exposed to a marine environment lemkau et al 2014 hrms has also been used to evaluate ococ associated with hydrocarbons in other contexts concerns for naphthenic acids in oil sands process water ospw these waters have been extensively studied ahad et al 2013 barrow et al 2015 frank et al 2014 leclair et al 2015 pereira et al 2013 vaughan et al 2016 ococ associated with ospw are different from those identified in the current study using orbitrap ahad et al 2013 analyzed oil sands ospw collected from storage ponds groundwater collected from wells downgradient of the ponds unimpacted groundwater and river water as expected in naphthenic acids rich materials over 60 of the ococ had two oxygens in samples of oil sands ospw and ospw impacted groundwater and only trace concentrations of compounds with more than four oxygens these results are consistent with ospw samples analyzed by other research groups ahad et al 2013 frank et al 2014 leclair et al 2015 pereira et al 2013 in contrast the most commonly identified ococ in unimpacted groundwater and surface water samples contained five oxygens followed by those with four or six oxygens vaughan et al 2016 fewer than 10 of the compounds identified in unimpacted waters had two oxygens others studies have found a greater difference in oxygen number distribution between ospw and unimpacted river water ococ barrow et al 2015 with the highest fraction of ococ having either five six or seven oxygens table 3 bemidji source area well samples are more similar to unimpacted water than ospw influenced samples the hypothesis that elevated doc is generated as a result of methanogenic hydrocarbon degradation has implications for modeling monitored natural attenuation the availability of electron acceptors such as oxygen nitrate sulfate and iron is considered a critical factor in assessing and modeling attenuation processes us epa 2017 charles et al 1996 grossi et al 2008 thornton et al 2001 paired fermentation methanogenesis does not require an extraneous electron acceptor as carbon within the substrate or co2 is reduced to methane as suggested by eq 3 the loss of electrons in methane is linked to the generation of oxidized organic material cxhyoz which includes doc hydroxyl aromatic components of doc can vary between quinone and hydroquinone forms as they accept or donate electrons so they may serve as either terminal or regenerable electron acceptors us epa 2017 cervantes et al 2001 klüpfel et al 2014 natural organic matter is known to contain exogenous electron mediators that allow for extracellular electron transfer between microbes and electron acceptors lovley et al 1996 geobacter a hydrocarbon degrading bacteria found at bemidji synthesizes and secretes fulvic acid to facilitate iron reduction essaid et al 2011 wang et al 2020 the humic component of doc has been shown to serve as electron acceptor supporting the degradation of hydrocarbons including benzene and toluene us epa 2017 klüpfel et al 2014 when doc concentrations exceed those of dissolved hydrocarbons as at the bemidji site the electron accepting capacity of the doc may be sufficient to support degradation of dissolved hydrocarbons the two hypotheses for the generation of doc associated with hydrocarbon biodegradation petroleum metabolites or microbial products are not mutually exclusive samples collected across a site are likely to have differing fractions of ococ that are either metabolites or microbial products consistent with naturally occurring doc metabolites are most likely to be present in waters containing dissolved hydrocarbons and progressively less likely as hydrocarbon free water moves downgradient formulae identified only within the hydrocarbon plume may warrant further investigation risk implications of this dual hypothesis are the subject of future study in conclusion the results presented challenge the long held assumptions that organic compounds dissolved in groundwater downgradient of a hydrocarbon release are primarily degradation intermediates and as such should be considered toxic until proven otherwise baedecker et al 2018 bekins et al 2016 eganhouse et al 1993 when assessing and managing risk our research suggests the issues of 1 analytical method used 2 source of the ococ and 3 their toxicity should be addressed for example our work with ococ in groundwater downgradient of biodegrading fuel release sites showed that the identifiable gc able portion was vastly dominated by molecular structures that likely posed low risk to human health mohler et al 2013 zemo et al 2017 zemo et al 2013 toxicity testing was conducted on whole groundwater samples containing ococ only which would contain both metabolites and microbial products and eliminates the analytical method question showed no effects for genotoxicity or estrogen receptor disruption via two assays and no effects above background for two standardized freshwater aquatic receptors patterson et al 2020 this work also highlights the importance of broadly surveying the scientific literature scientists focused on contaminated sites including ourselves often consider only similar studies while ignoring papers describing biochemical processes that occur in uncontaminated environments this study could not have been conducted without the excellent research being conducted in the fields of doc chemistry

1399,the concentrations of oxygen containing organic compounds ococ measured as dissolved organic carbon doc in groundwater exceeds those of dissolved hydrocarbons measured as total petroleum hydrocarbons tph at a crude oil release site orbitrap mass spectrometry was used to characterize ococ in samples of the oil water from upgradient of the release source area and downgradient wells and a local lake chemical characterization factors included carbon number oxygen number formulae similarity double bond equivalents dbe and radiocarbon dating oil samples were dominated by formulae with less than 30 carbons four or fewer oxygens and a dbe of less than four in water samples formulae were identified with more than 30 carbons more than 10 oxygens and a dbe exceeding 30 these characteristics are consistent with doc found in unimpacted water between 65 and 92 of the formulae found in samples collected within the elevated ococ plume were also found in the upgradient or surface water samples evidence suggests that many of the ococ are not petroleum degradation intermediates but microbial products generated as a result of de novo synthesis by organisms growing on carbon supplied by the oil implications of these results for understanding the fate and managing the risk of hydrocarbons in the subsurface are discussed 1 introduction high resolution mass

mohler et al 2013 2020 o reilly et al 2019 zemo et al 2013 zemo et al 2017 in earlier papers ococ were called petroleum metabolites mohler et al 2013 zemo et al 2017 or polar metabolites zemo et al 2013 and were assumed to be compounds within hydrocarbon biodegradation pathways we recommend the use of ococ because a number of the compounds have been identified in wells upgradient of any hydrocarbon release and have structures suggesting that some may not be metabolites of hydrocarbon degradation mohler et al 2020 o reilly et al 2019 in this paper petroleum metabolites is defined as a subclass of ococ that are degradation pathway intermediates or other oxidized hydrocarbons petroleum metabolites have carbon structures consistent with those found in oil the term microbial products another subclass of ococ is used to describe compounds generated by de novo synthesis as a result of biological activity so they have chemical structures unrelated to the growth substrate the terms petroleum metabolites and microbial products are consistent with the concepts of substrate utilization associated products and biomass associated products used in wastewater engineering laspidou and rittmann 2002 the use of orbitrap was inspired in part by the work of bekins et al 2016 in that paper questions were raised about the chemical characteristics of non volatile dissolved organic carbon doc in groundwater at the u s geological survey s usgs s bemidji minnesota crude oil release research site because doc methods measure a broader range of compounds than those that may pass through a gas chromatograph gc an alternative analytical approach was warranted limited results of hrms analysis of groundwater from this site are available islam et al 2016 mohler et al 2020 podgorski et al 2021 as applied in this study orbitrap uses direct injection of the sample extract so compounds that are too large to pass through a gc are detected and a larger fraction of the doc is characterized whereas gcxgc separates compounds by boiling point and polarity orbitrap separates ionizable compounds by ion mass so it is not limited by compound volatility mohler et al 2020 the tradeoff is that orbitrap identifies only chemical formulae while gcxgc tofms can identify the structure of compounds found in mass spectra libraries due to technical limitations of mass spectrometry neither method detects all the compounds present in a sample published results of orbitrap and other hrms analysis of oxidation products associated with marine oils spills chen et al 2016 islam et al 2016 lemkau et

results with other occurrences of hydrocarbon associated ococ the national crude oil spill fate and natural attenuation research site near bemidji minnesota usgs s bemidji site has been extensively studied and is ideal for characterizing the chemistry and sources of ococ crude oil was released as the result of a pipeline rupture in 1979 eganhouse et al 1993 usgs s efforts have resulted in

2016 mohler et al 2020 podgorski et al 2018 thorn and aiken 1998 while ococ and doc components have been assumed to be primarily petroleum metabolites bekins et al 2016 podgorski et al 2018 thorn and aiken 1998 the hypothesis that they may also be microbial products has not been tested mohler et al 2020 the distinction between petroleum metabolites and microbial products is critical for developing an accurate understanding of the fate of hydrocarbons in the environment and managing associated risks the assumption that ococ associated with a hydrocarbon plume are primarily petroleum metabolites is based on a conceptual model that some oil components are bioactive enough to be oxidized by bacteria but the compounds generated are slower to degrade the relative rates of these reactions are such that the concentration of the ococ can exceed that of dissolved hydrocarbon substrates more importantly it suggests that biogeochemical processes and doc chemistry at petroleum release sites are distinct from those of unimpacted sites on the other hand if the ococ are primarily microbial products it suggests that the more degradable fraction of oil serves as a carbon source that supports an active microbial community as the products of de novo microbial synthesis these ococ are less likely to be unique to hydrocarbon impacted sites and the biogeochemical processes are more consistent with unimpacted sites an issue with many publications focused on contaminant degradation is that they are often insular and fail to consider the broader scientific literature in this study we integrate research related to hydrocarbon fate with that from the rapidly growing field of doc chemistry understanding whether ococ are petroleum metabolites or microbial products is especially important if sample concentrations are measured using broad non specific analytical methods such as doc podgorski et al 2021 three recent papers describe bioactivity tests conducted on groundwater samples collected from the bemidji site bekins et al 2020 mcguire et al 2018 podgorski et al 2018 while the results are presented relative to doc concentrations the authors claim they evaluated the risk of petroleum derived dissolved organic matter podgorski et al 2018 transformation products mcguire et al 2018 or hydrocarbon degradation intermediates bekins et al 2020 in each case the assays were not adequately controlled for common doc constituents dissolved hydrocarbons and or microbial products even though these have been shown to generate positive results bittner et al 2006 blackwell et al 2019 eisman et al 1991 regulators have also assumed that ococ found at hydrocarbon release sites are petroleum metabolites in developing guidance for what they call hydrocarbon oxidation products san francisco bay regional water quality board sfrwqcb 2019 intermediate degradation products kmet 2016 or tph derived polar breakdown products state of hawaiʻi s o 2014 a clear understanding of the ococ and their potential sources is necessary to ensure that appropriate risk management strategies are employed at petroleum release sites goals of this study include characterizing complex mixtures of ococ found in oil and water associated with a crude oil release and evaluating the hypothesis that some ococ are microbial products not petroleum metabolites chemical characterization factors include the distribution of formulae based on carbon number oxygen number and double bond equivalence dbe similarities and differences in these distributions are compared between samples collected from monitoring wells upgradient of the oil release within the location of the crude oil source zone downgradient of the source and from the surface of a local lake individual formulae were compared between sample types to determine what fraction of formulae may be unique to the hydrocarbon plume chemical characteristics of the ococ formulae identified were compared to expected metabolites of the site oil and published values for doc from unimpacted aquatic systems finally biological processes that may be the primary source of ococ are discussed 2 methods 2 1 study site samples were collected at the usgs bemidji site a release of a light crude oil occurred at the site as the result of a pipeline rupture in 1979 eganhouse et al 1993 when released the oil s fractional composition was about 60 alkanes 35 aromatics and the remainder resins and asphaltenes ng et al 2014 following emergency response approximately 150 m3 of oil remained in the subsurface forming three oil bodies baedecker et al 2018 within the north pool oil on the water table extends 50 m upgradient and 25 m downgradient from the center of the oil body fig 1 essaid et al 2011 the resultant dissolved hydrocarbon plume has extended downgradient as far as 150 m eganhouse et al 1993 the aquifer is composed primarily of coarse grained glacial outwash with interbedded lower permeability layers natural attenuation processes have been documented in the groundwater and vadose zone resulting in changes to the oil composition and aquifer geochemistry eganhouse et al 1993 ng et al 2014 sihota et al 2011 in the vicinity of residual oil the primary attenuation processes are fermentation and methanogenesis baedecker et al 2018 bekins et al 2005 over 90 of the oil loss in the saturated zone is associated with the biodegradation of alkanes at the oil water interface while there has been a minor loss of mono aromatic compounds baedecker et al 2018 bekins et al 2005 ng et al 2014 there is no evidence of degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs resins or asphaltenes baedecker et al 2018 2 2 samples and sample locations samples for orbitrap analysis were collected in july 2016 june 2017 and october 2018 monitoring well locations are identified by their distance from the center of the oil body bekins et al 2016 groundwater samples were collected from two wells situated about 200 m upgradient of the release ten wells between 35 and 328 m downgradient of the release and an unimpacted cross gradient well fig 1 oil samples were collected from two wells during the 2017 and 2018 sampling events in 2018 two surface water samples were collected from a lake downgradient of the release the two numbers at the end of each sample name indicates the year the sample was

specific conductance and doc cozzarelli et al 2016 podgorski et al 2021 in 2018 radiocarbon analysis of doc and dissolved inorganic carbon was conducted a e lalonde ams laboratory ottawa ontario for evaluation of tph and ococ 5 l water samples were shipped to a state certified commercial laboratory eurofins lancaster laboratories lancaster pennsylvania and unfiltered groundwater was extracted with dichloromethane dcm following epa method 3510 one dcm extract for each groundwater sample was subjected to sgc epa method 3630 to separate the hydrocarbons from the polar compounds mohler et al 2013 each extract was analyzed using gc fid epa method 8015 to measure tph c10 to c40 concentration with and without sgc the extracts were shipped to chevron s laboratory in richmond california for further analysis 2 3 orbitrap analysis the ltq orbitrap xl instrument used in this study is capable of 100 000 resolving power at m z 200 with a mass accuracy of five parts per million mohler et al 2020 the combination of the high resolution and the high mass accuracy allows elemental compositions to be accurately assigned to the mass spectral peaks samples consisting of either groundwater dcm extracts without sgc or untreated crude oil were diffused directly into the ltq orbitrap xl with an electrospray ion source esi at 5 μl per minute the mass spectrometer was tuned to m z 400 the center of the mass distribution of the samples and kept constant for all samples the mass spectra were collected using a mass range of 125 2000 da with the resolving power set to 60 000 at m z 200 separate injections were made with the detector operated in negative and positive ion mode petroorg petroleomics software corilo 2013 was used to assign the elemental composition and chemical formulae the response or peak height for each formula was reported as the relative abundance these were converted to fractional response by dividing each formula s relative abundance by the sum of the relative abundance of all formulae identified in a sample hawkes et al 2016 sleighter et al 2010 subdiaga et al 2020 relative abundance and fractional response are used because concentrations of the thousands of individual formulae identified cannot be determined without the use chemical standards chemical characteristics derived from the formula include the numbers of carbons hydrogens oxygens nitrogens and sulfurs information on the structural complexity of the carbon skeleton is indicated by a formula s dbe which is calculated as 1 dbe c 1 h 2 n 2 where c h and n equal the number of carbon hydrogen and nitrogens in the formula one goal of this study is to identify formulae that may be unique to petroleum release sites first lists of formulae identified in background samples i e upgradient wells cross gradient wells and surface water were compiled formulae identified in source area or downgradient samples were screened against these lists for each of the source area or downgradient samples the percentage of formulae also found in background samples was determined as the number of formulae in both the plume well and background samples divided by the total number of formulae identified in the plume well sample 2 number of formulae in sample x that are also in a background sample number of formulae in sample x the percentage of the fractional response associated with formulae also found in background samples was calculated using the same approach 3 results 3 1 geochemical composition of the plume results of hydrocarbon concentrations and geochemical analyses of the natural attenuation parameters table 1 are consistent with previously published data from this site essaid et al 2011 ng et al 2014 the source area or dissolved hydrocarbon plume defined by samples with measurable tph in silica gel treated extracts extends to about 110 m samples with dissolved hydrocarbons from wells 518a 531a and 9315b have doc concentrations exceeding 15 mg l and geochemical characteristics consistent with anaerobic petroleum biodegradation one well within the source area well 533c did not have measurable tph and appears to be screened below the dissolved hydrocarbon plume mohler et al 2020 samples downgradient of the hydrocarbon plume but within the ococ plume wells 801a 9316a 954a 925d 1217c and 1217e have detectable tph without sgc no detectable tph with sgc and doc concentrations that exceed those of upgradient samples by between 2 and 5 mg l tph with sgc was non detect in the surface water samples the surface water s doc concentration of about 10 mg l exceeded those of either upgradient or downgradient groundwater samples radiocarbon analysis indicated that doc in upgradient groundwater and surface water consists of 100 modern carbon while doc in plume samples likely contained oil derived carbon table 1 for downgradient samples the fraction of modern carbon was consistent with the upgradient doc concentration as a fraction of the total doc the decrease in fraction of modern carbon in the dissolved inorganic carbon dic indicates that some hydrocarbons are being completely mineralized while the detection of methane in the source area wells suggests methanogenesis is on going 3 2 comparison to upgradient and surface water samples the number of orbitrap identified formulae per sample ranged from 104 to 2336 table 2 the median was 1595 and the average was 1460 over 8900 unique formulae were identified across the 28 samples results for each sample are summarized in table 3 the fractional response of individual formulae ranged from a few percent to less than 0 001 additional results for the 2016 samples are presented in mohler et al 2020 to identify formulae that might be unique to petroleum impacted sites the formulae found in oil source area and downgradient samples were screened against those found in upgradient and surface water samples formulae found in the latter are more likely to be doc components that are not unique to petroleum impacted waters while formulae found only in the oil influenced sample may warrant further investigation the comparisons were done on a number of formulae and fractional response basis only about 5 of the formulae identified in oil samples were also in either upgradient or surface water samples these account for less than 1 of the fractional response for the source area samples between 64 and 87 of the formulae were also found in one or more upgradient or surface water samples table 3 fig 2 these accounted for between 78 and 96 of the response for the downgradient samples the formulae also found in background samples were between 78 and 92 of the total formulae and 88 and 99 of the response 3 3 chemical characterization oil was collected from the same two wells in 2017 and 2018 the 2018 samples were analyzed in duplicate the results for all oil samples are consistent the carbon distribution indicates few formulae with less than c15 most formulae at around c20 and a decreasing trend through about c40 table 3 about 45 of the formulae contained three oxygens and one sulfur these so3 formulae accounted for about 90 of the fractional response of the ococ without sulfur 80 had two oxygens and the remaining had four oxygens over 80 of the response resulted from non aromatic formulae with less than four dbe the average dbe c of 0 07 is consistent with oxidized alkanes for the groundwater samples there are three carbon number distributions noted with some samples having all three table 3 the lighter group of formulae ranges from about c10 to c20 with a maxima at c15 the medium group ranges in the c20s while the heaviest group peaks in the c30s or beyond upgradient and downgradient samples with only the lighter group of formulae were collected in 2017 the medium and heavier groups were more common in source area and downgradient samples collected in 2016 and 2018 the carbon number distribution of the surface water samples which were only collected in 2018 overlapped with the medium and heavier formulae identified in groundwater formulae identified by orbitrap in groundwater extracts did not contain sulfur or nitrogen it is unknown whether this is due to issues with the extraction method or ionization efficiency the number of oxygens and dbes trended with carbon number fig 3 fig sm 1 while formulae with up to 12 oxygens were identified most formulae in the lighter carbon number group had between two and five oxygens formulae in the heavier group commonly had five or more oxygens while formulae in the lighter group tended to have fewer oxygens they had higher o c ratios formulae in the lighter group tended to have fewer than 10 dbes while those in the heavier groups tended to have between 10 and 20 dbes some formulae had over 30 dbes the dbe results indicate that formulae have some aromatic components due to the relationship between carbon number and dbe dbe c is used to compare compounds of different sizes the average dbe c for all water samples ranged from 0 35 to 0 51 a van krevelen diagram is a common approach for visualizing and evaluating data sets generated by the hrms analysis of complex mixtures kew et al 2017 kim et al 2003 in fig 4 the x axis is the o c ratio so formulae with higher oxygen numbers trend towards the right the y axis is the h c ratio so compounds with fewer dbe plot higher h c trends inversely with dbe c oil formulae with the greatest response plot between 0 1 and 0 2 on the o c axis and 1 5 and 2 0 on the h c axis formulae in the lighter group plot between 0 1 and 0 5 on the o c axis and 1 0 and 2 0 on the h c axis those in the heavier groups plot between 0 15 and 0 3 on the o c axis and 0 5 and 1 3 on the h c axis the van krevelen diagrams in fig 4 highlight differences in ococ formulae identified in oil and water samples formulae identified in the oil samples have high h c and low o c which is consistent with expected intermediates of alkane biodegradation for both background samples 9021 18 and sw1 18 and within plume samples 518a 16 and 925d 18 most formulae plot between 0 5 and 1 5 on the h c axis and 0 40 on the o c axis the lower h c ratios are consistent with higher dbe aromatic formulae degradation of complex aromatic hydrocarbons has not been demonstrated at this site baedecker et al 2018 similarities between the plume and surface water doc is highlighted by comparing the plots of sw1 18 and 518a 16 and 925d 18 4 discussion the carbon number distribution and low dbes of formulae identified in the oil samples are consistent with hydrocarbon structure of the alkane rich crude oil at the bemidji site formulae with less than four dbe indicating they are not aromatic accounted for about 80 of the response the dominance of so3 formulae in the oil samples may suggest the production of sulfonic esters sulfonate biosurfactants to aid in degradation at the oil water interface volkering et al 1997 sulfur free ococ typically had either two oxygens suggestive of organic acids or four oxygens suggestive of diacids such organic acids are consistent with expected petroleum biodegradation intermediates zemo et al 2013 the chemistry of the formulae identified in the water samples differs from those found in the oil samples average carbon numbers are 24 for the oil 14 for the lighter water sample group and 35 for the heavier water group the number of oxygens especially in the heavier group often exceeds four ococ in the oil samples were primarily alkyl as indicated by an average dbe c of 0 07 while those in the water samples had aromatic characteristics as indicated by average dbe c in the range of 0 35 to 0 51 there was not a consistent trend between the chemical characteristics of the ococ and plume location differing by sample upgradient wells had evidence of light medium and heavy formulae groups wells 531a and 9315b are in the core of the source area with elevated doc concentrations dissolved hydrocarbons and strongly reducing conditions samples from these wells were dominated by the heavier group of formulae well 533c is within the footprint of the dissolved hydrocarbon plume but it may be screened below the dissolved hydrocarbon plume as tph were non detect the sample from well 533c showed formulae from each group for downgradient wells all but one sample collected in 2017 954a 17 had only the lighter group all downgradient samples collected in 2016 and 2018 had the heavier group while some also had the lighter and medium group the reason for the difference in results between 2017 samples and those from the other two years is unknown while both source area and surface water samples were dominated by heavier formulae 14c results indicate doc in the source area derives from the oil but doc in the surface water derives from modern photosynthesis based only on carbon and oxygen numbers hydrocarbon biotransformation could theoretically account for formulae in the lighter group but the observation that formulae in the heavier group are larger than those in the oil suggest factors other than hydrocarbon degradation are involved in their production the observation that formulae with five or greater oxygens are at higher concentrations than those with four or fewer is more consistent with ococ found in unimpacted groundwater than expected for degradation intermediates ahad et al 2013 qiao et al 2020 zemo et al 2013 the dbe c range of formulae in both groups 0 35 to 0 51 is inconsistent with petroleum metabolites of the alkane dominated degradation detected at bemidji dbe c should be less than 0 10 for alkanes the mono aromatic acids identified by gc ms in groundwater at this site by cozzarelli et al 1994 had 10 or fewer carbons and dbe c of between 0 50 and 0 71 the range of measured dbe c values are consistent with typical doc constituents identified in natural waters using hrms hughes et al 2017 lian et al 2021 maizel et al 2017 valle et al 2018 while the o c ratios are lower than that of humic substances isolated from groundwater the average dbe c are similar artinger et al 2000 comparing formulae found in source area and downgradient samples with those identified in the upgradient and surface water samples indicates similarities in the nature of the doc inside and outside the plume upgradient samples had ococ in both the light and heavy group while the surface water was dominated by those in the heavier group 14c results for these samples indicate that their doc is modern and does not contain oil derived carbon still 78 to 96 of the fractional response of source samples and 88 to 99 of the response of downgradient samples consists of formula found in either upgradient or surface water islam et al 2016 used hrms to analyze xad resin extracts of bemidji site groundwater samples collected from an upgradient well 310 a well within the oil spray zone with elevated doc 603 and a well at the downgradient edge of the dissolved hydrocarbon plume 530 based on the data presented with the paper between 79 and 97 of the fractional response of well 530 and well 603 samples were also found in samples from the upgradient well 310 over 50 of the fractional response of both upgradient and dissolved plume samples consisted of formulae identified in standard mixtures of humic acids subdiaga et al 2020 it is important to note these comparisons are based only on formulae so differences in the chemical structures present are not known while podgorski et al 2021 conducted hrms analysis on samples of some of the wells we investigated only general results such sample averaged molecular weights o c and h c were presented formulae specific comparisons were not conducted but the authors noted a biodegradation continuum with doc chemistry becoming more similar to upstream samples as groundwater moved downgradient although formulae identified in background and plume samples are consistent differences between samples are to be expected background groundwater is carbon poor and aerobic carbon availability and redox conditions vary across the plume while surface water is carbon rich and aerobic table 1 in aquatic systems and sediments such geochemical factors are known to result in shifts in ococ mixtures characterized by hrms herzsprung et al 2017 valle et al 2018 still the product of chemical cycling and microbial processes is doc consisting of a common pool of chemical formulae zark and dittmar 2018 the compounds detected within a complex mixture depend on the analytical methods no single method will identify every constituent in paired analysis of some of the samples described in this paper mohler et al 2020 noted little overlap between the compounds identified by gcxgc ms and formulae identified by orbitrap while solid phase extraction is typically used to concentrate doc for hrms analysis dcm extraction was used in the current study because the research program is focused on ococ that may be measured as tph by method 8015 due to differences in extraction methods and the ionization efficiency of different hrms technologies comparisons between studies is challenging for example islam et al 2016 used fticr ms to analyze organics extracted from 120 l samples of bemidji groundwater using xad 4 and xad 8 and reported more formulae per sample than we identified by orbitrap in dcm extracts of 5 l samples the difference in extraction methods and 24 times greater sample volume may account for the detection of s and n containing heteroatoms by islam et al 2016 while we identified s containing compounds in the oil samples neither s nor n containing formulae were identified in the dcm groundwater extracts another difference between islam and the current study is the age of the release when the samples were collected as the extracts analyzed by islam in 2016 were prepared by usgs scientists in 1986 1987 and 1998 the carbon range distribution of ococs identified in the two studies also varied the response averaged carbon number for the seven islam samples ranged from 17 to 22 while it ranged from 27 to 34 for orbitrap analyzed samples dominated by the heavy formulae group a potential mechanism for the generation of elevated doc concentrations is microbial growth associated with methanogenesis at the oil water interface at bemidji methanogenesis and fermentation are dominant alkane degradation processes in the oil source zone bekins et al 2005 and much of the methane production occurs where oil contacts water ng et al 2014 sufficient gas is produced that exsolution occurs and bubbles containing methane and co2 are generated amos et al 2005 hydrocarbon degradation mediated by methanogens and fermenters growing at the oil water interface has been noted at other sites irianni renno et al 2016 fermentation converts organic molecules into a pool of fatty acids and alcohols that can serve as the carbon source for microorganisms including methanogens and other anaerobes irianni renno et al 2016 valle et al 2018 stable isotopic ratios of carbon and hydrogen in dissolved methane and carbon in dic in bemidji groundwater suggest that methanogenesis is linked to acetate fermentation revesz et al 1995 our 14c results indicate that oil is a source of carbon in dic table 1 concentrations of fermentation associated c4 organic acids exceeding 1000 mg l have been detected in groundwater at a gas condensate release site amos et al 2005 bacteria growing on simple substrates such as a single sugar or amino acid are known to produce complex mixtures of organic compounds with characteristics similar to those identified by orbitrap lechtenfeld et al 2015 lian et al 2021 valle et al 2017 described the generation of complex chemical mixtures linked to methanogenesis in anaerobic sediments under this hypothesis the generation of doc as a result of fermentation and methanogenesis is summarized by the informal equation 3 alkanes h 2 o ch 4 co 2 cxhyoz cxhyoz represents fermentation products biomass petroleum metabolites and microbial products microbial products measured as doc include those that are released from cells due to lysis diffusion through the cell membrane predation or excretion for some purpose laspidou and rittmann 2002 the biochemically produced fraction of doc may include simple chemicals such as sugars and fatty acids larger biopolymers such as polysaccharides and proteins and complex compounds characterized as humic acids lechtenfeld et al 2015 anaerobic bacteria can synthesize and secrete fulvic acid a common doc constituent wang et al 2020 organic carbon is cycled between biomass and doc as microorganisms degrade and grow on the microbial products lost by other organisms lechtenfeld et al 2015 repeta 2015 as such the compounds have structures that are distinct from the initial carbon source and are not unique to a petroleum release site bacterial transformation of organic matter to a common pool of compounds as water moves downgradient from inputs of organic matter is consistent with doc behavior in other aquatic systems kellerman et al 2018 scavia 1988 as noted by zark and dittmar 2018 doc from different sources consisting of compounds with identical structural features is likely the result of a cascade of common synthetic and degradation processes that ultimately lead to the formation of a universal background regardless of origin and history of the organic material the fraction of 14c depleted or oil derived carbon is greatest in the source area samples and decreases as groundwater moves downgradient table 1 the decrease is likely due to loss of more labile freshly produced ococs relative to the background doc that consists of modern carbon while 14c results indicate that carbon in the excess doc is derived from oil it does not distinguish between petroleum metabolites or the product of microbial synthesis compounds synthesized by organisms growing on oil or its degradation products will be depleted in 14c in defense of the hypothesis that ococ in bemidji groundwater are primarily petroleum metabolites ng et al 2014 proposed that doc is generated through the oxidation of precursors to doc pre doc including alkylated polyaromatics resins and asphaltenes this is not supported by our data to account for the carbon number and dbes of the formulae identified by orbitrap the hydrocarbons in the pre doc fraction would need to consist of alkyl aromatic compounds with up to 30 carbons thorn and aiken 1998 proposed c19 alkyl aromatics as potential precursors to doc in bemidji groundwater analysis of oil from the site indicates the loss of alkyl aromatics with more than eight carbons and pahs has been so low that it could not be quantified baedecker et al 2018 making it unlikely to be the source of the measured concentrations of doc on the other hand the same study indicated losses of c6 c30 n alkanes exceeding 90 podgorski et al 2021 suggested that resins and asphaltenes may be doc precursors even though they are minor component of the oil are considered to be recalcitrant and no evidence for their degradation at this site has been presented baedecker et al 2018 a specific mechanism for the biological oxidation of the pre doc that would account for greater than four oxygens per molecule has not been proposed two common approaches for incorporating oxygen into a hydrocarbon under anaerobic conditions are through the addition of fumarate c2h2o4 2 or co2 mosher et al 2015 in either case products have an even number of oxygens but the formulae identified in groundwater samples are equally split between those with even and odd numbers of oxygens also these oxygen addition mechanisms require an investment of either energy with carboxylation or a central metabolite with fumarate addition such a process would not seem to be sustainable if the organism lost the product as doc before recouping the investment while doc consisting of oxidized hydrocarbons made sense when it was initially proposed in the 1990s eganhouse et al 1993 thorn and aiken 1998 the hypothesis needs to be reassessed given current understandings of doc chemistry and concepts of anaerobic biotransformation when assessing and managing risk it is important to understand whether petroleum associated ococ are unique degradation intermediates or consistent with microbially produced doc from unimpacted sites using transcription receptor assays bekins et al 2020 evaluated the bioactivity of doc extracted from bemidji site groundwater while the term petroleum degradation intermediates is defined as compounds within a biodegradation pathway or those generated directly through the microbial oxidation of hydrocarbon molecules o reilly et al 2019 the authors used it to be synonymous with the doc isolated from downgradient wells of the 46 molecular targets tested upregulation was noted for two the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr and pregnane x receptor pxr transcription factors the extent of the response trended with doc concentration both genes have been described as promiscuous as they are activated by a wide range of structurally diverse naturally occurring compounds including surface water doc blackwell et al 2019 humic acids common constituents of doc have been shown to activate ahr at similar concentrations to those tested by bekins et al 2020 given the aromatic nature of the formulae identified by orbitrap upregulation of ahr and pxp is expected the gene response is appropriate given the functions of the associated enzymes the claim that these results indicate hydrocarbon degradation intermediates pose a risk cannot be supported without understanding what the active agents in the tested mixture are and whether they actually are degradation intermediates bekins et al 2020 to date hrms has been more commonly used to study transformations of oil associated with marine spills than subsurface releases chen et al 2016 lemkau et al 2014 ray et al 2014 vaughan et al 2016 while photooxidation is often the focus in marine environments the role of biodegradation cannot be excluded direct comparisons are difficult as results often presented in plots and figures but there are general differences between the crude oil oxidation products described and ococ identified in bemidji groundwater illumination of dissolved constitutes from a gulf of mexico crude oil resulted in a reduction of o2 compounds relative to o3 and o4 compounds but those with two oxygens remained in highest concentrations vaughan et al 2016 a similar study described a change in oxygen number distribution from o2 o3 o4 o5 o6 to o5 o4 o6 o3 o2 following illumination ray et al 2014 results consistent with vaughan et al 2016 vaughan et al 2016 were noted with oil collected from exposed sediments over 43 months chen et al 2016 these changes were concurrent with reductions in molecular weight and dbes of the oxidation products identified samples of a heavy fuel oil were collected up to 617 days after its release lemkau et al 2014 the oxygen number distribution was o1 o2 o3 o4 o5 for the fresh oil and o2 o3 o4 o5 o1for the weathered samples while the bemidji ococ had a greater number of dbe than those associated with the crude there was little change in the average dbe resulting from oxidation of the heavy fuel oil exposed to a marine environment lemkau et al 2014 hrms has also been used to evaluate ococ associated with hydrocarbons in other contexts concerns for naphthenic acids in oil sands process water ospw these waters have been extensively studied ahad et al 2013 barrow et al 2015 frank et al 2014 leclair et al 2015 pereira et al 2013 vaughan et al 2016 ococ associated with ospw are different from those identified in the current study using orbitrap ahad et al 2013 analyzed oil sands ospw collected from storage ponds groundwater collected from wells downgradient of the ponds unimpacted groundwater and river water as expected in naphthenic acids rich materials over 60 of the ococ had two oxygens in samples of oil sands ospw and ospw impacted groundwater and only trace concentrations of compounds with more than four oxygens these results are consistent with ospw samples analyzed by other research groups ahad et al 2013 frank et al 2014 leclair et al 2015 pereira et al 2013 in contrast the most commonly identified ococ in unimpacted groundwater and surface water samples contained five oxygens followed by those with four or six oxygens vaughan et al 2016 fewer than 10 of the compounds identified in unimpacted waters had two oxygens others studies have found a greater difference in oxygen number distribution between ospw and unimpacted river water ococ barrow et al 2015 with the highest fraction of ococ having either five six or seven oxygens table 3 bemidji source area well samples are more similar to unimpacted water than ospw influenced samples the hypothesis that elevated doc is generated as a result of methanogenic hydrocarbon degradation has implications for modeling monitored natural attenuation the availability of electron acceptors such as oxygen nitrate sulfate and iron is considered a critical factor in assessing and modeling attenuation processes us epa 2017 charles et al 1996 grossi et al 2008 thornton et al 2001 paired fermentation methanogenesis does not require an extraneous electron acceptor as carbon within the substrate or co2 is reduced to methane as suggested by eq 3 the loss of electrons in methane is linked to the generation of oxidized organic material cxhyoz which includes doc hydroxyl aromatic components of doc can vary between quinone and hydroquinone forms as they accept or donate electrons so they may serve as either terminal or regenerable electron acceptors us epa 2017 cervantes et al 2001 klüpfel et al 2014 natural organic matter is known to contain exogenous electron mediators that allow for extracellular electron transfer between microbes and electron acceptors lovley et al 1996 geobacter a hydrocarbon degrading bacteria found at bemidji synthesizes and secretes fulvic acid to facilitate iron reduction essaid et al 2011 wang et al 2020 the humic component of doc has been shown to serve as electron acceptor supporting the degradation of hydrocarbons including benzene and toluene us epa 2017 klüpfel et al 2014 when doc concentrations exceed those of dissolved hydrocarbons as at the bemidji site the electron accepting capacity of the doc may be sufficient to support degradation of dissolved hydrocarbons the two hypotheses for the generation of doc associated with hydrocarbon biodegradation petroleum metabolites or microbial products are not mutually exclusive samples collected across a site are likely to have differing fractions of ococ that are either metabolites or microbial products consistent with naturally occurring doc metabolites are most likely to be present in waters containing dissolved hydrocarbons and progressively less likely as hydrocarbon free water moves downgradient formulae identified only within the hydrocarbon plume may warrant further investigation risk implications of this dual hypothesis are the subject of future study in conclusion the results presented challenge the long held assumptions that organic compounds dissolved in groundwater downgradient of a hydrocarbon release are primarily degradation intermediates and as such should be considered toxic until proven otherwise baedecker et al 2018 bekins et al 2016 eganhouse et al 1993 when assessing and managing risk our research suggests the issues of 1 analytical method used 2 source of the ococ and 3 their toxicity should be addressed for example our work with ococ in groundwater downgradient of biodegrading fuel release sites showed that the identifiable gc able portion was vastly dominated by molecular structures that likely posed low risk to human health mohler et al 2013 zemo et al 2017 zemo et al 2013 toxicity testing was conducted on whole groundwater samples containing ococ only which would contain both metabolites and microbial products and eliminates the analytical method question showed no effects for genotoxicity or estrogen receptor disruption via two assays and no effects above background for two standardized freshwater aquatic receptors patterson et al 2020 this work also highlights the importance of broadly surveying the scientific literature scientists focused on contaminated sites including ourselves often consider only similar studies while ignoring papers describing biochemical processes that occur in uncontaminated environments this study could not have been conducted without the excellent research being conducted in the fields of doc chemistry and biology blackwell et al 2019 2020 eisman et al 1991 hawkes et al 2016 kellerman et al 2018 lian et al 2021 subdiaga et al 2020 valle et al 2018 volkering et al 1997 zark and dittar 2021
