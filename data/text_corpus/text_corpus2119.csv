10595,accurate knowledge of root zone soil moisture is of vital significance to many applications in agriculture such as crop yield estimation precision irrigation salinity and groundwater management remote sensing methods based on optical and thermal satellite imagery have been proposed to estimate fine resolution 30 m grid cells maps of root zone soil moisture θ or degree of saturation s over large regions these methods usually calculate the evaporative fraction λ s e b as the ratio of the latent heat flux to the difference of the net radiation and ground heat flux then they estimate θ or s from an empirical relationship with λ s e b a similar approach estimates θ or s using the evaporative index λ p e t which is the ratio of the actual to potential evapotranspiration however previous research has shown that a single relationship between either θ or s and λ s e b does not apply to all regions the objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of regional soil vegetation and climatic conditions on the form and strength of the λ s e b θ λ p e t θ λ s e b s and λ p e t s relationships to accomplish this goal extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test efast is applied to a physically based model hydrus 1 d that simulates both evapotranspiration and soil moisture dynamics the sensitivity results show that within a given climatic region soil characteristics such as the percent clay and percent silt are most important in determining the shape of the relationships while vegetation characteristics such as leaf area index and maximum rooting depth have the greatest effect on the strength of these relationships the total annual precipitation which helps determine the climatic region also has a strong effect on both the form and strength of the relationships the parameters that define the λ s e b θ and λ p e t θ relationships are also estimated using the regional characteristics estimating the parameters in this way allows the methods to be adapted to local conditions and has the potential to improve the θ and s estimates keywords soil moisture root zone evaporative fraction evaporative index hydrus 1 d efast 1 introduction soil moisture is an important factor in the transfer of water and energy at the land atmosphere boundary and governs the partitioning of incoming energy into latent and sensible heat fluxes through soil evaporation and plant transpiration entekhabi et al 1996 and sun et al 2011 soil moisture also has a strong influence on the dynamics of the atmospheric boundary layer and has a direct influence on weather and climate patel et al 2009 thus accurate estimation of soil moisture is useful for planning and management of water resources as well as sustainable agricultural production particularly in semiarid and arid ecosystems where water is a limited resource in recent decades spaceborne remote sensing methods have been developed to monitor soil moisture nearly globally at regular time intervals these methods include passive and active microwave instruments such as the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the earth observing system amsr e soil moisture and ocean salinity smos and soil moisture active and passive smap missions njoku et al 2003 kerr et al 2012 and entekhabi et al 2010 these satellites estimate soil moisture at very coarse spatial resolutions 9 40 km grid cells and are only sensitive to moisture in the upper 5 10 cm of the soil layer entekhabi et al 2004 and kerr et al 2012 soil moisture can also be estimated indirectly using optical liu et al 2002 2003 and lobell and asner 2002 and thermal infrared tir remote sensing verstraeten et al 2006 and lu et al 2009 these methods provide much finer spatial resolutions 30 m to 1 km and estimate the average soil moisture throughout the root zone however they often have poor temporal resolutions and like the active passive microwave methods have lower performance as the vegetation cover increases muller and decamps 2001 soil moisture can also be estimated from the combination of optical and tir data using the triangle or trapezoidal method gillies et al 1997 and stisen et al 2008 the perpendicular drought index pdi method ghulam et al 2007 or energy balance methods bastiaanssen et al 2000 and scott et al 2003 the methods proposed by bastiaanssen et al 2000 and scott et al 2003 use multispectral imagery to calculate all the components of the surface energy balance seb several models are available for this purpose including the two source model tsm norman et al 1995 surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 two source energy balance tseb french et al 2002 mapping evapotranspiration et at high resolution with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 and remote sensing of et reset elhaddad and garcia 2008 once the energy balance is calculated the bastiaanssen et al 2000 and scott et al 2003 methods estimate the evaporative fraction λ s e b which is the ratio of the latent heat flux to the available energy net radiation minus ground heat flux shuttleworth et al 1989 the bastiaanssen et al 2000 method then uses an empirical logarithmic function to convert λ s e b to average root zone volumetric water content θ while the scott et al 2003 method uses a similar function to obtain an average root zone degree of saturation s the reliability of these approaches has been evaluated in several studies smith et al 1992 plotted λ s e b values from surface stations against the soil moisture by mass in the top 2 5 cm of the soil for grazed and ungrazed grasslands on alluvial soils and loess in kansas most of these gravimetric soil moisture measurements were above 25 by mass and little correlation was observed between λ s e b and soil moisture however when bastiaanssen et al 2000 fitted their logarithmic function using remotely sensed λ s e b values and field measurements of θ at 23 locations they obtained a coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 855 ahmad and bastiaanssen 2003 compared sebal derived estimates of s to observations from theta probes top 100 cm of the soil for wheat cotton and rice fields in pakistan they found a root mean square error rmse of 0 05 m3 m 3 but they only had 26 observations in this comparison scott et al 2003 also compared sebal derived estimates of s to observations from irrigated fields of rice cotton wheat alfalfa and sorghum in pakistan and mexico depths ranging from 45 cm to 100 cm they also found an rmse of 0 05 m3 m 3 but this dataset included only 52 observations extensive evaluations of the λ s e b θ and λ s e b s relationships were performed by alburn et al 2015 reset was used to estimate λ s e b from landsat 5 and landsat 7 images across a semiarid region in southeastern colorado for the summer months of three years the bastiaanssen et al 2000 and scott et al 2003 relationships were then applied to estimate θ and s these estimates were compared to 280 θ and s observations from time domain reflectometry tdr but the estimates failed to explain any of the space time variations in the tdr measurements the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce nash and sutcliffe 1970 of the θ and s estimates was 1 12 and 1 02 respectively 1 00 would indicate a perfect estimate while a negative nsce value indicates that the mean of the observed soil moisture is a more accurate estimate than the estimated soil moisture the remote sensing estimates were much more successful when the relationships were calibrated using the tdr observations nsce was 0 32 for θ and 0 36 for s but calibration is only possible when in situ soil moisture observations are available for the region of interest overall these results suggest that the empirical relationships proposed by bastiaanssen et al 2000 and scott et al 2003 are not applicable for all regions and region specific relationships are required to achieve adequate performance in some cases although previous studies have used λ s e b to estimate θ or s numerous other studies have suggested similar relationships between θ or s and the evaporative index λ p e t which is the ratio of actual to potential et λ p e t θ and λ p e t s relationships have been used to evaluate water budgets thornthwaite and mather 1955 estimate the availability of soil moisture to plants under different meteorological conditions denmead and shaw 1962 and baier 1969 assess agricultural potential for different land classifications yao 1974 improve estimates of actual et from soil moisture crago and brutsaert 1994 and crago 1996 estimate root zone soil moisture in the middle rio grande basin in new mexico fleming et al 2005 downscale soil moisture ranney et al 2015 and insert real time et fluxes into hydrologic models hendrickx et al 2016 the shapes of the λ s e b θ λ s e b s λ p e t θ and λ p e t s relationships are expected to depend on regional soil vegetation and climatic characteristics davies and allen 1973 rouse et al 1977 and brutsaert 2013 for example wilson et al 1997 analyzed the λ p e t s relationship for thin soil specimens in the laboratory and observed different relationship forms depending on the specimen s texture sand silt and clay gentine et al 2007 used a calibrated model to show that the shape of the λ s e b θ relationship depends on the vegetation cover with thicker vegetation covers producing higher λ s e b values for a given value θ denmead and shaw 1962 used field experiments to examine the λ p e t θ relationship for corn when the et is dominated by transpiration they found that low atmospheric demands associated with low potential et values can be supplied at low θ values which produces high λ p e t values however high atmospheric demands cannot be fully supplied which produces lower λ p e t values for the same θ these results suggest that the shape of the λ p e t θ relationship also depends on the magnitude of the potential et the main objectives of the present study are to 1 quantify the impacts of soil vegetation and climatic characteristics on the strength and form of the λ s e b θ λ s e b s λ p e t θ and λ p e t s relationships and 2 propose a set of empirical relationships that account for the relevant regional characteristics to achieve these goals a global sensitivity analysis is performed using extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test efast saltelli et al 1999 combinations of soil vegetation and climate characteristics are generated with efast and supplied to the physically based vadose zone model hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2013 for each set of characteristics hydrus 1d is used to simulate the soil moisture dynamics over a period of nine months which produces paired datasets for λ s e b θ λ s e b s λ p e t θ and λ p e t s the λ s e b θ λ s e b s λ p e t θ and λ p e t s relationships are then fitted to the datasets and efast is used to identify the soil vegetation and climate characteristics that have the greatest control on the relationship constants and r 2 values finally empirical equations are determined that estimate the relationship constants based on the most important regional characteristics 2 methodology 2 1 hydrus 1 d model the one dimensional variably saturated flow model hydrus 1 d version 4 17 šimůnek et al 2013 is used to simulate θ and s through time for various soil vegetation and climatic conditions hydrus 1 d has been used in many studies including studies on solute transport boudreau et al 2009 groundwater recharge jiménez martínez et al 2009 soil co2 fluxes buchner et al 2008 surface energy balance saito and šimůnek 2009 and soil moisture chen et al 2014 hydrus 1 d simulates one dimensional water movement in a partially saturated rigid medium using richard s equation 1 θ ψ t z k ψ ψ z 1 s v ψ where θ ψ is the volumetric water

a sink term that accounts for root water uptake cm3 cm 3 h 1 šimůnek et al 2013 the van genuchten 1980 functions are used for θ ψ and k ψ specifically 2 θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 κ ψ n m ψ 0 θ s ψ 0 where θ r

genuchten 1980 equations several soil hydraulic characteristics are required θ r θ s κ n k s and l in the present study the rosetta model version 1 schaap et al 2001 is used to obtain the required soil parameters rosetta was selected because it can estimate soil hydraulic properties using different pedotransfer functions depending on the types of available input data here the soil hydraulic properties are estimated using the percent sand s a silt s i and clay c l which will be varied in the sensitivity analysis to simulate the soil properties of different regions to reduce the number of required simulations the soil profile is always 100 cm deep vertical and homogeneous with an initial volumetric water content of 0 15 for simplicity soil hysteresis is also neglected which is consistent with the level of simplifications made elsewhere in the analysis e g homogeneous soil texture with depth sutanto et al 2012 the sink term in richard s equation is calculated as 5 s v ψ ω ψ s p where s p is the potential water uptake rate h 1 and ω ψ describes the uptake as a dimensionless function of the soil water pressure head 0 ω ψ 1 the term ω ψ is defined as an s shaped function following van genuchten 1987 to calculate s p a provided potential et e t p is partitioned into potential soil evaporation e s and potential plant transpiration e t using a provided leaf area index l a i ritchie 1972 in particular 6 e s e t p exp k e x t l a i where k e x t is an extinction coefficient which depends on the vegetation type the parameters k e x t and l a i will be varied in the sensitivity analysis to simulate the vegetation of different regions e t is then found from 7 e t e t p e s the potential root water uptake is derived from potential transpiration rate e t cm h 1 8 s p β z e t where β z is the normalized root water uptake distribution cm 1 which in part characterizes the root density šimůnek et al 2013 β z is defined so that its integral up to the maximum rooting depth r m cm is equal to one β z is expected to decay exponentially with depth r m will also be varied in the sensitivity analysis to simulate different types of vegetation in different regions boundary fluxes such as actual evaporation infiltration and runoff at the soil surface and drainage from the bottom of soil profile are all calculated using richards equation šimůnek et al 2013 for simplicity the bottom boundary is selected to be freely draining in all simulations which implies a deep water table the top boundary condition is determined by temporally varying precipitation and potential et forcing data actual evaporation is constrained to be less than e s for each region i e a set of soil vegetation and climate characteristics hydrus 1d is used to simulate march through november at an hourly time step this period is used to avoid possible freezing and thawing cycles during the winter 2 2 precipitation forcing the precipitation forcing for hydrus 1d is modeled as a series of random storm events using the rectangular pulse model eagleson 1978 and hawk and eagleson 1992 the storms are generated using three independent random variables i r t r and t b i r is the constant rainfall rate during a given storm t r is the duration of a given storm and t b is the time between consecutive storms the variables i r t r and t b are assumed to be exponentially distributed with probability density functions pdfs as follows 9 f i r 1 i r exp i r i r 10 f t r 1 t r exp t r t r 11 f t b 1 t b exp t b t b where f i r f t r and f t b are the probability densities for i r t r and t b respectively and i r t r and t b are the mean rainfall intensity cm h 1 mean rainfall duration h and mean inter storm period h respectively these three means will be varied in the sensitivity analysis to simulate different climatic conditions 2 3 potential et forcing for this study e t p is estimated as the asce hourly standardized reference et for short crops asce ewri 2005

relationship between saturation vapor pressure and temperature kpa ºc 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa ºc 1 c n is a constant that changes with reference crop type and calculation time step k mm s3 mg 1 h 1 and c d is a constant that changes with the time step s m 1 allen et al 1998 r n is obtained using an approach provided by asce ewri 2005 specifically 13 r n r n s r n l where r n s is net shortwave radiation mj m 2 h 1 and r n l is net outgoing longwave radiation mj m 2 h 1 furthermore 14 r n s 1 α r s where r s is the incident solar radiation and α is the surface albedo the albedo α is estimated using zeng et al 1999 15 α 0 38 0 3 1 exp k e x t l a i which produces an albedo of 0 38 when l a i is zero and 0 08 as l a i becomes very large the incident solar radiation r s can be estimated 16 r s f c d 0 35 1 35 r s o where f c d is the cloudiness and r s o is the clear sky solar radiation f c d is allowed to vary randomly in each time step and is generated from a beta distribution with shape parameters p 1 and p 2 following falls 1974 the selection of the shape parameters is discussed later the clear sky radiation r s o can be estimated 17 r s o 0 75 2 10 5 z r a where z is the elevation above sea level m and r a is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 h 1 which is a function of the day of the year the time of day latitude φ and longitude λ see duffie and beckman 2013 z φ and λ will be varied as part of the sensitivity analysis r n l in eq 13 is estimated 18 r n l σ f c d 0 34 0 14 e a t 4 where σ is the stefan boltzmann constant 2 042 10 10 mj k 4 m 2 h 1 and t is the air temperature k brunt 1952 both g and t are required to calculate e t p with eq 12 for simplicity g is estimated from r n using equations from allen et al 1998 and t ºc is modeled as the sum of two sine waves which describe the seasonal and diurnal variations of air temperature specifically 19 t a s t sin f s t n c s t a d t sin f d t n c d t t m where a s t ºc f s t day 1 and c s t are the amplitude frequency and phase angle respectively of the seasonal temperature variation a d t ºc f d t day 1 c s t are the amplitude frequency and phase angle respectively of the daily temperature variation n is the day of the year day and t m is the mean annual air temperature ºc the variables f s t f d t c s t and c d t are specified to provide realistic timing and wavelengths for the seasonal and daily temperature variations and the same values are used for all simulations for simplicity the parameters a s t a d t and t m will be varied in the sensitivity analysis to describe different climates the air temperature t is also used to estimate δ and e s using expressions from murray 1966 and jensen et al 1990 the actual vapor pressure e a is calculated by assuming that the dew point temperature is the daily minimum t and using the method from asce ewri 2005 the psychrometric constant γ is calculated using the equation given in allen et al 1998 where atmospheric pressure is calculated from elevation z burman et al 1987 the c n and c d values for daytime and nighttime hours are from asce ewri 2005 the wind speed u 2 in each time step is randomly generated according to the weibull distribution with a specified scale parameter u a that is similar to the mean wind speed and a constant shape parameter of 1 7 following garcia et al 1998 u a will be varied in the sensitivity analysis and is called the wind speed magnitude in the end calculation of e t p through time for a given region requires specification of a s t a d t and t m to simulate air temperature and φ λ z u a k e x t and l a i to calculate the associated 2 4 use of model outputs when hydrus 1d is used to simulate a given hypothetical region that simulation produces datasets for λ s e b θ λ s e b s λ p e t θ and λ p e t s where each pair of data is associated with a particular time during a simulation recall that λ s e b can be found from the components of the energy balance 20 λ s e b l e t a r n g where l is the latent heat of vaporization of water j kg 1 and e t a is the actual et kg m 2 s 1 the variables r n and g are model inputs which are used to calculate the e t p forcing while e t a is a model output similarly λ p e t can be calculated as 21 λ p e t e t a e t p both λ s e b and λ p e t are unstable during the nighttime crago 1996 peng et al 2013 so only daytime hours excluding the hours of sunrise and sunset are included in the paired datasets the average root zone soil moisture θ and degree of saturation s can also be found from the model outputs at the selected times steps θ is obtained from an arithmetic average of the individual θ values within the root zone all θ values in the root zone are given equal weight regardless of the root distribution to be consistent past evaluations of the remote sensing methods ahmad and bastiaanssen 2003 and scott et al 2003 the degree of saturation s is calculated as θ θ s these datasets are then used to estimate the parameters of the λ s e b θ λ s e b s λ p e t θ and λ p e t s relationships using the logarithmic functions proposed by bastiaanssen et al 2000 and scott et al 2003 one can write 22 λ s e b a b ln θ or θ exp λ s e b a b 23 λ s e b c d ln s or s θ θ s a t exp λ s e b c d 24 λ p e t e f ln θ or θ exp λ p e t e f 25 λ p e t g h ln s or s θ θ s a t exp λ p e t g h where a b c d e f g and h are empirical constants bastiaanssen et al 2000 and scott et al 2003 both estimated nearly identical values a 1 284 and b 0 421 scott et al 2003 also estimated c 1 and d 0 421 where c 1 was imposed from the assumption that λ s e b 1 when the soil is fully saturated s 1 fig 1 a c show the effects of a and b on the λ s e b θ relationship as a increases thee relationship shifts to the left and becomes steeper fig 1a as b increases the relationship moves to the right and becomes steeper fig 1b increasing both a and b simultaneously holds the position of the relationship approximately constant but makes the relationship steeper fig 1c the constants e and f have similar effects on the λ p e t θ relationship as shown in fig 1d f 2 5 efast efast is used to estimate the sensitivity of the relationship constants a through h and the relationship r 2 values to the climate soil and vegetation parameters that are provided to the model efast was selected in part because it performs a global sensitivity analysis gsa saltelli et al 2008 gsa describes the sensitivity over the entire feasible ranges of the parameters rather than at a specified base point in the parameter space gsa is better suited for current purposes because no well defined base point exists among the available gsa methods saltelli et al 2008 efast was selected because it is computationally efficient saltelli et al 1999 and has been used with other hydrological models reusser et al 2011 sanadhya et al 2014 jefferson et al 2015 efast uses two variance based measures of sensitivity saltelli et al 2000 one is the first order sensitivity index to parameter j denoted s j which can be written 26 s j var e y x j var y where var y is the total variance of model output y when all parameters are varied over their feasible ranges e y x j is the expected value of output y for a given value of the parameter x j and var e y x j is the variance of e y x j as x j varies over its feasible range the first order sensitivity evaluates the direct contribution that a parameter makes to the variability of the output the second sensitivity is the total order index which evaluates the total contribution of a parameter to the output variability when all parameter interactions within the model structure are included both indices were calculated in this study and found to exhibit very similar behaviors which suggests relatively small parameter interactions in the model only the first order index is shown for brevity efast was applied using the simlab sensitivity and uncertainty package giglioli and saltelli 2003 in conjunction with matlab simlab determines the minimum required number of simulations sample size for a given set of parameters for the 17 parameters in this analysis table 1 efast requires at least 1 105 model simulations 65 runs per parameter to ensure the accuracy of the results 5049 model simulations or 297 runs per parameter were performed for each scenario in addition the sensitivity indices were generated twice for selected scenarios to confirm that they remain stable between repeated analyses to perform the gsa all the parameters in table 1 were varied independently within feasible ranges according to specified continuous pdfs in reality several of these parameters could have interdependence because they are partially determined by the region s climate to partially account for such dependence efast was applied separately for four different climatic regions that occur in the conterminous united states usa48 and different parameter distributions were allowed for each climatic region the four climatic regions were defined using the aridity index ai which is the ratio of annual precipitation and potential et and the generalized climate classifications of unep 1997 arid ai below 0 20 semiarid ai from 0 20 to 0 50 sub humid ai from 0 50 to 0 65 and humid ai above 0 65 an ai map with a resolution of 30 arc seconds was obtained from trabucco and zomer 2009 while some parameters may still be dependent within a climatic region such dependence will be weaker and may be overwhelmed by other factors e g human activities neglecting weak dependence introduces errors in the sensitivity index values but is unlikely to affect the determination of the most important parameters the distributions of some parameters were assumed to be independent of the climatic region table 2 in efast all these parameters were assumed to vary according to a uniform distribution due to lack of information about their true variability s a s i and c l were varied such that their sum was always 100 s a and s i were varied from 0 to 100 but c l was varied from 0 to 90 to avoid numerical instabilities that occur for very high clay contents the range for β was obtained from jackson et al 1996 who performed a global analysis of root distributions for various terrestrial biomes the maximum r m value was set to 100 cm because 100 cm is the thickness of the modeled layer the range for k e x t was obtained from the hydrus 1d manual šimůnek et al 2013 in reality k e x t depends on the sun angle the distribution of plants and the arrangement of leaves šimůnek et al 2013 the range for u a was obtained from archer and jacobson 2003 the range for φ was determined from the approximate extent of the usa48 table 3 describes the parameters whose distributions change between the four climatic regions l a i was calculated for the usa48 for june 28 2014 using modis mod15a2 images and the procedure of wang and zlotnik 2012 beta distributions were found to approximate the l a i variability within each region best among 15 distributions considered so l a i is assumed to vary according to a beta distribution in efast the distribution s shape parameters p and q were found by fitting the beta distribution to the data within each region the temperature parameters a s t a d t and t m were determined from hourly u s climate normals from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration arguez et al 2012 each climatic region was divided into three subregions and a representative station was identified towards the middle of each subregion the sinusoidal temperature model was then fitted to the data from each station the ranges for a s t a d t and t m were determined from the range of calibrated parameters within each region uniform distributions were selected for these parameters for simplicity the number of stations is not sufficient for detailed characterization of the variability in each region the variables f s t f d t c s t c d t in the temperature model exhibited little difference between the stations so they were set to consistent values of 0 01713 day 1 6 284 day 1 1 844 and 2 388 respectively the ranges of the precipitation model parameters i r t r and t b were obtained from hawk and eagleson 1992 they estimated these parameters at more than 70 stations in the usa48 those stations were plotted on an ai map to obtain i r t r and t b values for each climatic region a log normal distribution was found to approximate the variability of each parameter in each region so this distribution is used in efast the distribution parameters the mean of the log of the variable μ and the standard deviation of the log of the variable σ were determined by fitting the log normal distribution to the data in each region each distribution was also truncated at an upper bound to prevent very rare outlier rainfall values from occurring the ranges for λ were determined from the approximate extents of the climatic regions within the usa48 similarly the distributions and ranges for z were obtained from the elevation values in each region based on the united states geological survey national elevation dataset 1 arc second resolution the cloudiness distribution parameters p 1 and p 2 were determined as follows first hourly clear sky solar radiation and incident solar radiation data were obtained from the national solar radiation database for 2000 2010 for twelve stations within the usa48 three per climatic region for each station the cloudiness was calculated by a rearrangement of eq 16 and beta distributions were fitted to the data the average parameters in each region are used in the model arid p 1 0 2434 p 2 0 0713 semiarid p 1 0 1847 p 2 0 0532 sub humid p 1 0 1890 p 2 0 0664 and humid p 1 0 2950 p 2 0 1052 3 results and discussion 3 1 average strength and form of relationships we first examine the strength of the λ s e b θ λ p e t θ λ s e b s and λ p e t s relationships under the assumption that a single λ s e b θ λ p e t θ λ s e b s or λ p e t s relationship applies to all locations in the usa48 specifically fig 2 shows the r 2 values for the four relationships when they are calculated using data from all times in all simulations from all regions overall low r 2 values are observed for all four relationships these low values occur because a single relationship cannot adapt to the local soil vegetation and climatic characteristics higher r 2 values are observed for the relationships that use s than the equivalent relationships that use θ by using s the relationships account the local saturation water content θ s and thus partially capture the local soil characteristics this modeling result is consistent with the hypothesis of scott et al 2003 and the empirical results from alburn et al 2015 who observed better performance using s than θ higher r 2 values are also observed for the relationships that use λ p e t instead of λ s e b λ s e b only considers the available energy in its denominator i e r n g but et depends on not only the available energy but also the turbulent transport i e wind speed and vapor pressure deficit λ p e t accounts for all these components by using e t p in its denominator thus λ p e t is more directly related to the actual et and the associated θ and s values we next examine the strength of the λ s e b θ λ p e t θ λ s e b s and λ p e t s relationships under the assumption that the relationships change for each combination of soil vegetation and climate characteristics specifically fig 3 shows the r 2 values for the four relationships when the relationships are calculated separately from the data in each simulation and the r 2 values are then averaged for each climatic region the r 2 values in fig 3 are roughly twice the values in fig 2 which suggests that the performance of the remote sensing methods might be improved greatly if the local characteristics are accommodated in the relationships this modeling result is consistent with the empirical results of alburn et al 2015 who observed that calibrated relationships substantially outperform the universal relationships in fig 3 the relationships that use λ p e t again outperform those that use λ s e b because λ p e t is more directly connected with the actual et however the relationships that use θ and s exhibit nearly identical performance in fig 3 because different relationships are fitted to the data from each simulation thus the constants that define the λ s e b θ and λ p e t θ relationships accommodate the local θ s values fig 3 also shows that the r 2 values are higher for semiarid and sub humid regions than for arid and humid regions the simulations for arid regions include significant periods where θ is less than θ r in which case the et has almost no relationship with θ similarly the simulations for humid regions have long periods where θ approaches θ s and et changes little as θ changes because the relationships for θ and s exhibit nearly identical performance fig 3 and θ is expected to be more useful for practical applications than s only the λ s e b θ and λ p e t θ relationships are considered for further analysis fig 4 shows the average forms of the λ s e b θ and λ p e t θ relationships for the four climatic regions these relationships were determined by first obtaining the empirical constants for each simulation a and b for the λ s e b θ relationship and e and f for the λ p e t θ relationship and then averaging those constants within each climate arid and semiarid regions have steeper λ s e b θ relationships than sub humid and humid regions storms in arid and semiarid climates tend to be shorter and have lower intensity so the soil moisture tends to be in the upper portion of the soil profile also lower vegetation cover causes surface evaporation to dominate the et as a result high λ s e b values can occur in these regions even though the average root zone soil moisture is small in addition arid and semiarid regions tend to have lower θ values than sub humid and humid regions a single logarithmic relationship does not always fit the data for the full range of θ values so differences in the distribution of θ values lead to differences in the fitted relationships fig 4b shows that the λ p e t θ relationship is more linear than the λ s e b θ relationship and tends to fall in a narrower range of θ the lower and upper limits of the linear section are implied by the s shaped function that characterizes root water uptake and can be thought of as an approximate average permanent wilting point pwp and average field capacity fc respectively hydrus 1d implies a nearly linear relationship between the soil moisture at a particular depth and λ p e t between the pwp and fc if transpiration dominates similar linear λ p e t θ relationships have also been seen in previous studies thornthwaite and mather 1955 baier 1968 the relationships change between climatic regions due to variations in the moisture with depth in particular due to the frequent rainfall events that occur throughout the year and associated wetting and drying fronts humid regions tend to have the most variable λ p e t and moisture changes with depth which leads to increased scatter in the λ p e t values for a given θ because λ p e t always falls between 0 and 1 such scatter inevitably leads to a relationship with a lower slope as seen in fig 4b 3 2 sensitivity results the efast results for the λ p e t θ relationship are shown in fig 5 6 and 7 only this relationship is shown because λ p e t was found to provide more reliable estimates of θ than λ s e b in the previous section efast results were obtained for the other three cases and typically have similar behaviors to the case that is shown fig 5 shows the first order sensitivity s of the λ p e t θ relationship s r 2 to each climatic soil and vegetation parameter in this figure the parameters are ranked from the most important to least important based on their s values to facilitate inter comparisons the s values are normalized so that their sum is 100 ruark et al 2011 overall vegetation characteristics primarily control the strength of the λ p e t θ relationship l a i is the most important parameter for all four regions and r m is the second most important for three out of four regions the average dependence of r 2 on l a i and r m is shown in fig 5e and f respectively when l a i is very low r 2 is also low because soil evaporation dominates the et see eq 6 soil evaporation is insensitive to deep soil moisture because it draws water from near the ground surface thus λ p e t becomes less connected to θ when l a i is small when l a i is above about 2 its value has little impact on r 2 because transpiration more consistently dominants the et for arid regions the dependence on l a i extends over a wider range of l a i because the limited precipitated water sometimes does not reach deep into the soil which emphasizes the importance of evaporation and weakens the λ p e t θ relationship r 2 exhibits a similar dependence on l a i and other parameters for the sub humid and humid regions because the distributions from which l a i and other parameters are generated are similar for those two regions table 3 fig 5f shows that smaller r m values improve the strength of the λ p e t θ relationship particularly for arid regions as noted earlier precipitated water sometimes does not reach deep into the soil profile for arid regions if r m is large the importance of transpiration relative to evaporation changes through time depending on whether the precipitated water has reached deep into the soil evaporation and transpiration have different relationships with soil moisture so this changing importance tends to weaken the overall λ p e t θ relationship in humid regions precipitation is sufficient to keep the soil profile wet so transpiration tends to be more consistently important irrespective of r m fig 5h plots the average dependence of r 2 on the precipitation that occurred in each simulation to facilitate interpretation the annual precipitation p p t is estimated by multiplying the precipitation received in each 9 month simulation by 12 9 p p t was not included in efast because it is not a parameter in the model simulations instead it is a byproduct of the parameters of the stochastic precipitation model i r t r and t b for all climates very large values of p p t weaken the λ p e t θ relationship when p p t is very large θ is above the fc for substantial portions of each simulation thus λ p e t approaches one irrespective of the θ value and the relationship between these two variables weakens low p p t values also tend to weaken the λ p e t θ relationship for arid regions arid regions tend to have shorter and less intense storms than other regions thus when precipitation is low for arid regions the precipitated water is more likely to stay near the ground surface in such a case soil evaporation tends to play a larger role soil evaporation does not depend on deeper soil moisture which also weakens the λ p e t θ relationship fig 6 shows the sensitivity of the λ p e t θ relationship constant f to the model parameters overall soil characteristics are most important for determining the value of f c l is the single most important parameter for all four climatic regions and s i is the second most important for three of the four regions r m plays a secondary role for semiarid and sub humid regions fig 6e h show the average dependence of f on c l s i r m and p p t for each climate increasing c l causes a nearly linear increase in f fig 6e while increasing s i causes a nearly linear decrease in f fig 6f when r m is small the constant f also increases with r m fig 6g in addition f increases with p p t until it reaches a peak around 50 cm at which point f decreases with p p t fig 7 shows the sensitivity of the relationship constant e to the model parameters the highest sensivity values in fig 7 are smaller than the highest sensitivity values in fig 6 which suggests that more parameters have a meaningful influence on e than f similar to f e depends primarily on soil characteristics c l is the most important characteristic in all four climates while s i is the second most important in three out of the four climates vegetation characteristics l a i and r m again have a secondary role for semiarid and sub humid climates the nature of e s dependence on c l s i r m and p p t is shown in fig 7e h overall e shows a similar dependence on these parameters as f the tendency of e and f to increase simultaneously suggests that the most important model parameters i e regional characteristics affect the λ p e t θ relationship as shown in fig 1f specifically when e and f both increase the λ p e t θ relationship becomes steeper an increase in c l or a decrease in s i reduces the range between the pwp and fc i e the available water for root water uptake this increases e and f and produces a steeper λ p e t θ relationship low values of r m below about 30 cm tend to restrict transpiration s access to soil moisture thus λ p e t tends to be lower for a given θ which also reduces e and f see example curves in fig 1f as discussed earlier very large p p t values tend to produce many soil moisture values in each simulation that exceed the fc where λ p e t does not depend strongly on the particular value of θ similarly very low p p t values tend to produce soil moisture values that are below the pwp where λ p e t also does not depend strongly on the particular value of θ thus both extremes introduce more scatter into the relationship which reduces the estimates of e and f 3 3 proposed equations regression equations were developed to estimate the constants of the λ s e b θ and λ p e t θ relationships from the most important regional characteristics to develop these equations four cases were considered case 1 assumes no regional information is available so the relationship constants are simply numbers these numbers can be compared to those suggested by bastiaanssen et al 2000 but they are derived from all the combinations of soil vegetation and climate characteristics supplied to hydrus 1d case 2 assumes that only the climate classification is available thus the relationship constants differ for arid semiarid sub humid and humid regions case 3 assumes that the climate classification and total annual precipitation are known thus the relationship constants are estimated as a function of p p t where the function differs for each climate finally case 4 assumes that the climate classification p p t c l s i and l a i are all available although r m was observed to be important in the previous section it is unlikely to be known for a particular region with any certainty thus it is not used in the equations linear regression equations are used to estimate the relationship constants as noted earlier 50 cm appears to separate two distinct dependencies on p p t so separate relationships are used for these two ranges of p p t for the λ s e b θ relationship the following equations are proposed to estimate a and b for case 3 27 a c 1 c 2 p p t 28 b d 1 d 2 p p t where p p t is the annual precipitation cm and c 1 c 2 cm 1 d 1 and d 2 cm 1 are the regression constants for case 4 the following equations are proposed to estimate a and b 29 a c 1 c 2 p p t c 3 c l c 4 s i c 5 l a i 30 b d 1 d 2 p p t d 3 c l d 4 s i d 5 l a i where c l is a percentage s i is a percentage and c 3 c 4 c 5 d 3 d 4 and d 5 are regression constants for the λ p e t θ relationship the following equations are proposed to estimate e and f for case 3 31 e e 1 e 2 p p t 32 f f 1 f 2 p p t where e 1 e 2 cm 1 f 1 and f 2 cm 1 are regression constants for case 4 the following equations are proposed to estimate e and f 33 e e 1 e 2 p p t e 3 c l e 4 s i 34 f f 1 f 2 p p t f 3 c l f 4 s i where e 3 e 4 f 3 and f 4 are regression constants table 4 shows the regression constants for the λ s e b θ relationship and table 5 shows the constants for the λ p e t θ relationship in all cases the regression constants were calibrated to maximize the nsce between the a and b values or e and f values obtained from the hydrus 1d simulations and the regression equations the constants for the λ s e b θ relationship in case 1 table 4 are similar to the values proposed by bastiaanssen et al 2000 and scott et al 2003 based on their local datasets they suggested a 1 284 and b 0 421 whereas table 4 reports a 1 484 and b 0 522 respectively the nsce values for case 1 and case 2 in tables 4 and 5 are all zero because these cases explain no variation in the relationship constants within a given climatic region the nsce increases when the precipitation effects are considered case 3 for the λ s e b θ relationship the average ncse is 0 17 for a and 0 12 for b for the λ p e t θ relationship the average nsce is 0 24 for e and 0 15 for f the nsce values further improve when the effects of p p t c l s i and l a i are included case 4 for the λ s e b θ relationship the average ncse is 0 40 for a and 0 53 for b for the λ p e t θ relationship the average nsce is 0 44 for e and 0 55 for f to evaluate the overall performance fig 8 shows the nsce values for θ when the λ s e b θ and λ p e t θ relationships are estimated using bastiaanssen et al 2000 and cases 1 4 using λ p e t typically provides better nsce values than λ s e b this improvement also occurs when using the empirical relationship even though bastiaanssen et al 2000 did not suggest using the empirical relationship with λ p e t however the θ estimates from the bastiaanssen et al 2000 relationship typically have negative nsce values the θ estimates from all four cases have higher nsce s than the estimates from the bastiaanssen et al 2000 relationship furthermore as one uses more information to estimate the relationship i e one moves from case 1 to case 4 the estimates of θ typically improve like the empirical relationship case 1 uses no regional characteristics but it was derived by considering a much wider range of climate soil and vegetation conditions than the empirical relationship case 2 uses distinct λ s e b θ and λ p e t θ relationships for each climatic region so it adapts to the typical conditions for each climate better performance is observed for the semiarid and subhumid regions than the arid and humid regions case 3 includes the annual precipitation p p t when determining the λ s e b θ and λ p e t θ relationships but it shows only slight improvements compared to case 2 case 4 provides the best θ estimates for all regions by including variations in precipitation p p t soil texture s i and c l and vegetation l a i although these evaluations are made using modeled soil moisture the substantial improvement in nsce between using the bastiaanssen et al 2000 relationship and case 4 indicates that further testing of the proposed methods are warranted 4 conclusions the purposes of this study were to 1 quantify the impacts of soil vegetation and climatic characteristics on the strength and form of the λ s e b θ λ s e b s λ p e t θ and λ p e t s relationships and 2 propose a set of specific relationships that account for the most important regional characteristics based on this modeling study the following conclusions can be reached 1 the relationships that use λ p e t are better predictors of θ and s than the relationships that use λ s e b λ p e t is preferred not only when a single relationship shape is assumed to apply for all locations but also when the constants that determine the relationship shape are calibrated for each location λ p e t includes the effects of both available energy and turbulent transport wind speed and vapor pressure deficit while λ s e b includes only the effects of available energy therefore λ p e t is more directly related to et and thus θ and s this result suggests that the optical thermal remote sensing methods might be improved by using λ p e t instead of λ s e b if λ p e t can be reliably estimated from remote sensing and or weather station data 2 when a single relationship is assumed to apply to all locations the relationships are more reliable for estimating s than θ by estimating s local variations in the saturation water content are implicitly accommodated however when the relationship is calibrated separately for each location both θ and s can be estimated with similar accuracy in this case the calibration accounts for the local saturation water content 3 the λ s e b θ λ s e b s λ p e t θ and λ p e t s relationships are stronger for semiarid and sub humid regions than for arid and humid regions for arid and humid regions θ and s are more commonly below the pwp or above the fc where λ s e b and λ p e t depend less on the specific values of θ and s 4 the strength of the λ p e t θ relationship primarily depends on vegetation characteristics such as the leaf area index l a i and maximum rooting depth r m l a i is important because it impacts the relative importance of soil evaporation and plant transpiration r m is important because it controls the soil depths where transpiration obtains water 5 the shape of the λ p e t θ relationship primarily depends on soil characteristics such as the percent clay c l and percent silt s i c l and s i determine the range of soil moisture between the pwp and fc and thus affect the steepness of the λ p e t θ relationship 6 the annual precipitation p p t affects both the strength and the shape of the λ p e t θ relationship λ p e t already accounts for one of the two main forcing variables for soil moisture dynamics in its denominator potential et but it does not account for the other main forcing variable precipitation p p t helps determine how frequently the soil moisture reaches extreme values where the λ p e t θ relationship weakens 7 four methods were proposed to estimate the forms of the λ s e b θ and λ p e t θ relationships case 1 uses no regional information case 2 uses only the climate classification case 3 uses the climate classification and p p t and case 4 uses the climate classification p p t c l s i and l a i the nsce values from these cases suggest that the accuracy of the estimated λ s e b θ and λ p e t θ relationships substantially improve as more regional characteristics are considered the relationships proposed in this study are based on richards equation for variably saturated flow and soil characteristic curves from van genuchten 1980 as implemented in the one dimentional physically based model hydrus 1d the proposed relationships were not tested by application in a remote sensing method or comparisons to in situ observations of θ or s such testing is a critical avenue of future research when used in a practical context it is possible that errors in the estimation of λ s e b and λ p e t or regional characteristics such as p p t c l s i and l a i affects the relative performance of the various methods such testing could also consider how heterogeneity of soil vegetation and climatic conditions within a region affects the performance of the methods for example if soil characteristics vary within a region can separate relationships be used for different locations with adequate reliability future research could also repeat this analysis using other vadose zone model structures although hydrus 1d is physically based the results likely depend on assumptions embedded in the model structure future modeling studies could include thinner soils shallow water tables compensation in the root water uptake from different soil depths more detailed descriptions of the surface energy balance

10595,accurate knowledge of root zone soil moisture is of vital significance to many applications in agriculture such as crop yield estimation precision irrigation salinity and groundwater management remote sensing methods based on optical and thermal satellite imagery have been proposed to estimate fine resolution 30 m grid cells maps of root zone soil moisture θ or degree of saturation s over large regions these methods usually calculate the evaporative fraction λ s e b as the ratio of the latent heat flux to the difference of the net radiation and ground heat flux then they estimate θ or s from an empirical relationship with λ s e b a similar approach estimates θ or s using the evaporative index λ p e t which is the ratio of the actual to potential evapotranspiration however previous research has shown that a single relationship between either θ or s and λ s e b does not apply to all regions the objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of regional soil vegetation and climatic conditions on the form and strength of the λ s e b θ λ p e t θ λ s e b s and λ p e t s relationships to accomplish this goal extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test efast is applied to a physically based model hydrus 1 d that simulates both evapotranspiration and soil moisture dynamics the sensitivity results show that within a given climatic region soil characteristics such as the percent clay and percent silt are most important in determining the shape of the relationships while vegetation characteristics such as leaf area index and maximum rooting depth have the greatest effect on the strength of these relationships the total annual precipitation which helps determine the climatic region also has a strong effect on both the form and strength of the relationships the parameters that define the λ s e b θ and λ p e t θ relationships are also estimated using the regional characteristics estimating the parameters in this way allows the methods to be adapted to local conditions and has the potential to improve the θ and s estimates keywords soil moisture root zone evaporative fraction evaporative index hydrus 1 d efast 1 introduction soil moisture is an important factor in the transfer of water and energy at the land atmosphere boundary and governs the partitioning of incoming energy into latent and sensible heat fluxes through soil evaporation and plant transpiration entekhabi et al 1996 and sun et al 2011 soil moisture also has a strong influence on the dynamics of the atmospheric boundary layer and has a direct influence on weather and climate patel et al 2009 thus accurate estimation of soil moisture is useful for planning and management of water resources as well as sustainable agricultural production particularly in semiarid and arid ecosystems where water is a limited resource in recent decades spaceborne remote sensing methods have been developed to monitor soil moisture nearly globally at regular time intervals these methods include passive and active microwave instruments such as the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the earth observing system amsr e soil moisture and ocean salinity smos and soil moisture active and passive smap missions njoku et al 2003 kerr et al 2012 and entekhabi et al 2010 these satellites estimate soil moisture at very coarse spatial resolutions 9 40 km grid cells and are only sensitive to moisture in the upper 5 10 cm of the soil layer entekhabi et al 2004 and kerr et al 2012 soil moisture can also be estimated indirectly using optical liu et al 2002 2003 and lobell and asner 2002 and thermal infrared tir remote sensing verstraeten et al 2006 and lu et al 2009 these methods provide much finer spatial resolutions 30 m to 1 km and estimate the average soil moisture throughout the root zone however they often have poor temporal resolutions and like the active passive microwave methods have lower performance as the vegetation cover increases muller and decamps 2001 soil moisture can also be estimated from the combination of optical and tir data using the triangle or trapezoidal method gillies et al 1997 and stisen et al 2008 the perpendicular drought index pdi method ghulam et al 2007 or energy balance methods bastiaanssen et al 2000 and scott et al 2003 the methods proposed by bastiaanssen et al 2000 and scott et al 2003 use multispectral imagery to calculate all the components of the surface energy balance seb several models are available for this purpose including the two source model tsm norman et al 1995 surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 two source energy balance tseb french et al 2002 mapping evapotranspiration et at high resolution with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 and remote sensing of et reset elhaddad and garcia 2008 once the energy balance is calculated the bastiaanssen et al 2000 and scott et al 2003 methods estimate the evaporative fraction λ s e b which is the ratio of the latent heat flux to the available energy net radiation minus ground heat flux shuttleworth et al 1989 the bastiaanssen et al 2000 method then uses an empirical logarithmic function to convert λ s e b to average root zone volumetric water content θ while the scott et al 2003 method uses a similar function to obtain an average root zone degree of saturation s the reliability of these approaches has been evaluated in several studies smith et al 1992 plotted λ s e b values from surface stations against the soil moisture by mass in the top 2 5 cm of the soil for grazed and ungrazed grasslands on alluvial soils and loess in kansas most of these gravimetric soil moisture measurements were above 25 by mass and little correlation was observed between λ s e b and soil moisture however when bastiaanssen et al 2000 fitted their logarithmic function using remotely sensed λ s e b values and field measurements of θ at 23 locations they obtained a coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 855 ahmad and bastiaanssen 2003 compared sebal derived estimates of s to observations from theta probes top 100 cm of the soil for wheat cotton and rice fields in pakistan they found a root mean square error rmse of 0 05 m3 m 3 but they only had 26 observations in this comparison scott et al 2003 also compared sebal derived estimates of s to observations from irrigated fields of rice cotton wheat alfalfa and sorghum in pakistan and mexico depths ranging from 45 cm to 100 cm they also found an rmse of 0 05 m3 m 3 but this dataset included only 52 observations extensive evaluations of the λ s e b θ and λ s e b s relationships were performed by alburn et al 2015 reset was used to estimate λ s e b from landsat 5 and landsat 7 images across a semiarid region in southeastern colorado for the summer months of three years the bastiaanssen et al 2000 and scott et al 2003 relationships were then applied to estimate θ and s these estimates were compared to 280 θ and s observations from time domain reflectometry tdr but the estimates failed to explain any of the space time variations in the tdr measurements the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce nash and sutcliffe 1970 of the θ and s estimates was 1 12 and 1 02 respectively 1 00 would indicate a perfect estimate while a negative nsce value indicates that the mean of the observed soil moisture is a more accurate estimate than the estimated soil moisture the remote sensing estimates were much more successful when the relationships were calibrated using the tdr observations nsce was 0 32 for θ and 0 36 for s but calibration is only possible when in situ soil moisture observations are available for the region of interest overall these results suggest that the empirical relationships proposed by bastiaanssen et al 2000 and scott et al 2003 are not applicable for all regions and region specific relationships are required to achieve adequate performance in some cases although previous studies have used λ s e b to estimate θ or s numerous other studies have suggested similar relationships between θ or s and the evaporative index λ p e t which is the ratio of actual to potential et λ p e t θ and λ p e t s relationships have been used to evaluate water budgets thornthwaite and mather 1955 estimate the availability of soil moisture to plants under different meteorological conditions denmead and shaw 1962 and baier 1969 assess agricultural potential for different land classifications yao 1974 improve estimates of actual et from soil moisture crago and brutsaert 1994 and crago 1996 estimate root zone soil moisture in the middle rio grande basin in new mexico fleming et al 2005 downscale soil moisture ranney et al 2015 and insert real time et fluxes into hydrologic models hendrickx et al 2016 the shapes of the λ s e b θ λ s e b s λ p e t θ and λ p e t s relationships are expected to depend on regional soil vegetation and climatic characteristics davies and allen 1973 rouse et al 1977 and brutsaert 2013 for example wilson et al 1997 analyzed the λ p e t s relationship for thin soil specimens in the laboratory and observed different relationship forms depending on the specimen s texture sand silt and clay gentine et al 2007 used a calibrated model to show that the shape of the λ s e b θ relationship depends on the vegetation cover with thicker vegetation covers producing higher λ s e b values for a given value θ denmead and shaw 1962 used field experiments to examine the λ p e t θ relationship for corn when the et is dominated by transpiration they found that low atmospheric demands associated with low potential et values can be supplied at low θ values which produces high λ p e t values however high atmospheric demands cannot be fully supplied which produces lower λ p e t values for the same θ these results suggest that the shape of the λ p e t θ relationship also depends on the magnitude of the potential et the main objectives of the present study are to 1 quantify the impacts of soil vegetation and climatic characteristics on the strength and form of the λ s e b θ λ s e b s λ p e t θ and λ p e t s relationships and 2 propose a set of empirical relationships that account for the relevant regional characteristics to achieve these goals a global sensitivity analysis is performed using extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test efast saltelli et al 1999 combinations of soil vegetation and climate characteristics are generated with efast and supplied to the physically based vadose zone model hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2013 for each set of characteristics hydrus 1d is used to simulate the soil moisture dynamics over a period of nine months which produces paired datasets for λ s e b θ λ s e b s λ p e t θ and λ p e t s the λ s e b θ λ s e b s λ p e t θ and λ p e t s relationships are then fitted to the datasets and efast is used to identify the soil vegetation and climate characteristics that have the greatest control on the relationship constants and r 2 values finally empirical equations are determined that estimate the relationship constants based on the most important regional characteristics 2 methodology 2 1 hydrus 1 d model the one dimensional variably

properties are estimated using the percent sand s a silt s i and clay c l which will be varied in the sensitivity analysis to simulate the soil properties of different regions to reduce the number of required simulations the soil profile is always 100 cm deep vertical and homogeneous with an initial volumetric water content of 0 15 for simplicity soil hysteresis is also neglected which is consistent with the level of simplifications made elsewhere in the analysis e g homogeneous soil texture with depth sutanto et al 2012 the sink term in richard s equation is calculated as 5 s v ψ ω ψ

boundary fluxes such as actual evaporation infiltration and runoff at the soil surface and drainage from the bottom of soil profile are all calculated using richards equation šimůnek et al 2013 for simplicity the bottom boundary is selected to be freely draining in all simulations which implies a deep water table the top boundary condition is determined by temporally varying precipitation and

shortwave radiation mj m 2 h 1 and r n l is net outgoing longwave radiation mj m 2 h 1 furthermore 14 r n s 1 α r s where r s is the incident solar radiation and α is the surface albedo the albedo α

temperature variation n is the day of the year day and t m is the mean annual air temperature ºc the variables f s t f d t c s t and c d t are specified to provide realistic timing and wavelengths for the seasonal and daily temperature variations and the same values are used for all simulations for simplicity the parameters a s t a d t and t m will be varied in the sensitivity analysis to describe different climates the air temperature t is also used to estimate δ and e s using expressions from murray 1966 and jensen et al 1990 the actual vapor pressure e a is calculated by assuming that the dew point temperature is the daily minimum t and using the method from asce ewri 2005 the psychrometric constant γ is calculated using the equation given in allen et al 1998 where atmospheric pressure is calculated from elevation z burman et al 1987 the c n and c d values for daytime and nighttime hours are from asce ewri 2005 the wind speed u 2 in each time step is randomly generated according to the weibull distribution with a specified scale parameter u a that is similar to the mean wind speed and a constant shape parameter of 1 7 following garcia et al 1998 u a will be varied in the sensitivity analysis and is called the wind speed magnitude in the end calculation of e t p through time for a given region requires specification of a s t a d t and t m to simulate air temperature and φ λ z u a k e x t and l a i to calculate the associated 2 4 use of model outputs when hydrus 1d is used to simulate a given hypothetical region that simulation produces datasets for λ s e b θ λ s e b s λ p e t θ and λ p e t s where each pair of data is associated with a particular time during a simulation recall that λ s e b can be found from the components of the energy balance 20 λ s e b l e t a r n g where l is the latent heat of vaporization of water j kg 1 and e t a is the actual et kg m 2 s 1 the variables r n and g are model inputs which are used to calculate the e t p forcing while e t a is a model output similarly λ p e t can be calculated as 21 λ p e t e t a e t p both λ s e b and λ p e t are unstable during the nighttime crago 1996 peng et al 2013 so only daytime hours excluding the hours of sunrise and sunset are included in the paired datasets the average root zone soil moisture θ and degree of saturation s can also be found from the model outputs at the selected times steps θ is obtained from an arithmetic average of the individual θ values within the root zone all θ values in the root zone are given equal weight regardless of the root distribution to be consistent past evaluations of the remote sensing methods ahmad and bastiaanssen 2003 and scott et al 2003 the degree of saturation s is calculated as θ θ s these datasets are then used to estimate the parameters of the λ s e b θ λ s e b s λ p e t θ and λ p e t s relationships using the logarithmic functions proposed by bastiaanssen et al 2000 and scott et al 2003 one can write 22 λ s e b a b ln θ or θ exp λ s e b a b 23 λ s e b c d ln s or s θ θ s a t exp λ s e b c d 24 λ p e t e f ln θ or θ exp λ p e t e f 25 λ p e t g h ln s or s θ θ s a t exp λ p e t g h where a b c d e f g and h are empirical constants bastiaanssen et al 2000 and scott et al 2003 both estimated nearly identical values a 1 284 and b 0 421 scott et al 2003 also estimated c 1 and d 0 421 where c 1 was imposed from the assumption that λ s e b 1 when the soil is fully saturated s 1 fig 1 a c show the effects of a and b on the λ s e b θ relationship as a increases thee relationship shifts to the left and becomes steeper fig 1a as b increases the relationship moves to the right and becomes steeper fig 1b increasing both a and b simultaneously holds the position of the relationship approximately constant but makes the relationship steeper fig 1c the constants e and f have similar effects on the λ p e t θ relationship as shown in fig 1d f 2 5 efast efast is used to estimate the sensitivity of the relationship constants a through h and the relationship r 2 values to the climate soil and vegetation parameters that are provided to the model efast was selected in part because it performs a global sensitivity analysis gsa saltelli et al 2008 gsa describes the sensitivity over the entire feasible ranges of the parameters rather than at a specified base point in the parameter space gsa is better suited for current purposes because no well defined base point exists among the available gsa methods saltelli et al 2008 efast was selected because it is computationally efficient saltelli et al 1999 and has been used with other hydrological models reusser et al 2011 sanadhya et al 2014 jefferson et al 2015 efast uses two variance based measures of sensitivity saltelli et al 2000 one is the first order sensitivity index to parameter j denoted s j which can be written 26 s j var e y x j var y where var y is the total variance of model output y when all parameters are varied over their feasible ranges e y x j is the expected value of output y for a given value of the parameter x j and var e y x j is the variance of e y x j as x j varies over its feasible range the first order sensitivity evaluates the direct contribution that a parameter makes to the variability of the output the second sensitivity is the total order index which evaluates the total contribution of a parameter to the output variability when all parameter interactions within the model structure are included both indices were calculated in this study and found to exhibit very similar behaviors which suggests relatively small parameter interactions in the model only the first order index is shown for brevity efast was applied using the simlab sensitivity and uncertainty package giglioli and saltelli 2003 in conjunction with matlab simlab determines the minimum required number of simulations sample size for a given set of parameters for the 17 parameters in this analysis table 1 efast requires at least 1 105 model simulations 65 runs per parameter to ensure the accuracy of the results 5049 model simulations or 297 runs per parameter were performed for each scenario in addition the sensitivity indices were generated twice for selected scenarios to confirm that they remain stable between repeated analyses to perform the gsa all the parameters in table 1 were varied independently within feasible ranges according to specified continuous pdfs in reality several of these parameters could have interdependence because they are partially determined by the region s climate to partially account for such dependence efast was applied separately for four different climatic regions that occur in the conterminous united states usa48 and different parameter distributions were allowed for each climatic region the four climatic regions were defined using the aridity index ai which is the ratio of annual precipitation and potential et and the generalized climate classifications of unep 1997 arid ai below 0 20 semiarid ai from 0 20 to 0 50 sub humid ai from 0 50 to 0 65 and humid ai above 0 65 an ai map with a resolution of 30 arc seconds was obtained from trabucco and zomer 2009 while some parameters may still be dependent within a climatic region such dependence will be weaker and may be overwhelmed by other factors e g human activities neglecting weak dependence introduces errors in the sensitivity index values but is unlikely to affect the determination of the most important parameters the distributions of some parameters were assumed to be independent of the climatic region table 2 in efast all these parameters were assumed to vary according to a uniform distribution due to lack of information about their true variability s a s i and c l were varied such that their sum was always 100 s a and s i were varied from 0 to 100 but c l was varied from 0 to 90 to avoid numerical instabilities that occur for very high clay contents the range for β was obtained from jackson et al 1996 who performed a global analysis of root distributions for various terrestrial biomes the maximum r m value was set to 100 cm because 100 cm is the thickness of the modeled layer the range for k e x t was obtained from the hydrus 1d manual šimůnek et al 2013 in reality k e x t depends on the sun angle the distribution of plants and the arrangement of leaves šimůnek et al 2013 the range for u a was obtained from archer and jacobson 2003 the range for φ was determined from the approximate extent of the usa48 table 3 describes the parameters whose distributions change between the four climatic regions l a i was calculated for the usa48 for june 28 2014 using modis mod15a2 images and the procedure of wang and zlotnik 2012 beta distributions were found to approximate the l a i variability within each region best among 15 distributions considered so l a i is assumed to vary according to a beta distribution in efast the distribution s shape parameters p and q were found by fitting the beta distribution to the data within each region the temperature parameters a s t a d t and t m were determined from hourly u s climate normals from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration arguez et al 2012 each climatic region was divided into three subregions and a representative station was identified towards the middle of each subregion the sinusoidal temperature model was then fitted to the data from each station the ranges for a s t a d t and t m were determined from the range of calibrated parameters within each region uniform distributions were selected for these parameters for simplicity the number of stations is not sufficient for detailed characterization of the variability in each region the variables f s t f d t c s t c d t in the temperature model exhibited little difference between the stations so they were set to consistent values of 0 01713 day 1 6 284 day 1 1 844 and 2 388 respectively the ranges of the precipitation model parameters i r t r and t b were obtained from hawk and eagleson 1992 they estimated these parameters at more than 70 stations in the usa48 those stations were plotted on an ai map to obtain i r t r and t b values for each climatic region a log normal distribution was found to approximate the variability of each parameter in each region so this distribution is used in efast the distribution parameters the mean of the log of the variable μ and the standard deviation of the log of the variable σ were determined by fitting the log normal distribution to the data in each region each distribution was also truncated at an upper bound to prevent very rare outlier rainfall values from occurring the ranges for λ were determined from the approximate extents of the climatic regions within the usa48 similarly the distributions and ranges for z were obtained from the elevation values in each region based on the united states geological survey national elevation dataset 1 arc second resolution the cloudiness distribution parameters p 1 and p 2 were determined as follows first hourly clear sky solar radiation and incident solar radiation data were obtained from the national solar radiation database for 2000 2010 for twelve stations within the usa48 three per climatic region for each station the cloudiness was calculated by a rearrangement of eq 16 and beta distributions were fitted to the data the average parameters in each region are used in the model arid p 1 0 2434 p 2 0 0713 semiarid p 1 0 1847 p 2 0 0532 sub humid p 1 0 1890 p 2 0 0664 and humid p 1 0 2950 p 2 0 1052 3 results and discussion 3 1 average strength and form of relationships we first examine the strength of the λ s e b θ λ p e t θ λ s e b s and λ p e t s relationships under the assumption that a single λ s e b θ λ p e t θ λ s e b s or λ p e t s relationship applies to all locations in the usa48 specifically fig 2 shows the r 2 values for the four relationships when they are calculated using data from all times in all simulations from all regions overall low r 2 values are observed for all four relationships these low values occur because a single relationship cannot adapt to the local soil vegetation and climatic characteristics higher r 2 values are observed for the relationships that use s than the equivalent relationships that use θ by using s the relationships account the local saturation water content θ s and thus partially capture the local soil characteristics this modeling result is consistent with the hypothesis of scott et al 2003 and the empirical results from alburn et al 2015 who observed better performance using s than θ higher r 2 values are also observed for the relationships that use λ p e t instead of λ s e b λ s e b only considers the available energy in its denominator i e r n g but et depends on not only the available energy but also the turbulent transport i e wind speed and vapor pressure deficit λ p e t accounts for all these components by using e t p in its denominator thus λ p e t is more directly related to the actual et and the associated θ and s values we next examine the strength of the λ s e b θ λ p e t θ λ s e b s and λ p e t s relationships under the assumption that the relationships change for each combination of soil vegetation and climate characteristics specifically fig 3 shows the r 2 values for the four relationships when the relationships are calculated separately from the data in each simulation and the r 2 values are then averaged for each climatic region the r 2 values in fig 3 are roughly twice the values in fig 2 which suggests that the performance of the remote sensing methods might be improved greatly if the local characteristics are accommodated in the relationships this modeling result is consistent with the empirical results of alburn et al 2015 who observed that calibrated relationships substantially outperform the universal relationships in fig 3 the relationships that use λ p e t again outperform those that use λ s e b because λ p e t is more directly connected with the actual et however the relationships that use θ and s exhibit nearly identical performance in fig 3 because different relationships are fitted to the data from each simulation thus the constants that define the λ s e b θ and λ p e t θ relationships accommodate the local θ s values fig 3 also shows that the r 2 values are higher for semiarid and sub humid regions than for arid and humid regions the simulations for arid regions include significant periods where θ is less than θ r in which case the et has almost no relationship with θ similarly the simulations for humid regions have long periods where θ approaches θ s and et changes little as θ changes because the relationships for θ and s exhibit nearly identical performance fig 3 and θ is expected to be more useful for practical applications than s only the λ s e b θ and λ p e t θ relationships are considered for further analysis fig 4 shows the average forms of the λ s e b θ and λ p e t θ relationships for the four climatic regions these relationships were determined by first obtaining the empirical constants for each simulation a and b for the λ s e b θ relationship and e and f for the λ p e t θ relationship and then averaging those constants within each climate arid and semiarid regions have steeper λ s e b θ relationships than sub humid and humid regions storms in arid and semiarid climates tend to be shorter and have lower intensity so the soil moisture tends to be in the upper portion of the soil profile also lower vegetation cover causes surface evaporation to dominate the et as a result high λ s e b values can occur in these regions even though the average root zone soil moisture is small in addition arid and semiarid regions tend to have lower θ values than sub humid and humid regions a single logarithmic relationship does not always fit the data for the full range of θ values so differences in the distribution of θ values lead to differences in the fitted relationships fig 4b shows that the λ p e t θ relationship is more linear than the λ s e b θ relationship and tends to fall in a narrower range of θ the lower and upper limits of the linear section are implied by the s shaped function that characterizes root water uptake and can be thought of as an approximate average permanent wilting point pwp and average field capacity fc respectively hydrus 1d implies a nearly linear relationship between the soil moisture at a particular depth and λ p e t between the pwp and fc if transpiration dominates similar linear λ p e t θ relationships have also been seen in previous studies thornthwaite and mather 1955 baier 1968 the relationships change between climatic regions due to variations in the moisture with depth in particular due to the frequent rainfall events that occur throughout the year and associated wetting and drying fronts humid regions tend to have the most variable λ p e t and moisture changes with depth which leads to increased scatter in the λ p e t values for a given θ because λ p e t always falls between 0 and 1 such scatter inevitably leads to a relationship with a lower slope as seen in fig 4b 3 2 sensitivity results the efast results for the λ p e t θ relationship are shown in fig 5 6 and 7 only this relationship is shown because λ p e t was found to provide more reliable estimates of θ than λ s e b in the previous section efast results were obtained for the other three cases and typically have similar behaviors to the case that is shown fig 5 shows the first order sensitivity s of the λ p e t θ relationship s r 2 to each climatic soil and vegetation parameter in this figure the parameters are ranked from the most important to least important based on their s values to facilitate inter comparisons the s values are normalized so that their sum is 100 ruark et al 2011 overall vegetation characteristics primarily control the strength of the λ p e t θ relationship l a i is the most important parameter for all four regions and r m is the second most important for three out of four regions the average dependence of r 2 on l a i and r m is shown in fig 5e and f respectively when l a i is very low r 2 is also low because soil evaporation dominates the et see eq 6 soil evaporation is insensitive to deep soil moisture because it draws water from near the ground surface thus λ p e t becomes less connected to θ when l a i is small when l a i is above about 2 its value has little impact on r 2 because transpiration more consistently dominants the et for arid regions the dependence on l a i extends over a wider range of l a i because the limited precipitated water sometimes does not reach deep into the soil which emphasizes the importance of evaporation and weakens the λ p e t θ relationship r 2 exhibits a similar dependence on l a i and other parameters for the sub humid and humid regions because the distributions from which l a i and other parameters are generated are similar for those two regions table 3 fig 5f shows that smaller r m values improve the strength of the λ p e t θ relationship particularly for arid regions as noted earlier precipitated water sometimes does not reach deep into the soil profile for arid regions if r m is large the importance of transpiration relative to evaporation changes through time depending on whether the precipitated water has reached deep into the soil evaporation and transpiration have different relationships with soil moisture so this changing importance tends to weaken the overall λ p e t θ relationship in humid regions precipitation is sufficient to keep the soil profile wet so transpiration tends to be more consistently important irrespective of r m fig 5h plots the average dependence of r 2 on the precipitation that occurred in each simulation to facilitate interpretation the annual precipitation p p t is estimated by multiplying the precipitation received in each 9 month simulation by 12 9 p p t was not included in efast because it is not a parameter in the model simulations instead it is a byproduct of the parameters of the stochastic precipitation model i r t r and t b for all climates very large values of p p t weaken the λ p e t θ relationship when p p t is very large θ is above the fc for substantial portions of each simulation thus λ p e t approaches one irrespective of the θ value and the relationship between these two variables weakens low p p t values also tend to weaken the λ p e t θ relationship for arid regions arid regions tend to have shorter and less intense storms than other regions thus when precipitation is low for arid regions the precipitated water is more likely to stay near the ground surface in such a case soil evaporation tends to play a larger role soil evaporation does not depend on deeper soil moisture which also weakens the λ p e t θ relationship fig 6 shows the sensitivity of the λ p e t θ relationship constant f to the model parameters overall soil characteristics are most important for determining the value of f c l is the single most important parameter for all four climatic regions and s i is the second most important for three of the four regions r m plays a secondary role for semiarid and sub humid regions fig 6e h show the average dependence of f on c l s i r m and p p t for each climate increasing c l causes a nearly linear increase in f fig 6e while increasing s i causes a nearly linear decrease in f fig 6f when r m is small the constant f also increases with r m fig 6g in addition f increases with p p t until it reaches a peak around 50 cm at which point f decreases with p p t fig 7 shows the sensitivity of the relationship constant e to the model parameters the highest sensivity values in fig 7 are smaller than the highest sensitivity values in fig 6 which suggests that more parameters have a meaningful influence on e than f similar to f e depends primarily on soil characteristics c l is the most important characteristic in all four climates while s i is the second most important in three out of the four climates vegetation characteristics l a i and r m again have a secondary role for semiarid and sub humid climates the nature of e s dependence on c l s i r m and p p t is shown in fig 7e h overall e shows a similar dependence on these parameters as f the tendency of e and f to increase simultaneously suggests that the most important model parameters i e regional characteristics affect the λ p e t θ relationship as shown in fig 1f specifically when e and f both increase the λ p e t θ relationship becomes steeper an increase in c l or a decrease in s i reduces the range between the pwp and fc i e the available water for root water uptake this increases e and f and produces a steeper λ p e t θ relationship low values of r m below about 30 cm tend to restrict transpiration s access to soil moisture thus λ p e t tends to be lower for a given θ which also reduces e and f see example curves in fig 1f as discussed earlier very large p p t values tend to produce many soil moisture values in each simulation that exceed the fc where λ p e t does not depend strongly on the particular value of θ similarly very low p p t values tend to produce soil moisture values that are below the pwp where λ p e t also does not depend strongly on the particular value of θ thus both extremes introduce more scatter into the relationship which reduces the estimates of e and f 3 3 proposed equations regression equations were developed to estimate the constants of the λ s e b θ and λ p e t θ relationships from the most important regional characteristics to develop these equations four cases were considered case 1 assumes no regional information is available so the relationship constants are simply numbers these numbers can be compared to those suggested by bastiaanssen et al 2000 but they are derived from all the combinations of soil vegetation and climate characteristics supplied to hydrus 1d case 2 assumes that only the climate classification is available thus the relationship constants differ for arid semiarid sub humid and humid regions case 3 assumes that the climate classification and total annual precipitation are known thus the relationship constants are estimated as a function of p p t where the function differs for each climate finally case 4 assumes that the climate classification p p t c l s i and l a i are all available although r m was observed to be important in the previous section it is unlikely to be known for a particular region with any certainty thus it is not used in the equations linear regression equations are used to estimate the relationship constants as noted earlier 50 cm appears to separate two distinct dependencies on p p t so separate relationships are used for these two ranges of p p t for the λ s e b θ relationship the following equations are proposed to estimate a and b for case 3 27 a c 1 c 2 p p t 28 b d 1 d 2 p p t where p p t is the annual precipitation cm and c 1 c 2 cm 1 d 1 and d 2 cm 1 are the regression constants for case 4 the following equations are proposed to estimate a and b 29 a c 1 c 2 p p t c 3 c l c 4 s i c 5 l a i 30 b d 1 d 2 p p t d 3 c l d 4 s i d 5 l a i where c l is a percentage s i is a percentage and c 3 c 4 c 5 d 3 d 4 and d 5 are regression constants for the λ p e t θ relationship the following equations are proposed to estimate e and f for case 3 31 e e 1 e 2 p p t 32 f f 1 f 2 p p t where e 1 e 2 cm 1 f 1 and f 2 cm 1 are regression constants for case 4 the following equations are proposed to estimate e and f 33 e e 1 e 2 p p t e 3 c l e 4 s i 34 f f 1 f 2 p p t f 3 c l f 4 s i where e 3 e 4 f 3 and f 4 are regression constants table 4 shows the regression constants for the λ s e b θ relationship and table 5 shows the constants for the λ p e t θ relationship in all cases the regression constants were calibrated to maximize the nsce between the a and b values or e and f values obtained from the hydrus 1d simulations and the regression equations the constants for the λ s e b θ relationship in case 1 table 4 are similar to the values proposed by bastiaanssen et al 2000 and scott et al 2003 based on their local datasets they suggested a 1 284 and b 0 421 whereas table 4 reports a 1 484 and b 0 522 respectively the nsce values for case 1 and case 2 in tables 4 and 5 are all zero because these cases explain no variation in the relationship constants within a given climatic region the nsce increases when the precipitation effects are considered case 3 for the λ s e b θ relationship the average ncse is 0 17 for a and 0 12 for b for the λ p e t θ relationship the average nsce is 0 24 for e and 0 15 for f the nsce values further improve when the effects of p p t c l s i and l a i are included case 4 for the λ s e b θ relationship the average ncse is 0 40 for a and 0 53 for b for the λ p e t θ relationship the average nsce is 0 44 for e and 0 55 for f to evaluate the overall performance fig 8 shows the nsce values for θ when the λ s e b θ and λ p e t θ relationships are estimated using bastiaanssen et al 2000 and cases 1 4 using λ p e t typically provides better nsce values than λ s e b this improvement also occurs when using the empirical relationship even though bastiaanssen et al 2000 did not suggest using the empirical relationship with λ p e t however the θ estimates from the bastiaanssen et al 2000 relationship typically have negative nsce values the θ estimates from all four cases have higher nsce s than the estimates from the bastiaanssen et al 2000 relationship furthermore as one uses more information to estimate the relationship i e one moves from case 1 to case 4 the estimates of θ typically improve like the empirical relationship case 1 uses no regional characteristics but it was derived by considering a much wider range of climate soil and vegetation conditions than the empirical relationship case 2 uses distinct λ s e b θ and λ p e t θ relationships for each climatic region so it adapts to the typical conditions for each climate better performance is observed for the semiarid and subhumid regions than the arid and humid regions case 3 includes the annual precipitation p p t when determining the λ s e b θ and λ p e t θ relationships but it shows only slight improvements compared to case 2 case 4 provides the best θ estimates for all regions by including variations in precipitation p p t soil texture s i and c l and vegetation l a i although these evaluations are made using modeled soil moisture the substantial improvement in nsce between using the bastiaanssen et al 2000 relationship and case 4 indicates that further testing of the proposed methods are warranted 4 conclusions the purposes of this study were to 1 quantify the impacts of soil vegetation and climatic characteristics on the strength and form of the λ s e b θ λ s e b s λ p e t θ and λ p e t s relationships and 2 propose a set of specific relationships that account for the most important regional characteristics based on this modeling study the following conclusions can be reached 1 the relationships that use λ p e t are better predictors of θ and s than the relationships that use λ s e b λ p e t is preferred not only when a single relationship shape is assumed to apply for all locations but also when the constants that determine the relationship shape are calibrated for each location λ p e t includes the effects of both available energy and turbulent transport wind speed and vapor pressure deficit while λ s e b includes only the effects of available energy therefore λ p e t is more directly related to et and thus θ and s this result suggests that the optical thermal remote sensing methods might be improved by using λ p e t instead of λ s e b if λ p e t can be reliably estimated from remote sensing and or weather station data 2 when a single relationship is assumed to apply to all locations the relationships are more reliable for estimating s than θ by estimating s local variations in the saturation water content are implicitly accommodated however when the relationship is calibrated separately for each location both θ and s can be estimated with similar accuracy in this case the calibration accounts for the local saturation water content 3 the λ s e b θ λ s e b s λ p e t θ and λ p e t s relationships are stronger for semiarid and sub humid regions than for arid and humid regions for arid and humid regions θ and s are more commonly below the pwp or above the fc where λ s e b and λ p e t depend less on the specific values of θ and s 4 the strength of the λ p e t θ relationship primarily depends on vegetation characteristics such as the leaf area index l a i and maximum rooting depth r m l a i is important because it impacts the relative importance of soil evaporation and plant transpiration r m is important because it controls the soil depths where transpiration obtains water 5 the shape of the λ p e t θ relationship primarily depends on soil characteristics such as the percent clay c l and percent silt s i c l and s i determine the range of soil moisture between the pwp and fc and thus affect the steepness of the λ p e t θ relationship 6 the annual precipitation p p t affects both the strength and the shape of the λ p e t θ relationship λ p e t already accounts for one of the two main forcing variables for soil moisture dynamics in its denominator potential et but it does not account for the other main forcing variable precipitation p p t helps determine how frequently the soil moisture reaches extreme values where the λ p e t θ relationship weakens 7 four methods were proposed to estimate the forms of the λ s e b θ and λ p e t θ relationships case 1 uses no regional information case 2 uses only the climate classification case 3 uses the climate classification and p p t and case 4 uses the climate classification p p t c l s i and l a i the nsce values from these cases suggest that the accuracy of the estimated λ s e b θ and λ p e t θ relationships substantially improve as more regional characteristics are considered the relationships proposed in this study are based on richards equation for variably saturated flow and soil characteristic curves from van genuchten 1980 as implemented in the one dimentional physically based model hydrus 1d the proposed relationships were not tested by application in a remote sensing method or comparisons to in situ observations of θ or s such testing is a critical avenue of future research when used in a practical context it is possible that errors in the estimation of λ s e b and λ p e t or regional characteristics such as p p t c l s i and l a i affects the relative performance of the various methods such testing could also consider how heterogeneity of soil vegetation and climatic conditions within a region affects the performance of the methods for example if soil characteristics vary within a region can separate relationships be used for different locations with adequate reliability future research could also repeat this analysis using other vadose zone model structures although hydrus 1d is physically based the results likely depend on assumptions embedded in the model structure future modeling studies could include thinner soils shallow water tables compensation in the root water uptake from different soil depths more detailed descriptions of the surface energy balance

10596,intensive agricultural cultivation in hilly catchments is subject to significant environmental risks because the local terrain and exceptionally fragile ecosystem usually promote high levels of nutrient loss in order to assess such negative effects we compared long term 2012 2018 water quality dynamics of four ponds that are fed by runoff from agricultural hillsides with contrasting slopes and land cover near tianmu lake in eastern china averaged total nitrogen tn levels in ponds increased from 7 0 mg l 1 to 10 0 mg l 1 when the cultivated slopes above them doubled from 8 to 16 in contrast total phosphorus tp levels varied modestly from 0 05 to 0 07 mg l 1 among the four ponds values were lower when drained hillslopes had good vegetation coverage and or buffer strips redundancy analysis rda indicated that relatively high precipitation is the determining factor for n loss from gentle hillsides but as slope gradients increase the frequency of rainfall events becomes the major influential factor tp loss was associated with strong rainfall events and can be greatly reduced if hillsides are well covered with vegetation when vegetation cover is removed nutrient loss especially n is heightened our results underscore the significance of agricultural cultivation of steep hillsides in exacerbating n and p pollution and highlight the value of forests and grasslands in reducing nutrient loss from these sensitive areas an integrated strategy that includes controlling land exploitation source control delivery interception and pond management should be considered to minimize nutrient loss in hilly areas prone to rapid agricultural expansion keywords pond water quality trends taihu lake trend decomposition agricultural expansion hillslopes 1 introduction increasing nutrient loss as a result of intensified agricultural activities has become an issue of global concern galloway et al 2004 howarth et al 1996 swaney et al 2018 because it results in enhanced eutrophication and other ecological damage swaney et al 2012 withers and jarvie 2008 recent rapid socio economic development and correspondingly improved living standards have greatly raised the demand for specialized nonfood agricultural products such as tea and coffee li et al 2018 the resulting pressure on limited land resources triggers continued agricultural expansion and draws more and more ecologically fragile land such as that in hilly regions into production de jesús crespo et al 2016 lv et al 2016 undesirable social and environmental issues have consequently arisen especially elevated nutrient loss that degrades downstream aquatic ecosystems given the fact that hilly regions provide essential freshwater for growing populations both in the mountains and in the lowlands it is critical both to understand nutrient loss raised by agricultural production in hilly regions and to develop methods to minimize it accelerated land cover change and increasing cultivation of fragile hilly uplands continues to be one of the most prevalent problems in the future laurance et al 2014 tilman 1999 a large and growing body of literature has recognized their negative effects on nutrient loss for example according to garcía llamas et al 2019 rapid land cover change as a result of agricultural encroachment onto natural lands often results in long lasting impairment of soil and water conservation and other crucial ecosystem services suescun et al 2017 concluded that land cover changes could induce successive changes in the precipitation runoff infiltration progression which in turn can result in considerable soil erosion and nutrient loss in addition cultivation of steep hillslopes usually causes significant environmental consequences because these hillslopes have a tendency to lose water nutrients and soil dibiase and whipple 2011 sharma et al 2001 tiwari et al 2010 el kateb et al 2013 demonstrated that the amount of soil erosion and associated nutrient loss is positively related to the slope gradient of cultivated land although previous investigators have highlighted the importance of land cover and slope in governing nutrient loss mainali and chang 2018 shibata et al 2018 suescun et al 2017 little is known of these dynamics as a consequence of long term interactions of land cover slope precipitation agricultural cultivation and other factors at the hillslope scale according to sharpley and tunney 2000 analysis of hillslope nutrient loss and its spatio temporal dynamics has explicit scientific and management significance and can contribute to improved strategies to reduce water pollution current gaps in our understanding of the mediating roles of land cover and slope in nutrient loss nevertheless limit our ability to clearly identify areas of greatest concern and to predict the response of systems to future change nutrient loss pathways can significantly differ across space and time and so monitoring is a primary challenge for assessing overall nutrient loss from agricultural hillslopes van verseveld et al 2009 in many hilly regions ponds are widely distributed in more lowland areas where they provide hydrological connections between upland sources and downstream water bodies chen et al 2019b these ponds can receive and store runoff and nutrients from different pathways including surface subsurface and lateral flows and so they provide inherently excellent records of nutrient loss from drainage uplands yan et al 1998 previous studies have focused extensively on the mitigating roles of ponds in nutrient loss uusheimo et al 2018 pérez gutiérrez et al 2017 but only for relatively short periods such as a rainy season or the duration of several rainfall events sønderup et al 2016 yan et al 1998 few such studies have linked water quality with the terrain and land cover of drainage uplands or taken the long term perspectives warranted by the fact that water quality is determined by these drainage areas chen et al 2019b the hypothesis driving this study is that the dynamics of water quality in ponds can be used as a metric to assess the impacts of land cover changes and the slope gradients of upland drainage sites our main objective was to investigate the linkages between nutrient loss and the slopes and land cover of agricultural hillslopes we do so by examining water quality dynamics in four contrasting lowland ponds fed by runoff from agricultural hillslopes with contrasting topographical features and land covers the ponds and hillslopes are located at the tianmu lake catchment which lies in the taihu lake basin the third largest freshwater lake basin of china the main agricultural crop planted on the hillslopes is tea camellia sinensis which has been extensively cultivated in the entire catchment and other regions in china chao and shou 2001 huang 1989 driven by increasing demand for high yield high margin tea products nearly 7 of the forest in this catchment has been converted into tea plantations in recent years in many cases these plantations are located on very fragile highlands with steep slopes diao et al 2013 and thus represent agricultural development that has caused significant environmental damage li et al 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and agronomic practices the tianmu lake catchment lies on the western edge of the much larger taihu lake basin of china fig 1 this catchment includes two reservoirs shahe and daxi both of which are important drinking water sources and it has a typical hilly topography with elevations ranging from 1 to 531 m above sea level such terrain naturally contains countless ponds see fig 1 four contrasting agricultural pond systems which consist of hillslopes and ponds were selected as research sites average elevations of the four pond systems are similar with a range of 57 88 m the main agricultural crop for all of the hillslopes is tea which is usually associated with intense agronomic management that includes periodic pruning and fertilization arable soil layers of these hillslopes are rather thin generally ranging from 60 to 100 cm and consist primarily of shallow lithosols as defined by fao fao iiasa isric isscas jrc 2012 their textures are silt loam with 70 mean silt content and 20 clay content the content of gravimetric rock fragment is 17 and mean porosity reaches 33 which preferentially allows the infiltration of water and associated pollutants lai et al 2020 zhu et al 2014 according to recent reports of soil properties in this catchment lai et al 2020 mean bulk density soil organic carbon and field capacity is 1 41 g cm 3 0 011 g g 1 0 22 m3 m 3 respectively although moderate spatial variations also exist among different hillslopes bedrock lies beneath the soil and blocks vertical movement downwards thus most of the surface and subsurface water from the hillslopes eventually flows into the lowland ponds the four pond systems designated sites a b c and d differ significantly in land cover slope drainage area and other characteristics as summarized in fig 2 sites a and b are 100 tea but site b contains buffer strips of grass and trees during the period from 2012 to 2018 land use on these three sites remained stable but land cover on site d was disrupted when all of the pine tree forestland was cut in march 2017 and the area subsequently planted with tea agronomic practices for tea production were similar at all sites local farmers usually apply a combination of organic fertilizers manure and chemical fertilizers three times annually before harvest of tea shoots in early march about 7500 kg of organic fertilizers and 225 kg of compound chemical fertilizer are applied per ha as a total containing 180 kg n ha 1 of n and 80 kg p ha 1 of p after pruning of the plants in april and may about 3750 kg of organic fertilizers and 375 kg of compound chemical fertilizer are applied per ha as a total containing 130 kg n ha 1 of n and 55 kg p ha 1 of p winter fertilization in september and october usually consists of 3750 kg of manure and 1875 kg of oilseed residues per ha as a total containing 185 kg n ha 1 of n and 35 kg p ha 1 of p other agronomic practices are not usually employed but if the weather is very dry plants are sometimes irrigated 2 2 field sampling and analytical techniques the meteorological station near sites b and d was chosen for this study because it is also close to other sites 8 km and it has more stable and continuous records of data during 2012 2018 compared with other meteorological stations in this catchment see zhang et al 2019 for their locations monthly indicators used here were derived from hourly meteorological observations and included precipitation in mm pre averaged air temperature in temp the number of days when daily rainfall was greater than 5 mm pre5 the number of rainfall days nop and maximum rainfall intensity in mm h 1 mri water samples from all four sites were obtained at the end of each month during 2012 2018 no samples were lost or missing each sampling site was adjacent to the outlet that connects the pond to downstream water bodies if water was draining samples were drawn from the outflowing water if there was no water discharge three samples were taken from different locations of each pond and blended dissolved oxygen was immediately measured using a ysi 6000 multi probe field meter samples were stored at 2 and transported to the laboratory for some analysis of water quality variation monthly data were grouped to represent three distinct periods defined by a combination of weather and agricultural practices these included a dry period november through february a farming period during which fertilization harvesting and pruning of tea occur march through may and september through october and a rainy period june through august in the laboratory the dissolved fraction was collected via vacuum filtration 8 psi through pre combusted 450 c for 4 h and rinsed 0 7 μm nominal pore size glass fiber filters the filtrate was used for the determination of dissolved forms of nutrients including total dissolved nitrogen tdn nitrate no3 n ammonium ammonia nh4 n nitrite no2 n total dissolved phosphorus tdp and soluble reactive phosphorus srp material on the filters was used for determination of total suspended solids tss raw water samples were used for the determination of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and permanganate index cod all of the above water quality indicators were analyzed following standard protocols mep 2002 note that particulate nitrogen pn was indirectly calculated from the difference between tn and tdn a similar calculation was adopted for particulate phosphorus pp dissolved organic nitrogen don was calculated from the difference between tdn and other dissolved n forms i e no3 n nh4 n no2 n dissolved organic phosphorus dop was calculated from the difference between tdp and srp 2 3 data analysis two statistical features the average and standard deviation of each water quality indicator were calculated one way analysis of variance one way anova tabachnick and fidell 2006 was adopted to assess whether statistically significant differences of water quality existed among the four ponds studied the water quality data were imported into r an open source statistical programming language to test the dca detrended correspondence analysis gradient axis the dca gradient shaft length was less than 3 wollenberg 1977 and therefore redundancy analysis rda was selected for gradient analysis of the relationships of water quality to climate indicators as influenced by land cover and slope rda is useful in condensing the information between two sets of variables and offers advantages in revealing the strength and direction of the correlation between them shen et al 2015 shi et al 2017 before applying rda the normality of the data was examined and log x 1 transformation of data was performed to meet the assumptions of normality wollenberg 1977 data are expressed as rda biplots where arrows of two variables pointing in the same direction indicate a positive correlation and the angle between two arrows is inversely proportional to the degree of their correlation in order to qualitatively analyze temporal variations in water quality we adopted a nonparametric time series decomposition method known as seasonal trend decomposition procedure based on loess stl cleveland and cleveland 1990 this allowed us to resolve trends and seasonality of water quality in each pond the stl approach is useful for describing nonlinear patterns and seasonal interactions that do not have an obvious functional form and it provides a robust statistical estimation of seasonal and trend components buffering the effect of outliers and aberrant data romero et al 2016 this technique has been widely used to analyze the temporal dynamics of water quality time series data cheng et al 2018 romero et al 2016 stow et al 2015 broadly stl applies repeated nonparametric loess fitting to decompose monthly time series data into smoothed trend seasonal and residual components cleveland 1979 shamsudduha et al 2009 the observed monthly time series data can be expressed as 1 y y e a r m o n t h t y e a r m o n t h s y e a r m o n t h r y e a r m o n t h where y y e a r m o n t h is the observed value for a given year and month t y e a r m o n t h is the trend component s y e a r m o n t h is the seasonal component and r y e a r m o n t h is the remainder or residual term qian et al 2000 stl recursive procedures permit the trend component of the water quality time series to be isolated by removing the seasonal and residual components from the time series data wan et al 2017 use of this technique involves two parameters that determine the degree of smoothing in both trend and seasonal components based on recommendations and diagnostic methods in previous studies cleveland and cleveland 1990 romero et al 2016 and given the number and frequency of our pond observations we chose window widths of 6 months and 30 months respectively to visually reveal trends for the seasonal and long term components the smoothing parameters were therefore fixed at these values for all subsequent stl analyses which were performed with r 3 results 3 1 meteorological conditions during the period 2012 2018 annual precipitation ranged from 828 mm yr 1 in 2013 to 2376 mm yr 1 in 2016 fig 3 similarly mri also exhibited significant annual variations ranging from 8 4 mm h 1in 2013 to 14 2 mm h 1 in 2016 both nop and pre5 showed obvious annual variations but pre5 was decreased after 2015 the annual average air temperature varied little with a range of 15 17 c as influenced by the subtropical humid monsoon and shown in fig 3c and d all of the weather variables in the tianmu lake catchment exhibited obvious seasonality i e a hot rainy period june through august and a cold dry period november through february rainfall is highly concentrated during the rainy period when more than 50 of annual precipitation occurs precipitation during this period is recorded for nearly 15 days per month with 6 days experiencing relatively large precipitation pre 5 mm the corresponding monthly averaged mri is 23 mm h 1 which is two and six times of that in the farming and dry periods respectively 3 2 overall water quality comprehensive water quality characteristics of the four ponds over the period from 2012 to 2018 are presented in fig 4 as box and whisker diagrams of scattered points and their corresponding distribution curves between pond variation of two n related indicators tn and no3 n was much greater than that of the p related indicators thus long term averaged tp concentrations varied only from 0 05 to 0 07 mg l 1 but averaged tn concertations varied from 1 8 mg l 1 to 9 7 mg l 1 unexpectedly long term averaged tp content in pond b was slightly lower than that in ponds a and c an observation that may be related to the existence of buffer strips in the former shown in fig 2 concentrations of tn and no3 n the major n pollutants in ponds a b and c are statistically higher than those in pond d p 0 01 this correlates with the presence of tea plants as a major component of land cover at the sites when the land was entirely covered by tea as at sites a and b steeper hillslopes site b usually correlated with a higher concentration of pollutants when half of the land was covered by forest the negative effects of slope gradient could be counteracted i e there was no significant difference in tn and no3 n levels at sites b and c no significant differences in cod were detected among the ponds and other characteristics were similar monthly tn concentrations in all of the ponds are frequently higher than 2 mg l 1 which was in the worst category as defined by the environmental quality standards for surface water in china gb3838 2002 monthly tp concentrations are obviously higher than 0 02 mg l 1 indicating significant risk of algal blooms correll 1998 in aggregate this information confirms that water from these ponds represents a significant pollution source for downstream rivers 3 3 components of n and p loss during the annual cycle management decisions to control pollution in pond systems and downslope areas requires detailed knowledge of the main n and p species that serve as potential pollutants fig 5 summarizes the average components of n and p pollution in the four ponds during different periods i e the dry farming and rainy periods as measured from 2012 to 2018 no3 n was always the predominant form of n in ponds comprising from 75 to 99 of the total small amounts of pn from 4 to 23 of the total were present at all ponds but with the exception of don during the farming season when manure is being applied the levels of other forms of nitrogen such as nh4 n and no2 n were negligible overall n concentrations exhibited seasonal variation across the three periods tending to be higher in the dry season and lower in the rainy season the main forms of p in all ponds were dop and pp high dissolved forms of p srp drp were expected since local soil porosity is high 33 lai et al 2020 which allows more dissolved p leaching with subsurface flows relatively high levels of pp were also observed highlighting that soil erosion could be a significant source of p arriving in the ponds although p concentrations were generally high during the farming period when agronomic practices would be expected to contribute to p loss from fields to ponds high p levels were also evident during the dry and rainy periods this is because strong rainfall erosion as represented by high mri and more frequent rainfall events shown in fig 3 usually exacerbates soil erosion and enhances p leaching during the rainy period however during the dry period although rainfall erosion becomes fairly weak high accumulation of erodible p enriched particulates in soils as a result of the intensive winter fertilization can greatly increase pp levels in ponds highest pp contents were observed in the dry period among ponds underscoring that p loss as a result of the winter fertilization could be a significant factor 3 4 relationships between pond water quality and environmental variables the topographic and land cover conditions of hillslopes are important mediating factors of pond water quality because they strongly influence the generation transport and retention of nutrients we consequently subjected each pond to rda analysis to assess the responses of pond water quality to weather conditions as influenced by contrasting slope gradients and land cover as shown in fig 6 most of the water quality indicators are closely related to monthly precipitation and temperature for example tn and no3 n are always negatively related to monthly air temperature temp as indicated by the angles among the arrows across ponds shown in fig 6 this suggests that their concentrations tended to be low in the warm period when vegetative growth and denitrification are active precipitation related indicators such as pre5 were positively related to tn this kind of relationship is apparent for all ponds most prominently for pond a suggesting that n loss from the gentle hillslope was likely driven by relatively high precipitation events in contrast the number of rainfall days nop is more closely related to the tn and no3 n concentration in pond b indicating that the frequency of rainfall events is an important controlling factor for n loss from the pond drained by a steeper hillslope notably precipitation related factors exhibit weak linkages to n related indicators in pond c implying that there are other non weather factors that can mediate the rainfall runoff processes one such factor may be the high coverage of forestland on the hillslope which would be expected to buffer precipitation and runoff and trap pollutants a similar pattern is also observable in pond d further emphasizing the importance of forestland in intercepting precipitation and buffering nutrient loss as with n p concentrations in ponds are also influenced by precipitation in both pond a and pond b monthly maximum rainfall intensity mri was most closely linked to p related indicators this demonstrates that p loss is mainly associated with strong rainfall events especially at sites devoted to tea the relationship is not apparent at the other sites which contain significant amounts of forested land it is also noteworthy that precipitation and pre5 are negatively related to pp and tp concentrations in pond c and d which are drained by hillslopes with buffer strips or well coverage of forestland this indicates that high precipitation may dilute the p contents in these ponds this is possible because high coverage of forests can significantly reduce soil off site movement and increase the interceptions of p enriched particulates 3 5 temporal trends the stl procedure decomposes time series data into seasonal and annual components we subjected tn and tp data from each pond to such analysis and show the seasonal and annual components as well as the original time series data in fig 7 the annual trends for tn in pond a and pond c are similar especially after 2015 which is highly consistent with the trend of pre5 shown in fig 3 this indicates that the decrease in the frequency of relatively large rainfall events actually reduces the chances of runoff generation and associated n off site movement the deep trough and inflection point in pond b creates a much different tn trend as does the relatively flat line for pond d that rises rapidly coincident with removal of the forest in 2017 fig 7 shaded area the overall annual tp trend lines resemble one another in that they decline during the early sampling years and increase thereafter in pond b the parallel deep trough and inflection point were also observed for tp indicating that the buffer strips have been over saturated with nutrients in the year around 2015 and released more nutrients thereafter in the case of ponds a and c the increase is interrupted with an inflection point and modest declines thereafter an observation consistent with the trends of precipitation and nop see fig 3 the annual tp trend for pond d is unique because annualized tp concentrations decline over the course of the sampling period but then rise fig 7 shaded area coincident with removal of trees from the site tn concentrations in pond d increased rapidly from 2 mg l 1 to 10 mg l 1 during the 1 5 years following land cover changes but tp concentrations did not rise similarly this implies that ponds have a stronger ability in trapping sediment and associated p the stl analysis also provides insight into the seasonal fluctuations of tn and tp in each pond fig 7 major differences in the seasonality of tn and tp are apparent tn peaks generally occurred during march to may coincident with agricultural cultivation periods low tn generally occurred in the summer time in contrast tp peaks were usually evident in the early rainy season june and july when canopy cover in tea plantations has been reduced as a result of pruning high concentrations of tn and tp were also observed in february when the temperature is low and freezing and thawing are likely 4 discussion 4 1 influence of weather conditions there is a growing body of research recognizing the important impact of weather in the form of precipitation and temperature on nutrient loss ramos and martínezcasasnovas 2010 suescun et al 2017 zheng et al 2016 in the tianmu lake catchment precipitation is highly variable from year to year the annual average for the period 2012 2018 was 1150 mm and around 50 of annual precipitation is concentrated during the june august period fig 3 frequent rainfall events 10 days per month with variable rainfall intensity can greatly influence the off site movement of nutrients via surface or subsurface runoff increasing nutrient loads arriving in ponds little et al 2005 liu et al 2014 characterized by a subtropical humid monsoon climate the mean annual temperature in this area is 16 18 c with significant seasonality during the warm months suitable temperatures can favor a variety of forms of biotic and abiotic processing of nutrients including denitrification soil microbial activity and associated rates of n and p mineralization tan et al 2018 however during the cold winter the biotic processes would be inhibited resulting in net accumulations of nutrients in ponds importantly occasional freezing thawing processes as a result of temperature change can destroy plant cells and soil structure which in turn can promote nutrient loss bechmann et al 2005 although such freezing thawing effects are usually most prominent in the cold regions jian et al 2014 matzner and borken 2008 the periodic peaks of p concentrations observed in february when the temperature frequently fluctuated around the melting point suggested that the effects could be significant in our research area tp loss from cultivated land seems to be more sensitive to precipitation and maximum rainfall intensity short duration rainstorms characterized by high rainfall intensity see fig 3 were common and likely facilitate p loss via enhanced soil erosion trend analysis as shown in fig 7 demonstrates that tp annual dynamics across ponds generally corresponds to annual changes in rainfall these results are consistent with previous evidence zhang et al 2011 that hillslope tp loss can be exacerbated by significant rainfall events temperature is a much more influential factor for n because it can promote and inhibit various processes related to transformation and removal of this element huang et al 2013 our rda results confirm that tn and no3 n in all ponds are always negatively related to air temperature the influence of precipitation on tn in ponds is much more complicated because rainfall can trigger complex biogeochemical processes for example although rainfall can drive n loss rainfall can also enhance biogeochemical removal of n in ponds e g through creating an anaerobic environment suitable for denitrification herrman et al 2008 or increasing the chances of n processing in the microbial active zones such as hyporheic and riparian zones etc harvey et al 2013 the weak tn peak of annual trends in wet 2016 is evidence of this bachmair et al 2012 comparison of the four contrasting sites in our study each with a different slope gradient and land cover characteristics confirms that the influence of weather indicators on water quality can be highly varied even in a relatively small spatial context see fig 6 pond specific relationships between weather indicators and nutrient levels provide evidence that cultivating more ecologically fragile land can enhance the responses of nutrient loss to climate conditions leading to more prominent nutrient loss however this study only focused on the linkages between weather indicators and pond water quality ignoring the complicated processes on or below the hillslopes more refined monitoring that tracks nutrient loss during the successive processes of precipitation runoff infiltration on the hillslopes could more precisely determine the functions of pond and role of weather conditions as mediated by slope gradient and land cover 4 2 influence of slope and land cover obviously higher concentrations of tn in ponds b and c in comparison to pond a indicate that steep hillslopes promote more n loss than gentler slopes fig 4 actually slope gradients of the hill to valley convergence can directly or indirectly determine total water yields flow pathways either surface and subsurface and the speed of runoff chen et al 2019a in this context steep hillslopes can have a stronger propensity to form runoff that elevates soil erosion and n extraction van verseveld et al 2009 the significance of the slope gradient in governing n loss has also been well documented by previous studies el kateb et al 2013 van verseveld et al 2009 in contrast to levels of tn levels of tp and tss in pond a were significantly greater than those in pond b which had a similar cover but a much higher average slope site b contains buffer strips of grass and trees and it is likely that their presence reduced p loss because buffer strips are known to have strong abilities to reduce soil erosion and p loads dorioz et al 2006 yang et al 2009 although buffer strips are capable of trapping particles and dissolved pollutants nutrients can be flushed through them and into the ponds when rainfall is significant the relatively higher tp concentrations observed in pond b during the rainy period shown fig 5 is evidence for such limitations of buffer strips comparison of pond b to pond c provides evidence that many water quality indicators are not statistically different even when the slopes of drainage areas diverge significantly half of site c is forested and this factor likely offsets the negative influence of tea production site d provides additional convincing evidence of the importance of forestland in preventing nutrient loss removal of trees from this site in 2017 triggered a surge in tn concentrations with associated increases of tp that were less dramatic short term dynamics not revealed by monthly monitoring may have obscured rapid trapping of sediments and associated p conditioned by deforestation boyd et al 1998 high frequency sampling or event based rainfall runoff monitoring will be necessary to clarify this point previous findings have highlighted the crucial roles of vegetation in soil and water conservation pan and shangguan 2006 zhang et al 2011 and forestland is considered to be the most appropriate land use form on steep slopes because it substantially reduces soil erosion and nutrient loss carroll et al 2000 el kateb et al 2013 once vegetation coverage is removed however negative consequences become apparent papanicolaou et al 2018 e g hydrograph peaks can be elevated by up to 133 sharpley and moyer 2000 in parallel seasonal vegetation cover changes as a result of agricultural cultivation can also lead to significant environmental concerns tea plants can provide significant canopy cover but just before the rainy season local farmers usually prune the plants to force new growth and obtain better yields for the next year this practice can abruptly reduce vegetation coverage from 70 to 30 resulting in a large area of exposed land subject to erosion nie et al 2013 this elevates the risk of p pollution as observed from significantly higher tp concentrations during the farming period see fig 5 anything that can be done to retain cover during this period including covering soil with crop residues or piling up of stones would be useful in preventing p loss 4 3 implications for pollution management ponds perform an important ecological function by hydrologically linking uplands with the downstream river network yan et al 1998 they can be sinks for inflowing nutrients because of their strong abilities in nutrient removal interception and also can be sources of pollution of downstream rivers if their water quality is poor chen et al 2019b minimization of negative downstream effects requires careful management of the ponds and their drainage areas we believe that this should focus on two factors control of agricultural expansion and when agriculture is present integrated strategies to minimize nutrient loss controlling the expansion of agricultural land especially that for tea plantations is of great urgency near tianmu lake where land use conversion to tea is proceeding rapidly over short periods of time diao et al 2013 our observation of rapidly deteriorating water quality in pond d after tree cutting to prepare lands for tea is a stark reminder of the negative effects of such expansion li et al 2013 nie et al 2013 the relatively poor water quality in ponds b and c is also a reminder that steep land must be carefully managed to avoid undesirable environmental effects sivertun and prange 2003 approvals for agricultural expansion near tianmu lake should take factors such as slope gradient land cover and distance to important water bodies into account deterministic and risk assessment modeling tools are available to guide this process e g li et al 2015 schwarz et al 2011 su et al 2016 best management plans can also be drawn up so that capital resources can be allocated efficiently sivertun and prange 2003 some legislation including reservoir management regulations and imposition of ecological red lines has already been put in place to prohibit agricultural development in sensitive areas lü et al 2013 yun lin et al 2003 but additional controls are needed integrated management of agricultural production to minimize nutrient runoff should include measures to control the source of nutrients and intercept their delivery from hillslopes local farmers usually apply excessively high amounts of fertilizer to assure good quality and high yields of tea excessive accumulation of nutrients in the tea hillslopes significantly exacerbates their loss risk van meter et al 2016 fertilizer use efficiency must be improved via methods such as recycling of crop residues and adoption of precision fertilization sun et al 2012 loss of cover due to trimming of tea plants just prior of the rainy season can be offset by application of straw agronomic measures including contour cultivation conservation tillage and piling up of stones have already been adopted by some large farms to slow movement of water and nutrients from tea plantations the establishment of buffer strips is a particularly good option to intercept nutrient transfer provided that these barriers are appropriately placed on important pathways of runoff movement such as low lying areas of hillslopes these areas are usually outflow places of lateral surface and subsurface recharge and so they not only facilitate soil erosion and surface flow but they also tend to be hot spots for biogeochemical processes zhu et al 2014 buffer strips are most valuable when located at lower positions along slopes liu et al 2013 when optimally positioned they can remove approximately 80 of total p loads dorioz et al 2006 vegetation type the size of the buffer in relation to site hydrological conditions and how it is managed are all important considerations roberts et al 2012 but as dorioz et al 2006 pointed out the long term influence of buffer strips should be carefully considered since they can also release the temporarily stored nutrients pond management becomes an important method to restrict nutrient transport and promote retention of nutrients that would otherwise migrate into downstream waterways chen et al 2019b fu et al 2018 the sharp reduction in velocity of flow as surface runoff enters ponds allows deposition of the suspended sediment load and increased opportunity for soluble n and p to be absorbed by the soil and taken up by vegetation withers and jarvis 1998 rainfall runoff field monitoring of tea hillslopes near tianmu lake revealed that tn content in surface flow is 11 25 mg l 1 and in the subsurface flow is 27 16 mg l 1 nie et al 2013 given that the average tn concentration in ponds a and b is 8 8 mg l 1 this implies that roughly 32 78 of n loads were removed these values are within reported ranges of n removal rates in ponds e g reinhardt et al 2006 yan et al 1998 however relatively high do contents and relatively low availability of carbon sources as represented by relative low cod levels see fig 4 may suggest that the denitrification n removal in ponds could be highly inhibited this indicates that n removal in ponds can be improved by increasing external carbon sources or in other ways enhancing oxygen depletion there is very limited information on p loss from hillslopes near tianmu lake but studies from elsewhere suggest that event average concentration of tp loss is about 0 5 mg l 1 wang et al 2012 this information indicates that pond p retention is generally around 88 given the averaged tp contents 0 06 mg l 1 in the ponds of our study area this is consistent with the results of yan et al 1998 who demonstrated that ponds can retain as much as 95 of tp loads however this result should be interpreted with caution because ponds which both receive hillslope runoff and drain water downstream can only partly account for p retention irrespective of this fact the retention efficiency of ponds also depends on water storage capacity the growth of aquatic vegetation and irrigation amounts chen et al 2019b appropriate pond management and maintenance should be considered to avoid problems of internal loading filling and resuspension sønderup et al 2016 5 conclusions relatively high nutrient concentrations are usually present in ponds drained by hillslopes with higher percentages of agricultural land cover and or very steep average slopes indicating that pollution of water with n and p can be significantly exacerbated when tea cultivation extends to these areas this conclusion is strengthened by the observation of increased nutrient runoff following conversion of site d from forest to a tea plantation more than 75 of n in the ponds consisted of no3 n implying that subsurface flow could be the main loss pathway of n tn is also a more sensitive indicator of land cover change than tp showing an increase by a factor of five once the vegetation cover was removed in contrast particulate and dissolved organic forms of p predominated suggesting that prevention of soil erosion should control p loss relatively high amounts of both nutrients left fields during the farming season and so agronomic practices are a logical target for control of n and p pollution influences of weather indicators on water quality can be mediated by land cover and gradient slopes of agricultural uplands on gentle hillslopes significant precipitation e g 5 mm is the main influential factor for n loss but as the slope gradient increases the frequency of rainfall events becomes the major controlling factor implying that n loss from steep hillslopes can be sensitive to even small rainfall events significant p loss was always associated with storm rainfall events and was strongly mediated by forest coverage which again focuses attention on forest removal for agriculture these results point to the fact that cultivation of more ecologically fragile land can enhance the responses of nutrient loss to weather conditions especially in regions with a humid climate through the above analysis a more detailed perspective has been obtained on the effects of land cover changes and cultivation of steep hillslopes on nutrient loss integrated agricultural management including controlling land exploitation

10596,intensive agricultural cultivation in hilly catchments is subject to significant environmental risks because the local terrain and exceptionally fragile ecosystem usually promote high levels of nutrient loss in order to assess such negative effects we compared long term 2012 2018 water quality dynamics of four ponds that are fed by runoff from agricultural hillsides with contrasting slopes and land cover near tianmu lake in eastern china averaged total nitrogen tn levels in ponds increased from 7 0 mg l 1 to 10 0 mg l 1 when the cultivated slopes above them doubled from 8 to 16 in contrast total phosphorus tp levels varied modestly from 0 05 to 0 07 mg l 1 among the four ponds values were lower when drained hillslopes had good vegetation coverage and or buffer strips redundancy analysis rda indicated that relatively high precipitation is the determining factor for n loss from gentle hillsides but as slope gradients increase the frequency of rainfall events becomes the major influential factor tp loss was associated with strong rainfall events and can be greatly reduced if hillsides are well covered with vegetation when vegetation cover is removed nutrient loss especially n is heightened our results underscore the significance of agricultural cultivation of steep hillsides in exacerbating n and p pollution and highlight the value of forests and grasslands in reducing nutrient loss from these sensitive areas an integrated strategy that includes controlling land exploitation source control delivery interception and pond management should be considered to minimize nutrient loss in hilly areas prone to rapid agricultural expansion keywords pond water quality trends taihu lake trend decomposition agricultural expansion hillslopes 1 introduction increasing nutrient loss as a result of intensified agricultural activities has become an issue of global concern galloway et al 2004 howarth et al 1996 swaney et al 2018 because it results in enhanced eutrophication and other ecological damage swaney et al 2012 withers and jarvie 2008 recent rapid socio economic development and correspondingly improved living standards have greatly raised the demand for specialized nonfood agricultural products such as tea and coffee li et al 2018 the resulting pressure on limited land resources triggers continued agricultural expansion and draws more and more ecologically fragile land such as that in hilly regions into production de jesús crespo et al 2016 lv et al 2016 undesirable social and environmental issues have consequently arisen especially elevated nutrient loss that degrades downstream aquatic ecosystems given the fact that hilly regions provide essential freshwater for growing populations both in the mountains and in the lowlands it is critical both to understand nutrient loss raised by agricultural production in hilly regions and to develop methods to minimize it accelerated land cover change and increasing cultivation of fragile hilly uplands continues to be one of the most prevalent problems in the future laurance et al 2014 tilman 1999 a large and growing body of literature has recognized their negative effects on nutrient loss for example according to garcía llamas et al 2019 rapid land cover change as a result of agricultural encroachment onto natural lands often results in long lasting impairment of soil and water conservation and other crucial ecosystem services suescun et al 2017 concluded that land cover changes could induce successive changes in the precipitation runoff infiltration progression which in turn can result in considerable soil erosion and nutrient loss in addition cultivation of steep hillslopes usually causes significant environmental consequences because these hillslopes have a tendency to lose water nutrients and soil dibiase and whipple 2011 sharma et al 2001 tiwari et al 2010 el kateb et al 2013 demonstrated that the amount of soil erosion and associated nutrient loss is positively related to the slope gradient of cultivated land although previous investigators have highlighted the importance of land cover and slope in governing nutrient loss mainali and chang 2018 shibata et al 2018 suescun et al 2017 little is known of these dynamics as a consequence of long term interactions of land cover slope precipitation agricultural cultivation and other factors at the hillslope scale according to sharpley and tunney 2000 analysis of hillslope nutrient loss and its spatio temporal dynamics has explicit scientific and management significance and can contribute to improved strategies to reduce water pollution current gaps in our understanding of the mediating roles of land cover and slope in nutrient loss nevertheless limit our ability to clearly identify areas of greatest concern and to predict the response of systems to future change nutrient loss pathways can significantly differ across space and time and so monitoring is a primary challenge for assessing overall nutrient loss from agricultural hillslopes van verseveld et al 2009 in many hilly regions ponds are widely distributed in more lowland areas where they provide hydrological connections between upland sources and downstream water bodies chen et al 2019b these ponds can receive and store runoff and nutrients from different pathways including surface subsurface and lateral flows and so they provide inherently excellent records of nutrient loss from drainage uplands yan et al 1998 previous studies have focused extensively on the mitigating roles of ponds in nutrient loss uusheimo et al 2018 pérez gutiérrez et al 2017 but only for relatively short periods such as a rainy season or the duration of several rainfall events sønderup et al 2016 yan et al 1998 few such studies have linked water quality with the terrain and land cover of drainage uplands or taken the long term perspectives warranted by the fact that water quality is determined by these drainage areas chen et al 2019b the hypothesis driving this study is that the dynamics of water quality in ponds can be used as a metric to assess the impacts of land cover changes and the slope gradients of upland drainage sites our main objective was to investigate the linkages between nutrient loss and the slopes and land cover of agricultural hillslopes we do so by examining water quality dynamics in four contrasting lowland ponds fed by runoff from agricultural hillslopes with contrasting topographical features and land covers the ponds and hillslopes are located at the tianmu lake catchment which lies in the taihu lake basin the third largest freshwater lake basin of china the main agricultural crop planted on the hillslopes is tea camellia sinensis which has been extensively cultivated in the entire catchment and other regions in china chao and shou 2001 huang 1989 driven by increasing demand for high yield high margin tea products nearly 7 of the forest in this catchment has been converted into tea plantations in recent years in many cases these plantations are located on very fragile highlands with steep slopes diao et al 2013 and thus represent agricultural development that has caused significant environmental damage li et al 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and agronomic practices the tianmu lake catchment lies on the western edge of the much larger taihu lake basin of china fig 1 this catchment includes two reservoirs shahe and daxi both of which are important drinking water sources and it has a typical hilly topography with elevations ranging from 1 to 531 m above sea level such terrain naturally contains countless ponds see fig 1 four contrasting agricultural pond systems which consist of hillslopes and ponds were selected as research sites average elevations of the four pond systems are similar with a range of 57 88 m the main agricultural crop for all of the hillslopes is tea which is usually associated with intense agronomic management that includes periodic pruning and fertilization arable soil layers of these hillslopes are rather thin generally ranging from 60 to 100 cm and consist primarily of shallow lithosols as defined by fao fao iiasa isric isscas jrc 2012 their textures are silt loam with 70 mean silt content and 20 clay content the content of gravimetric rock fragment is 17 and mean porosity reaches 33 which preferentially allows the infiltration of water and associated pollutants lai et al 2020 zhu et al 2014 according to recent reports of soil properties in this catchment lai et al 2020 mean bulk density soil organic carbon and field capacity is 1 41 g cm 3 0 011 g g 1 0 22 m3 m 3 respectively although moderate spatial variations also exist among different hillslopes bedrock lies beneath the soil and blocks vertical movement downwards thus most of the surface and subsurface water from the hillslopes eventually flows into the lowland ponds the four pond systems designated sites a b c and d differ significantly in land cover slope drainage area and other characteristics as summarized in fig 2 sites a and b are 100 tea but site b contains buffer strips of grass and trees during the period from 2012 to 2018 land use on these three sites remained stable but land cover on site d was disrupted when all of the pine tree forestland was cut in march 2017 and the area subsequently planted with tea agronomic practices for tea production were similar at all sites local farmers usually apply a combination of organic fertilizers manure and chemical fertilizers three times annually before harvest of tea shoots in early march about 7500 kg of organic fertilizers and 225 kg of compound chemical fertilizer are applied per ha as a total containing 180 kg n ha 1 of n and 80 kg p ha 1 of p after pruning of the plants in april and may about 3750 kg of organic fertilizers and 375 kg of compound chemical fertilizer are applied per ha as a total containing 130 kg n ha 1 of n and 55 kg p ha 1 of p winter fertilization in september and october usually consists of 3750 kg of manure and 1875 kg of oilseed residues per ha as a total containing 185 kg n ha 1 of n and 35 kg p ha 1 of p other agronomic practices are not usually employed but if the weather is very dry plants are sometimes irrigated 2 2 field sampling and analytical techniques the meteorological station near sites b and d was chosen for this study because it is also close to other sites 8 km and it has more stable and continuous records of data during 2012 2018 compared with other meteorological stations in this catchment see zhang et al 2019 for their locations monthly indicators used here were derived from hourly meteorological observations and included precipitation in mm pre averaged air temperature in temp the number of days when daily rainfall was greater than 5 mm pre5 the number of rainfall days nop and maximum rainfall intensity in mm h 1 mri water samples from all four sites were obtained at the end of each month during 2012 2018 no samples were lost or missing each sampling site was adjacent to the outlet that connects the pond to downstream water bodies if water was draining samples were drawn from the outflowing water if there was no water discharge three samples were taken from different locations of each pond and blended dissolved oxygen was immediately measured using a ysi 6000 multi probe field meter samples were stored at 2 and transported to the laboratory for some analysis of water quality variation monthly data were grouped to represent three distinct periods defined by a combination of weather and agricultural practices these included a dry period november through february a farming period during which fertilization harvesting and pruning of tea occur march through may and september through october and a rainy period june through august in the laboratory the dissolved fraction was collected via vacuum filtration 8 psi through pre combusted 450 c for 4 h and rinsed 0 7 μm nominal pore size glass fiber filters the filtrate was used for the determination of dissolved forms of nutrients including total dissolved nitrogen tdn nitrate no3 n ammonium ammonia nh4 n nitrite no2 n total dissolved phosphorus tdp and soluble reactive phosphorus srp material on the filters was used for determination of total suspended solids tss raw water samples were used for the determination of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and permanganate index cod all of the above water quality indicators were analyzed following standard protocols mep 2002 note that particulate nitrogen pn was indirectly calculated from the difference between tn and tdn a similar calculation was adopted for particulate phosphorus pp dissolved organic nitrogen don was calculated from the difference between tdn and other dissolved n forms i e no3 n nh4 n no2 n dissolved organic phosphorus dop was calculated from the difference between tdp and srp 2 3 data analysis two statistical features the average and standard deviation of each water quality indicator were calculated one way analysis of variance one way anova tabachnick and fidell 2006 was adopted to assess whether statistically significant differences of water quality existed among the four ponds studied the water quality data were imported into r an open source statistical programming language to test the dca detrended correspondence analysis gradient axis the dca gradient shaft length was less than 3 wollenberg 1977 and therefore redundancy analysis rda was selected for gradient analysis of the relationships of water quality to climate indicators as influenced by land cover and slope rda is useful in condensing the information between two sets of variables and offers advantages in revealing the strength and direction of the correlation between them shen et al 2015 shi et al 2017 before applying rda the normality of the data was examined and log x 1 transformation of data was performed to meet the assumptions of normality wollenberg 1977 data are expressed as rda biplots where arrows of two variables pointing in the same direction indicate a positive correlation and the angle between two arrows is inversely proportional to the degree of their correlation in order to qualitatively analyze temporal variations in water quality we adopted a nonparametric time series decomposition method known as seasonal trend decomposition procedure based on loess stl cleveland and cleveland 1990 this allowed us to resolve trends and seasonality of water quality in each pond the stl approach is useful for describing nonlinear patterns and seasonal interactions that do not have an obvious functional form and it provides a robust statistical estimation of seasonal and trend components buffering the effect of outliers and aberrant data romero et al 2016 this technique has been widely used to analyze the temporal dynamics of water quality time series data cheng et al 2018 romero et al 2016 stow et al 2015 broadly stl applies repeated nonparametric loess fitting to decompose monthly time series data into smoothed trend seasonal and residual components cleveland 1979 shamsudduha et al 2009 the observed monthly time series data can be expressed as 1 y y e a r m o n t h t y e a r m o n t h s y e a r m o n t h r y e a r m o n t h where y y e a r m o n t h is the observed value for a given year and month t y e a r m o n t h is the trend component s y e a r m o n t h is the seasonal component and r y e a r m o n t h is the remainder or residual term qian et al 2000 stl recursive procedures permit the trend component of the water quality time series to be isolated by removing the seasonal and residual components from the time series data wan et al 2017 use of this technique involves two parameters that determine the degree of smoothing in both trend and seasonal components based on recommendations and diagnostic methods in previous studies cleveland and cleveland 1990 romero et al 2016 and given the number and frequency of our pond observations we chose window widths of 6 months and 30 months respectively to visually reveal trends for the seasonal and long term components the smoothing parameters were therefore fixed at these values for all subsequent stl analyses which were performed with r 3 results 3 1 meteorological conditions during the period 2012 2018 annual precipitation ranged from 828 mm yr 1 in 2013 to 2376 mm yr 1 in 2016 fig 3 similarly mri also exhibited significant annual variations ranging from 8 4 mm h 1in 2013 to 14 2 mm h 1 in 2016 both nop and pre5 showed obvious annual variations but pre5 was decreased after 2015 the annual average air temperature varied little with a range of 15 17 c as influenced by the subtropical humid monsoon and shown in fig 3c and d all of the weather variables in the tianmu lake catchment exhibited obvious seasonality i e a hot rainy period june through august and a cold dry period november through february rainfall is highly concentrated during the rainy period when more than 50 of annual precipitation occurs precipitation during this period is recorded for nearly 15 days per month with 6 days experiencing relatively large precipitation pre 5 mm the corresponding monthly averaged mri is 23 mm h 1 which is two and six times of that in the farming and dry periods respectively 3 2 overall water quality comprehensive water quality characteristics of the four ponds over the period from 2012 to 2018 are presented in fig 4 as box and whisker diagrams of scattered points and their corresponding distribution curves between pond variation of two n related indicators tn and no3 n was much greater than that of the p related indicators thus long term averaged tp concentrations varied only from 0 05 to 0 07 mg l 1 but averaged tn concertations varied from 1 8 mg l 1 to 9 7 mg l 1 unexpectedly long term averaged tp content in pond b was slightly lower than that in ponds a and c an observation that may be related to the existence of buffer strips in the former shown in fig 2 concentrations of tn and no3 n the major n pollutants in ponds a b and c are statistically higher than those in pond d p 0 01 this correlates with the presence of tea plants as a major component of land cover at the sites when the land was entirely covered by tea as at sites a and b steeper hillslopes site b usually correlated with a higher concentration of pollutants when half of the land was covered by forest the negative effects of slope gradient could be counteracted i e there was no significant difference in tn and no3 n levels at sites b and c no significant differences in cod were detected among the ponds and other characteristics were similar monthly tn concentrations in all of the ponds are frequently higher than 2 mg l 1 which was in the worst category as defined by the environmental quality standards for surface water in china gb3838 2002 monthly tp concentrations are obviously higher than 0 02 mg l 1 indicating significant risk of algal blooms correll 1998 in aggregate this information confirms that water from these ponds represents a significant pollution source for downstream rivers 3 3 components of n and p loss during the annual cycle management decisions to control pollution in pond systems and downslope areas requires detailed knowledge of the main n and p species that serve as potential pollutants fig 5 summarizes the average components of n and p pollution in the four ponds during different periods i e the dry farming and rainy periods as measured from 2012 to 2018 no3 n was always the predominant form of n in ponds comprising from 75 to 99 of the total small amounts of pn from 4 to 23 of the total were present at all ponds but with the exception of don during the farming season when manure is being applied the levels of other forms of nitrogen such as nh4 n and no2 n were negligible overall n concentrations exhibited seasonal variation across the three periods tending to be higher in the dry season and lower in the rainy season the main forms of p in all ponds were dop and pp high dissolved forms of p srp drp were expected since local soil porosity is high 33 lai et al 2020 which allows more dissolved p leaching with subsurface flows relatively high levels of pp were also observed highlighting that soil erosion could be a significant source of p arriving in the ponds although p concentrations were generally high during the farming period when agronomic practices would be expected to contribute to p loss from fields to ponds high p levels were also evident during the dry and rainy periods this is because strong rainfall erosion as represented by high mri and more frequent rainfall events shown in fig 3 usually exacerbates soil erosion and enhances p leaching during the rainy period however during the dry period although rainfall erosion becomes fairly weak high accumulation of erodible p enriched particulates in soils as a result of the intensive winter fertilization can greatly increase pp levels in ponds highest pp contents were observed in the dry period among ponds underscoring that p loss as a result of the winter fertilization could be a significant factor 3 4 relationships between pond water quality and environmental variables the topographic and land cover conditions of hillslopes are important mediating factors of pond water quality because they strongly influence the generation transport and retention of nutrients we consequently subjected each pond to rda analysis to assess the responses of pond water quality to weather conditions as influenced by contrasting slope gradients and land cover as shown in fig 6 most of the water quality indicators are closely related to monthly precipitation and temperature for example tn and no3 n are always negatively related to monthly air temperature temp as indicated by the angles among the arrows across ponds shown in fig 6 this suggests that their concentrations tended to be low in the warm period when vegetative growth and denitrification are active precipitation related indicators such as pre5 were positively related to tn this kind of relationship is apparent for all ponds most prominently for pond a suggesting that n loss from the gentle hillslope was likely driven by relatively high precipitation events in contrast the number of rainfall days nop is more closely related to the tn and no3 n concentration in pond b indicating that the frequency of rainfall events is an important controlling factor for n loss from the pond drained by a steeper hillslope notably precipitation related factors exhibit weak linkages to n related indicators in pond c implying that there are other non weather factors that can mediate the rainfall runoff processes one such factor may be the high coverage of forestland on the hillslope which would be expected to buffer precipitation and runoff and trap pollutants a similar pattern is also observable in pond d further emphasizing the importance of forestland in intercepting precipitation and buffering nutrient loss as with n p concentrations in ponds are also influenced by precipitation in both pond a and pond b monthly maximum rainfall intensity mri was most closely linked to p related indicators this demonstrates that p loss is mainly associated with strong rainfall events especially at sites devoted to tea the relationship is not apparent at the other sites which contain significant amounts of forested land it is also noteworthy that precipitation and pre5 are negatively related to pp and tp concentrations in pond c and d which are drained by hillslopes with buffer strips or well coverage of forestland this indicates that high precipitation may dilute the p contents in these ponds this is possible because high coverage of forests can significantly reduce soil off site movement and increase the interceptions of p enriched particulates 3 5 temporal trends the stl procedure decomposes time series data into seasonal and annual components we subjected tn and tp data from each pond to such analysis and show the seasonal and annual components as well as the original time series data in fig 7 the annual trends for tn in pond a and pond c are similar especially after 2015 which is highly consistent with the trend of pre5 shown in fig 3 this indicates that the decrease in the frequency of relatively large rainfall events actually reduces the chances of runoff generation and associated n off site movement the deep trough and inflection point in pond b creates a much different tn trend as does the relatively flat line for pond d that rises rapidly coincident with removal of the forest in 2017 fig 7 shaded area the overall annual tp trend lines resemble one another in that they decline during the early sampling years and increase thereafter in pond b the parallel deep trough and inflection point were also observed for tp indicating that the buffer strips have been over saturated with nutrients in the year around 2015 and released more nutrients thereafter in the case of ponds a and c the increase is interrupted with an inflection point and modest declines thereafter an observation consistent with the trends of precipitation and nop see fig 3 the annual tp trend for pond d is unique because annualized tp concentrations decline over the course of the sampling period but then rise fig 7 shaded area coincident with removal of trees from the site tn concentrations in pond d increased rapidly from 2 mg l 1 to 10 mg l 1 during the 1 5 years following land cover changes but tp concentrations did not rise similarly this implies that ponds have a stronger ability in trapping sediment and associated p the stl analysis also provides insight into the seasonal fluctuations of tn and tp in each pond fig 7 major differences in the seasonality of tn and tp are apparent tn peaks generally occurred during march to may coincident with agricultural cultivation periods low tn generally occurred in the summer time in contrast tp peaks were usually evident in the early rainy season june and july when canopy cover in tea plantations has been reduced as a result of pruning high concentrations of tn and tp were also observed in february when the temperature is low and freezing and thawing are likely 4 discussion 4 1 influence of weather conditions there is a growing body of research recognizing the important impact of weather in the form of precipitation and temperature on nutrient loss ramos and martínezcasasnovas 2010 suescun et al 2017 zheng et al 2016 in the tianmu lake catchment precipitation is highly variable from year to year the annual average for the period 2012 2018 was 1150 mm and around 50 of annual precipitation is concentrated during the june august period fig 3 frequent rainfall events 10 days per month with variable rainfall intensity can greatly influence the off site movement of nutrients via surface or subsurface runoff increasing nutrient loads arriving in ponds little et al 2005 liu et al 2014 characterized by a subtropical humid monsoon climate the mean annual temperature in this area is 16 18 c with significant seasonality during the warm months suitable temperatures can favor a variety of forms of biotic and abiotic processing of nutrients including denitrification soil microbial activity and associated rates of n and p mineralization tan et al 2018 however during the cold winter the biotic processes would be inhibited resulting in net accumulations of nutrients in ponds importantly occasional freezing thawing processes as a result of temperature change can destroy plant cells and soil structure which in turn can promote nutrient loss bechmann et al 2005 although such freezing thawing effects are usually most prominent in the cold regions jian et al 2014 matzner and borken 2008 the periodic peaks of p concentrations observed in february when the temperature frequently fluctuated around the melting point suggested that the effects could be significant in our research area tp loss from cultivated land seems to be more sensitive to precipitation and maximum rainfall intensity short duration rainstorms characterized by high rainfall intensity see fig 3 were common and likely facilitate p loss via enhanced soil erosion trend analysis as shown in fig 7 demonstrates that tp annual dynamics across ponds generally corresponds to annual changes in rainfall these results are consistent with previous evidence zhang et al 2011 that hillslope tp loss can be exacerbated by significant rainfall events temperature is a much more influential factor for n because it can promote and inhibit various processes related to transformation and removal of this element huang et al 2013 our rda results confirm that tn and no3 n in all ponds are always negatively related to air temperature the influence of precipitation on tn in ponds is much more complicated because rainfall can trigger complex biogeochemical processes for example although rainfall can drive n loss rainfall can also enhance biogeochemical removal of n in ponds e g through creating an anaerobic environment suitable for denitrification herrman et al 2008 or increasing the chances of n processing in the microbial active zones such as hyporheic and riparian zones etc harvey et al 2013 the weak tn peak of annual trends in wet 2016 is evidence of this bachmair et al 2012 comparison of the four contrasting sites in our study each with a different slope gradient and land cover characteristics confirms that the influence of weather indicators on water quality can be highly varied even in a relatively small spatial context see fig 6 pond specific relationships between weather indicators and nutrient levels provide evidence that cultivating more ecologically fragile land can enhance the responses of nutrient loss to climate conditions leading to more prominent nutrient loss however this study only focused on the linkages between weather indicators and pond water quality ignoring the complicated processes on or below the hillslopes more refined monitoring that tracks nutrient loss during the successive processes of precipitation runoff infiltration on the hillslopes could more precisely determine the functions of pond and role of weather conditions as mediated by slope gradient and land cover 4 2 influence of slope and land cover obviously higher concentrations of tn in ponds b and c in comparison to pond a indicate that steep hillslopes promote more n loss than gentler slopes fig 4 actually slope gradients of the hill to valley convergence can directly or indirectly determine total water yields flow pathways either surface and subsurface and the speed of runoff chen et al 2019a in this context steep hillslopes can have a stronger propensity to form runoff that elevates soil erosion and n extraction van verseveld et al 2009 the significance of the slope gradient in governing n loss has also been well documented by previous studies el kateb et al 2013 van verseveld et al 2009 in contrast to levels of tn levels of tp and tss in pond a were significantly greater than those in pond b which had a similar cover but a much higher average slope site b contains buffer strips of grass and trees and it is likely that their presence reduced p loss because buffer strips are known to have strong abilities to reduce soil erosion and p loads dorioz et al 2006 yang et al 2009 although buffer strips are capable of trapping particles and dissolved pollutants nutrients can be flushed through them and into the ponds when rainfall is significant the relatively higher tp concentrations observed in pond b during the rainy period shown fig 5 is evidence for such limitations of buffer strips comparison of pond b to pond c provides evidence that many water quality indicators are not statistically different even when the slopes of drainage areas diverge significantly half of site c is forested and this factor likely offsets the negative influence of tea production site d provides additional convincing evidence of the importance of forestland in preventing nutrient loss removal of trees from this site in 2017 triggered a surge in tn concentrations with associated increases of tp that were less dramatic short term dynamics not revealed by monthly monitoring may have obscured rapid trapping of sediments and associated p conditioned by deforestation boyd et al 1998 high frequency sampling or event based rainfall runoff monitoring will be necessary to clarify this point previous findings have highlighted the crucial roles of vegetation in soil and water conservation pan and shangguan 2006 zhang et al 2011 and forestland is considered to be the most appropriate land use form on steep slopes because it substantially reduces soil erosion and nutrient loss carroll et al 2000 el kateb et al 2013 once vegetation coverage is removed however negative consequences become apparent papanicolaou et al 2018 e g hydrograph peaks can be elevated by up to 133 sharpley and moyer 2000 in parallel seasonal vegetation cover changes as a result of agricultural cultivation can also lead to significant environmental concerns tea plants can provide significant canopy cover but just before the rainy season local farmers usually prune the plants to force new growth and obtain better yields for the next year this practice can abruptly reduce vegetation coverage from 70 to 30 resulting in a large area of exposed land subject to erosion nie et al 2013 this elevates the risk of p pollution as observed from significantly higher tp concentrations during the farming period see fig 5 anything that can be done to retain cover during this period including covering soil with crop residues or piling up of stones would be useful in preventing p loss 4 3 implications for pollution management ponds perform an important ecological function by hydrologically linking uplands with the downstream river network yan et al 1998 they can be sinks for inflowing nutrients because of their strong abilities in nutrient removal interception and also can be sources of pollution of downstream rivers if their water quality is poor chen et al 2019b minimization of negative downstream effects requires careful management of the ponds and their drainage areas we believe that this should focus on two factors control of agricultural expansion and when agriculture is present integrated strategies to minimize nutrient loss controlling the expansion of agricultural land especially that for tea plantations is of great urgency near tianmu lake where land use conversion to tea is proceeding rapidly over short periods of time diao et al 2013 our observation of rapidly deteriorating water quality in pond d after tree cutting to prepare lands for tea is a stark reminder of the negative effects of such expansion li et al 2013 nie et al 2013 the relatively poor water quality in ponds b and c is also a reminder that steep land must be carefully managed to avoid undesirable environmental effects sivertun and prange 2003 approvals for agricultural expansion near tianmu lake should take factors such as slope gradient land cover and distance to important water bodies into account deterministic and risk assessment modeling tools are available to guide this process e g li et al 2015 schwarz et al 2011 su et al 2016 best management plans can also be drawn up so that capital resources can be allocated efficiently sivertun and prange 2003 some legislation including reservoir management regulations and imposition of ecological red lines has already been put in place to prohibit agricultural development in sensitive areas lü et al 2013 yun lin et al 2003 but additional controls are needed integrated management of agricultural production to minimize nutrient runoff should include measures to control the source of nutrients and intercept their delivery from hillslopes local farmers usually apply excessively high amounts of fertilizer to assure good quality and high yields of tea excessive accumulation of nutrients in the tea hillslopes significantly exacerbates their loss risk van meter et al 2016 fertilizer use efficiency must be improved via methods such as recycling of crop residues and adoption of precision fertilization sun et al 2012 loss of cover due to trimming of tea plants just prior of the rainy season can be offset by application of straw agronomic measures including contour cultivation conservation tillage and piling up of stones have already been adopted by some large farms to slow movement of water and nutrients from tea plantations the establishment of buffer strips is a particularly good option to intercept nutrient transfer provided that these barriers are appropriately placed on important pathways of runoff movement such as low lying areas of hillslopes these areas are usually outflow places of lateral surface and subsurface recharge and so they not only facilitate soil erosion and surface flow but they also tend to be hot spots for biogeochemical processes zhu et al 2014 buffer strips are most valuable when located at lower positions along slopes liu et al 2013 when optimally positioned they can remove approximately 80 of total p loads dorioz et al 2006 vegetation type the size of the buffer in relation to site hydrological conditions and how it is managed are all important considerations roberts et al 2012 but as dorioz et al 2006 pointed out the long term influence of buffer strips should be carefully considered since they can also release the temporarily stored nutrients pond management becomes an important method to restrict nutrient transport and promote retention of nutrients that would otherwise migrate into downstream waterways chen et al 2019b fu et al 2018 the sharp reduction in velocity of flow as surface runoff enters ponds allows deposition of the suspended sediment load and increased opportunity for soluble n and p to be absorbed by the soil and taken up by vegetation withers and jarvis 1998 rainfall runoff field monitoring of tea hillslopes near tianmu lake revealed that tn content in surface flow is 11 25 mg l 1 and in the subsurface flow is 27 16 mg l 1 nie et al 2013 given that the average tn concentration in ponds a and b is 8 8 mg l 1 this implies that roughly 32 78 of n loads were removed these values are within reported ranges of n removal rates in ponds e g reinhardt et al 2006 yan et al 1998 however relatively high do contents and relatively low availability of carbon sources as represented by relative low cod levels see fig 4 may suggest that the denitrification n removal in ponds could be highly inhibited this indicates that n removal in ponds can be improved by increasing external carbon sources or in other ways enhancing oxygen depletion there is very limited information on p loss from hillslopes near tianmu lake but studies from elsewhere suggest that event average concentration of tp loss is about 0 5 mg l 1 wang et al 2012 this information indicates that pond p retention is generally around 88 given the averaged tp contents 0 06 mg l 1 in the ponds of our study area this is consistent with the results of yan et al 1998 who demonstrated that ponds can retain as much as 95 of tp loads however this result should be interpreted with caution because ponds which both receive hillslope runoff and drain water downstream can only partly account for p retention irrespective of this fact the retention efficiency of ponds also depends on water storage capacity the growth of aquatic vegetation and irrigation amounts chen et al 2019b appropriate pond management and maintenance should be considered to avoid problems of internal loading filling and resuspension sønderup et al 2016 5 conclusions relatively high nutrient concentrations are usually present in ponds drained by hillslopes with higher percentages of agricultural land cover and or very steep average slopes indicating that pollution of water with n and p can be significantly exacerbated when tea cultivation extends to these areas this conclusion is strengthened by the observation of increased nutrient runoff following conversion of site d from forest to a tea plantation more than 75 of n in the ponds consisted of no3 n implying that subsurface flow could be the main loss pathway of n tn is also a more sensitive indicator of land cover change than tp showing an increase by a factor of five once the vegetation cover was removed in contrast particulate and dissolved organic forms of p predominated suggesting that prevention of soil erosion should control p loss relatively high amounts of both nutrients left fields during the farming season and so agronomic practices are a logical target for control of n and p pollution influences of weather indicators on water quality can be mediated by land cover and gradient slopes of agricultural uplands on gentle hillslopes significant precipitation e g 5 mm is the main influential factor for n loss but as the slope gradient increases the frequency of rainfall events becomes the major controlling factor implying that n loss from steep hillslopes can be sensitive to even small rainfall events significant p loss was always associated with storm rainfall events and was strongly mediated by forest coverage which again focuses attention on forest removal for agriculture these results point to the fact that cultivation of more ecologically fragile land can enhance the responses of nutrient loss to weather conditions especially in regions with a humid climate through the above analysis a more detailed perspective has been obtained on the effects of land cover changes and cultivation of steep hillslopes on nutrient loss integrated agricultural management including controlling land exploitation

10597,analysis of drought on rain fed maize production in the luvuvhu river catchment was measured using the water requirement satisfaction index wrsi computation of wrsi was performed using a crop water balance model in instat software for a 120 day maturing maize crop using nine different planting dekads from october to december this study made use of seven weather stations which adequately represent climatic and geographical environments of the catchment containing historical rainfall and temperature data from 1974 to 2015 the non parametric spearman s rank correlation test was conducted to determine drought trends thereafter probabilities and extreme widespread dry and wet agricultural seasons were analysed using statistica software results revealed that since the 1980s the catchment had been subjected to frequent drought conditions with an average frequency of once every two to three seasons extreme drought episodes wrsi 50 were commonly identified in the northern drier parts of the catchment as compared to the high rainfall region whereby 50 93 of the analysed seasons were subjected to extreme drought conditions furthermore there were no drought trends ρ values close to 0 during the analysed climate period water requirements satisfaction index wrsi values corresponding to more intense drought conditions were reflected during the december planting date for all stations moreover at the low rainfall region it was seen that extreme droughts occurred once in five seasons regardless of the planting date thus the study led to a recommendation of using october november as the optimum planting date in the catchment furthermore farmers located areas with high probabilities of drought during critical stages can be advised to supplement rain fed farming with irrigation should they be located nearby to rivers keywords agricultural season crop performance planting dekad rainfall region 1 introduction 1 1 background drought occurs in many parts of the world even in different climate regions characterized by high or low rainfall mniki 2009 this is mainly due to drought being described as a prolonged rainfall deficiency relative to a region s long term average dai 2011 thus unlike aridity or desertification where low rainfall is a permanent feature of a specific region drought is merely a temporary phenomenon das 2012 in south africa drought is a common feature of climate and its extensive effects are generally felt throughout all sectors of society vogel et al 2000 agriculture is typically the first sector to feel the effects of drought as it primarily depends on precipitation for crop growth and production vogel et al 2000 woli 2010 other types of drought do exist viz hydrological which is associated with lack of surface and subsurface water commonly noticeable after six to 12 months and socio economic which emanates when any or a combination of the other three physical types begin to affect the economy or society at large wilhite and glantz 1987 at large drought has many characteristics and one eminent feature of this phenomenon is that it starts gradually and intensifies with time thus making it difficult to pinpoint until the impacts are visible hayes et al 2004 according to rouault and richard 2005 drought impacts become evident in agriculture when precipitation deficiency start to cause damage on crops during a short time scale i e season however a recent study by malherbe et al 2016 specified that agricultural drought could only be apparent following three to 12 months of meteorological drought the latter can be quantified by rainfall anomalies over a specific area vicente serrano et al 2010 moreover rainfall deficiencies together with high temperatures strong winds high evapotranspiration rates and soil water deficits are often associated with drought in many regions of the world and can significantly aggravate the severity of the event wilhite and svoboda 2000 when considering maize zea mays l production can occur under diverse environments due to the fact that the crop responds well to warm temperatures and a significant amount of water du plessis 2003d however for attaining optimum productivity adequate water is required throughout the physiological development emergence to maturity of a maize crop as the yield of which is sensitive to the occurrence of drought moeletsi and walker 2012 wetterhall et al 2014 drought could affect the rate of germination and emergence development of root leaf and stem flowering pollination grain filling as well as the quality of the grains depending on when it occurs prasad et al 2008 in addition khalili et al 2013 stated that the severity of drought damage on crops depends on stress duration intensity crop growth stage and on the different responses of the various crop variety and soils to water stress consequently the ability and extent of crops to withstand drought stress vary with crop variety climate and soil type of a given area akıncı and lösel 2012 lisar et al 2012 thus increasing recurrences of extreme weather events such as extreme temperatures and severe droughts pose a serious threat to the country s natural resources and socio economic development cop17 2011 although drought events in any given area are considered unique in their characteristics and effects frequent occurrences could cause serious implications on small scale farmers in the luvuvhu river catchment area fig 1 where maize production serves as a primary staple food and plays a crucial role in job creation national treasury 2015 the population in the catchment has been estimated to be increasing swiftly exerting pressure on existing natural resources wrc 2001 this has attributed to the change in land cover since 1978 during which forests and shrubs were cleared in order to provide fuel wood pasture and maize fields jewitt et al 2004 1 2 literature review drought stress on maize is primarily caused by a deficiency of water in the root zone as well as increased evapotranspiration rates particularly referred to as an imbalance between crop water requirements and the amount a rainfall received during the growing season sun 2009 lisar et al 2012 crop water requirements can be explained as the amount of water needed for optimal growth and development fao 1986 in south africa maize water requirements are estimated at between 450 mm and 600 mm depending on the local environment du plessis 2003d under rain fed conditions which is the most common practice in south african smallholder cropping systems crops can be susceptible to mild extreme drought conditions due to the variability of rainfall daff 2012 bouagila and sushama 2013 researchers are thus faced with the necessity to study aspects of climate variability and change on agriculture in order to identify the challenges encountered by farmers different studies have analyzed rainfall and temperature patterns independently in the northern regions of limpopo province whereby findings reported significant decreases in annual precipitation as well as strong warming trends during periods 1910 2004 and 1960 2003 for rainfall and temperature respectively kruger and shongwe 2004 kruger 2006b other papers have analysed the dynamics of temperature and climate variability for investigating the climatology of droughts over various regions in the country edossa et al 2014 ujeneza 2014 botai et al 2016 malherbe et al 2016 one of the most commonly used indices for drought monitoring is the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi developed by rouse et al 1974 this index is based on remote sensing data and monitors vegetation reflectance in the invisible and infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum however the index is not crop specific and thus it accounts for the entire vegetated area other meteorological indices that also find more applications in many studies include dry spells assessments mathugama and peiris 2011 masupha et al 2016 standardized precipitation index sonmez et al 2005 dlamini 2013 and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index potop et al 2012 vicente serrano et al 2015 yet these indices are solely based on meteorological factors and do not take into account soil water and crop factors in their calculations the present study focused on utilizing the water requirement satisfaction index wrsi developed by frere and popov 1979 for calculating potential drought stress to the crop as most indices are limited to only using meteorological data the wrsi was selected as a suitable index due to its maximal applicability in regions with high rainfall variability santos et al 2012 applied this index for determining drought risk in integrated crop livestock systems in brazil whilst most research findings have highlighted the importance of using the wrsi as a crop forecasting tool for maize growing regions across the world including in southern africa martin et al 2000 rafi and ahmad 2005 jayasree et al 2008 senay 2008 jayanthi and husak 2013 other papers utilized future climate simulations in order to determine the impact of climate change on the performance of maize in the country hachigonta 2011 crespo et al 2011 masupha and moeletsi 2018 a common message emerging from these studies is that wrsi is based on soil water availability to the crop throughout the growing period and it can be used as a representation of crop performance using both historical data and future predictions nevertheless in a region of strong rainfall variability as the luvuvhu river catchment a few studies on the influence of intra and inter annual climate variability on determining drought risk for different planting dates have been published in fact it could be said that the risk of drought occurrences is driven regionally by rainfall variability which would further explain the temporal patterns during the maize growing season a comparable paper by moeletsi and walker 2012 applied the wrsi in the free state province of south africa and provided evidence on the interactions between weather soil crop factors for determining drought risk on maize per dekad during the growing period however this study focused only on the central region of the country with contrasting agro climatic zones this paper proposes to extend the existing method by analyzing the temporal response of agricultural droughts to precipitation deficits taking into account the different climatic and geographic environments from mountainous region in the south west to the driest and sparsely populated north eastern regions this method took into consideration drought risk prior to planting and during the development of the crop per dekad in order to inform optimal planting dates with reference to producing maize furthermore it will assist decision makers in making timely informed decisions on how to reduce the accompanying drought impacts in the luvuvhu river catchment the objectives of the study were 1 to investigate how agricultural drought has evolved in the area and 2 to assess the possible drought effects on the production of maize relative to different planting dates 2 data and methods 2 1 data the geographical location altitude time periods and soil water holding capacity swhc of the seven weather stations at the study area are given in table 1 climatological data rainfall and temperature and soil water holding capacity swhc data were obtained from the agricultural research council arc 2016 for assuring data quality climate data was inspected and the arc stand alone patching tool which applies the inverse distance weighting idw and the multiple linear regression mlr methods using neighbouring stations was used to fill missing values shabalala and moeletsi 2015 moeletsi et al 2016 reference evapotranspiration was calculated using the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 which employs geographical location and air temperature for estimation daily data were then aggregated into dekads i e a sum of 10 day values resulting in three values per month 1st dekad day 1 10 2nd dekad day 11 20 and 3rd dekad day 21 31 2 2 quantification of agricultural drought a crop water balance model in instat software was used to generate the water requirement satisfaction index wrsi this index was formulated using dekadal climatological data soil water holding capacity and crop coefficients as inputs the use of soil water holding capacity swhc determines the amount of potential stored soil water while crop coefficient kc values are used as adjustment factors for the crop water requirement per growth stage martin et al 2000 for the current study kc values were based on the four maize growth stages initial development mid season stage and late season considering maize crop life cycle of 120 days which is equivalent to 12 dekads calculations for crop coefficients were done using the single kc approach developed by allen et al 1998 in the fao 56 paper in which values for initial and late season were obtained and thereafter intermediate values were linearly interpolated to obtain the kc values for the development and mid season stages based on the area s climatic conditions normally kc values start at a minimum during the initial stage and increase during the development and mid season stages then reduce as the crop start to require less water in the late season stage the calculated values were then used to construct the kc curve as shown in fig 2 the water requirement satisfaction index wrsi for a season was calculated as a proportion of actual evapotranspiration a e t to the crop water requirement w r expressed by senay and verdin 2002 1 w r s i a e t w r 100 the crop water requirement w r was obtained by multiplying reference evapotranspiration et0 by the crop coefficient kc given by allen et al 1998 2 w r e t 0 k c after determining the crop water requirements w r the a e t representing the actual amount of water lost from the soil water reservoir was estimated using the soil water balance method incorporated within the model in order to determine a e t for the maize crop dekadal rainfall p p t was added to the soil water content to produce a plant available water p a w value 3 p a w i s w i 1 p p t where s w i 1 soil water content at the end of the previous i th time interval mm dekad depending on the p a w in the soil reservoir the value of aet was estimated using the following equations senay and verdin 2002 4 a e t w r w h e n p a w s w c 5 a e t w r s w c p a w w h e n p a w s w c 6 a e t p a w w h e n a e t p a w where w r crop water requirement s w c critical soil water level in the soil reservoir water requirement satisfaction index is recorded after each consecutive dekad and cumulative water stress experienced by the crop throughout the growing period is then given at the end of the growing season fao 1986 the index starts with a value of 100 and a reduction occurs as the crop undergoes water stress in a form of water deficit and if the water surplus is greater than 100 mm allen et al 1998 therefore as illustrated in table 2 a wrsi value 80 specifies a drought episode and a decrement in the index indicates an increase in the severity of drought with a wrsi value of less than 50 indicating total crop failure the crop water balance model in instat software was run for nine planting dekads using the first dekad of october oct dek1 to the last dekad of december dec dek3 as the starting period these dates were selected based on the mean start of the rainy season given by masupha et al 2016 dekadal wrsi values were then obtained and drought severity was interpreted according to the classification in table 2 2 3 statistical analysis for trend detection and probabilities historical time series of drought and its possible effects on maize were assessed and trends were analysed using the non parametric spearman s rank correlation test conducted at α significance level of 0 05 in statistica software this test is based on the coefficient ρ ranging from 1 to 1 where a negative value implies a decreasing trend while positive values represent an increase gitau 2011 gives the method of calculating the coefficient ρ to determine the trend 7 ρ 6 i 1 n d i n n 2 1 2 where d i difference between each rank of corresponding values of x and y n number of data pairs to investigate crop performance in relation to drought occurrence during each growing season probabilities of wrsi following the nine planting dekads were analysed and plotted for each station using statistica software based on the wrsi series it was determined that the normal and johnson sb distributions table 3 generated the best fitting curves for the different stations randomly the johnson sb distribution is related to the normal distribution and in this regard it was applied to transform data points that did not follow a standard normal curve dell inc 2015 these distributions were selected from over 23 different types of probability distributions according to the anderson darling goodness of fit test at α 0 05 significance level 2 4 evaluation of extreme widespread dry and wet agricultural seasons notable agricultural seasons subjected to extreme widespread drought given by wrsi values corresponding to extreme drought 50 were evaluated to measure the degree to which the water requirement of the crop had been satisfied during each stage of the growing season three stations representing the different rainfall regions in the catchment viz lwamondo high tshiombo moderate and sigonde low were selected and analysis was conducted using december results as this was identified as the period in which the drought was more intense compared to other planting dekads the seasons in which there was no drought wet seasons and whereby there was mild to moderate drought at low rainfall regions due to high risk of recurrent drought occurrence were also evaluated to inspect the intra seasonal variability of rainfall throughout the growing season 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal evolution of agricultural drought and trends based on wrsi the temporal patterns of wrsi fig 3 5 revealed that the catchment encountered notable drought conditions at different severity levels during the analysed agricultural seasons table 5 shows the number of seasons in which the maize crop had been subjected to the different drought severities according to these results wrsi values corresponding to mild and moderate droughts proved to be more frequent at levubu lwamondo thohoyandou and tshiombo this was commonly observed once every two to three seasons meanwhile at punda maria sigonde and pafuri it was noted that extreme drought conditions were most frequent giving a range of 15 30 seasons of the 30 32 analysed seasons there have also been notable widespread extreme droughts in the past viz 1983 84 1988 89 1991 92 1993 94 2001 02 2002 03 2004 05 and 2014 15 these historical droughts were recorded at all stations except levubu where the drought was observed to be less intense previous findings recorded by lda 2011 stated the 1991 92 drought as being the most severe across the whole country moreover a report conducted by pretorius and smal 1992 indicated estimates of a decline in the gross value added by the agricultural sector based on summer crop estimates for 1991 92 as compared to previous agricultural seasons austin 2008 reported that in 2001 maize prices had dramatically increased within 5 months in the season this increase could have been due to different influential factors such as the foreign exchange maize world price and the accessibility of maize by other southern african countries chabane 2002 by 2002 the average farming output of the country was recorded to have decreased by 75 of the previous output resulting in economic losses fao 2004 planting in december resulted in more seasons being exposed to the occurrence of extreme droughts as compared to planting in october and november this is evident for all stations analysed the least potential risk of crop damage was observed at levubu with no occurrences of extreme droughts wrsi 50 following planting during the 1st dekad of october to the 3rd dekad of november december planting dekads revealed three extreme drought events during the 3rd dekad of december it was also observed at this station that only two cases of severe drought were observed relative to planting in october and november followed by three to six cases should planting occur in december this implies that late planting could increase the risk of possible total crop failure in the region another evident observation is that at punda maria sigonde and pafuri extreme drought episodes wrsi 50 were generally predominant in these regions during the growing period irrespective of the different planting dekads moreover according to table 4 the highest number of seasons subjected to extreme drought were observed following planting during the 2nd and 3rd dekad of december at sigonde and pafuri this implies a high risk of total crop failure making the upper regions of the catchment unsuitable for rain fed maize production water requirement satisfaction index trends provided by the spearman s rank correlation test table 5 did not show any significant increase or decrease this implies that although the luvuvhu river catchment has experienced several drought events in the past the area has not become drier since the 1980s earlier findings have reported significant decreases in annual precipitation as well as a strong warming trend in the northern parts of limpopo province kruger 2006a however these studies were carried out over long periods 1910 2004 for rainfall and 1960 2003 for temperature over the whole province contrary to these findings weak increasing trends were noted at lwamondo following planting in december whereas at thohoyandou the trend ρ values of 0 5 was observed following planting in the 1st dekad of october this increase in wrsi suggests that there has been a gradual decrease in drought severity following the respective planting dekads implying improved precipitation patterns at those regions 3 2 probabilities of wrsi during the growing season of maize the wrsi probability plots showing proneness to drought relative to planting in october november and december are presented in fig 6 8 at the 20th percentile mark results show that mild conditions wrsi 70 79 can be expected at levubu following october and november planting dekads while december planting reflected wrsi values corresponding to moderate to severe droughts at lwamomdo and tshiombo probabilities of severe droughts wrsi 60 were observed relative to planting during the 2nd dekad of october to the 1st dekad of november with the drought intensifying to extreme conditions wrsi 50 in december moreover at thohoyandou the least risk can be expected during the 1st dekad of october while at punda maria sigonde and pafuri extreme droughts can be expected once in five seasons regardless of the planting dekad when observing the 50 probability of non exceedance it was evident that at levubu wrsi reflected values of 80 during all planting dekads this implies that once in two seasons the farmers in this region can expect no drought conditions resulting in good crop performance at lwamondo it can be seen that planting in the 1st dekad of october could result in severe drought wrsi 50 59 while the risk may possibly be reduced if planting occurs during the 3rd dekad of october to the 3rd dekad of december with wrsi values ranging from 70 79 during this period at tshiombo and thohoyandou planting during the 1 st dekad and 2nd 3rd dekad of december respectively gave a risk of severe droughts while planting in october to november could result in better crop produce at both stations similar to the 20th percentile it can also be seen at the 50th percentile with a return period of once every two seasons that punda maria sigonde and pafuri can expect to receive extreme drought conditions following all planting dekads this implies an imbalance between the distribution of rainy days and the amount of rainfall throughout the season with respect to water requirements of the maize crop yengoh et al 2010 at 80 probability of non exceedance conditions of no drought can be expected at levubu and lwamondo following all planting dekads similar patterns can be observed at thohoyandou and tshiombo although cases of mild drought were observed following planting in december this shows that the risk of experiencing drought every season at these regions is very low conversely given the same return period drought conditions can be expected at stations that are located in the upper catchment punda maria sigonde and pafuri at punda maria planting in the 1st dekad of october to the 1st dekad of december could result in mild to moderate drought while planting later 2nd dekad onwards in december suggests probabilities of severe droughts wrsi 60 results further indicated that delay in planting at sigonde and pafuri could place the maize crop at higher risk of total crop failure as compared to the other planting dekads these results indicate that the optimal planting date for rain fed maize crop in the luvuvhu river catchment area is during october to november with wrsi values relative to more intense drought conditions reflected during the december planting dekads for all stations although early planting can be advised it is important to note that at thohoyandou planting too early 1st dekad of october might place crops grown in this area under drought stress this indicates that there is a risk that water requirements of the crop will not be fully met during critical periods of the growing season following this planting dekad 3 3 observed extreme widespread dry and wet agricultural seasons the widespread drought events and wet seasons were evaluated to measure the satisfaction of the water requirement to the crop during each stage of the growing season it appears fig 9 11 that the drought conditions were due to a deficit of water starting from the 5th dekad to the 12th dekad of the growing period this means that the rainfall experienced during that period did not meet the crop water requirements and therefore crops did not get sufficient water during the most critical stages 7th 9th dekad thus explaining the decline of wrsi line this is consistent with literature as it has been shown that the maize crop is unable to resume growth and development after a severe drought at tasselling to silking stage whitmore 2000 another interesting finding is that at sigonde the extreme drought of 1991 92 was caused by lack of water throughout the growing season with only four dekads receiving rainfall of less than 10 mm per dekad the resulting wrsi value for that season was zero in 1993 94 it is interesting to note that despite the good start to the season with fairly good rainfall occurring during the 1st 4th dekad conditions at the end of the season resulted in wrsi values of 50 this is owing to the fact that the water in the soil had not yet recovered from the previous drought 1991 92 thus the rainfall was not sufficient for proper growth and development a similar study has shown that the 1991 92 drought effects worsened until the end of 1993 correspondingly affecting the hydrological water supply trambauer et al 2014 this prolonged drought was widely experienced throughout the country as well as in other parts of southern africa including botswana zimbabwe and mozambique causing widespread crop failure and livestock mortalities fao 2004 after the year 2000 the area experienced extreme drought for two consecutive seasons 2001 02 and 2002 03 and again during 2004 05 at lwamondo and sigonde thereafter the area was then struck by extreme drought again after a decade 2014 15 at the moderate and low rainfall regions on further analysis results showed extreme wet seasons as being 1987 88 1999 00 2003 04 and 2013 14 fig 8 shows that during the course of these seasons rainfall was equal and or more than the corresponding water requirements for considerable number of dekads including the critical stage of the crop it was further noted that for some dekads the index was reduced despite the high rainfall amounts that were received this is because according to allen et al 1998 the index is not only reduced when the crop experiences water stress but also when the water surplus is 100 mm however the wrsi value at the end of these seasons reflected good crop performance at the high and moderate rainfall regions and average crop performance at the low rainfall regions the total crop failure during the dry seasons could be explained by the lack of rainfall during the growing season at the low rainfall regions as well as during the sensitive stages at the high and moderate rainfall regions the intra seasonal variability of rainfall resulted in deficient uptake of the required water by crops due to a reduction in moisture around the roots das 2012 however during the wet seasons it was observed that the rainfall was fairly distributed thus resulting in wrsi values corresponding to good crop performance implying satisfactory yields 4 conclusions this study provided information that agricultural decisions can be made better by computing probabilities of drought occurrence relating to crop performance following various planting dates the timing of drought also highlighted that although farmers would rather want a fair distribution of rainfall throughout the season in reality this not ideal thus the necessity of assessing drought relative to the different stages of the crops therefore to lessen the potential effects of drought on a maize crop planting in october to november can be recommended at high moderate rainfall regions while for farmers located near punda maria sigonde and pafuri low rainfall planting in november could be beneficial consequently effective water management practices could be adopted for local rain fed maize growers especially in regions where moisture is available for a short period during the growing season hence in order to assess the conditions of drought for reducing agricultural vulnerability and improving livelihoods of small scale farmers depending on rain fed agriculture in a given area it is critical to conduct relevant

10597,analysis of drought on rain fed maize production in the luvuvhu river catchment was measured using the water requirement satisfaction index wrsi computation of wrsi was performed using a crop water balance model in instat software for a 120 day maturing maize crop using nine different planting dekads from october to december this study made use of seven weather stations which adequately represent climatic and geographical environments of the catchment containing historical rainfall and temperature data from 1974 to 2015 the non parametric spearman s rank correlation test was conducted to determine drought trends thereafter probabilities and extreme widespread dry and wet agricultural seasons were analysed using statistica software results revealed that since the 1980s the catchment had been subjected to frequent drought conditions with an average frequency of once every two to three seasons extreme drought episodes wrsi 50 were commonly identified in the northern drier parts of the catchment as compared to the high rainfall region whereby 50 93 of the analysed seasons were subjected to extreme drought conditions furthermore there were no drought trends ρ values close to 0 during the analysed climate period water requirements satisfaction index wrsi values corresponding to more intense drought conditions were reflected during the december planting date for all stations moreover at the low rainfall region it was seen that extreme droughts occurred once in five seasons regardless of the planting date thus the study led to a recommendation of using october november as the optimum planting date in the catchment furthermore farmers located areas with high probabilities of drought during critical stages can be advised to supplement rain fed farming with irrigation should they be located nearby to rivers keywords agricultural season crop performance planting dekad rainfall region 1 introduction 1 1 background drought occurs in many parts of the world even in different climate regions characterized by high or low rainfall mniki 2009 this is mainly due to drought being described as a prolonged rainfall deficiency relative to a region s long term average dai 2011 thus unlike aridity or desertification where low rainfall is a permanent feature of a specific region drought is merely a temporary phenomenon das 2012 in south africa drought is a common feature of climate and its extensive effects are generally felt throughout all sectors of society vogel et al 2000 agriculture is typically the first sector to feel the effects of drought as it primarily depends on precipitation for crop growth and production vogel et al 2000 woli 2010 other types of drought do exist viz hydrological which is associated with lack of surface and subsurface water commonly noticeable after six to 12 months and socio economic which emanates when any or a combination of the other three physical types begin to affect the economy or society at large wilhite and glantz 1987 at large drought has many characteristics and one eminent feature of this phenomenon is that it starts gradually and intensifies with time thus making it difficult to pinpoint until the impacts are visible hayes et al 2004 according to rouault and richard 2005 drought impacts become evident in agriculture when precipitation deficiency start to cause damage on crops during a short time scale i e season however a recent study by malherbe et al 2016 specified that agricultural drought could only be apparent following three to 12 months of meteorological drought the latter can be quantified by rainfall anomalies over a specific area vicente serrano et al 2010 moreover rainfall deficiencies together with high temperatures strong winds high evapotranspiration rates and soil water deficits are often associated with drought in many regions of the world and can significantly aggravate the severity of the event wilhite and svoboda 2000 when considering maize zea mays l production can occur under diverse environments due to the fact that the crop responds well to warm temperatures and a significant amount of water du plessis 2003d however for attaining optimum productivity adequate water is required throughout the physiological development emergence to maturity of a maize crop as the yield of which is sensitive to the occurrence of drought moeletsi and walker 2012 wetterhall et al 2014 drought could affect the rate of germination and emergence development of root leaf and stem flowering pollination grain filling as well as the quality of the grains depending on when it occurs prasad et al 2008 in addition khalili et al 2013 stated that the severity of drought damage on crops depends on stress duration intensity crop growth stage and on the different responses of the various crop variety and soils to water stress consequently the ability and extent of crops to withstand drought stress vary with crop variety climate and soil type of a given area akıncı and lösel 2012 lisar et al 2012 thus increasing recurrences of extreme weather events such as extreme temperatures and severe droughts pose a serious threat to the country s natural resources and socio economic development cop17 2011 although drought events in any given area are considered unique in their characteristics and effects frequent occurrences could cause serious implications on small scale farmers in the luvuvhu river catchment area fig 1 where maize production serves as a primary staple food and plays a crucial role in job creation national treasury 2015 the population in the catchment has been estimated to be increasing swiftly exerting pressure on existing natural resources wrc 2001 this has attributed to the change in land cover since 1978 during which forests and shrubs were cleared in order to provide fuel wood pasture and maize fields jewitt et al 2004 1 2 literature review drought stress on maize is primarily caused by a deficiency of water in the root zone as well as increased evapotranspiration rates particularly referred to as an imbalance between crop water requirements and the amount a rainfall received during the growing season sun 2009 lisar et al 2012 crop water requirements can be explained as the amount of water needed for optimal growth and development fao 1986 in south africa maize water requirements are estimated at between 450 mm and 600 mm depending on the local environment du plessis 2003d under rain fed conditions which is the most common practice in south african smallholder cropping systems crops can be susceptible to mild extreme drought conditions due to the variability of rainfall daff 2012 bouagila and sushama 2013 researchers are thus faced with the necessity to study aspects of climate variability and change on agriculture in order to identify the challenges encountered by farmers different studies have analyzed rainfall and temperature patterns independently in the northern regions of limpopo province whereby findings reported significant decreases in annual precipitation as well as strong warming trends during periods 1910 2004 and 1960 2003 for rainfall and temperature respectively kruger and shongwe 2004 kruger 2006b other papers have analysed the dynamics of temperature and climate variability for investigating the climatology of droughts over various regions in the country edossa et al 2014 ujeneza 2014 botai et al 2016 malherbe et al 2016 one of the most commonly used indices for drought monitoring is the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi developed by rouse et al 1974 this index is based on remote sensing data and monitors vegetation reflectance in the invisible and infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum however the index is not crop specific and thus it accounts for the entire vegetated area other meteorological indices that also find more applications in many studies include dry spells assessments mathugama and peiris 2011 masupha et al 2016 standardized precipitation index sonmez et al 2005 dlamini 2013 and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index potop et al 2012 vicente serrano et al 2015 yet these indices are solely based on meteorological factors and do not take into account soil water and crop factors in their calculations the present study focused on utilizing the water requirement satisfaction index wrsi developed by frere and popov 1979 for calculating potential drought stress to the crop as most indices are limited to only using meteorological data the wrsi was selected as a suitable index due to its maximal applicability in regions with high rainfall variability santos et al 2012 applied this index for determining drought risk in integrated crop livestock systems in brazil whilst most research findings have highlighted the importance of using the wrsi as a crop forecasting tool for maize growing regions across the world including in southern africa martin et al 2000 rafi and ahmad 2005 jayasree et al 2008 senay 2008 jayanthi and husak 2013 other papers utilized future climate simulations in order to determine the impact of climate change on the performance of maize in the country hachigonta 2011 crespo et al 2011 masupha and moeletsi 2018 a common message emerging from these studies is that wrsi is based on soil water availability to the crop throughout the growing period and it can be used as a representation of crop performance using both historical data and future predictions nevertheless in a region of strong rainfall variability as the luvuvhu river catchment a few studies on the influence of intra and inter annual climate variability on determining drought risk for different planting dates have been published in fact it could be said that the risk of drought occurrences is driven regionally by rainfall variability which would further explain the temporal patterns during the maize growing season a comparable paper by moeletsi and walker 2012 applied the wrsi in the free state province of south africa and provided evidence on the interactions between weather soil crop factors for determining drought risk on maize per dekad during the growing period however this study focused only on the central region of the country with contrasting agro climatic zones this paper proposes to extend the existing method by analyzing the temporal response of agricultural droughts to precipitation deficits taking into account the different climatic and geographic environments from mountainous region in the south west to the driest and sparsely populated north eastern regions this method took into consideration drought risk prior to planting and during the development of the crop per dekad in order to inform optimal planting dates with reference to producing maize furthermore it will assist decision makers in making timely informed decisions on how to reduce the accompanying drought impacts in the luvuvhu river catchment the objectives of the study were 1 to investigate how agricultural drought has evolved in the area and 2 to assess the possible drought effects on the production of maize relative to different planting dates 2 data and methods 2 1 data the geographical location altitude time periods and soil water holding capacity swhc of the seven weather stations at the study area are given in table 1 climatological data rainfall and temperature and soil water holding capacity swhc data were obtained from the agricultural research council arc 2016 for assuring data quality climate data was inspected and the arc stand alone patching tool which applies the inverse distance weighting idw and the multiple linear regression mlr methods using neighbouring stations was used to fill missing values shabalala and moeletsi 2015 moeletsi et al 2016 reference evapotranspiration was calculated using the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 which employs geographical location and air temperature for estimation daily data were then aggregated into dekads i e a sum of 10 day values resulting in three values per month 1st dekad day 1 10 2nd dekad day 11 20 and 3rd dekad day 21 31 2 2 quantification of agricultural drought a crop water balance model in instat software was used to generate the water requirement satisfaction index wrsi this index was formulated using dekadal climatological data soil water holding capacity and crop coefficients as inputs the use of soil water holding capacity swhc determines the amount of potential stored soil water while crop coefficient kc values are used as adjustment factors for the crop water requirement per growth stage martin et al 2000 for the current study kc values were based on the four maize growth stages initial development mid season stage and late season considering maize crop life cycle of 120 days which is equivalent to 12 dekads calculations for crop coefficients were done using the single kc approach developed by allen et al 1998 in the fao 56 paper in which values for initial and late season were obtained and thereafter intermediate values were linearly interpolated to obtain the kc values for the development and mid season stages based on the area s climatic conditions normally kc values start at a minimum during the initial stage and increase during the development and mid season stages then reduce as the crop start to require less water in the late season stage the calculated values were then used to construct the kc curve as shown in fig 2 the water requirement satisfaction index wrsi for a season was calculated as a proportion of actual evapotranspiration a e t to the crop water requirement w r expressed by senay and verdin 2002 1 w r s i a e t w r 100 the crop water requirement w r was obtained by multiplying reference evapotranspiration et0 by the crop coefficient kc given by allen et al 1998 2 w r e t 0 k c after determining the crop water requirements w r the a e t representing the actual amount of water lost from the soil water reservoir was estimated using the soil water balance method incorporated within the model in order to determine a e t for the maize crop dekadal rainfall p p t was added to the soil water content to produce a plant available water p a w value 3 p a w i s w i 1 p p t where s w i 1 soil water content at the end of the previous i th time interval mm dekad depending on the p a w in the soil reservoir the value of aet was estimated using the following equations senay and verdin 2002 4 a e t w r w h e n p a w s w c 5 a e t w r s w c p a w w h e n p a w s w c 6 a e t p a w w h e n a e t p a w where w r crop water requirement s w c critical soil water level in the soil reservoir water requirement satisfaction index is recorded after each consecutive dekad and cumulative water stress experienced by the crop throughout the growing period is then given at the end of the growing season fao 1986 the index starts with a value of 100 and a reduction occurs as the crop undergoes water stress in a form of water deficit and if the water surplus is greater than 100 mm allen et al 1998 therefore as illustrated in table 2 a wrsi value 80 specifies a drought episode and a decrement in the index indicates an increase in the severity of drought with a wrsi value of less than 50 indicating total crop failure the crop water balance model in instat software was run for nine planting dekads using the first dekad of october oct dek1 to the last dekad of december dec dek3 as the starting period these dates were selected based on the mean start of the rainy season given by masupha et al 2016 dekadal wrsi values were then obtained and drought severity was interpreted according to the classification in table 2 2 3 statistical analysis for trend detection and probabilities historical time series of drought and its possible effects on maize were assessed and trends were analysed using the non parametric spearman s rank correlation test conducted at α significance level of 0 05 in statistica software this test is based on the coefficient ρ ranging from 1 to 1 where a negative value implies a decreasing trend while positive values represent an increase gitau 2011 gives the method of calculating the coefficient ρ to determine the trend 7 ρ 6 i 1 n d i n n 2 1 2 where d i difference between each rank of corresponding values of x and y n number of data pairs to investigate crop performance in relation to drought occurrence during each growing season probabilities of wrsi following the nine planting dekads were analysed and plotted for each station using statistica software based on the wrsi series it was determined that the normal and johnson sb distributions table 3 generated the best fitting curves for the different stations randomly the johnson sb distribution is related to the normal distribution and in this regard it was applied to transform data points that did not follow a standard normal curve dell inc 2015 these distributions were selected from over 23 different types of probability distributions according to the anderson darling goodness of fit test at α 0 05 significance level 2 4 evaluation of extreme widespread dry and wet agricultural seasons notable agricultural seasons subjected to extreme widespread drought given by wrsi values corresponding to extreme drought 50 were evaluated to measure the degree to which the water requirement of the crop had been satisfied during each stage of the growing season three stations representing the different rainfall regions in the catchment viz lwamondo high tshiombo moderate and sigonde low were selected and analysis was conducted using december results as this was identified as the period in which the drought was more intense compared to other planting dekads the seasons in which there was no drought wet seasons and whereby there was mild to moderate drought at low rainfall regions due to high risk of recurrent drought occurrence were also evaluated to inspect the intra seasonal variability of rainfall throughout the growing season 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal evolution of agricultural drought and trends based on wrsi the temporal patterns of wrsi fig 3 5 revealed that the catchment encountered notable drought conditions at different severity levels during the analysed agricultural seasons table 5 shows the number of seasons in which the maize crop had been subjected to the different drought severities according to these results wrsi values corresponding to mild and moderate droughts proved to be more frequent at levubu lwamondo thohoyandou and tshiombo this was commonly observed once every two to three seasons meanwhile at punda maria sigonde and pafuri it was noted that extreme drought conditions were most frequent giving a range of 15 30 seasons of the 30 32 analysed seasons there have also been notable widespread extreme droughts in the past viz 1983 84 1988 89 1991 92 1993 94 2001 02 2002 03 2004 05 and 2014 15 these historical droughts were recorded at all stations except levubu where the drought was observed to be less intense previous findings recorded by lda 2011 stated the 1991 92 drought as being the most severe across the whole country moreover a report conducted by pretorius and smal 1992 indicated estimates of a decline in the gross value added by the agricultural sector based on summer crop estimates for 1991 92 as compared to previous agricultural seasons austin 2008 reported that in 2001 maize prices had dramatically increased within 5 months in the season this increase could have been due to different influential factors such as the foreign exchange maize world price and the accessibility of maize by other southern african countries chabane 2002 by 2002 the average farming output of the country was recorded to have decreased by 75 of the previous output resulting in economic losses fao 2004 planting in december resulted in more seasons being exposed to the occurrence of extreme droughts as compared to planting in october and november this is evident for all stations analysed the least potential risk of crop damage was observed at levubu with no occurrences of extreme droughts wrsi 50 following planting during the 1st dekad of october to the 3rd dekad of november december planting dekads revealed three extreme drought events during the 3rd dekad of december it was also observed at this station that only two cases of severe drought were observed relative to planting in october and november followed by three to six cases should planting occur in december this implies that late planting could increase the risk of possible total crop failure in the region another evident observation is that at punda maria sigonde and pafuri extreme drought episodes wrsi 50 were generally predominant in these regions during the growing period irrespective of the different planting dekads moreover according to table 4 the highest number of seasons subjected to extreme drought were observed following planting during the 2nd and 3rd dekad of december at sigonde and pafuri this implies a high risk of total crop failure making the upper regions of the catchment unsuitable for rain fed maize production water requirement satisfaction index trends provided by the spearman s rank correlation test table 5 did not show any significant increase or decrease this implies that although the luvuvhu river catchment has experienced several drought events in the past the area has not become drier since the 1980s earlier findings have reported significant decreases in annual precipitation as well as a strong warming trend in the northern parts of limpopo province kruger 2006a however these studies were carried out over long periods 1910 2004 for rainfall and 1960 2003 for temperature over the whole province contrary to these findings weak increasing trends were noted at lwamondo following planting in december whereas at thohoyandou the trend ρ values of 0 5 was observed following planting in the 1st dekad of october this increase in wrsi suggests that there has been a gradual decrease in drought severity following the respective planting dekads implying improved precipitation patterns at those regions 3 2 probabilities of wrsi during the growing season of maize the wrsi probability plots showing proneness to drought relative to planting in october november and december are presented in fig 6 8 at the 20th percentile mark results show that mild conditions wrsi 70 79 can be expected at levubu following october and november planting dekads while december planting reflected wrsi values corresponding to moderate to severe droughts at lwamomdo and tshiombo probabilities of severe droughts wrsi 60 were observed relative to planting during the 2nd dekad of october to the 1st dekad of november with the drought intensifying to extreme conditions wrsi 50 in december moreover at thohoyandou the least risk can be expected during the 1st dekad of october while at punda maria sigonde and pafuri extreme droughts can be expected once in five seasons regardless of the planting dekad when observing the 50 probability of non exceedance it was evident that at levubu wrsi reflected values of 80 during all planting dekads this implies that once in two seasons the farmers in this region can expect no drought conditions resulting in good crop performance at lwamondo it can be seen that planting in the 1st dekad of october could result in severe drought wrsi 50 59 while the risk may possibly be reduced if planting occurs during the 3rd dekad of october to the 3rd dekad of december with wrsi values ranging from 70 79 during this period at tshiombo and thohoyandou planting during the 1 st dekad and 2nd 3rd dekad of december respectively gave a risk of severe droughts while planting in october to november could result in better crop produce at both stations similar to the 20th percentile it can also be seen at the 50th percentile with a return period of once every two seasons that punda maria sigonde and pafuri can expect to receive extreme drought conditions following all planting dekads this implies an imbalance between the distribution of rainy days and the amount of rainfall throughout the season with respect to water requirements of the maize crop yengoh et al 2010 at 80 probability of non exceedance conditions of no drought can be expected at levubu and lwamondo following all planting dekads similar patterns can be observed at thohoyandou and tshiombo although cases of mild drought were observed following planting in december this shows that the risk of experiencing drought every season at these regions is very low conversely given the same return period drought conditions can be expected at stations that are located in the upper catchment punda maria sigonde and pafuri at punda maria planting in the 1st dekad of october to the 1st dekad of december could result in mild to moderate drought while planting later 2nd dekad onwards in december suggests probabilities of severe droughts wrsi 60 results further indicated that delay in planting at sigonde and pafuri could place the maize crop at higher risk of total crop failure as compared to the other planting dekads these results indicate that the optimal planting date for rain fed maize crop in the luvuvhu river catchment area is during october to november with wrsi values relative to more intense drought conditions reflected during the december planting dekads for all stations although early planting can be advised it is important to note that at thohoyandou planting too early 1st dekad of october might place crops grown in this area under drought stress this indicates that there is a risk that water requirements of the crop will not be fully met during critical periods of the growing season following this planting dekad 3 3 observed extreme widespread dry and wet agricultural seasons the widespread drought events and wet seasons were evaluated to measure the satisfaction of the water requirement to the crop during each stage of the growing season it appears fig 9 11 that the drought conditions were due to a deficit of water starting from the 5th dekad to the 12th dekad of the growing period this means that the rainfall experienced during that period did not meet the crop water requirements and therefore crops did not get sufficient water during the most critical stages 7th 9th dekad thus explaining the decline of wrsi line this is consistent with literature as it has been shown that the maize crop is unable to resume growth and development after a severe drought at tasselling to silking stage whitmore 2000 another interesting finding is that at sigonde the extreme drought of 1991 92 was caused by lack of water throughout the growing season with only four dekads receiving rainfall of less than 10 mm per dekad the resulting wrsi value for that season was zero in 1993 94 it is interesting to note that despite the good start to the season with fairly good rainfall occurring during the 1st 4th dekad conditions at the end of the season resulted in wrsi values of 50 this is owing to the fact that the water in the soil had not yet recovered from the previous drought 1991 92 thus the rainfall was not sufficient for proper growth and development a similar study has shown that the 1991 92 drought effects worsened until the end of 1993 correspondingly affecting the hydrological water supply trambauer et al 2014 this prolonged drought was widely experienced throughout the country as well as in other parts of southern africa including botswana zimbabwe and mozambique causing widespread crop failure and livestock mortalities fao 2004 after the year 2000 the area experienced extreme drought for two consecutive seasons 2001 02 and 2002 03 and again during 2004 05 at lwamondo and sigonde thereafter the area was then struck by extreme drought again after a decade 2014 15 at the moderate and low rainfall regions on further analysis results showed extreme wet seasons as being 1987 88 1999 00 2003 04 and 2013 14 fig 8 shows that during the course of these seasons rainfall was equal and or more than the corresponding water requirements for considerable number of dekads including the critical stage of the crop it was further noted that for some dekads the index was reduced despite the high rainfall amounts that were received this is because according to allen et al 1998 the index is not only reduced when the crop experiences water stress but also when the water surplus is 100 mm however the wrsi value at the end of these seasons reflected good crop performance at the high and moderate rainfall regions and average crop performance at the low rainfall regions the total crop failure during the dry seasons could be explained by the lack of rainfall during the growing season at the low rainfall regions as well as during the sensitive stages at the high and moderate rainfall regions the intra seasonal variability of rainfall resulted in deficient uptake of the required water by crops due to a reduction in moisture around the roots das 2012 however during the wet seasons it was observed that the rainfall was fairly distributed thus resulting in wrsi values corresponding to good crop performance implying satisfactory yields 4 conclusions this study provided information that agricultural decisions can be made better by computing probabilities of drought occurrence relating to crop performance following various planting dates the timing of drought also highlighted that although farmers would rather want a fair distribution of rainfall throughout the season in reality this not ideal thus the necessity of assessing drought relative to the different stages of the crops therefore to lessen the potential effects of drought on a maize crop planting in october to november can be recommended at high moderate rainfall regions while for farmers located near punda maria sigonde and pafuri low rainfall planting in november could be beneficial consequently effective water management practices could be adopted for local rain fed maize growers especially in regions where moisture is available for a short period during the growing season hence in order to assess the conditions of drought for reducing agricultural vulnerability and improving livelihoods of small scale farmers depending on rain fed agriculture in a given area it is critical to conduct relevant

10598,to deal with serious water resources crisis the shiyang river basin srb of hexi corridor in northwestern china has been experiencing rehabilitation for water saving since 2006 water use efficiency in cropland wuec is a critical indicator to understand the response of carbon water interactions because we currently lack a clear picture of how wuec responds to climate and human activities factors in the srb here we applied moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis satellite images to obtain a regional estimation of gross primary productivity in cropland gppc and actual evapotranspiration in cropland etc and analyzed the variations in wuec and climate and human activities factors then we evaluated the annual wuec responses to climate and human activity factors and discussed major driving factors underlying the interannual variability iav of wuec from 2000 to 2014 in the srb finally we clarified the implications of the water saving project wsp on the water cycle results indicated that increased wuec covered 97 25 of the cropland area with a trend of 0 017 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 etc decreased at 0 41 mm yr 1 etc decreasing pixel mainly occurred in the irrigation districts of wsp completed by 2010 the iav of wuec was mainly determined by etc 68 rather than gppc 6 the relative contribution of human activities factors in the wsp to etc was 77 5 while that of climate factors was 22 5 which further proved water availability increase was mainly artificially controlled an effect of the wsp rather than that of climate factors keywords water use efficiency wue actual evapotranspiration et relative contribution water saving project cropland modis 1 introduction water use efficiency wue is a key parameter that quantifies the trade off between photosynthetic carbon assimilation and transpiration at the leaf scale farquhar et al 1980 neither carbon assimilation nor transpiration can be observed directly at the ecosystem level ecosystem wue ewue is usually defined as the ratio of carbon assimilation i e gross primary productivity gpp to water consumption i e actual evapotranspiration et which links carbon and water cycles over the terrestrial ecosystem reichstein et al 2002 beer and ciais 2009 meanwhile climate change and human activities have significantly disturbed the global water balance teuling et al 2013 and changed water availability conditions of the terrestrial ecosystem huntington 2006 hence exploring the spatial and temporal patterns of ewue sheds light on the interrelationship between carbon and water interactions in terrestrial ecosystems and supplies support in evaluating the response of ecosystem to changing environmental niu et al 2011 keenan et al 2013 kang et al 2017 in recent years forest and grassland ecosystems have attracted considerable attention and persistent interest in evaluating on ewue variations and its driving factors niu et al 2011 christian smith et al 2012 huang et al 2016 yang et al 2019 however ewue in cropland wuec defined as the ratio of gpp in cropland gppc to et in cropland etc has few mentions du et al 2019 clearly analyzing the variations and driving factors in wuec under changing environments is of importance for the reasonable utilization of regional water resource management and allocation strategies this is particularly true for sustainable development and agriculture in arid and semiarid areas that are experiencing severe water shortages bu et al 2013 climate change which is a consequence of increased greenhouse gas emissions and global warming ipcc 2014 karamouz et al 2014 and the change in global precipitation regimes is considered to be caused by the warming air temperature in the northern hemisphere these circumstances have greatly affected the relationship between gpp and et huang et al 2015 meanwhile water resource shortages and extreme environmental conditions e g drought and extreme precipitation are occurring more frequently in china under global warming yu et al 2008 niu et al 2008 wang et al 2017 which also affects regional carbon and water cycles generally ewue responds positively to warming in the northern hemisphere due to relatively higher photosynthetic capacities piao et al 2007 2013 richardson et al 2010 however under different conditions dry and wet the trend of ewue in relation to climate change and its response to climate factors will probably be inconsistent yu et al 2008 liu et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 for example bai et al 2008 concluded that ewue increased with increasing annual precipitation while li et al 2008 found an opposite result and wue is usually considered to be decreased with increasing vapor pressure deficit vpd across different time scales law et al 2002 similarly in some conditions such a response of wue to vpd may only exist seasonally eamus et al 2013 or even does not exist at all due to extreme environmental conditions reichstein et al 2002 in

light heat and land resources gpwrb and gpdrc 2007 and shows typical features of arid zones with multi year mean precipitation of 259 mm yr 1 fig 1 and annual mean potential evaporation of 700 2600 mm kang et al 2009 as a result precipitation is far less than crop water requirement and irrigation is essential for agriculture meanwhile the region is facing the most serious water shortage problem in china which is limiting factor for regional prosperity and economic development kang et al 2017 actually competition for water and unsustainable rates of use are evident around the world from the north china plain to the near east and north africa region to california kendy et al 2003 zamora et al 2015 fao 2017 even temperate areas of europe that are relatively well endowed with precipitation are now also experiencing localized water scarcity oecd 2015 that will require interventions to ensure the long term sustainability of water use fao 2017 in particular the chinese central government launched a water saving project wsp under the comprehensive treatment program of the srb ctsrb in 2006 in order to tackle the water shortage issue the aim of the wsp at srb is to increase wuec by improving irrigation technology and adjusting crop planting structure gpwrb and gpdrc 2007 the wsp of the ctsrb was planned to be implemented in three stages over these irrigation districts fig 1 as mentioned above these facts reflect the complexity in distinguishing the major driving factors for wue variations probably due to the differential responses of gpp and et to climate and human activities factors brümmer et al 2012 hence it is critical to explain the individual responses of gppc and etc and the effects of single variables to determine how wuec changes in the changing environment these considerations are also critical to clarify the effects of the wsp in the srb in short the primary objective of this study is to explore the variations and major driving factors in wuec under the changing environment to clarify the effects of the wsp on the water cycle in the srb here we try to 1 analyze the variations in wuec and climate and human activities factors from 2000 to 2014 2 evaluate the annual wuec responses to climate and human activities factors and discuss its major driving factors underlying interannual variability iav of wuec from 2000 to 2014 and 3 clarify the implications of wsp on water cycle thus our study is a valuable reference for wsp performance assessments contributing to the reasonable utilization of regional water resource management and allocation strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the srb lies in the east part of the hexi corridor in the arid and semiarid regions of northwest china 101 41 e 104 16 e 37 41 n 42 42 n the total basin area is about 4000 km2 elevation varies from 1244 m to 5220 m with an average elevation of 1910 m above mean sea level fig 1 annual mean temperature is 7 4 c with a range of 12 3 c 22 0 c and it increases from the snowy mountains upstream to the deserts downstream in the srb fig 1 natural landscape ecosystems of the srb comprise glacial areas forestland grassland cropland and deserts cropland accounts for about 10 of the srb area locally generated precipitation in the cropland is normally insufficient i e the mean is 259 mm yr 1 fig 1 for supporting agricultural irrigation streamflow and groundwater are the main water resources for irrigation in the cropland before the ctsrb the overexploitation of groundwater seriously destroyed the ecohydrology and ecosystem environment of the basin and led to ecological degradation e g salinization desertification and vegetation degradation zhang and li 2016 hao et al 2017 meanwhile an obvious turning point in the year of 2000 that moving average value of mean air temperature exceeded the average of the year 1970 2015 in the hexi corridor was detected by fu et al 2019 indicating that the region has faced a more challenging environment since the new millennium 2 2 materials 2 2 1 remote sensing data the digital elevation model data set was obtained from the nasa shuttle radar topography mission website http www glcf umd edu at a 1 km resolution modis gpp data mod17a2 and et potential evapotranspiration mod16a2 were acquired from the numerical terradynamic simulation group of the university of montana at an 8 day interval with a 1 km resolution http www ntsg umt edu monthly vegetation index information i e the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and enhanced vegetation index evi were derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis terra mod13a3 version 6 product it was provided by the nasa land processes distributed active archive center lp daac with a spatial resolution of 1 km https lpdaac usgs gov the modis land cover type product mcd12q1 was downloaded from the nasa lp daac at a 500 m resolution the land cover type product was resampled and categorized into a 1 km resolution using the resample tool in arcmap 10 2 the modis data format hdf was converted to the relevant geographical coordinates and world geodetic system wgs 84 data with 2 tiles h25v05 h26v05 were mosaicked together using the public domain modis reprojection tool mrt package this study only focused on cropland ecosystem based on the annual crop cover of mcd12q1 datasets by the extracting tool in arcmap 10 2 to generate gppc etc petc potential evapotranspiration in cropland ndvic ndvi in cropland and evic evi in cropland the analysis was performed for the period from 2000 to 2014 except for the modis annual land cover type product providing temporal coverage from 2001 2014 only pixels with a constant crop cover between 2001 2014 are included for analysis 2 2 2 meteorological data meteorological data including daily air temperatures t precipitation p and relative humidity rh were collected from meteorological stations of the srb and the surrounding area table 1 in 2000 2014 and they were acquired from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn we used thin plate smoothing splines algorithms based on the elevation information derived from the digital elevation model and applied them in the anusplin package to process the daily meteorological data t and p into grid pixels at a spatial resolution of 1 km the vapor pressure deficit vpd can be calculated in terms of t and rh by the following formula jiao et al 2019 1 v p d 0 611 e 17 502 t t 240 970 100 r h where vpd is the vapor pressure deficit kpa t is the monthly average air temperature c and rh is the monthly average relative humidity in addition the statistical data such as irrigation water used iwu for srb was provided by the water resources bulletin of gansu province 2 3 data analysis all spatial data was simulated at the same spatial resolution of 1 km our data analysis methods mainly include temporal pearson correlation analysis spatially sen s trend test and partial correlation analysis on each pixel from 2000 to 2014 2 3 1 spatial trend test and partial correlation analysis in the mann kendall test another very useful index is sen s slope which is an unbiased estimator of monotonic trend magnitude extended by hirsch et al 1982 from the one proposed by sen 1968 the slope was performed to detect the spatial variation of trends in gppc etc and wuec during 2000 2014 on each pixel to explore the response of annual variations of each driving factor to wuec on each pixel we also chose partial correlation analysis between wuec and one driver after statistically controlling changes in the other drivers for example the partial correlation coefficient between wuec and ndvic was controlled the interrelationship between ndvic p and t 2 3 2 temporal correlation analysis to quantify the iav of gppc etc wuec climatic variables i e t p and vpd and human agricultural activities variables i e ndvic evic and iwu the following equation was used 2 x x i 1 x i i 2000 2013 where x i 1 was the following year variable x i was the current year variable and δx was the iav of the variables for temporal correlation analysis the pearson correlation coefficient was used in this study the correlation analysis was used to investigate the relationships between the iav of the variables 2 3 3 temporally relative contribution assessment temporally to quantify the relative contribution of human activities factors in the wsp to etc its mutation period was determined according to the mk mutation test kendall 1938 mann 1945 evic and iwu variations represent the influence of human activities in wsp using the basic idea of the partial differential equation all variables were normalization by the zero mean method and the etc variation n could be decomposed as follows 3 d e t c d t δ e t c δ e v i c δ e v i c δ t δ e t c δ i w u δ i w u δ t δ e t c δ c lim a t e δ c lim a t e δ t where evic and iwu are the enhanced vegetation index in cropland and irrigation water used in srb respectively climate represents etc variation due to climate factors change e g t p and vpd and the partial derivatives of etc with respect to the evic iwu and climate represent the contributions of those factors to etc variation then based on first order approximation the equation can be written as 4 δ e t c δ e t c δ e v i c δ e v i c δ e t c δ i w u δ i w u δ e t c c lim a t e where δetc δevic and δiwu are the difference of variables respectively the sum of the first and second terms is approximately the indication of the contribution of human activities factors to etc variation and the temporally relative contribution of etc can be expressed as follows 5 r c h u m a n δ e t c h u m a n δ e t c 100 6 r c c lim a t e 100 r c h u m a n where rcclimate and rchuman are the relative contribution of climate and human activities factors respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification of the ewue estimated from the modis products upon comparing the results of this study with other estimates in the literature to verify the effectiveness of the modis ewue the variation of the modis ewue was consistent with the results of the remote sensing calculations and model estimations xiao et al 2013 gao et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 du et al 2019 xiao et al 2013 reported ranges of the ewue in china were about 0 37 3 10 g c kg 1 h2o from 2003 to 2010 and zhu et al 2015 found approximately 0 36 3 89 g c kg 1 h2o from 2001 to 2010 all of which were consistent with our results which ranged from 0 00 4 68 g c kg 1 h2o recently du et al 2019 compared the two ewue datasets derived from the modis gpp and et products and from the glass gpp and et datasets for the north china the result concluded a high degree of consistency between the modis ewue and glass ewue rmse 0 21 r2 0 72 p 0 001 there was highest consistency between the values in the western central of north china r2 0 83 srb is located in the region hence the ewue values estimated using the modis products in this study were similar to the results of previous studies supporting the use of the modis products 3 2 variation of climate and human activities factors and wuec 3 2 1 variations of climate and human activities factors the seasonal patterns of the climate variables are shown in fig 2 the monthly p was 15 6 mm on average through all the year it was about 24 8 mm during the growing season between april and october on average with the peak value reaching 41 4 mm in july on the other hand it was only 2 3 mm during the nongrowing season on average with the lowest value reaching 1 1 mm in december the monthly t ranged from 12 3 c 22 0 c with a mean value of 7 4 c and the highest mean value occurred in july 20 4 c meanwhile the annual mean vpd showed an increased trend and varied between 0 55 kpa in 2007 and 0 68 kpa in 2013 with a mean value of 0 60 kpa the monthly mean vpd showed the highest mean value occurred in april 0 77 kpa and the lowest value in january 0 18 kpa overall it is obvious that the variations of p t and vpd from 2000 to 2014 represented typically seasonal trends for the srb which implied warm and wet growing seasons and cool and dry nongrowing seasons in terms of human activities factors fig 3 the monthly ndvic and evic were 0 29 and 0 20 on average through all the year fig 3a they were about 0 40 and 0 28 during the growing season on average with the peak value reaching 0 60 and 0 45 in july on the other hand they were only 0 13 and 0 08 during the nongrowing season on average with the lowest value reaching 0 08 and 0 07 in december consistent with the seasonal patterns of p and t which also indicated the better vegetation performance in growing season compared with nongrowing season the annual iwu is shown in fig 3b although iwu was decreased with rate of 0 03 billion m3 yr 1 from 2000 to 2014 the inter annual fluctuation is relatively greater especially from 2007 2014 the iwu increased slightly during the period 2000 2007 the highest iwu occurred at 2005 of 2 40 billion m3 with 0 18 billion m3 higher than the multi year average iwu the annual iwu decreased dramatically during the period 2007 2014 with a decreased rate of 0 064 billion m3 yr 1 the lowest value of the growing season iwu appeared in 2013 with a value of 1 83 billion m3 0 39 billion m3 less than the multi year average iwu which may be attributed to the effect of human activities factors in wsp and climate factors on water cycle 3 2 2 variations of gppc etc and wuec the monthly gppc reached its maximum value in july with a mean value of 126 59 g c m 2 month 1 fig 4a similarly the highest value of the monthly etc also occurred in july ranging from 33 55 mm month 1 to 63 06 mm month 1 fig 4b with a mean value of 38 96 mm month 1 during the growing season the mean etc was 29 19 mm month 1 which was about 60 higher than that during the nongrowing season 19 38 mm month 1 the monthly wuec ranged from 2 67 g c kg 1 h2o to 4 68 g c kg 1 h2o during the growing season the monthly wuec peaked in may fig 4c in addition the mean maximum and minimum values of wuec in the growing season were higher than those in the nongrowing season for example the mean values of wuec in growing seasons and nongrowing seasons were 2 33 g c kg 1 h2o and 0 10 g c kg 1 h2o respectively clearly gppc etc and wuec showed a synchronized seasonal variation trends to describe the spatial patterns of gppc etc and wuec variations their changing trends were analyzed pixel by pixel from 2000 to 2014 this showed gppc increased at a mean rate of 2 42 g c m 2 yr 1 fig 5a and etc slightly declined at a mean rate of 0 41 mm yr 1 the negative trend of etc mainly occurred in the id where the wsp was completed by 2010 fig 5b the negative trend of etc occupied approximately 51 28 of cropland area and that for the positive gppc covered about 62 89 of cropland area meanwhile the spatial pattern of annual gppc etc and wuec were correlated with climate and human activities in the srb uneven changes in environmental factors resulted in the variance in wuec tendencies over the 15 year period the positive wuec trend covered about 97 25 of the total cropland area with a slope of 0 017 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 fig 5c the spatial distribution of the mean annual wuec from 2000 to 2014 was shown in fig 5d the mean annual wuec was about 1 575 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 and varied from 0 710 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 to 2 927 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 the spatial variation of wuec indicated obvious regional heterogeneity fig 5d with relatively lower values located in the upstream cropland while higher values mainly occurred in the oasis in the middle and lower reaches the result also implies that water availability for cropland was limited the land was forced to respond to the water stress more efficiently miranda fernandes et al 2018 3 3 the response of wuec variation to climate and human activities factors 3 3 1 the response of wuec variation to t and p t wang et al 2014 and p poulter et al 2014 jung et al 2017 have been reported as the most important climate factors controlling the gpp and et variations trend analysis showed wuec increased during the period of 2000 2014 and spatially partial correlation analysis was used to further explore the individual effects of t and p on wuec from 2000 to 2014 fig 6 the partial correlation of wuec and t showed a positive relationship in most regions covering 82 5 of cropland area generally t mainly affects crop photosynthesis and evapotranspiration zhang et al 2012 xue et al 2015 sun et al 2016 for photosynthesis if the ambient t is lower than the optimal t of photosynthesis then increased t will promote photosynthesis and vice versa t affected the evapotranspiration process mainly by adjusting the stomatal conductance of crop below the threshold of t the stomatal conductance of crop is more open with an t increased and the effect of photosynthesis is greater than that of evapotranspiration meanwhile as an important part of climate change p significantly influenced the water cycle of the ecosystem p had a negative correlation with wuec in most regions accounting for 90 6 of the srb area high negative partial coefficients were found in the id of the wsp completed by 2010 recently numerous researches have discussed the effect of p on wue yu et al 2008 hu et al 2008 2010 guo et al 2019 yu et al 2008 also showed wue was negatively correlated with p variation in addition there are many studies that have shown that with the aggravation of drought wue first gradually increases and then decreases after the drought reaches a threshold xu et al 2019 overall in the cropland ecosystem of the srb wuec was negatively correlated with p however it showed a positive correlation with t in most regions for the downstream area a positive relationship between wuec and p was found in the north of the hongyashan id where the climate was warmer and drier fig 1 this is in accordance with huang et al 2015 who indicated that positive partial correlations of wue and p mainly occurred in warmer and drier regions due to water being the main limitation on gpp forcing a positive correlation between wue and annual p by enhance gpp knapp and smith 2001 nemani et al 2003 bai et al 2008 3 3 2 the response of wuec variation to ndvic and evic previous ec based and process based model ewue studies have showed that vegetation strongly affected ewue and even primarily determined the seasonal and annual variations of ewue hu et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 for example based on the model experiments scenario analysis zhang et al 2014 concluded that the increased wue over east asia during 1982 2006 was first attributed to the vegetation greening followed by the effects of climate factors however many studies have explored the t and p directly drive the water and energy cycle and further affect vegetation performance bagnoud et al 2001 blanken et al 2004 ding et al 2014 in contrast our partial correlation analysis explored the relationship between wuec and vegetation variations to remove the covariate effects of vegetation performance and climate factors t and p spatially a positive partial correlation coefficient for wuec and ndvic evic mainly occurred in the region of the wsp completed by 2010 fig 7 thus the wsp has successfully achieved the purpose of increasing low wuec by promoting advanced irrigation technology and adjusting crop planting structure some water intensive crops have been converted into cash crops 3 3 3 factors underlying wuec interannual variations we quantified the major driving factors of wuec variation and the effects of major drivers on wuec were also estimated by calculating the iav of human activities vegetation change and so on and climate air temperature precipitation and vpd factors to the variation of wuec fig 7 results show that both gppc and etc were negatively correlated with wuec by a correlation coefficient of 0 06 and 0 68 respectively indicating that the iav in wuec was mainly ascribed to the changes in etc and not determined by ndvic and evic by a correlation coefficient of 0 04 and 0 19 respectively the iav of gppc has a strongly positive correlation with ndvic and evic 0 84 0 85 indicating that the iav in gppc was mainly ascribed to the vegetation performance there is debate about whether variations in annual gpp would be positively or negatively correlated with that of wue some research indicates that plants in environments with and without sufficient water supply may have distinct water use strategies hu et al 2008 niu et al 2011 indicated that ewue responded negatively to climate warming while responding positively to increasing precipitation based on a 4 year manipulative field experiment in a temperate stope in northern china but wue may decrease or increase with annual precipitation increasing in different ecosystems depending on water condition and vegetation types tian et al 2010 in the cropland ecosystem of the srb the iav of wuec was positivity correlated with t 0 54 but negatively correlated with p 0 64 this is in accordance with hu et al 2008 under drier conditions with warming however without other water sources more water evaporated into the atmosphere decoupled from vegetation productivity with high gppc the iav of etc has a strong correlation with vpd 0 81 followed by p 0 80 this is because that water was the main limitation on etc irrigation was applied to maintain crop growth for agriculture in the arid and semiarid regions in such cases irrigated crop may transpire at its actual rate defined by atmospheric moisture demand because atmospheric moisture demand is also represented by vpd as a factor influencing the vegetation moisture relationship geruo et al 2020 thus vpd became the dominant factors that control the water cycle process furthermore the iav of vpd has a strongly negative correlation with p etc gppc ndvic and evic 0 91 0 81 0 63 0 60 0 62 indicating that vpd closely connected carbon water cycle and vegetation performance meanwhile in the water limited srb the response of vpd would be considerably more important in variations of the water cycle process compared with the carbon cycle in the cropland of the srb it is likely that vpd determines the iav in etc and hence wuec which is in accordance with hu et al 2008 the high vpd driven transpiration water loss decoupled from vegetation productivity may lead to high wuec guo et al 2019 and the increasing of wuec will ultimately result in decreasing in water consumption which will alleviate water shortages in the srb in addition wuec formulation could be considered to link wuec and vpd in srb such as an inherent wue iwue gpp vpd et at the ecosystem scale was proposed by beer and ciais 2009 and zhou et al 2014 2015 2016 introduced the concept of underlying wue given by uwue gpp vpd0 5 et in terms of human activities factors the iav of iwu had a negative correlation with wuec variation 0 48 but positively correlated with etc 0 52 therefore the improved irrigation technology had probably played a significant role in promoting wuec mainly by reducing water consumption although iav in wuec was mainly ascribed to the changes in etc and not determined by ndvic and evic the iavs of ndvic and evic had a very high correlation coefficient with gppc and etc they even explained 63 and 73 of etc variation and of 84 and 85 gppc variation respectively corresponding to fig 5 and fig 7 vegetation performance was closely connected with gppc and etc variations therefore adjusting crop planting structure is also very important in this region in improving wuec as a conclusion wsp had probably played an important role in promoting wuec by improving irrigation technology and adjusting crop planting structure 3 4 implications of water saving project on water cycle hao et al 2017 showed that the implementation of the ctsrb had a significantly positive effect in regard to the groundwater resource recovery in the minqin during the first decade of the program and also verified the effects of watershed groundwater restoration polices corresponding measures of the wsp involve promoting advanced water saving technologies and adjusting crop plant pattern to increased wuec in the srb and the iav in wuec was mainly ascribed to the changes in etc fig 8b water consumption decreased in the cropland mainly occurred in the id where the wsp was completed by 2010 fig 5b especially a large proportion of the cropland of srb showed wet trend in the last decades fu et al 2019 due to the effect of human activities and climate change in the srb to further clarify the relative contribution of climate change and human activities to etc variation we figured out the mutation point of etc decrease as shown in fig 9 etc decline started in 2007 this finding is consistent with the annual variation of iwu for the srb fig 3b besides annual etc was plotted against potential evapotranspiration in cropland petc revealed in fig 10 further regression analysis of pre 2007 and post 2007 point to human activities factors rather than climate factors as the dominant factors of driving regional crop consumptive water use for similar petc lower etc is noticeable from the regression lines after 2007 that is similar water demand or maximum water at large scale lower the actual amount of water evaporated from the entire region after years of water saving technology popularization hence water saving measures probably changed the hydrological cycle through adjusting etc after wsp furthermore to quantify the contribution of human activities factors in wsp to the etc variation iwu and vegetation index were used to represent the human activities factors in wsp due to the aim of wsp iwu was used to represent the improving irrigation technology regarding the vegetation index as mentioned above the iavs of ndvic and evic explained 63 and 73 of etc variation respectively fig 8 evic was used to represent the adjusting crop planting structure due to its better explained the variation of etc results indicated that the relative contribution of human activities factor in water saving management was extremely low before the mutation point only accounting for 26 3 while after the mutation point human activities in wsp contribution to etc increased to 77 5 fig 11 this further proves that water availability increase was mainly artificially controlled by the effect of the wsp rather than that of climate factors 4 conclusions in this study we explored the variations and major driving factors in wuec under the changing environment to clarify the effects of the wsp in the srb it was revealed that increased wuec area occupied 97 25 of the total cropland area of the srb since 2000 etc decreasing pixel mainly occurred in the irrigation districts of wsp completed by 2010 then we explained the effects of climate and human activities factors on the variations of wuec and its major driving factors the iav of wuec was mainly determined by etc 68 rather than gppc 6 thus the study quantified the contribution of human activities factors in the wsp to etc variation further clarified water availability increase is mainly artificially controlled by the effect of wsp rather than that of climate factors overall which serves as a valuable reference for the effectiveness of a wsp and the reasonable utilization of regional water resource management and allocation strategies in the srb the vpd was shown to play a more important role in the underlying wuec interannual variations further studies are also required wuec formulation could be considered to link wuec and vpd namely using the developed wuec formulation to better assess spatial temporal dynamics of developed wuec and its response to agricultural water management in addition given the improvement in wuec being related to the change in crop biomass production in different crop types not only in the srb it is also of great necessity to explore the spatial variations of crop biomass production in different crop types by remote sensing in the future declaration

10598,to deal with serious water resources crisis the shiyang river basin srb of hexi corridor in northwestern china has been experiencing rehabilitation for water saving since 2006 water use efficiency in cropland wuec is a critical indicator to understand the response of carbon water interactions because we currently lack a clear picture of how wuec responds to climate and human activities factors in the srb here we applied moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis satellite images to obtain a regional estimation of gross primary productivity in cropland gppc and actual evapotranspiration in cropland etc and analyzed the variations in wuec and climate and human activities factors then we evaluated the annual wuec responses to climate and human activity factors and discussed major driving factors underlying the interannual variability iav of wuec from 2000 to 2014 in the srb finally we clarified the implications of the water saving project wsp on the water cycle results indicated that increased wuec covered 97 25 of the cropland area with a trend of 0 017 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 etc decreased at 0 41 mm yr 1 etc decreasing pixel mainly occurred in the irrigation districts of wsp completed by 2010 the iav of wuec was mainly determined by etc 68 rather than gppc 6 the relative contribution of human activities factors in the wsp to etc was 77 5 while that of climate factors was 22 5 which further proved water availability increase was mainly artificially controlled an effect of the wsp rather than that of climate factors keywords water use efficiency wue actual evapotranspiration et relative contribution water saving project cropland modis 1 introduction water use efficiency wue is a key parameter that quantifies the trade off between photosynthetic carbon assimilation and transpiration at the leaf scale farquhar et al 1980 neither carbon assimilation nor transpiration can be observed directly at the ecosystem level ecosystem wue ewue is usually defined as the ratio of carbon assimilation i e gross primary productivity gpp to water consumption i e actual evapotranspiration et which links carbon and water cycles over the terrestrial ecosystem reichstein et al 2002 beer and ciais 2009 meanwhile climate change and human activities have significantly disturbed the global water balance teuling et al 2013 and changed water availability conditions of the terrestrial ecosystem huntington 2006 hence exploring the spatial and temporal patterns of ewue sheds light on the interrelationship between carbon and water interactions in terrestrial ecosystems and supplies support in evaluating the response of ecosystem to changing environmental niu et al 2011 keenan et al 2013 kang et al 2017 in recent years forest and grassland ecosystems have attracted considerable attention and persistent interest in evaluating on ewue variations and its driving factors niu et al 2011 christian smith et al 2012 huang et al 2016 yang et al 2019 however ewue in cropland wuec defined as the ratio of gpp in cropland gppc to et in cropland etc has few mentions du et al 2019 clearly analyzing the variations and driving factors in wuec under changing environments is of importance for the reasonable utilization of regional water resource management and allocation strategies this is particularly true for sustainable development and agriculture in arid and semiarid areas that are experiencing severe water shortages bu et al 2013 climate change which is a consequence of increased greenhouse gas emissions and global warming ipcc 2014 karamouz et al 2014 and the change in global precipitation regimes is considered to be caused by the warming air temperature in the northern hemisphere these circumstances have greatly affected the relationship between gpp and et huang et al 2015 meanwhile water resource shortages and extreme environmental conditions e g drought and extreme precipitation are occurring more frequently in china under global warming yu et al 2008 niu et al 2008 wang et al 2017 which also affects regional carbon and water cycles generally ewue responds positively to warming in the northern hemisphere due to relatively higher photosynthetic capacities piao et al 2007 2013 richardson et al 2010 however under different conditions dry and wet the trend of ewue in relation to climate change and its response to climate factors will probably be inconsistent yu et al 2008 liu et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 for example bai et al 2008 concluded that ewue increased with increasing annual precipitation while li et al 2008 found an opposite result and wue is usually considered to be decreased with increasing vapor pressure deficit vpd across different time scales law et al 2002 similarly in some conditions such a response of wue to vpd may only exist seasonally eamus et al 2013 or even does not exist at all due to extreme environmental conditions reichstein et al 2002 in addition to climate change ewue is one of the fundamental trade offs governing plant growth and is widely used to indicate the influence of human activities e g vegetation performance previous studies have shown that large scale vegetation changes due to grain for green programs implemented in north china have significantly influenced the terrestrial ecohydrology murray et al 2012 woodward et al 2014 jin et al 2017 li et al 2019 for the shiyang river basin srb of hexi corridor in northwestern china it used to be one of the most important commodity grain bases in china due to its abundant light heat and land resources gpwrb and gpdrc 2007 and shows typical features of arid zones with multi year mean precipitation of 259 mm yr 1 fig 1 and annual mean potential evaporation of 700 2600 mm kang et al 2009 as a result precipitation is far less than crop water requirement and irrigation is essential for agriculture meanwhile the region is facing the most serious water shortage problem in china which is limiting factor for regional prosperity and economic development kang et al 2017 actually competition for water and unsustainable rates of use are evident around the world from the north china plain to the near east and north africa region to california kendy et al 2003 zamora et al 2015 fao 2017 even temperate areas of europe that are relatively well endowed with precipitation are now also experiencing localized water scarcity oecd 2015 that will require interventions to ensure the long term sustainability of water use fao 2017 in particular the chinese central government launched a water saving project wsp under the comprehensive treatment program of the srb ctsrb in 2006 in order to tackle the water shortage issue the aim of the wsp at srb is to increase wuec by improving irrigation technology and adjusting crop planting structure gpwrb and gpdrc 2007 the wsp of the ctsrb was planned to be implemented in three stages over these irrigation districts fig 1 as mentioned above these facts reflect the complexity in distinguishing the major driving factors for wue variations probably due to the differential responses of gpp and et to climate and human activities factors brümmer et al 2012 hence it is critical to explain the individual responses of gppc and etc and the effects of single variables to determine how wuec changes in the changing environment these considerations are also critical to clarify the effects of the wsp in the srb in short the primary objective of this study is to explore the variations and major driving factors in wuec under the changing environment to clarify the effects of the wsp on the water cycle in the srb here we try to 1 analyze the variations in wuec and climate and human activities factors from 2000 to 2014 2 evaluate the annual wuec responses to climate and human activities factors and discuss its major driving factors underlying interannual variability iav of wuec from 2000 to 2014 and 3 clarify the implications of wsp on water cycle thus our study is a valuable reference for wsp performance assessments contributing to the reasonable utilization of regional water resource management and allocation strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the srb lies in the east part of the hexi corridor in the arid and semiarid regions of northwest china 101 41 e 104 16 e 37 41 n 42 42 n the total basin area is about 4000 km2 elevation varies from 1244 m to 5220 m with an average elevation of 1910 m above mean sea level fig 1 annual mean temperature is 7 4 c with a range of 12 3 c 22 0 c and it increases from the snowy mountains upstream to the deserts downstream in the srb fig 1 natural landscape ecosystems of the srb comprise glacial areas forestland grassland cropland and deserts cropland accounts for about 10 of the srb area locally generated precipitation in the cropland is normally insufficient i e the mean is 259 mm yr 1 fig 1 for supporting agricultural irrigation streamflow and groundwater are the main water resources for irrigation in the cropland before the ctsrb the overexploitation of groundwater seriously destroyed the ecohydrology and ecosystem environment of the basin and led to ecological degradation e g salinization desertification and vegetation degradation zhang and li 2016 hao et al 2017 meanwhile an obvious turning point in the year of 2000 that moving average value of mean air temperature exceeded the average of the year 1970 2015 in the hexi corridor was detected by fu et al 2019 indicating that the region has faced a more challenging environment since the new millennium 2 2 materials 2 2 1 remote sensing data the digital elevation model data set was obtained from the nasa shuttle radar topography mission website http www glcf umd edu at a 1 km resolution modis gpp data mod17a2 and et potential evapotranspiration mod16a2 were acquired from the numerical terradynamic simulation group of the university of montana at an 8 day interval with a 1 km resolution http www ntsg umt edu monthly vegetation index information i e the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and enhanced vegetation index evi were derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis terra mod13a3 version 6 product it was provided by the nasa land processes distributed active archive center lp daac with a spatial resolution of 1 km https lpdaac usgs gov the modis land cover type product mcd12q1 was downloaded from the nasa lp daac at a 500 m resolution the land cover type product was resampled and categorized into a 1 km resolution using the resample tool in arcmap 10 2 the modis data format hdf was converted to the relevant geographical coordinates and world geodetic system wgs 84 data with 2 tiles h25v05 h26v05 were mosaicked together using the public domain modis reprojection tool mrt package this study only focused on cropland ecosystem based on the annual crop cover of mcd12q1 datasets by the extracting tool in arcmap 10 2 to generate gppc etc petc potential evapotranspiration in cropland ndvic ndvi in cropland and evic evi in cropland the analysis was performed for the period from 2000 to 2014 except for the modis annual land cover type product providing temporal coverage from 2001 2014 only pixels with a constant crop cover between 2001 2014 are included for analysis 2 2 2 meteorological data meteorological data including daily air temperatures t precipitation p and relative humidity rh were collected from meteorological stations of the srb and the surrounding area table 1 in 2000 2014 and they were acquired from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn we used thin plate smoothing splines algorithms based on the elevation information derived from the digital elevation model and applied them in the anusplin package to process the daily meteorological data t and p into grid pixels at a spatial resolution of 1 km the vapor pressure deficit vpd can be calculated in terms of t and rh by the following formula jiao et al 2019 1 v p d 0 611 e 17 502 t t 240 970 100 r h where vpd is the vapor pressure deficit kpa t is the monthly average air temperature c and rh is the monthly average relative humidity in addition the statistical data such as irrigation water used iwu for srb was provided by the water resources bulletin of gansu province 2 3 data analysis all spatial data was simulated at the same spatial resolution of 1 km our data analysis methods mainly include temporal pearson correlation analysis spatially sen s trend test and partial correlation analysis on each pixel from 2000 to 2014 2 3 1 spatial trend test and partial correlation analysis in the mann kendall test another very useful index is sen s slope which is an unbiased estimator of monotonic trend magnitude extended by hirsch et al 1982 from the one proposed by sen 1968 the slope was performed to detect the spatial variation of trends in gppc etc and wuec during 2000 2014 on each pixel to explore the response of annual variations of each driving factor to wuec on each pixel we also chose partial correlation analysis between wuec and one driver after statistically controlling changes in the other drivers for example the partial correlation coefficient between wuec and ndvic was controlled the interrelationship between ndvic p and t 2 3 2 temporal correlation analysis to quantify the iav of gppc etc wuec climatic variables i e t p and vpd and human agricultural activities variables i e ndvic evic and iwu the following equation was used 2 x x i 1 x i i 2000 2013 where x i 1 was the following year variable x i was the current year variable and δx was the iav of the variables for temporal correlation analysis the pearson correlation coefficient was used in this study the correlation analysis was used to investigate the relationships between the iav of the variables 2 3 3 temporally relative contribution assessment temporally to quantify the relative contribution of human activities factors in the wsp to etc its mutation period was determined according to the mk mutation test kendall 1938 mann 1945 evic and iwu variations represent the influence of human activities in wsp using the basic idea of the partial differential equation all variables were normalization by the zero mean method and the etc variation n could be decomposed as follows 3 d e t c d t δ e t c δ e v i c δ e v i c δ t δ e t c δ i w u δ i w u δ t δ e t c δ c lim a t e δ c lim a t e δ t where evic and iwu are the enhanced vegetation index in cropland and irrigation water used in srb respectively climate represents etc variation due to climate factors change e g t p and vpd and the partial derivatives of etc with respect to the evic iwu and climate represent the contributions of those factors to etc variation then based on first order approximation the equation can be written as 4 δ e t c δ e t c δ e v i c δ e v i c δ e t c δ i w u δ i w u δ e t c c lim a t e where δetc δevic and δiwu are the difference of variables respectively the sum of the first and second terms is approximately the indication of the contribution of human activities factors to etc variation and the temporally relative contribution of etc can be expressed as follows 5 r c h u m a n δ e t c h u m a n δ e t c 100 6 r c c lim a t e 100 r c h u m a n where rcclimate and rchuman are the relative contribution of climate and human activities factors respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification of the ewue estimated from the modis products upon comparing the results of this study with other estimates in the literature to verify the effectiveness of the modis ewue the variation of the modis ewue was consistent with the results of the remote sensing calculations and model estimations xiao et al 2013 gao et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 du et al 2019 xiao et al 2013 reported ranges of the ewue in china were about 0 37 3 10 g c kg 1 h2o from 2003 to 2010 and zhu et al 2015 found approximately 0 36 3 89 g c kg 1 h2o from 2001 to 2010 all of which were consistent with our results which ranged from 0 00 4 68 g c kg 1 h2o recently du et al 2019 compared the two ewue datasets derived from the modis gpp and et products and from the glass gpp and et datasets for the north china the result concluded a high degree of consistency between the modis ewue and glass ewue rmse 0 21 r2 0 72 p 0 001 there was highest consistency between the values in the western central of north china r2 0 83 srb is located in the region hence the ewue values estimated using the modis products in this study were similar to the results of previous studies supporting the use of the modis products 3 2 variation of climate and human activities factors and wuec 3 2 1 variations of climate and human activities factors the seasonal patterns of the climate variables are shown in fig 2 the monthly p was 15 6 mm on average through all the year it was about 24 8 mm during the growing season between april and october on average with the peak value reaching 41 4 mm in july on the other hand it was only 2 3 mm during the nongrowing season on average with the lowest value reaching 1 1 mm in december the monthly t ranged from 12 3 c 22 0 c with a mean value of 7 4 c and the highest mean value occurred in july 20 4 c meanwhile the annual mean vpd showed an increased trend and varied between 0 55 kpa in 2007 and 0 68 kpa in 2013 with a mean value of 0 60 kpa the monthly mean vpd showed the highest mean value occurred in april 0 77 kpa and the lowest value in january 0 18 kpa overall it is obvious that the variations of p t and vpd from 2000 to 2014 represented typically seasonal trends for the srb which implied warm and wet growing seasons and cool and dry nongrowing seasons in terms of human activities factors fig 3 the monthly ndvic and evic were 0 29 and 0 20 on average through all the year fig 3a they were about 0 40 and 0 28 during the growing season on average with the peak value reaching 0 60 and 0 45 in july on the other hand they were only 0 13 and 0 08 during the nongrowing season on average with the lowest value reaching 0 08 and 0 07 in december consistent with the seasonal patterns of p and t which also indicated the better vegetation performance in growing season compared with nongrowing season the annual iwu is shown in fig 3b although iwu was decreased with rate of 0 03 billion m3 yr 1 from 2000 to 2014 the inter annual fluctuation is relatively greater especially from 2007 2014 the iwu increased slightly during the period 2000 2007 the highest iwu occurred at 2005 of 2 40 billion m3 with 0 18 billion m3 higher than the multi year average iwu the annual iwu decreased dramatically during the period 2007 2014 with a decreased rate of 0 064 billion m3 yr 1 the lowest value of the growing season iwu appeared in 2013 with a value of 1 83 billion m3 0 39 billion m3 less than the multi year average iwu which may be attributed to the effect of human activities factors in wsp and climate factors on water cycle 3 2 2 variations of gppc etc and wuec the monthly gppc reached its maximum value in july with a mean value of 126 59 g c m 2 month 1 fig 4a similarly the highest value of the monthly etc also occurred in july ranging from 33 55 mm month 1 to 63 06 mm month 1 fig 4b with a mean value of 38 96 mm month 1 during the growing season the mean etc was 29 19 mm month 1 which was about 60 higher than that during the nongrowing season 19 38 mm month 1 the monthly wuec ranged from 2 67 g c kg 1 h2o to 4 68 g c kg 1 h2o during the growing season the monthly wuec peaked in may fig 4c in addition the mean maximum and minimum values of wuec in the growing season were higher than those in the nongrowing season for example the mean values of wuec in growing seasons and nongrowing seasons were 2 33 g c kg 1 h2o and 0 10 g c kg 1 h2o respectively clearly gppc etc and wuec showed a synchronized seasonal variation trends to describe the spatial patterns of gppc etc and wuec variations their changing trends were analyzed pixel by pixel from 2000 to 2014 this showed gppc increased at a mean rate of 2 42 g c m 2 yr 1 fig 5a and etc slightly declined at a mean rate of 0 41 mm yr 1 the negative trend of etc mainly occurred in the id where the wsp was completed by 2010 fig 5b the negative trend of etc occupied approximately 51 28 of cropland area and that for the positive gppc covered about 62 89 of cropland area meanwhile the spatial pattern of annual gppc etc and wuec were correlated with climate and human activities in the srb uneven changes in environmental factors resulted in the variance in wuec tendencies over the 15 year period the positive wuec trend covered about 97 25 of the total cropland area with a slope of 0 017 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 fig 5c the spatial distribution of the mean annual wuec from 2000 to 2014 was shown in fig 5d the mean annual wuec was about 1 575 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 and varied from 0 710 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 to 2 927 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 the spatial variation of wuec indicated obvious regional heterogeneity fig 5d with relatively lower values located in the upstream cropland while higher values mainly occurred in the oasis in the middle and lower reaches the result also implies that water availability for cropland was limited the land was forced to respond to the water stress more efficiently miranda fernandes et al 2018 3 3 the response of wuec variation to climate and human activities factors 3 3 1 the response of wuec variation to t and p t wang et al 2014 and p poulter et al 2014 jung et al 2017 have been reported as the most important climate factors controlling the gpp and et variations trend analysis showed wuec increased during the period of 2000 2014 and spatially partial correlation analysis was used to further explore the individual effects of t and p on wuec from 2000 to 2014 fig 6 the partial correlation of wuec and t showed a positive relationship in most regions covering 82 5 of cropland area generally t mainly affects crop photosynthesis and evapotranspiration zhang et al 2012 xue et al 2015 sun et al 2016 for photosynthesis if the ambient t is lower than the optimal t of photosynthesis then increased t will promote photosynthesis and vice versa t affected the evapotranspiration process mainly by adjusting the stomatal conductance of crop below the threshold of t the stomatal conductance of crop is more open with an t increased and the effect of photosynthesis is greater than that of evapotranspiration meanwhile as an important part of climate change p significantly influenced the water cycle of the ecosystem p had a negative correlation with wuec in most regions accounting for 90 6 of the srb area high negative partial coefficients were found in the id of the wsp completed by 2010 recently numerous researches have discussed the effect of p on wue yu et al 2008 hu et al 2008 2010 guo et al 2019 yu et al 2008 also showed wue was negatively correlated with p variation in addition there are many studies that have shown that with the aggravation of drought wue first gradually increases and then decreases after the drought reaches a threshold xu et al 2019 overall in the cropland ecosystem of the srb wuec was negatively correlated with p however it showed a positive correlation with t in most regions for the downstream area a positive relationship between wuec and p was found in the north of the hongyashan id where the climate was warmer and drier fig 1 this is in accordance with huang et al 2015 who indicated that positive partial correlations of wue and p mainly occurred in warmer and drier regions due to water being the main limitation on gpp forcing a positive correlation between wue and annual p by enhance gpp knapp and smith 2001 nemani et al 2003 bai et al 2008 3 3 2 the response of wuec variation to ndvic and evic previous ec based and process based model ewue studies have showed that vegetation strongly affected ewue and even primarily determined the seasonal and annual variations of ewue hu et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 for example based on the model experiments scenario analysis zhang et al 2014 concluded that the increased wue over east asia during 1982 2006 was first attributed to the vegetation greening followed by the effects of climate factors however many studies have explored the t and p directly drive the water and energy cycle and further affect vegetation performance bagnoud et al 2001 blanken et al 2004 ding et al 2014 in contrast our partial correlation analysis explored the relationship between wuec and vegetation variations to remove the covariate effects of vegetation performance and climate factors t and p spatially a positive partial correlation coefficient for wuec and ndvic evic mainly occurred in the region of the wsp completed by 2010 fig 7 thus the wsp has successfully achieved the purpose of increasing low wuec by promoting advanced irrigation technology and adjusting crop planting structure some water intensive crops have been converted into cash crops 3 3 3 factors underlying wuec interannual variations we quantified the major driving factors of wuec variation and the effects of major drivers on wuec were also estimated by calculating the iav of human activities vegetation change and so on and climate air temperature precipitation and vpd factors to the variation of wuec fig 7 results show that both gppc and etc were negatively correlated with wuec by a correlation coefficient of 0 06 and 0 68 respectively indicating that the iav in wuec was mainly ascribed to the changes in etc and not determined by ndvic and evic by a correlation coefficient of 0 04 and 0 19 respectively the iav of gppc has a strongly positive correlation with ndvic and evic 0 84 0 85 indicating that the iav in gppc was mainly ascribed to the vegetation performance there is debate about whether variations in annual gpp would be positively or negatively correlated with that of wue some research indicates that plants in environments with and without sufficient water supply may have distinct water use strategies hu et al 2008 niu et al 2011 indicated that ewue responded negatively to climate warming while responding positively to increasing precipitation based on a 4 year manipulative field experiment in a temperate stope in northern china but wue may decrease or increase with annual precipitation increasing in different ecosystems depending on water condition and vegetation types tian et al 2010 in the cropland ecosystem of the srb the iav of wuec was positivity correlated with t 0 54 but negatively correlated with p 0 64 this is in accordance with hu et al 2008 under drier conditions with warming however without other water sources more water evaporated into the atmosphere decoupled from vegetation productivity with high gppc the iav of etc has a strong correlation with vpd 0 81 followed by p 0 80 this is because that water was the main limitation on etc irrigation was applied to maintain crop growth for agriculture in the arid and semiarid regions in such cases irrigated crop may transpire at its actual rate defined by atmospheric moisture demand because atmospheric moisture demand is also represented by vpd as a factor influencing the vegetation moisture relationship geruo et al 2020 thus vpd became the dominant factors that control the water cycle process furthermore the iav of vpd has a strongly negative correlation with p etc gppc ndvic and evic 0 91 0 81 0 63 0 60 0 62 indicating that vpd closely connected carbon water cycle and vegetation performance meanwhile in the water limited srb the response of vpd would be considerably more important in variations of the water cycle process compared with the carbon cycle in the cropland of the srb it is likely that vpd determines the iav in etc and hence wuec which is in accordance with hu et al 2008 the high vpd driven transpiration water loss decoupled from vegetation productivity may lead to high wuec guo et al 2019 and the increasing of wuec will ultimately result in decreasing in water consumption which will alleviate water shortages in the srb in addition wuec formulation could be considered to link wuec and vpd in srb such as an inherent wue iwue gpp vpd et at the ecosystem scale was proposed by beer and ciais 2009 and zhou et al 2014 2015 2016 introduced the concept of underlying wue given by uwue gpp vpd0 5 et in terms of human activities factors the iav of iwu had a negative correlation with wuec variation 0 48 but positively correlated with etc 0 52 therefore the improved irrigation technology had probably played a significant role in promoting wuec mainly by reducing water consumption although iav in wuec was mainly ascribed to the changes in etc and not determined by ndvic and evic the iavs of ndvic and evic had a very high correlation coefficient with gppc and etc they even explained 63 and 73 of etc variation and of 84 and 85 gppc variation respectively corresponding to fig 5 and fig 7 vegetation performance was closely connected with gppc and etc variations therefore adjusting crop planting structure is also very important in this region in improving wuec as a conclusion wsp had probably played an important role in promoting wuec by improving irrigation technology and adjusting crop planting structure 3 4 implications of water saving project on water cycle hao et al 2017 showed that the implementation of the ctsrb had a significantly positive effect in regard to the groundwater resource recovery in the minqin during the first decade of the program and also verified the effects of watershed groundwater restoration polices corresponding measures of the wsp involve promoting advanced water saving technologies and adjusting crop plant pattern to increased wuec in the srb and the iav in wuec was mainly ascribed to the changes in etc fig 8b water consumption decreased in the cropland mainly occurred in the id where the wsp was completed by 2010 fig 5b especially a large proportion of the cropland of srb showed wet trend in the last decades fu et al 2019 due to the effect of human activities and climate change in the srb to further clarify the relative contribution of climate change and human activities to etc variation we figured out the mutation point of etc decrease as shown in fig 9 etc decline started in 2007 this finding is consistent with the annual variation of iwu for the srb fig 3b besides annual etc was plotted against potential evapotranspiration in cropland petc revealed in fig 10 further regression analysis of pre 2007 and post 2007 point to human activities factors rather than climate factors as the dominant factors of driving regional crop consumptive water use for similar petc lower etc is noticeable from the regression lines after 2007 that is similar water demand or maximum water at large scale lower the actual amount of water evaporated from the entire region after years of water saving technology popularization hence water saving measures probably changed the hydrological cycle through adjusting etc after wsp furthermore to quantify the contribution of human activities factors in wsp to the etc variation iwu and vegetation index were used to represent the human activities factors in wsp due to the aim of wsp iwu was used to represent the improving irrigation technology regarding the vegetation index as mentioned above the iavs of ndvic and evic explained 63 and 73 of etc variation respectively fig 8 evic was used to represent the adjusting crop planting structure due to its better explained the variation of etc results indicated that the relative contribution of human activities factor in water saving management was extremely low before the mutation point only accounting for 26 3 while after the mutation point human activities in wsp contribution to etc increased to 77 5 fig 11 this further proves that water availability increase was mainly artificially controlled by the effect of the wsp rather than that of climate factors 4 conclusions in this study we explored the variations and major driving factors in wuec under the changing environment to clarify the effects of the wsp in the srb it was revealed that increased wuec area occupied 97 25 of the total cropland area of the srb since 2000 etc decreasing pixel mainly occurred in the irrigation districts of wsp completed by 2010 then we explained the effects of climate and human activities factors on the variations of wuec and its major driving factors the iav of wuec was mainly determined by etc 68 rather than gppc 6 thus the study quantified the contribution of human activities factors in the wsp to etc variation further clarified water availability increase is mainly artificially controlled by the effect of wsp rather than that of climate factors overall which serves as a valuable reference for the effectiveness of a wsp and the reasonable utilization of regional water resource management and allocation strategies in the srb the vpd was shown to play a more important role in the underlying wuec interannual variations further studies are also required wuec formulation could be considered to link wuec and vpd namely using the developed wuec formulation to better assess spatial temporal dynamics of developed wuec and its response to agricultural water management in addition given the improvement in wuec being related to the change in crop biomass production in different crop types not only in the srb it is also of great necessity to explore the spatial variations of crop biomass production in different crop types by remote sensing in the future declaration

used historical climate data and low salinity irrigation water in the subsequent period 2018 2050 irrigation continued with rcw and projected meteorological conditions were obtained by considering expected future climate change the average soil water salinity ecsw at the end of the simulation period ranged from 2 9 10 5 ds m across all soils and crops potential yields of salt sensitive crops such as annual horticulture and almonds were reduced by 4 32 due to increased salinity in the soil similarly the model predicted that the sodium adsorption ratio sar and exchangeable sodium percentage

burgeoning global human population requires large amounts of freshwater to be allocated to agriculture however in many parts of the world especially under arid and semiarid climate water demand has already exceeded water supply provided by fresh surface and groundwater resources fao 2012 famiglietti 2014 un environment 2019 the scarcity of water supplies coupled with the need for urban communities to manage large quantities of water from sewage treatment plants has led to increasing interest in the recirculation of this water for irrigating crops consequently treated wastewater is recognized as an important alternative water source for supporting crop production qadir et al 2010 grattan et al 2015 and is increasingly being adopted in irrigation water allocation schemes for arid and semiarid regions where water scarcity is severe hamilton et al 2007 otoo and drechsler 2018 generally usage of rcw can have both positive and negative impacts on crops and soils depending on the water quality and the extent and duration of exposure the benefits include reducing freshwater demand recycling nutrients and minimizing the discharge of pollutants into waterways hanjraa et al 2012 hassena et al 2018 furthermore several investigations have reported improvements in soil fertility status nutrient uptake plant growth and yield potential e g singh et al 2012 lal et al 2015 minhas et al 2015 elfanssi et al 2018 hassena et al 2018 similarly some other investigations reported that irrigation with rcw had no detrimental effects on tree growth and productivity parsons et al 2001 morgan et al 2008 nor upon soil physico chemical properties e g andrews et al 2016 however the prolonged and indiscriminate use of rcw can result in the accumulation of ions in roots and leaves potentially reaching toxic levels paudel et al 2016 damage plantations and decrease the yield noshadi et al 2013 it may further increase soil salinity and sar which can lead to the development of sodicity hazards high exchangeable sodium in the soils bardhan et al 2016 assouline et al 2016 qian and lin 2019 phogat et al 2020 these conditions can degrade the soil hydraulic properties and thus

different prospective crops considered for expanding irrigated horticulture and agriculture in the nap region in south australia a much improved understanding of the spatiotemporal soil solution and exchange dynamics allows identifying conditions including mitigating measures required for the sustainable use of recycled water for irrigated crops the outcome of these long term simulations accounting for future climate predictions helps in devising better irrigation guidelines for growing horticultural and vegetable crops 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study site the northern adelaide plains nap south australia will experience a considerable expansion of irrigated agriculture and horticulture based predominantly on the utilization of increasingly available recycled water rcw from the bolivar treatment plant the goyder institute for water research 2016 the wastewater is treated using the dissolved air flotation and filtration daff technique through a tertiary process of filtration and disinfection making it suitable for irrigating horticultural crops the nap has a mediterranean type climate which is characterized by hot dry summers and cool to cold winters long term 1900 2016 average rainfall in the region amounts to 475 mm department of environment water and natural resources 2016 and annual evapotranspiration amounts to 1308 mm with most of the rainfall occurring in the winter months crop production requires intensive irrigation fourteen representative soil profiles were excavated to determine the relevant physico chemical properties of the main soil groups oliver et al 2018 samples consisted of disturbed soil for the particle size analysis and undisturbed cores for measurements of the bulk density the water content matric suction relationship and the saturated hydraulic conductivity the soil samples were collected from 0 10 10 30 and 30 60 cm and selectively also from lower depths 60 90 and 90 120 cm a detailed description of different soil profiles and their physico chemical properties can be found in oliver et al 2018 undisturbed soil cores collected from the field were first used to measure the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks using the constant head method of youngs 2001 subsequently the soil water retention characteristic was determined by placing the cores onto saturated ceramic plates connected to either hanging water columns 0 1 4 and 8 kpa or subjected to positive gas nitrogen pressures 33 60 and 100 kpa in sealed chambers other soil samples were used to measure the soil water content at 1500 kpa

grapes almond pistachio pasture carrot onion and carrot initially the model was warmed up for 48 years from july 1970 to june 2018 using climate parameters from the bureau of meteorology bom station no 023083 at the edinburgh raaf site latitude 34 7111 longitude 138 6222 elevation 17 m to initialize the soil water balance and to attain equilibrium conditions for chemical species for each soil crop combination the future climate 2018 2050 data were taken from the goyder institute climate change median climate projections charles and fu 2015 the median data is based on the downscaled series obtained from the gfdl esm2m global climate model gcm one of the six better performing gcms which are deemed to provide more realistic inputs for impacts and adaptation assessment than those from the six poorer gcms note that the range of a possible future climate change is larger than that obtained from only using the downscaled results from the six better gcms a median decrease in annual rainfall by 2050 is 6 8 relative to the 1986 2005 baseline the 10th percentile decrease is 8 8 and the 95th percentile decrease is 3 5 for the intermediate emission representative concentration

co2 equivalent in the year 2100 without ever exceeding that value moss et al 2010 a single climate future is used rather than a range of climate futures to keep the overall number of modeling scenarios manageable as a result the simulations present one possible outcome a detailed description of the hydrus 1d model is available from šimůnek et al 2013 and šimůnek et al 2016 the one dimensional richards equation which assumes that the air phase plays an insignificant role in liquid flow processes and that water flow due to thermal gradients can be neglected is solved in hydrus 1d using a galerkin type linear finite element scheme šimůnek et al 2013 the governing one dimensional water flow equation is described as 1 θ t z k h h z cos α s h z t where θ is the soil water content

direction and the vertical axis e g 1 for vertical flow and 0 for horizontal flow and s h z t is a sink term accounting for water uptake by plant roots l3l 3t 1 the hydrus 1d model will be run with best available soil crop climate and irrigation management parameters the soil parameters are mostly directly measured on representative soil samples or estimated using auxiliary soil data most of the crop parameters are from the literature although some calibrated parameters were available for wine grapes climate data is in part measured on site for historical climate and in part derived from downscaled climate projections irrigation management parameters were obtained from surveys these data sets are discussed next the model was thus not specifically calibrated as preference was given to use the measured input parameters note that estimating model parameters through calibration using an inadequate conceptual model could lead to so called parameter bias enemark et al 2019 3 soil

the parameters θr θs k s α and n for different soils were derived from the measurements on soil cores from 14 soil profiles from the nap as described in section 2 1 mean parameter values were then derived for the 5 most important textural soils groups table 1 3 1 solute transport properties for unsatchem the major ion chemistry module unsatchem enables the simulation of equilibrium geochemical reactions involving ca mg na k so4 cl no3 h4sio4 hco3 and co2 šimůnek and suarez 1997 šimůnek et al 2013 the model accounts for equilibrium chemical reactions between these components such as aqueous complexation cation exchange and precipitation dissolution for the precipitation dissolution of calcite and dissolution of dolomite either equilibrium or multicomponent kinetic expressions are used which include both forward and back reactions other precipitation dissolution reactions considered involve gypsum caso4 2h2o hydromagnesite mg5 co3 4 oh 2 4h2o nesquehonite mgco3 3h2o and sepiolite mg2si3o7 5 oh 3h2o since the ionic strength of soil solutions can vary considerably with time and space and often reach high values both modified debye hückel and pitzer expressions are incorporated into the model as options to calculate single ion activities the geochemical model considered aqueous gaseous adsorbed precipitated and complexed phases šimůnek and suarez 1997 šimůnek et al 2013

model warming up period 1970 2018 3 2 estimation of potential evaporation es and potential transpiration tp the hydrus 1d unsatchem šimůnek et al 2016 model requires daily inputs of rainfall as well as potential evaporation es and potential transpiration tp therefore the daily es and tp values for all crops wine grape almond pistachio pasture carrot onion and potato for current and future climates were estimated following the fao 56 dual crop coefficient dcc approach allen et al 1998 the fao 56 dcc methodology requires a considerable amount of data for crops soils and climate all relevant information and required data for this approach for the nap soils and crops are included in mallants et al 2019 and phogat et al 2020 daily climate data for the historic climate 1970 2018 was obtained from the bureau of meteorology bom edinburg raaf station while future climate 2018 2050 data was taken from the goyder climate change median climate projections for the same station charles and fu 2015 apart from daily es and tp the irrigation requirements for different crops almonds wine grape pistachios pasture carrot onion and potato were also estimated following the fao 56 dual crop coefficient dcc approach allen et al 1998 as discussed in detail by mallants et al 2019 for wine grapes measured lai values were taken from similar studies phogat et al 2016 2017 in the study area also values for canopy geometry and fractional cover for wine grape previously calibrated by phogat et al 2016 have been used here the functional relation followed in the fao dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 is given as 12 etc kcb ke et0 where etc is the crop evapotranspiration lt 1 et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration lt 1 kcb is the basal crop coefficient which represents the plant transpiration component and ke is the soil evaporation coefficient some of the basic information such as kcb crop duration plant height rooting depth and depletion factor is available from fao 56 allen et al 1998 the details on data requirements and other relevant information for each crop soil and climate conditions can be found in mallants et al 2019 in this approach standard kcb values allen et al 1998 of the crops were adjusted for the local climate taking into consideration crop height wind speed and minimum relative humidity averages estimated kcb s in the current study compares well with previous calibrated values for wine grape phogat et al 2017 soil specific information soil texture field capacity θfc permanent wilting point θwp readily available water raw total available water taw has been drawn from the soil analyses oliver et al 2018 the values of daily potential transpiration tp and soil evaporation es thus obtained were used as time variable boundary conditions in the hydrus model along with the irrigation schedule for different crops and precipitation received at the site during the simulation period the amount and timing of irrigation were also imposed as a time variable flux boundary 3 3 root water uptake parameters water extraction s h hs x z t from the soil is computed according to the feddes macroscopic approach feddes et al 1978 in this method the potential transpiration rate tp is distributed over the root zone using a normalized root density distribution function β x z t and multiplied by dimensionless water α 1 h and salinity α 1 hs stress response functions as 13 s h h s x z t α 1 h h s x z t s p x z t α 1 h h s x z t β x z t t p t this model reduces potential plant root water uptake rates according to the local soil water pressure head h and osmotic head hs at any point in the root zone this model defines how potential transpiration tp is reduced when the soil is no longer capable of supplying the amount of water required by plants under prevailing climatic and soil conditions the multiplicative model for the uptake reduction due to the osmotic stress is considered in this study 14 α 1 h h s α 1 h α 1 h s the reduction of root water uptake due to the water stress α 1 h is described as 15 α 1 h 0 h h 1 o r h h 4 h h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 h h 1 1 h 3 h h 2 h h 4 h 3 h 4 h 4 h h 3 where h 1 h 2 h 3 and h 4 are the threshold model parameters water uptake is at the potential rate when the pressure head is between h 2 and h 3 decreases linearly when h h 2 or h h 3 and becomes zero when h h 4 or h h 1 these critical values of the pressure head for viticulture and perennial horticulture e g almond for the study were taken from previous investigations in south australia e g phogat et al 2012 2013 2017 and other available literature e g taylor and ashcroft 1972 and the hydrus database the threshold model uses two variables to simulate the osmotic stress α 1 hs the osmotic head below which water is extracted at the maximum rate and the slope i e a fractional reduction of water uptake per a unit increase in the osmotic head above the threshold these parameters were obtained from zhang et al 2002 for wine grapes sanden et al 2004 for pistachios and ayers and westcot 1985 for other crops 3 4 irrigation water quality average seasonal recycled water rcw quality data was obtained from awad et al 2019 the mean seasonal composition for rcw was estimated from raw data from 2002 2017 the final values used for the modeling study are given in table 3 the water quality falls into the medium category for the salinity rating in australia anzecc armcanz 2000 which means that moderately tolerant crops can be grown using rcw as an irrigation source the chemical composition of rainwater was obtained from cresswell et al 2010 for the adelaide region table 3 in this study two irrigation systems were identified on the basis of a survey undertaken among the farmers overhead sprinklers potato carrots cauliflower broccoli cabbage lettuce and drippers almonds wine grapes tomatoes for sprinkler irrigation water application is relatively uniform across the soil surface thus leading to one dimensional flow and solute migration the use of the one dimensional hydrus model is thus appropriate for drip irrigation flow and solute transport is quasi three dimensional in the radial direction away from the dripper therefore the use of a one dimensional model may not be entirely correct the discrepancies in both water content and salinity are likely highest at the edge of the wetting zone surrounding the dripper how much this impacts crop growth will depend on the spatial distribution of the rooting system relative to the position of the drippers previous work by phogat et al 2014 with a two dimensional model with drip irrigation applied to a mandarin tree clearly showed the non homogeneous salt redistribution surrounding the dripper under the dripper salt levels were the lowest while highest salinity was observed at the edge of the wetted soil area our one dimensional may capture the water and salt distribution just underneath the dripper but not at the edges estimating the impact of this simplification on crop yield was beyond the scope of this study 3 5 modeling domain initial and boundary conditions simulations for all crops were performed for a 200 cm deep soil profile divided into 100 finite elements the finite element nodes were distributed with a nodal density of 0 5 at the surface and 1 at the bottom to ensure a fine discretization at the soil surface where major water and solute dynamics processes take place the domain was divided into 5 soil layers 0 15 15 30 30 60 60 100 and 100 200 cm to accommodate the measured textural heterogeneity in various soil groups cal hrb soc and dug in the nap area determined by soil sampling and the particle size analysis at the soil surface an atmospheric boundary condition with surface runoff was imposed and a free drainage boundary condition was applied at the bottom boundary for solute transport a concentration flux boundary condition was used at the soil surface and a zero concentration gradient boundary condition was imposed at the bottom to allow gravitational outflow with drainage water a constant pressure head of 100 cm was considered to initiate the model runs measured daily rainfall and calculated daily es and ep for different crops were applied during the warmup period 1970 2018 measured soil solution and exchange parameters table 2 were assumed as initial conditions for the multi component solute transport module while cultivation methods may affect the soil properties over the years we assume that the measured soil physical and hydraulic properties reflect such tillage effects and remain constant over the simulation period furthermore even though the location of horticultural crops is not static across multiple years as long as sprinkler irrigation is applied water is rather uniformly distributed over the cropped area in response to the crop et demand this means that salinity distribution is rather uniform in space and therefore assuming the same exposure over many years is justified tree crops however have a fixed location across the years so the salt distribution is likely less uniform especially under drip irrigation the long term impact of use of rcw will then depend among others on the spatial distribution of the root system relative to the location of the drippers two dimensional salinity distribution under drip irrigation was demonstrated by phogat et al 2014 4 results and discussion 4 1 impact of rcw irrigation on ph and salinity ecsw dynamics in the soil periodic changes in the profile averaged ph ecsw sar and esp in different soils under recycled water rcw irrigation of almonds are shown in fig 1 corresponding chemical variables for other crops during selected years are listed in table 4 the initial profile averaged ph which ranged from 7 9 to 8 3 in different soils gradually converged to a narrow range 8 2 8 3 at the end of the simulation fig 1 soil ph in cal and dug soils decreased during the early years 3 4 years following the application of rcw irrigation while it increased slightly in the other two soils hrb and soc the ph remained more or less constant after that and attained a steady state condition in all soils fig 1 for the other crops rcw irrigation had a similar impact on soil ph where differences between initial and final values were within a 0 21 to 0 32 range data not shown quan and lin 2019 observed a 0 25 0 3 increase in the initial soil ph 7 1 7 5 during 11 years of recycled water irrigation of landscape facilities however a soil ph higher than 8 can reduce the micro nutrient availability to the crops which in turn can impact the normal growth and development of trees and other crop plants previous work in the nap area by stevens et al 2004 also did not observe any significant differences in the soil ph due to rcw irrigation for periods between 10 28 years concentrations of soluble salts in the soil solution ecsw increased rapidly as a result of irrigation with rcw of all crops fig 1 table 4 in almonds the average profile ecsw in the soil almost attained a steady value within 2 3 years final ecsw values in 2050 varied from 4 33 to 5 15 ds m across different soils similarly the corresponding values under wine grape pistachios pasture mix carrot onion and potato ranged from 4 0 4 7 3 8 6 7 5 5 6 4 5 8 6 6 6 1 6 2 and 4 0 9 5 ds m respectively table 4 these results corroborate well with stevens et al 2004 who reported that ece values ranged between 2 8 and 6 9 ds m for 10 28 years of rcw irrigation of different crops in the same region however maximum salinity values irrespective of the crop were observed during 2034 which was projected to be a drought year with an annual rainfall of 247 mm compared to other crops the average profile ecsw build up in the soil under potato was higher in cal and hrb soils table 4 this was probably due to a potato oats rain fed cropping sequence adopted in the study after 7 years of irrigation 2025 ecsw in these soils was twice as high as in the other two soils under potato and other crops this pattern continued until the end of the simulation 2050 overall the salinity build up in the cal and hrb soils in 2050 was double than observed in the other two soils table 4 therefore the use of rcw irrigation can have a varied and significant impact on the soil salinity build up under different cropping sequences which subsequently may have a dramatic impact on crop yields however responses of crops to salinity are influenced by several factors including climate irrigation or agronomic management for example leaching of soluble salts using low salinity water is one way to bring the effective rootzone salinity below the crop threshold value to attain optimal yield and thus to control the harmful impact of salts associated with recycled water irrigation on the other hand ecsw showed an increasing trend from the soil surface to lower depths irrespective of soil and crop type for example in almond ecsw attained a value larger than 5 ds m everywhere below a depth of 40 cm after 7 years of irrigation fig 2 at deeper depths 80 cm ecsw increased quickly to a value of more than 5 ds m in all soils after about 5 7 years of irrigation see fig 2 the first column similar patterns of spatiotemporal changes in ecsw were also observed for other crops table 4 interestingly ecsw was always below 3 ds m in the surface soil zone 0 30 cm during the entire simulation period 2018 2050 which is well below the critical threshold salinity for vegetables almond and clover maas and hoffmann 1977 however the average profile ecsw values are higher than the salinity threshold for vegetables carrot potato and onion ecsw 2 3 4 ds m mixed pasture clover 3 ds m and almonds 3 ds m similar to that for wine grapes 4 2 ds m but much lower than those for mixed pasture rye grass 11 2 ds m and pistachio 18 8 ds m it is generally accepted that soils with ece larger than 4 ds m ecsw of 8 ds m are considered as saline soils u s salinity lab staff 1994 the previous work by stevens et al 2003 for the nap soils considered ece of 3 ds m as a salinity threshold for vegetable crops ec sw higher than the crop salinity threshold can adversely affect the normal growth development and yield of horticultural and vegetable crops hence leaching of soluble salts with low salinity water is essential to bring the effective rootzone salinity below the crop salinity threshold among different soils cal and hrb displayed high salinity at lower depths soc had the lowest ecsw and dug had values in between those of the other soils pistachio is a highly salinity tolerant crop that is potentially the most suitable for cultivation in salt affected soils sepaskhah and maftoun 1981 ferguson et al 2002 and sanden et al 2004 showed the viability of using saline water with an ec of 8 ds m which showed no impact on the pistachio yield notably the salinity tolerance of pistachio similarly as of many other woody species have been associated with a small growth reduction sepaskhah and maftoun 1988 picchioni et al 1990 a small decrease in the photosynthetic activity including a high chlorophyll index chlorophyll fluorescence and chlorophyll content and the transpiration rate walker et al 1988 karimi and maleki kuhbanani 2015 momenpour and imani 2018 smaller amounts of salt ions transported to the leaves walker et al 1987 picchioni et al 1990 the ability to maintain relative high k na and ca2 na ratios needed for osmotic adjustment and enzymatic activities chelli chaabouni et al 2010 hajiboland et al 2014 and a smaller nut yield reduction sanden et al 2004 ferguson et al 2010 picchioni et al 1990 the high salt tolerance of pistachio is attributed to the ability to store large amounts of na in the roots and basal stem maintaining normal growth under salinity stress is associated with the ability of plants to reduce water losses and ensure an osmotic adjustment at the cellular level munns 2002 however other studies saandatmand et al 2007 karimi et al 2011 reported that high salinity stress could negatively affect the photosynthesis rate the morphology of leaves and the nutrient balance of pistachio trees the maximum soil salinity value reached during the simulations ecsw 13 7 ds m at 120 200 cm depth in 2047 data not shown which is still below the crop threshold suggests that pistachio could be a viable option for rcw irrigation in the nap area 4 2 changes in sodium adsorption ratio sar the long term use of recycled water for irrigation resulted in a considerable increase in sar for all soils and all crops figs 1 2 table 4 for example after 7 8 years of irrigation sar in all soil except for hrb under almond increased to a value larger than 10 fig 1 similarly for other crops sar increased rapidly and its profile averaged values ranged between 5 5 and 16 6 table 4 during the same time after 7 8 years of irrigation subsequently sar continued to increase with the use of rcw irrigation for almost attaining a constant value after about 15 years of rcw irrigation note that sar at lower depths 100 cm in hard clay and calcareous soils had a delayed response to rcw irrigation fig 2 the profile averaged sar values at the end of the simulation were between 10 and 20 in all soils and for all crops table 4 sar values at soil depths larger than 50 cm were greater than 15 in all soils and comparatively higher values in dug and cal soils fig 2 stevens et al 2003 reported an increase in sar in the top soil by a factor of three relative to virgin soil which is similar to our simulations for similar rcw sar 8 7 for stevens et al versus 8 1 for this study an increasing soil sar triggers an exchange of cations between the soil solution and soil cation exchange complex which increases the soil esp sar values greater than 13 indicate a potential for sodic soil development us salinity lab staff 1954 high sar values suggest that the long term use of irrigation with recycled water can induce sodicity hazards which could have a severe impact on the sustainable production of pastures and perennial and annual horticultural crops soil sar is a dynamic property that depends on the composition of the soil solution when the measurements are made however the soil specific inherent bio geochemical and ion exchange reactions can have a great impact on the composition of the soil solution and exchange although the profile averaged sar varied in a rather narrow range 12 1 19 5 in different soil crop combinations these values are much higher than the threshold values reported in rangasamy et al 1984 i e sar1 5 3 which may result in adverse soil impacts based on the fao fao 1985 criteria for sodicity sar values predicted in our study are in the range of the light to moderate or moderate to high sodicity hazard class this suggests that the use of recycled water irrigation can lead to the development of high esp levels in the soil high esp causes reductions in the hydraulic conductivity mcneal 1968 1974 for the nap soils that would be in the range of 20 to 40 mallants et al 2019 the precise extent of any adverse impacts due to high sar is determined by factors such as concentrations of soluble salts the leaching fraction rainfall amounts and the type and content of clay in the soil anzecc armcanz 2000 4 3 impact on exchangeable sodium percentage esp the initial measured esp values in the soils ranged between 7 9 and 24 oliver et al 2018 and varied slightly during the warm up period 1970 2018 when low salinity water was used however a rapid increase in esp occurred in response to the use of rcw for irrigation figs 1 2 table 4 while the profile averaged esp 21 8 in the cal soil doubled the corresponding esp in the soc soil increased roughly 3 times relative to its initial value reaching 28 7 after 32 years of irrigation fig 1 such increases in esp were observed for all soil crop combinations table 4 at the end of the simulation 2050 the corresponding profile averaged esp across all crops ranged between 40 7 47 5 48 9 53 6 23 9 31 3 and 31 6 38 7 in the cal hrb soc and dug soils respectively table 4 an increase in esp relative to its initially measured values in response to rcw irrigation varied from 18 8 27 1 18 6 24 7 15 4 22 3 and 7 1 15 0 in the cal hrb soc and dug soils respectively the maximum esp ranging between 40 and 60 was observed in the hrb soil at the end of the simulation fig 1 this demonstrates that the use of rcw over the years results in a rapid increase in esp which may render the soil unfit for crop production calculated esp values were above their threshold value 6 is non sodic in all soils at all depths normally shallow depths had lower esp compared to deeper soil layers fig 2 for example the average initial esp in the hrb soil in the surface layer 0 15 cm under almond was 17 7 which increased to 56 6 in the 120 200 cm layer at the end of the simulation esp at soil depths larger than 40 cm typically was between 40 and 60 in all soils however the hrb and cal soils showed comparatively higher esp 35 than other soils irrigation with recycled water tends to increase the na content on the soil exchange complex an increase in the na content on the soil exchange complex relative to ca and mg may induce soil swelling and dispersion of clay and organic matter impact soil water movement water logging and degrade the soil structure these conditions may decrease oxygen concentrations and ultimately impact the plant growth this condition is therefore considered to be a significant barrier to a sustainable irrigation practice the amount of dispersed clay is also affected by soil mineralogy soil solution constituents e g salinity and organic matter nrmmc ephc 2006 therefore soil amendments such as gypsum compost or other organic materials would be required to control esp below its threshold esp 6 and provide a congenial environment for normal crop growth the range of sar and esp observed in this study can have severe impacts on the clay dispersion clogging of macropores and degradation of the soil structure which ultimately negatively affects crop growth and yield and long term sustainability of crops therefore irrigation with recycled water should be supplemented with an adequate amount of soil amendments such as gypsum and organic matter compost to avoid the harmful impacts on soils and crops 4 4 yield salinity relationship the modeling results presented in previous sections clearly indicated that irrigation with rcw increased the soil solution salinity ecsw for all investigated crops to estimate the effect of increased salinity on crop yield the yield salinity relations were drawn following the maas and hoffman 1977 piecewise linear regression this model is given as y r 100 b e c s w 1 e c t where yr is the relative yield ecsw1 is the profile average soil salinity at a given time ect is the crop tolerance threshold salinity and b is a decrease in yield in percent in response to per unit increase in salinity ds m above the threshold value calculations based on this model only indicate the impact of soluble salts on the possible reduction in the potential yield furthermore high esp can lead to an additive or multiplicative effect on the yield reduction due to its adverse impact on soil physical conditions of the soil the latter effect was not quantified here the extent of average profile salinity ecsw1 in soils under different crops ranged from 2 9 to 10 6 ds m the green background in fig 3 with an overall mean of 5 5 ds m across all soils and crops these salinities developed over 32 years of recycled water irrigation in the nap soils these values correspond very well with some of the previous studies in the nap region which assessed the impact of the long term 10 28 years use of recycled water for irrigation stevens et al 2003 2004 however their study focused on analyses of soils unirrigated virgin soils rcw irrigated soils and groundwater irrigated soils that had received different irrigation waters while the impact on crop yields was not investigated the model simulated annual profile average salinity ecsw1 for different crops was used to estimate the reduction in the potential yield fig 3 the yield reduction for the 10th tile mean and 90th tile profile averaged salinities for different soils are shown in table 5 pistachios and pasture rye grass would not experience a significant yield loss because they are tolerant crops a yield reduction of almonds due to recycled water irrigation varied from 9 to 22 depending on the soil type a reduction in wine grapes is comparatively low 0 5 7 due to a higher tolerance to salinity a comparison of almond yields grown in the nap pitt et al 2017 and riverland regions phogat et al 2013 average yield of 8 years revealed that the almond yield in the nap region was only 50 of that in the riverland region the major difference between the two sites was the water quality used for irrigation climate and the soil type more sandy in riverland in the riverland almonds are irrigated with the river murray water which has a much lower salinity 0 4 ds m phogat et al 2018a than recycled water groundwater or blended water 0 8 1 9 ds m phogat et al 2018b used in the nap region the current hypothesis is that the use of rcw in the nap region pitt et al 2017 with its high soil salinity soil profile ecse 2 7 5 ds m might have contributed greatly to the reduction in the almonds yield the yield reduction in clover pasture ranged from 12 to 23 8 therefore under mixed pasture conditions rye grass and clover rcw irrigation can potentially impact the clover crop similarly among annual horticulture crops almost one third of the potential yield in onion 23 5 34 9 and potato 23 5 34 9 could be lost due to salinity stress the corresponding yield loss for carrot and brassicas ranged from 19 6 to 32 4 and from 5 8 to 14 7 respectively salinity impacts on crops are influenced by climate irrigation and agronomic management rhodes and loveday 1990 generally most vegetable crops suffer a 10 yield reduction at an ece of 2 7 0 8 ds m ecsw1 2 ece anzecc armcanz 2000 therefore appropriate management of irrigation induced soil salinity is essential for sustainable crop production in the nap soils the effectiveness of mitigation scenarios is reported in mallants et al 2019 and will not be discussed here 4 5 sodicity development the nap soils are inherently sodic with a high na content in the soil solution and on the exchange complex especially at deeper depths matheson and lobban 1974 even the virgin soils have been shown to have sar as high as 44 at lower depths stevens et al 2003 however rcw containing sarw sar of water of 8 12 2 can have a significant impact on an increase in the soil sar the data in the current study showed that a rapid increase in the soil solution sar occurred due to the use of rcw for irrigation overall average increases in the profile averaged sar values as a result of rcw irrigation in the cal hrb soc and dug soils were equal to 17 4 15 8 13 3 and 13 8 respectively and corresponding increase esp values in response to rcw irrigation was 22 7 21 6 19 4 and 10 5 respectively table 4 it is well understood that high sar of the soil solution can potentially modify the cation dynamics in the soil solution as well as on the soil exchange complex high sar ultimately leads to the development of high esp in the soils however there is no universally accepted relationship that can define the intricate dynamics between the soil solution and the soil cation exchange complex similarly there is no universal understanding of the critical esp value to categorize the sodic soils in australia a sodic soil is defined as the soil which has an esp larger than 6 northcote and skene 1972 however the american classification of sodic soils has an esp threshold of 15 us salinity lab staff 1954 this difference is attributed to several factors including differences in electrolyte concentrations ph organic matter contents and the clay type and contents and the way such differences in soil chemistry affect the critical esp above which clay dispersion and hydraulic conductivity reduction occur rengasamy and olsson 1991 measuring esp is complicated and time consuming and therefore alternative parameters which can better characterize sodic soils have been sought after many studies e g rengasamy et al 1984 suggested sar as an alternative indicator for sodic soils since sar is highly correlated with the soil esp and can be more conveniently measured numerous studies have attempted to find a relation between sare sar of the saturation extract and esp of the soils in different parts of the world us salinity lab staff 1954 paliwal and gandhi 1976 shainberg et al 1980 evangelou and marsi 2003 seilsepour et al 2009 chi et al 2011 these approximate relationships vary according to site specific soil parameters such as the clay content and mineralogy of the soils similarly rengasamy et al 1984 extended this relation between sar1 5 and esp for australian soils similar to those in the current study to facilitate the soil classification fig 5 similarly chi et al 2011 found that there were non significant differences in the esp development from the approximate log relations with sare or sar1 5 as for the soils of the nap region rengasamy et al 1984 found a linear relationship esp 1 95 sar 1 85 r2 0 82 between sar1 5 and esp whereas stevens et al 2003 reported a curvilinear esp 5 36 sar0 65 r2 0 83 relationship fig 4 stevens et al 2003 hypothesized that the inclusion of the soil analysis of deeper layers up to 1 m might change the nature of the relationship as the former study only analyzed samples from surface layers 0 45 cm we attempted to draw similar relationships to understand the impact of rcw irrigation on sodicity development in the soils a strong relationship was found between the irrigation induced sar and the resulting soil esp fig 4 both linear as well as curvilinear regressions models showed good agreement with an r2 of 0 89 and 0 92 respectively since the simulations provided sufficient sar esp data for all soil types we have derived separate relationships between sar and esp for different nap soils fig 5 there was a good curvilinear relationship between sar and esp with r2 values of 0 91 0 93 and 0 94 for the cal hrb and soc soils respectively however the relation for the dug soils was poor r2 0 29 the initially high esp of these soils may have influenced the rate of na exchange between the soil solution and the exchange phase which may in turn have resulted in the lower esp build up in response to recycled water irrigation more importantly the relations in fig 5 suggest that different sar thresholds exist which could lead to soil esp exceeding the threshold value of esp 6 indeed the sar thresholds sarth that would cause esp to exceed its threshold are as follows sarth 4 for calcareous soils sarth 3 5 for hard red brown soils sarth 6 for sand over clay soils and sarth 3 for deep uniform to gradational soils rengasamy et al 1984 suggested a common sar 3 irrespective of the soil type associated with clay dispersion crusting and reduced porosity in similar soils however they found a strong correlation between clay dispersion and both sar and the total cation concentration tcc in another study rengasamy and marchuk 2011 proposed an alternative ratio cross to sar it includes other cations mg and k that induce the dispersive behavior in the soil which is critical for characterizing the structural stability of the soils however we understand that the degree of dispersivity due to different cations e g na k and mg may not be a basic soil property but may depend on all inherent soil characteristics which affect the biogeochemical dynamics of the soil solution and soil exchange however our study was not aimed at deriving any such critical thresholds for evaluating the dispersive behavior of different soils we suggest that further studies are undertaken to thoroughly understand the critical relative concentrations of various cations i e sar in different nap soils that could impact the structural stability clay dispersion and a reduction in the hydraulic conductivity of the soils such information can help devise soil location specific guidelines for reducing the harmful impacts of the use of rcw for irrigation one of the main concerns with sar of irrigation water is its effect on modifying the soil cation exchange complex resulting in high esp which in turn has a dramatic impact on the structural stability and the hydraulic properties of soil excellent hydraulic conductivity needs to be maintained to enable appropriate leaching requirements to move salts below the root zone good soil structure also aids root development improving plant health and drought resistance based on the modeling results it is suggested that the use of rcw for irrigation may need frequent applications of soil amendments such as gypsum organic matter compost and or combination of such products such that soil esp can be managed to maintain values below the threshold esp 6 for sustainable crop production similarly low concentrations of soluble salts in the soils need to be maintained by adopting appropriate leaching preferably with low salinity water such as harvested rainwater to realize long term sustainability of rcw irrigation mallants et al 2019 stevens et al 2004 suggested a leaching fraction of 20 50 as ideal for rcw water used in the nap region other studies e g kumar and kookana 2006 expressed similar concerns with winery wastewater containing salinity and sar problems overall the long term use of recycled water for irrigation can potentially increase soil salinity and sodicity hazards beyond the threshold thereby rendering the soil unfit for cultivation therefore adequate management options must be explored to use these waters sustainably for crop production in the nap region the results are broadly applicable to the two irrigation systems overhead sprinkler and drippers note that the modelling itself did not account for differences in irrigation method as it was a one dimensional model a two dimensional model would be required to incorporate any small scale spatial effects of different irrigation methods on water and salt distribution in soil see e g phogat et al 2014 extrapolation to other regions where rcw is currently used or may be used in the future is possible however care should be taken to adjust the findings for local conditions of irrigation water quality soil types climate and crops 5 conclusions this study uses the multicomponent unsatchem module of hydrus 1d to evaluate the impact of the long term 2018 2050 use of rcw for irrigating wine grapes almonds pistachios pasture carrot onion and potato crops in different nap soils calcareous hard red brown sand over clay and deep uniform to gradational simulated data revealed that irrigation with recycled water can potentially increase the soil solution salinity ecsw sodium adsorption ratio sar and exchangeable sodium percentage esp in the soil the average end of simulation ecsw in the soil profile under different crops in the 10th to 90th tile range varied from 2 9 to 10 6 ds m usually the average ecsw in the upper soil layers 30 cm remained lower than 4 ds m for almonds wine grapes pistachios and pasture while under annual horticulture carrot onion potato salinity may rise to between 4 87 and 9 5 ds m due to upward movement of salts during the cover crop season average soil salinity at lower depths 30 cm ranged from 3 6 to 10 8 ds m for all crops including pasture viticulture and perennial horticulture increased salinity in the soil reduced the potential yield of almond by 12 20 in different soils with a higher yield loss in the hard red brown soils followed by the calcareous soils however no yield loss was observed for wine grapes perennial pastures and pistachios as these are relatively salinity tolerant crops however annual horticultural crops carrot onion potato showed yield losses from 4 to 32 due to increased salinity associated with rcw irrigation the use of rcw for irrigation also has a strong impact on the soil solution and cation exchange dynamics which increased the sar in the soils after 32 years of irrigation the simulated profile average values of sar were 17 4 15 8 15 5 and 16 3 in the calcareous hard red brown sand over clay and deep uniform to gradational soils respectively these values are higher than the threshold sar reported in many previous studies which are associated with an increase in the esp of the soils the model predicted profile average esp in the soil increased in absolute values by 22 7 21 6 19 4 and 10 5 respectively in the calcareous hard red brown sand over clay and deep uniform to gradational soils these values are much higher than the accepted esp thresholds esp 6 for australian soils thus it is suggested that high sar and esp build up in the soils as a result of rcw irrigation to different crops could adversely impact the physical properties of soils including clay dispersion porosity and hydraulic conductivity and structural stability of the soil therefore adequate management options must be put in place such that adverse impacts of the use of recycled water can be minimized realizing a long term

10599,the variably saturated flow and multi component transport module unsatchem of hydrus 1d was used to evaluate the impact of the long term 2018 2050 application of recycled water rcw for irrigating perennial horticulture almonds pistachios viticulture grapevines annual horticulture carrot onion and potato and pasture crops in representative soils from the northern adelaide plains nap south australia the input parameters for soil hydraulic soil solution and cation exchange data were determined for 14 soil profiles from the nap region for a warm up period from 1970 to 2017 the model used historical climate data and low salinity irrigation water in the subsequent period 2018 2050 irrigation continued with rcw and projected meteorological conditions were obtained by considering expected future climate change the average soil water salinity ecsw at the end of the simulation period ranged from 2 9 10 5 ds m across all soils and crops potential yields of salt sensitive crops such as annual horticulture and almonds were reduced by 4 32 due to increased salinity in the soil similarly the model predicted that the sodium adsorption ratio sar and exchangeable sodium percentage esp would increase above threshold values typically considered as indicative of poor growing conditions for most crops relationships between sar and esp were developed for four representative soils providing the threshold soil sar that corresponds to a critical esp 6 which would lead to adverse soil health and crop growth impacts threshold sars were derived for calcareous sar 4 hard red brown sar 3 5 sand over clay sar 6 and deep uniform to gradational sar 3 soils an increase in sar and esp in soils adversely affects soil structural stability and soil water movement which can severely impact the sustainable crop production in the nap region relationships such as those between sar and esp help in identifying critical soil constraints and assist in devising better guidelines for the sustainable use of recycled water for irrigated agriculture keywords recycled water irrigation salinity sar esp hydrus 1d unsatchem horticultural crops 1 introduction increasing demand for food by a burgeoning global human population requires large amounts of freshwater to be allocated to agriculture however in many parts of the world especially under arid and semiarid climate water demand has already exceeded water supply provided by fresh surface and groundwater resources fao 2012 famiglietti 2014 un environment 2019 the scarcity of water supplies coupled with the need for urban communities to manage large quantities of water from sewage treatment plants has led to increasing interest in the recirculation of this water for irrigating crops consequently treated wastewater is recognized as an important alternative water source for supporting crop production qadir et al 2010 grattan et al 2015 and is increasingly being adopted in irrigation water allocation schemes for arid and semiarid regions where water scarcity is severe hamilton et al 2007 otoo and drechsler 2018 generally usage of rcw can have both positive and negative impacts on crops and soils depending on the water quality and the extent and duration of exposure the benefits include reducing freshwater demand recycling nutrients and minimizing the discharge of pollutants into waterways hanjraa et al 2012 hassena et al 2018 furthermore several investigations have reported improvements in soil fertility status nutrient uptake plant growth and yield potential e g singh et al 2012 lal et al 2015 minhas et al 2015 elfanssi et al 2018 hassena et al 2018 similarly some other investigations reported that irrigation with rcw had no detrimental effects on tree growth and productivity parsons et al 2001 morgan et al 2008 nor upon soil physico chemical properties e g andrews et al 2016 however the prolonged and indiscriminate use of rcw can result in the accumulation of ions in roots and leaves potentially reaching toxic levels paudel et al 2016 damage plantations and decrease the yield noshadi et al 2013 it may further increase soil salinity and sar which can lead to the development of sodicity hazards high exchangeable sodium in the soils bardhan et al 2016 assouline et al 2016 qian and lin 2019 phogat et al 2020 these conditions can degrade the soil hydraulic properties and thus affect water movement in the soil e g assouline and narkis 2013 assouline et al 2016 in particular high esp in the soil may cause clay dispersion and swelling rengasamy and olsson 1993 and overall soil structure degradation basile et al 2012 therefore understanding the impacts on soils and crops of long term irrigation with variable quantity and quality rcw potentially exacerbated by hotter and drier climate ipcc 2014 csiro bom 2016 is essential to develop guidelines for sustainable irrigation with rcw process based numerical models are preferred tools to enhance our understanding of the

component major ion chemistry module unsatchem integrated into the hydrus 1d software package šimůnek et al 2016 is an advanced numerical tool to predict coupled processes of major ion chemistry variably saturated water flow and solute transport in soils during transient conditions while the water flow and solute transport components of the standard hydrus 1d model have been used widely e g šimůnek et al 2016 fewer applications of the major ion chemistry module have been reported mainly because of a lack of appropriate experimental soil chemical data e g gonçalves et al 2006 ramos et al 2011 several of the reported studies focused on assessing the short term impact of using high sar water suarez et al 2006 evaluating ways to reclaim sodic soils šimůnek and suarez 1997 kaledhonkar et al 2006 wang et al 2014 assessing conditions for a sustainable use of coal seam gas water for crop production mallants et al 2017 and undertaking solute transport simulations of irrigation with saline degraded water ramos et al 2011 skaggs et al 2014 these simulations of the movement of dissolved solutes while also accounting for precipitation dissolution reactions of salts in soils have been a useful complement to field studies suarez 2001 nevertheless applications with the major ion chemistry module unsatchem of hydrus 1d for assessing long term risks of irrigation with rcw to horticultural crops and associated environments are limited this modeling study aims to evaluate the impact of long term 2018 2050 irrigation with rcw on i crop yield of horticultural crops almonds and pistachios viticulture pasture mixed and annual vegetables carrot onion and potato and ii changes in chemical composition in texturally different soils by applying the actual water usage to different prospective crops considered for expanding irrigated horticulture and agriculture in the nap region in south australia a much improved understanding of the spatiotemporal soil solution and exchange dynamics allows identifying conditions including mitigating measures required for the sustainable use of recycled water for irrigated crops the outcome of these long term simulations accounting for future climate predictions helps in devising better irrigation guidelines for growing horticultural and vegetable crops 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study site the northern adelaide plains nap south australia will experience a considerable expansion of irrigated agriculture and horticulture based predominantly on the utilization of increasingly available recycled water rcw from the bolivar treatment plant the goyder institute for water research 2016 the wastewater is treated using the dissolved air flotation and filtration daff technique through a tertiary process of filtration and disinfection making it suitable for irrigating horticultural crops the nap has a mediterranean type climate which is characterized by hot dry summers and cool to cold winters long term 1900 2016 average rainfall in the region amounts to 475 mm department of environment water and natural resources 2016 and annual evapotranspiration amounts to 1308 mm with most of the rainfall occurring in the winter months crop production requires intensive irrigation fourteen representative soil profiles were excavated to determine the relevant physico chemical properties of the main soil groups oliver et al 2018 samples consisted of disturbed soil for the particle size analysis and undisturbed cores for measurements of the bulk density the water content matric suction relationship and the saturated hydraulic conductivity the soil samples were collected from 0 10 10 30 and 30 60 cm and selectively also from lower depths 60 90 and 90 120 cm a detailed description of different soil profiles and their physico chemical properties can be found in oliver et al 2018 undisturbed soil cores collected from the field were first used to measure the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks using the constant head method of youngs 2001 subsequently the soil water retention characteristic was determined by placing the cores onto saturated ceramic plates connected to either hanging water columns 0 1 4 and 8 kpa or subjected to positive gas nitrogen pressures 33 60 and 100 kpa in sealed chambers other soil samples were used to measure the soil water content at 1500 kpa

grapes almond pistachio pasture carrot onion and carrot initially the model was warmed up for 48 years from july 1970 to june 2018 using climate parameters from the bureau of meteorology bom station no 023083 at the edinburgh raaf site latitude 34 7111 longitude 138 6222 elevation 17 m to initialize the soil water balance and to attain equilibrium conditions for chemical species for each soil crop combination the future climate 2018 2050 data were taken from the goyder institute climate change median climate projections charles and fu 2015 the median data is based on the downscaled series obtained from the gfdl esm2m global climate model gcm one of the six better performing gcms which are deemed to provide more realistic inputs for impacts and adaptation assessment than those from the six poorer gcms note that the range of a possible future climate change is larger than that obtained from only using the downscaled results from the six better gcms a median decrease in annual rainfall by 2050 is 6 8 relative to the 1986 2005 baseline the 10th percentile decrease is 8 8 and the 95th percentile decrease is 3 5 for the intermediate emission representative concentration

co2 equivalent in the year 2100 without ever exceeding that value moss et al 2010 a single climate future is used rather than a range of climate futures to keep the overall number of modeling scenarios manageable as a result the simulations present one possible outcome a detailed description of the hydrus 1d model is available from šimůnek et al 2013 and šimůnek et al 2016 the one dimensional richards equation which assumes that the air phase plays an insignificant role in liquid flow processes and that water flow due to thermal gradients can be neglected is solved in hydrus 1d using a galerkin type linear finite element scheme šimůnek et al 2013 the governing one dimensional water flow equation is described as 1 θ t z k h h z cos α s h z t where θ is the soil water content

best available soil crop climate and irrigation management parameters the soil parameters are mostly directly measured on representative soil samples or estimated using auxiliary soil data most of the crop parameters are from the literature although some calibrated parameters were available for wine grapes climate data is in part measured on site for historical climate and in part derived from downscaled climate projections irrigation management parameters were obtained from surveys these data sets are discussed next the model was thus not specifically calibrated as preference was given to use the measured input parameters note that estimating model parameters through calibration using an inadequate conceptual model could lead to so called parameter bias enemark et al 2019 3 soil

reactions involving ca mg na k so4 cl no3 h4sio4 hco3 and co2 šimůnek and suarez 1997 šimůnek et al 2013 the model accounts for equilibrium chemical reactions between these components such as aqueous complexation cation exchange and precipitation dissolution for the precipitation dissolution of calcite and dissolution of dolomite either equilibrium or multicomponent kinetic expressions are used which include both forward and back reactions other precipitation dissolution reactions considered involve gypsum caso4 2h2o hydromagnesite mg5 co3 4 oh 2 4h2o nesquehonite mgco3 3h2o and sepiolite

model warming up period 1970 2018 3 2 estimation of potential evaporation es and potential transpiration tp the hydrus 1d unsatchem šimůnek et al 2016 model requires daily inputs of rainfall as well as potential evaporation es and potential transpiration tp therefore the daily es and tp values for all crops wine grape almond pistachio pasture carrot onion and potato for current and future climates were estimated following the fao 56 dual crop coefficient dcc approach allen et al 1998 the fao 56 dcc methodology requires a considerable amount of data for crops soils and climate all relevant information and required data for this approach for the nap soils and crops are included in mallants et al 2019 and phogat et al 2020 daily climate data for the historic climate 1970 2018 was obtained from the bureau of meteorology bom edinburg raaf station while future climate 2018 2050 data was taken from the goyder climate change median climate projections for the same station charles and fu 2015 apart from daily es and tp the irrigation requirements for different crops almonds wine grape pistachios pasture carrot onion and potato were also estimated following the fao 56 dual crop coefficient dcc approach allen et al 1998 as discussed in detail by mallants et al 2019 for wine grapes measured lai values were taken from similar studies phogat et al 2016 2017 in the study area also values for canopy geometry and fractional cover for wine grape previously calibrated by phogat et al 2016 have been used here the functional relation followed in the fao dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 is given as 12 etc kcb ke et0 where etc is the crop evapotranspiration lt 1 et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration lt 1 kcb is the basal crop coefficient which represents the plant transpiration component and ke is the soil evaporation coefficient some of the basic information such as kcb crop duration plant height rooting depth and depletion factor is available from fao 56 allen et al 1998 the details on data requirements and other relevant information for each crop soil and climate conditions can be found in mallants et al 2019 in this approach standard kcb values allen et al 1998 of the crops were adjusted for the local climate taking into consideration crop height wind speed and minimum relative humidity averages estimated kcb s in the current study compares well with previous calibrated values for wine grape phogat et al 2017 soil specific information soil texture field capacity θfc permanent wilting point θwp readily available water raw total available water taw has been drawn from the soil analyses oliver et al 2018 the values of daily potential transpiration tp and soil evaporation es thus obtained were used as time variable boundary conditions in the hydrus model along with the irrigation schedule for different crops and precipitation received at the site during the simulation period the amount and timing of irrigation were also imposed as a time variable flux boundary 3 3 root water uptake parameters water extraction s h hs x z t from the soil is computed according to the feddes macroscopic approach feddes et al 1978 in this method the potential transpiration rate tp is distributed over the root zone using a normalized root density distribution function β x z t and multiplied by dimensionless water α 1 h and salinity α 1 hs stress response functions as 13 s h h s x z t α 1 h h s x z t s p x z t α 1 h h s x z t β x z t t p t this model reduces potential plant root water uptake rates according to the local soil water pressure head h and osmotic head hs at any point in the root zone this model defines how potential transpiration tp is reduced when the soil is no longer capable of supplying the amount of water required by plants under prevailing climatic and soil conditions the multiplicative model for the uptake reduction due to the osmotic stress is considered in this study 14 α 1 h h s α 1 h α 1 h s the reduction of root water uptake due to the water stress α 1 h is described as 15 α 1 h 0 h h 1 o r h h 4 h h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 h h 1 1 h 3 h h 2 h h 4 h 3 h 4 h 4 h h 3 where h 1 h 2 h 3 and h 4 are the threshold model parameters water uptake is at the potential rate when the pressure head is between h 2 and h 3 decreases linearly when h h 2 or h h 3 and becomes zero when

from zhang et al 2002 for wine grapes sanden et al 2004 for pistachios and ayers and westcot 1985 for other crops 3 4 irrigation water quality average seasonal recycled water rcw quality data was obtained from awad et al 2019 the mean seasonal composition for rcw was estimated from raw data from 2002 2017 the final values used for the modeling study are given in table 3 the water quality falls into the medium category for the salinity rating in australia anzecc armcanz 2000 which means that moderately tolerant crops can be grown using rcw as an irrigation source the chemical composition of rainwater was obtained from cresswell et al 2010 for the adelaide region table 3 in this study two irrigation systems were identified on the basis of a survey undertaken among the farmers overhead sprinklers potato carrots cauliflower broccoli cabbage lettuce and drippers almonds wine grapes tomatoes for sprinkler irrigation water application is relatively uniform across the soil surface thus leading to one dimensional flow and solute migration the use of the one dimensional hydrus model is thus appropriate for drip irrigation flow and solute transport is quasi three dimensional in the radial direction away from the dripper therefore the use of a one dimensional model may not be entirely correct the discrepancies in both water content and salinity are likely highest at the edge of the wetting zone surrounding the dripper how much this impacts crop growth will depend on the spatial distribution of the rooting system relative to the position of the drippers previous work by phogat et al 2014 with a two dimensional model with drip irrigation applied to a mandarin tree clearly showed the non homogeneous salt redistribution surrounding the dripper under the dripper salt levels were the lowest while highest salinity was observed at the edge of the wetted soil area our one dimensional may capture the water and salt distribution just underneath the dripper but not at the edges estimating the impact of this simplification on crop yield was beyond the scope of this study 3 5 modeling domain initial and boundary conditions simulations for all crops were performed for a 200 cm deep soil profile divided into 100 finite elements the finite element nodes were distributed with a nodal density of 0 5 at the surface and 1 at the bottom to ensure a fine discretization at the soil surface where major water and solute dynamics processes take place the domain was divided into 5 soil layers 0 15 15 30 30 60 60 100 and 100 200 cm to accommodate the measured textural heterogeneity in various soil groups cal hrb soc and dug in the nap area determined by soil sampling and the particle size analysis at the soil surface an atmospheric boundary condition with surface runoff was imposed and a free drainage boundary condition was applied at the bottom boundary for solute transport a concentration flux boundary condition was used at the soil surface and a zero concentration gradient boundary condition was imposed at the bottom to allow gravitational outflow with drainage water a constant pressure head of 100 cm was considered to initiate the model runs measured daily rainfall and calculated daily es and ep for different crops were applied during the warmup period 1970 2018 measured soil solution and exchange parameters table 2 were assumed as initial conditions for the multi component solute transport module while cultivation methods may affect the soil properties over the years we assume that the measured soil physical and hydraulic properties reflect such tillage effects and remain constant over the simulation period furthermore even though the location of horticultural crops is not static across multiple years as long as sprinkler irrigation is applied water is rather uniformly distributed over the cropped area in response to the crop et demand this means that salinity distribution is rather uniform in space and therefore assuming the same exposure over many years is justified tree crops however have a fixed location across the years so the salt distribution is likely less uniform especially under drip irrigation the long term impact of use of rcw will then depend among others on the spatial distribution of the root system relative to the location of the drippers two dimensional salinity distribution under drip irrigation was demonstrated by phogat et al 2014 4 results and discussion 4 1 impact of rcw irrigation on ph and salinity ecsw dynamics in the soil periodic changes in the profile averaged ph ecsw sar and esp in different soils under recycled water rcw irrigation of almonds are shown in fig 1 corresponding chemical variables for other crops during selected years are listed in table 4 the initial profile averaged ph which ranged from 7 9 to 8 3 in different soils gradually converged to a narrow range 8 2 8 3 at the end of the simulation fig 1 soil ph in cal and dug soils decreased during the early years 3 4 years following the application of rcw irrigation while it increased slightly in the other two soils hrb and soc the ph remained more or less constant after that and attained a steady state condition in all soils fig 1 for the other crops rcw irrigation had a similar impact on soil ph where differences between initial and final values were within a 0 21 to 0 32 range data not shown quan and lin 2019 observed a 0 25 0 3 increase in the initial soil ph 7 1 7 5 during 11 years of recycled water irrigation of landscape facilities however a soil ph higher than 8 can reduce the micro nutrient availability to the crops which in turn can impact the normal growth and development of trees and other crop plants previous work in the nap area by stevens et al 2004 also did not observe any significant differences in the soil ph due to rcw irrigation for periods between 10 28 years concentrations of soluble salts in the soil solution ecsw increased rapidly as a result of irrigation with rcw of all crops fig 1 table 4 in almonds the average profile ecsw in the soil almost attained a steady value within 2 3 years final ecsw values in 2050 varied from 4 33 to 5 15 ds m across different soils similarly the corresponding values under wine grape pistachios pasture mix carrot onion and potato ranged from 4 0 4 7 3 8 6 7 5 5 6 4 5 8 6 6 6 1 6 2 and 4 0 9 5 ds m respectively table 4 these results corroborate well with stevens et al 2004 who reported that ece values ranged between 2 8 and 6 9 ds m for 10 28 years of rcw irrigation of different crops in the same region however maximum salinity values irrespective of the crop were observed during 2034 which was projected to be a drought year with an annual rainfall of 247 mm compared to other crops the average profile ecsw build up in the soil under potato was higher in cal and hrb soils table 4 this was probably due to a potato oats rain fed cropping sequence adopted in the study after 7 years of irrigation 2025 ecsw in these soils was twice as high as in the other two soils under potato and other crops this pattern continued until the end of the simulation 2050 overall the salinity build up in the cal and hrb soils in 2050 was double than observed in the other two soils table 4 therefore the use of rcw irrigation can have a varied and significant impact on the soil salinity build up under different cropping sequences which subsequently may have a dramatic impact on crop yields however responses of crops to salinity are influenced by several factors including climate irrigation or agronomic management for example leaching of soluble salts using low salinity water is one way to bring the effective rootzone salinity below the crop threshold value to attain optimal yield and thus to control the harmful impact of salts associated with recycled water irrigation on the other hand ecsw showed an increasing trend from the soil surface to lower depths irrespective of soil and crop type for example in almond ecsw attained a value larger than 5 ds m everywhere below a depth of 40 cm after 7 years of irrigation fig 2 at deeper depths 80 cm ecsw increased quickly to a value of more than 5 ds m in all soils after about 5 7 years of irrigation see fig 2 the first column similar patterns of spatiotemporal changes in ecsw were also observed for other crops table 4 interestingly ecsw was always below 3 ds m in the surface soil zone 0 30 cm during the entire simulation period 2018 2050 which is well below the critical threshold salinity for vegetables almond and clover maas and hoffmann 1977 however the average profile ecsw values are higher than the salinity threshold for vegetables carrot potato and onion ecsw 2 3 4 ds m mixed pasture clover 3 ds m and almonds 3 ds m similar to that for wine grapes 4 2 ds m but much lower than those for mixed pasture rye grass 11 2 ds m and pistachio 18 8 ds m it is generally accepted that soils with ece larger than 4 ds m ecsw of 8 ds m are considered as saline soils u s salinity lab staff 1994 the previous work by stevens et al 2003 for the nap soils considered ece of 3 ds m as a salinity threshold for vegetable crops ec sw higher than the crop salinity threshold can adversely affect the normal growth development and yield of horticultural and vegetable crops hence leaching of soluble salts with low salinity water is essential to bring the effective rootzone salinity below the crop salinity threshold among different soils cal and hrb displayed high salinity at lower depths soc had the lowest ecsw and dug had values in between those of the other soils pistachio is a highly salinity tolerant crop that is potentially the most suitable for cultivation in salt affected soils sepaskhah and maftoun 1981 ferguson et al 2002 and sanden et al 2004 showed the viability of using saline water with an ec of 8 ds m which showed no impact on the pistachio yield notably the salinity tolerance of pistachio similarly as of many other woody species have been associated with a small growth reduction sepaskhah and maftoun 1988 picchioni et al 1990 a small decrease in the photosynthetic activity including a high chlorophyll index chlorophyll fluorescence and chlorophyll content and the transpiration rate walker et al 1988 karimi and maleki kuhbanani 2015 momenpour and imani 2018 smaller amounts of salt ions transported to the leaves walker et al 1987 picchioni et al 1990 the ability to maintain relative high k na and ca2 na ratios needed for osmotic adjustment and enzymatic activities chelli chaabouni et al 2010 hajiboland et al 2014 and a smaller nut yield reduction sanden et al 2004 ferguson et al 2010 picchioni et al 1990 the high salt tolerance of pistachio is attributed to the ability to store large amounts of na in the roots and basal stem maintaining normal growth under salinity stress is associated with the ability of plants to reduce water losses and ensure an osmotic adjustment at the cellular level munns 2002 however other studies saandatmand et al 2007 karimi et al 2011 reported that high salinity stress could negatively affect the photosynthesis rate the morphology of leaves and the nutrient balance of pistachio trees the maximum soil salinity value reached during the simulations ecsw 13 7 ds m at 120 200 cm depth in 2047 data not shown which is still below the crop threshold suggests that pistachio could be a viable option for rcw irrigation in the nap area 4 2 changes in sodium adsorption ratio sar the long term use of recycled water for irrigation resulted in a considerable increase in sar for all soils and all crops figs 1 2 table 4 for example after 7 8 years of irrigation sar in all soil except for hrb under almond increased to a value larger than 10 fig 1 similarly for other crops sar increased rapidly and its profile averaged values ranged between 5 5 and 16 6 table 4 during the same time after 7 8 years of irrigation subsequently sar continued to increase with the use of rcw irrigation for almost attaining a constant value after about 15 years of rcw irrigation note that sar at lower depths 100 cm in hard clay and calcareous soils had a delayed response to rcw irrigation fig 2 the profile averaged sar values at the end of the simulation were between 10 and 20 in all soils and for all crops table 4 sar values at soil depths larger than 50 cm were greater than 15 in all soils and comparatively higher values in dug and cal soils fig 2 stevens et al 2003 reported an increase in sar in the top soil by a factor of three relative to virgin soil which is similar to our simulations for similar rcw sar 8 7 for stevens et al versus 8 1 for this study an increasing soil sar triggers an exchange of cations between the soil solution and soil cation exchange complex which increases the soil esp sar values greater than 13 indicate a potential for sodic soil development us salinity lab staff 1954 high sar values suggest that the long term use of irrigation with recycled water can induce sodicity hazards which could have a severe impact on the sustainable production of pastures and perennial and annual horticultural crops soil sar is a dynamic property that depends on the composition of the soil solution when the measurements are made however the soil specific inherent bio geochemical and ion exchange reactions can have a great impact on the composition of the soil solution and exchange although the profile averaged sar varied in a rather narrow range 12 1 19 5 in different soil crop combinations these values are much higher than the threshold values reported in rangasamy et al 1984 i e sar1 5 3 which may result in adverse soil impacts based on the fao fao 1985 criteria for sodicity sar values predicted in our study are in the range of the light to moderate or moderate to high sodicity hazard class this suggests that the use of recycled water irrigation can lead to the development of high esp levels in the soil high esp causes reductions in the hydraulic conductivity mcneal 1968 1974 for the nap soils that would be in the range of 20 to 40 mallants et al 2019 the precise extent of any adverse impacts due to high sar is determined by factors such as concentrations of soluble salts the leaching fraction rainfall amounts and the type and content of clay in the soil anzecc armcanz 2000 4 3 impact on exchangeable sodium percentage esp the initial measured esp values in the soils ranged between 7 9 and 24 oliver et al 2018 and varied slightly during the warm up period 1970 2018 when low salinity water was used however a rapid increase in esp occurred in response to the use of rcw for irrigation figs 1 2 table 4 while the profile averaged esp 21 8 in the cal soil doubled the corresponding esp in the soc soil increased roughly 3 times relative to its initial value reaching 28 7 after 32 years of irrigation fig 1 such increases in esp were observed for all soil crop combinations table 4 at the end of the simulation 2050 the corresponding profile averaged esp across all crops ranged between 40 7 47 5 48 9 53 6 23 9 31 3 and 31 6 38 7 in the cal hrb soc and dug soils respectively table 4 an increase in esp relative to its initially measured values in response to rcw irrigation varied from 18 8 27 1 18 6 24 7 15 4 22 3 and 7 1 15 0 in the cal hrb soc and dug soils respectively the maximum esp ranging between 40 and 60 was observed in the hrb soil at the end of the simulation fig 1 this demonstrates that the use of rcw over the years results in a rapid increase in esp which may render the soil unfit for crop production calculated esp values were above their threshold value 6 is non sodic in all soils at all depths normally shallow depths had lower esp compared to deeper soil layers fig 2 for example the average initial esp in the hrb soil in the surface layer 0 15 cm under almond was 17 7 which increased to 56 6 in the 120 200 cm layer at the end of the simulation esp at soil depths larger than 40 cm typically was between 40 and 60 in all soils however the hrb and cal soils showed comparatively higher esp 35 than other soils irrigation with recycled water tends to increase the na content on the soil exchange complex an increase in the na content on the soil exchange complex relative to ca and mg may induce soil swelling and dispersion of clay and organic matter impact soil water movement water logging and degrade the soil structure these conditions may decrease oxygen concentrations and ultimately impact the plant growth this condition is therefore considered to be a significant barrier to a sustainable irrigation practice the amount of dispersed clay is also affected by soil mineralogy soil solution constituents e g salinity and organic matter nrmmc ephc 2006 therefore soil amendments such as gypsum compost or other organic materials would be required to control esp below its threshold esp 6 and provide a congenial environment for normal crop growth the range of sar and esp observed in this study can have severe impacts on the clay dispersion clogging of macropores and degradation of the soil structure which ultimately negatively affects crop growth and yield and long term sustainability of crops therefore irrigation with recycled water should be supplemented with an adequate amount of soil amendments such as gypsum and organic matter compost to avoid the harmful impacts on soils and crops 4 4 yield salinity relationship the modeling results presented in previous sections clearly indicated that irrigation with rcw increased the soil solution salinity ecsw for all investigated crops to estimate the effect of increased salinity on crop yield the yield salinity relations were drawn following the maas and hoffman 1977 piecewise linear regression this model is given as y r 100 b e c s w 1 e c t where yr is the relative yield ecsw1 is the profile average soil salinity at a given time ect is the crop tolerance threshold salinity and b is a decrease in yield in percent in response to per unit increase in salinity ds m above the threshold value calculations based on this model only indicate the impact of soluble salts on the possible reduction in the potential yield furthermore high esp can lead to an additive or multiplicative effect on the yield reduction due to its adverse impact on soil physical conditions of the soil the latter effect was not quantified here the extent of average profile salinity ecsw1 in soils under different crops ranged from 2 9 to 10 6 ds m the green background in fig 3 with an overall mean of 5 5 ds m across all soils and crops these salinities developed over 32 years of recycled water irrigation in the nap soils these values correspond very well with some of the previous studies in the nap region which assessed the impact of the long term 10 28 years use of recycled water for irrigation stevens et al 2003 2004 however their study focused on analyses of soils unirrigated virgin soils rcw irrigated soils and groundwater irrigated soils that had received different irrigation waters while the impact on crop yields was not investigated the model simulated annual profile average salinity ecsw1 for different crops was used to estimate the reduction in the potential yield fig 3 the yield reduction for the 10th tile mean and 90th tile profile averaged salinities for different soils are shown in table 5 pistachios and pasture rye grass would not experience a significant yield loss because they are tolerant crops a yield reduction of almonds due to recycled water irrigation varied from 9 to 22 depending on the soil type a reduction in wine grapes is comparatively low 0 5 7 due to a higher tolerance to salinity a comparison of almond yields grown in the nap pitt et al 2017 and riverland regions phogat et al 2013 average yield of 8 years revealed that the almond yield in the nap region was only 50 of that in the riverland region the major difference between the two sites was the water quality used for irrigation climate and the soil type more sandy in riverland in the riverland almonds are irrigated with the river murray water which has a much lower salinity 0 4 ds m phogat et al 2018a than recycled water groundwater or blended water 0 8 1 9 ds m phogat et al 2018b used in the nap region the current hypothesis is that the use of rcw in the nap region pitt et al 2017 with its high soil salinity soil profile ecse 2 7 5 ds m might have contributed greatly to the reduction in the almonds yield the yield reduction in clover pasture ranged from 12 to 23 8 therefore under mixed pasture conditions rye grass and clover rcw irrigation can potentially impact the clover crop similarly among annual horticulture crops almost one third of the potential yield in onion 23 5 34 9 and potato 23 5 34 9 could be lost due to salinity stress the corresponding yield loss for carrot and brassicas ranged from 19 6 to 32 4 and from 5 8 to 14 7 respectively salinity impacts on crops are influenced by climate irrigation and agronomic management rhodes and loveday 1990 generally most vegetable crops suffer a 10 yield reduction at an ece of 2 7 0 8 ds m ecsw1 2 ece anzecc armcanz 2000 therefore appropriate management of irrigation induced soil salinity is essential for sustainable crop production in the nap soils the effectiveness of mitigation scenarios is reported in mallants et al 2019 and will not be discussed here 4 5 sodicity development the nap soils are inherently sodic with a high na content in the soil solution and on the exchange complex especially at deeper depths matheson and lobban 1974 even the virgin soils have been shown to have sar as high as 44 at lower depths stevens et al 2003 however rcw containing sarw sar of water of 8 12 2 can have a significant impact on an increase in the soil sar the data in the current study showed that a rapid increase in the soil solution sar occurred due to the use of rcw for irrigation overall average increases in the profile averaged sar values as a result of rcw irrigation in the cal hrb soc and dug soils were equal to 17 4 15 8 13 3 and 13 8 respectively and corresponding increase esp values in response to rcw irrigation was 22 7 21 6 19 4 and 10 5 respectively table 4 it is well understood that high sar of the soil solution can potentially modify the cation dynamics in the soil solution as well as on the soil exchange complex high sar ultimately leads to the development of high esp in the soils however there is no universally accepted relationship that can define the intricate dynamics between the soil solution and the soil cation exchange complex similarly there is no universal understanding of the critical esp value to categorize the sodic soils in australia a sodic soil is defined as the soil which has an esp larger than 6 northcote and skene 1972 however the american classification of sodic soils has an esp threshold of 15 us salinity lab staff 1954 this difference is attributed to several factors including differences in electrolyte concentrations ph organic matter contents and the clay type and contents and the way such differences in soil chemistry affect the critical esp above which clay dispersion and hydraulic conductivity reduction occur rengasamy and olsson 1991 measuring esp is complicated and time consuming and therefore alternative parameters which can better characterize sodic soils have been sought after many studies e g rengasamy et al 1984 suggested sar as an alternative indicator for sodic soils since sar is highly correlated with the soil esp and can be more conveniently measured numerous studies have attempted to find a relation between sare sar of the saturation extract and esp of the soils in different parts of the world us salinity lab staff 1954 paliwal and gandhi 1976 shainberg et al 1980 evangelou and marsi 2003 seilsepour et al 2009 chi et al 2011 these approximate relationships vary according to site specific soil parameters such as the clay content and mineralogy of the soils similarly rengasamy et al 1984 extended this relation between sar1 5 and esp for australian soils similar to those in the current study to facilitate the soil classification fig 5 similarly chi et al 2011 found that there were non significant differences in the esp development from the approximate log relations with sare or sar1 5 as for the soils of the nap region rengasamy et al 1984 found a linear relationship esp 1 95 sar 1 85 r2 0 82 between sar1 5 and esp whereas stevens et al 2003 reported a curvilinear esp 5 36 sar0 65 r2 0 83 relationship fig 4 stevens et al 2003 hypothesized that the inclusion of the soil analysis of deeper layers up to 1 m might change the nature of the relationship as the former study only analyzed samples from surface layers 0 45 cm we attempted to draw similar relationships to understand the impact of rcw irrigation on sodicity development in the soils a strong relationship was found between the irrigation induced sar and the resulting soil esp fig 4 both linear as well as curvilinear regressions models showed good agreement with an r2 of 0 89 and 0 92 respectively since the simulations provided sufficient sar esp data for all soil types we have derived separate relationships between sar and esp for different nap soils fig 5 there was a good curvilinear relationship between sar and esp with r2 values of 0 91 0 93 and 0 94 for the cal hrb and soc soils respectively however the relation for the dug soils was poor r2 0 29 the initially high esp of these soils may have influenced the rate of na exchange between the soil solution and the exchange phase which may in turn have resulted in the lower esp build up in response to recycled water irrigation more importantly the relations in fig 5 suggest that different sar thresholds exist which could lead to soil esp exceeding the threshold value of esp 6 indeed the sar thresholds sarth that would cause esp to exceed its threshold are as follows sarth 4 for calcareous soils sarth 3 5 for hard red brown soils sarth 6 for sand over clay soils and sarth 3 for deep uniform to gradational soils rengasamy et al 1984 suggested a common sar 3 irrespective of the soil type associated with clay dispersion crusting and reduced porosity in similar soils however they found a strong correlation between clay dispersion and both sar and the total cation concentration tcc in another study rengasamy and marchuk 2011 proposed an alternative ratio cross to sar it includes other cations mg and k that induce the dispersive behavior in the soil which is critical for characterizing the structural stability of the soils however we understand that the degree of dispersivity due to different cations e g na k and mg may not be a basic soil property but may depend on all inherent soil characteristics which affect the biogeochemical dynamics of the soil solution and soil exchange however our study was not aimed at deriving any such critical thresholds for evaluating the dispersive behavior of different soils we suggest that further studies are undertaken to thoroughly understand the critical relative concentrations of various cations i e sar in different nap soils that could impact the structural stability clay dispersion and a reduction in the hydraulic conductivity of the soils such information can help devise soil location specific guidelines for reducing the harmful impacts of the use of rcw for irrigation one of the main concerns with sar of irrigation water is its effect on modifying the soil cation exchange complex resulting in high esp which in turn has a dramatic impact on the structural stability and the hydraulic properties of soil excellent hydraulic conductivity needs to be maintained to enable appropriate leaching requirements to move salts below the root zone good soil structure also aids root development improving plant health and drought resistance based on the modeling results it is suggested that the use of rcw for irrigation may need frequent applications of soil amendments such as gypsum organic matter compost and or combination of such products such that soil esp can be managed to maintain values below the threshold esp 6 for sustainable crop production similarly low concentrations of soluble salts in the soils need to be maintained by adopting appropriate leaching preferably with low salinity water such as harvested rainwater to realize long term sustainability of rcw irrigation mallants et al 2019 stevens et al 2004 suggested a leaching fraction of 20 50 as ideal for rcw water used in the nap region other studies e g kumar and kookana 2006 expressed similar concerns with winery wastewater containing salinity and sar problems overall the long term use of recycled water for irrigation can potentially increase soil salinity and sodicity hazards beyond the threshold thereby rendering the soil unfit for cultivation therefore adequate management options must be explored to use these waters sustainably for crop production in the nap region the results are broadly applicable to the two irrigation systems overhead sprinkler and drippers note that the modelling itself did not account for differences in irrigation method as it was a one dimensional model a two dimensional model would be required to incorporate any small scale spatial effects of different irrigation methods on water and salt distribution in soil see e g phogat et al 2014 extrapolation to other regions where rcw is currently used or may be used in the future is possible however care should be taken to adjust the findings for local conditions of irrigation water quality soil types climate and crops 5 conclusions this study uses the multicomponent unsatchem module of hydrus 1d to evaluate the impact of the long term 2018 2050 use of rcw for irrigating wine grapes almonds pistachios pasture carrot onion and potato crops in different nap soils calcareous hard red brown sand over clay and deep uniform to gradational simulated data revealed that irrigation with recycled water can potentially increase the soil solution salinity ecsw sodium adsorption ratio sar and exchangeable sodium percentage esp in the soil the average end of simulation ecsw in the soil profile under different crops in the 10th to 90th tile range varied from 2 9 to 10 6 ds m usually the average ecsw in the upper soil layers 30 cm remained lower than 4 ds m for almonds wine grapes pistachios and pasture while under annual horticulture carrot onion potato salinity may rise to between 4 87 and 9 5 ds m due to upward movement of salts during the cover crop season average soil salinity at lower depths 30 cm ranged from 3 6 to 10 8 ds m for all crops including pasture viticulture and perennial horticulture increased salinity in the soil reduced the potential yield of almond by 12 20 in different soils with a higher yield loss in the hard red brown soils followed by the calcareous soils however no yield loss was observed for wine grapes perennial pastures and pistachios as these are relatively salinity tolerant crops however annual horticultural crops carrot onion potato showed yield losses from 4 to 32 due to increased salinity associated with rcw irrigation the use of rcw for irrigation also has a strong impact on the soil solution and cation exchange dynamics which increased the sar in the soils after 32 years of irrigation the simulated profile average values of sar were 17 4 15 8 15 5 and 16 3 in the calcareous hard red brown sand over clay and deep uniform to gradational soils respectively these values are higher than the threshold sar reported in many previous studies which are associated with an increase in the esp of the soils the model predicted profile average esp in the soil increased in absolute values by 22 7 21 6 19 4 and 10 5 respectively in the calcareous hard red brown sand over clay and deep uniform to gradational soils these values are much higher than the accepted esp thresholds esp 6 for australian soils thus it is suggested that high sar and esp build up in the soils as a result of rcw irrigation to different crops could adversely impact the physical properties of soils including clay dispersion porosity and hydraulic conductivity and structural stability of the soil therefore adequate management options must be put in place such that adverse impacts of the use of recycled water can be minimized realizing a long term
