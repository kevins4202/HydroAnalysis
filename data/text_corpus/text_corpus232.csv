1160,the volcanic and tectonic lakes of the eastern branch of the african great rift valley are exposed to multiple stressors and characterised by different levels of hydrological connectivity past volcanic activity generated endorheic basins in which the nature of the bedrock its connection with groundwater and local climatic conditions favoured the formation of highly alkaline soda waters while little is known about their nutrient dynamics most lakes in this area experience considerable microbial blooms and harbour diverse and specifically adapted microbial populations some of which could embody novel biotechnological potential here we review the geochemical and micro biological features of a cluster of lakes distributed within the east african rift ranging from fresh to hypersaline under different levels of hydrological connectivity possibly no other location on earth has a comparable range of lake types in close proximity to each other and representing such a remarkable microbial biodiversity environmental heterogeneity and habitat connectivity among adjacent aquatic ecosystems may have positive implications in terms of regional environmental stability by enhancing the overall carrying capacity i e the resilience to various forms of impact contributing to biodiversity protection within these ecosystems microbial processes encompass the entire basis of their primary production in particular those driven by cyanobacteria combining a multi disciplinary ecohydrological approach with a biogeochemical investigation of the principles underlying their functioning our study can contribute to the development of appropriate environmental protection measures to effectively maintain their natural capital keywords saline alkaline lakes rift valley biogeochemistry bacteria ecological connectivity 1 introduction the interaction among bedrock surface and ground waters in aquifers and within deep lake sediments is a major driver of ecosystem dynamics in lakes worldwide and particularly in lakes affected by geogenic water inputs with high mineral content borch et al 2009 christenson et al 2015 water bedrock interactions are further intensified in tropical areas owing to high average annual temperatures intense weathering and frequent hydrological extremes floods and droughts which fundamentally contribute to environmental variability in semi arid and sub humid tropical regions aquatic ecosystems are threatened by intense anthropogenic impact because of urban waste disposal discharge of industrial effluents intensive agricultural practices employing fertilizers and pesticides water abstraction for irrigation and human uses and hydroelectric energy production the combined and interacting influence of geogenic and anthropogenic drivers results in biodiversity decline and habitat reduction dudgeon et al 2006 this situation has been recently exacerbated by climate change and demographic growth understanding lake biogeochemical dynamics is essential for interpreting the specificity of human impact and for identifying adequate conservation measures vitousek et al 1997 this is of great relevance for alkaline lakes where biogeochemical conditions represent a strong environmental filter in the selection of resident lake communities of micro organisms prokaryotes as well as algae and micro crustaceans schagerl 2016 variable degrees of connectivity defined as the strength of interactions across ecotones ward et al 1999 between separate wetlands bear a significant influence on the composition of fish communities bouvier et al 2009 as well as on aquatic bacteria peter and sommaruga 2016 thus impacting onto regional biodiversity we propose that connectivity among adjacent environmentally heterogeneous aquatic ecosystems may have positive implications in terms of contributing to biodiversity protection and to resilience towards various forms of impact thus enhancing regional environmental stability and overall carrying capacity this reflects the urgency of collecting scientific data from water bodies at different levels of ecohydrological connectivity it will support the understanding of ecosystem features and the design of adequate lake management tools for restoring biodiversity improving water quality and enhancing ecosystem services for the benefit of lake dependent communities following the concept of ecohydrology defined on the basis of the mutual interaction between hydrological drivers and biotic processes sensu zalewski 2000 this paper reviews existing links between ecohydrological features hydrological connectivity and carrying capacity within a lake network overall this review illustrates how environmental variability among lakes can support system stability and biodiversity dynamics at regional scale we focused on a cluster of lakes aligned from north to south within the kenyan portion of the east african rift they are subject to different levels of hydrological connectivity and represent a discontinuous gradient of water bodies stretching from freshwater to hypersaline conditions schagerl 2016 knowledge of these lakes is limited to few accessible ones and research activities that were carried out typically achieved a lifespan no longer than a phd thesis limited long term studies exist except those few based on satellite image analysis lake levels and chlorophyll concentrations tebbs et al 2011 2013 and those on cyanobacteria mass development over a 12 year period krienitz et al 2013a b c and a 15 year period krienitz et al 2016a this despite the fact that some lakes are under protected area management and could be regularly monitored by conservation management agencies the harsh biogeochemical setting created conditions for the development of highly selected and diversified microbial communities very few fish species persist in particular some cichlids remarkably adapted to alkaline conditions the target lake network offers a series of stepping stones for migratory birds as well as habitats for sedentary endemic populations thus retaining a relevant value in terms of regional avian biodiversity 2 lakes in the kenyan portion of the east african rift valley the major 30 volcanic and tectonic lakes of the eastern branch of the african great rift valley are characterised by different ranges of hydrological connectivity and are exposed to multiple natural and anthropogenic stressors within the rift all catchments except that of ewaso ng iro north receiving tributaries from the nyandarua mountains and from mt kenya have developed endorheic basins lacking surface outflow all the lakes are situated in sub humid to semi arid savannahs 300 600mmyear 1 subject to high potential evaporation rates 1300 2000mmyear 1 and are fed by drainage from mountain blocks on either side of the rift valley drastic hydrological changes are rather frequent in the rift valley owing to capricious precipitation patterns originating in distant geographical regions which are dependent on the variable position of the inter tropical convergence zone on the strength of the monsoons and on the temperature of the indian ocean lake water levels depend upon the balance between water output e g evaporation and input controlled by the rate of rainfall that occurs in forested upland portions of the lake catchments water levels may vary also under the influence of groundwater pressure which is connected to tectonic movements below the earth crust and to pressure forces that arise within the mantle unusual changes in the water levels of wells are considered common signs of volcanic activity tilling 1989 de carolis and patricelli 2003 report that water level in wells had risen in occasion of the vesuvius volcanic eruption of december 1631 similarly water levels rose in taal crater lake in the philippines just before an eruption smith 2013 ephemeral streams from lower altitudes of the catchments and underground springs at the bases of the mountains can constitute a small proportion of the inflows significantly contributing to the water chemistry since 2010 most east african lakes are at high water level despite lacking evidence of an increase in rainfall odongo et al 2015 upper catchment deforestation and land cover degradation could be an important contributing factor but there is no clear understanding of the complex hydrology of this region where hydrological records disagree with ippc climate change predictions based upon popular global circulation models according to which higher rainfall should be expected klein et al 2016 odongo et al 2015 a cluster of these lakes table 1 and fig 1 forms a discontinuous gradient of water bodies from freshwater baringo and naivasha to hypersaline bogoria nakuru elementeita sonachi natron the latter are evaporitic systems ph from 9 0 to 12 0 representing extreme conditions characterised by high salinity high alkalinity and high primary productivity under constant high temperatures while nakuru is protected as a national park lake bogoria is a national reserve managed by the county of baringo and lake elementeita a wildlife sanctuary is largely within soysambu conservancy a private conservation charity most lakes are primarily of tectonic origin having developed along linear faults stretching across a geologically ancient volcanic landscape reshaped by recent volcanic activity others such as sonachi crater lake are entirely within a volcanic caldera and naivasha itself a tectonic lake includes a number of in filled volcanic craters early hydrological studies using stable isotopes highlighted deep water connections below the rift valley floor able to transfer groundwater over great distances eugster 1970 in this way it could be ascertained that water from lake naivasha reaches as far as suswa and up to lake magadi over 100km south recent monitoring of the vertical profile in lake sonachi showed a distinct increase in temperature and alkalinity with depth pacini unpublished indicating that lake level increase in late 2016 during a dry season was due to feeding by underground alkaline springs in some lakes such as nasikie engida and lake magadi in southern kenya hot spring provide most of the recharge in other lake basins thermal springs are minor but sometimes important contributors schagerl and renaut 2016 no two lakes have the same limnological characteristics due to their different histories and degrees of hydrological connection within their catchment and no one lake is stable enough to maintain a consistently high primary production the most studied lakes have been naivasha limnology ecology management magadi microbiology and geochemistry and nakuru ecology and management whereas bogoria sonachi elementeita and oloidien lakes have been poorly investigated table 2 kenya s saline alkaline lakes offer highly prized cultural ecosystem services they are renowned spots for bird and wildlife tourism offer magnificent landscape views and include important paleontological sites bogoria is visited as much for its hot springs around the western shore of the lake as for its flamingos these springs are reputed to be the most visually impressive and extensive in africa both bogoria and elementeita have a spectacular scenery of escarpments and extinct craters elementeita was formerly part of a much larger prehistoric lake basin whose level was well above the present one connected to both present day nakuru to the north and naivasha to the south the lake shoreline was situated at the altitude of the nationally most important stone tool site attributable to homo erectus dated about 0 75ma kariandusi lake magadi in the south of the country is in private ownership and extensively exploited on an industrial scale for its deposits of soda ash i e trona left after evaporation 3 processes controlling the chemical composition of lake waters endorheic basins formed by tectonic processes generate aquatic ecosystems affected by strong evaporation under the prevailing semi arid climate and the intense equatorial radiation the dominant lithology consisting of recent volcanic rocks and volcanoclastic sediments e g macdonald 2003 dawson 2008 abbate et al 2015 is rapidly weathered to produce highly soluble secondary minerals e g nahcolite trona and thermonatrite soda lakes chemistry is associated with modern or past volcanic activity pecoraino et al 2015 high ph and na hco3 dominance originate from the hydrolysis of the abundant silicate minerals such as sodium rich plagioclase feldspar whose weathering is very effective under the prevailing high temperatures this process consumes hydrogen ions from solution and release alkali cations resulting in high ph and increase in dissolved na concentrations once released dissolved silicate is transported to lakes a strong reduction in dissolved reactive silicate has been noticed in the last decades in freshwater lakes victoria verschuren et al 1998 and naivasha pacini unpublished data a likely consequence of eutrophication and development of dense communities of colonial diatoms in alkaline lakes high evaporation may lead to the precipitation of alkaline earth carbonates e g calcite mg calcite smectite which produces a decrease of ca2 and secondarily mg2 in solution as shown in south american evaporitic alkaline lakes furquim et al 2008 barbiero et al 2017 mg precipitation in alkaline lakes is frequently mediated by cyanobacteria shirokova et al 2013 the occurrence of alkaline springs e g cioni et al 1992 also significantly contributes to the formation of sodic lakes their peculiar geochemical features are reflected in the ratio between total dissolved inorganic carbon tdic and earth alkaline elements reaching values much higher than 1 the caustic nature of carbonatic brines further enhances bedrock dissolution causing a release of nutrients limiting primary production phosphate concentrations that are naturally extremely low in tropical freshwaters due to sustained primary production are commonly found in alkaline lakes surrounded by rocks of volcanic origin such as basalt trachyte phonolite in which phosphorus tends to be moderately abundant a further crucial limiting element is nitrogen being primarily the product of bacterial fixation within surrounding soils and wetlands its presence is biologically regulated and excess nitrate tends to inhibit the nitrogenase i e the enzyme responsible for nitrogen fixation denitrification tends to reduce dissolved nitrogen in tropical wetlands at alkaline lake shores detailed descriptions and interpretations of the biogeochemical properties of kenyan soda lakes are poorly developed the closest to this topic is the research conducted by maclntyre and melack 1982 table 1 attention has been mainly given to inorganic carbon although dissolved organic matter dom often represents the main carbon and energy source for aquatic heterotrophic communities as well as an important alternative source of nitrogen and phosphorus the quantitative and qualitative characterisation of dom including composition structure molecular weight and bioavailability remains an important missing gap in the understanding of carbon cycling within the lakes of the kenyan rift 4 aquatic biodiversity including microbiology the east african rift valley is a cradle of mammalian and avian biodiversity over millennia its high mountains served as freshwater refuges at times of drought while the floor of the rift valley constituted a preferential corridor for latitudinal migration as an adaptation to extreme conditions dictated by periodical climate changes still today the rift valley shelters a high density of threatened fauna i e ungulates primates rodents and birds alkaline lakes are part of a mosaic of diverse biotopes that contribute to landscape diversity as well as to local biodiversity the aquatic organisms which survive within the lakes themselves are restricted to few species of tilapia alcolapia grahami a alcalica a latilabris and to a small number of invertebrates in alkaline lakes often a single species tends to dominate belonging to cladocera and copepoda the water column of most soda lakes tends to be dominated by the planktonic arthrospira fusiformis commonly known as spirulina a colony forming rod shaped bluegreen bacteria cyanobacteria that develops into macroscopic spirals of about 0 2 0 3mm in length visible as tiny flakes by the naked eye over the years due to its highly nutritious properties coupled to its high productivity commercial cultures of a fusiformis developed in tropical regions of the world early assessments from lake sonachi indicated that a fusiformis can achieve rates of primary productivity that place it among the fastest growing planktonic organisms in the world melack 1979a b overall saline alkaline lakes dominated by a fusiformis colonies are characterised by high ph and strong light inhibition through self shading but no lake remains consistently highly productive the onset and the crash of cyanobacterial blooms seem to be disconnected from the availability of elements that commonly limit primary production one cause may be changes in hydrology that affect lake alkalinity causing a disruption of the monoculture of a fusiformis in favour of more complex assemblages typically dominated by colonial diatoms aulacoseira achnanthes and other cyanobacteria e g microcystis another may be the wax and wane of cyanophages known to be abundant in these waters junaideen 2010 foster 2013 peduzzi et al 2014 fig 2 few organisms have developed adaptations to feed on a fusiformis the most renown being the lesser flamingo phoeniconaias minor these large birds are entirely dependent on their a fusiformis diet and have to feed during most of their waking hours the long term survival of their population depends upon the preservation of the regional network of lakes enabling them to move away from lakes whose food supply unexpectedly drops in search of an alkaline lake with adequate a fusiformis blooms harper et al 2016 flamingo movements support lake connectivity along the rift valley and contribute to the dispersal of microorganisms and invertebrates that remain attached to their feathers fig 3 details about factors controlling the main a fusiformis p minor food chain have not improved significantly since early studies carried out in nakuru during the 1970s e g vareschi 1978 studies on a fusiformis are frequent addressing either a wide context phytoplankton community or focussing on the physiology and ecomorphology of the species e g schagerl 2016 and references therein a fusiformis can synthetise tryptophan an amino acid with well known fluorescent properties in water however the availability of dom associated tryptophane has been largely disregarded as well as the potential impact of large scale dom tryptophan leaching on the diversity and production of bacterial plankton monitoring the availability and the fate of dom tryptophan by detecting fluorescence could reveal microbial loop interactions among primary and secondary producers in soda lakes suksomjit et al 2009 recent work has quantified the high dynamics of natural populations tebbs 2014 and provided support for the hypothesis that infection by cyanophages could represent an important factor controlling their growth next to nutrient and or light limitation marine research showed that cyanobacterial viruses tend to be tightly linked to their hosts to the extent that they are able to acquire from them a large number of genes e g clokie et al 2006 these can be used to sustain host physiology during infection in order to ensure that cells are healthy and can maintain an energy source to produce more viruses it is also known that the diversity of the cyanoviruses may drive bacterial diversity this indicates that viruses are important for bacterial population dynamics as well as their long term horizontal evolution parsons et al 2012 these relationships have been far less studied in lake systems than in the ocean but are likely to be important here also and are likely to become a key to our understanding of lake microbiology virus bacteria dynamics may change under climate change or other anthropogenic factors with implications for species reliant on a fusiformis a serious limitation to our understanding of arthrospira virus dynamics has been represented by the difficulty involved in isolating them this is due to the fact that arthrospira does not grow well on a plate and typical virus isolation assays cannot be applied recently peduzzi and co workers 2014 provided strong evidence for the role of viruses in population crashes they showed that virus like particles accumulated inside arthrospira just before the population contracted and concomitantly flamingos departed other organisms of the a fusiformis food chain have also received attention rotifers who are able to consume a fusiformis have been the object of a few papers focusing on grazing community diversity and genetics table 2 the east african saline alkaline lakes are renowned as the kingdom of prokaryotes and in this respect they represent biodiversity foci of global relevance dense communities of cyanobacteria archaea and microalgae often forming mats and biofilms grow upon bottom or littoral substrata of each lake along natural alkalinity and temperature gradients that develop as a result of inflowing freshwater tributaries presence of brackish riparian swamps hot springs and geysers bacterial communities in alkaline lakes have fascinated biologists all over the world as they host diverse microbial populations adapted to chemolithotrophic modes of energy conversion the study of east african extremophiles their metabolism biology and ability to thrive in a range of extreme chemical and physical conditions has promoted a deeper fundamental understanding of bacterial physiology grant and jones 2016 relatively little work on strain isolation has actually been carried out in this region but data assembled so far suggest that the extant biological diversity provides options for huge biotechnological potential as reviewed in grant and jones 2016 important applications can result from the characterisation of novel genes encoded within microbes in particular those encoding proteins that are resistant to high temperatures high alkalinity and salinity such proteins are used in pharmaceutical industries but also in wood processing and in biotechnology it should be expected that bacterial and archaeal communities encode for genes whose proteins could host precursors of novel antimicrobial and other therapeutic properties cragg and newman 2013 5 open issues and information gaps the main topic of published researches addressed structure and characterisation of microbial communities especially cyanobacteria including the genomic code of a restricted number of species new species of bacteria have been isolated and described taking a food web perspective however there are several key gaps in our understanding of how the geochemistry may promote such a large microbial biodiversity and yet despite this the energy derived from microbial production enters very short low diversity food chains it is probable that given the moderate lake volume hydrological processes have a much stronger influence upon ecosystem structure and function in alkaline lakes than in larger freshwater lakes because of radical changes that may occur following lake level rise and dilution as an example the only planktonic invertebrate consumers in lake bogoria up to 2010 were rotifers and protozoa burian et al 2013 ong ondo et al 2013 since that time lake levels have risen throughout the rift valley 2011 2016 and salinity became diluted by half amer unpublished data since 2013 at least the plankton has been invaded by moina sp a cladoceran crustacean never previously recorded from alkaline soda lakes concomitantly rotifera and protozoa have become irrelevant probably being out competed by the large sized filter feeder while the population of a fusiformis remained at about half the density of the previous 20 years tebbs 2014 a further gap in our understanding concerns the range of energy transfer mechanisms that sustain microbial communities there is weak evidence that inorganic energy rich compounds can be reduced by unique microbial assemblages in a parallel situation to deep sea vents the composition of the microbial loop has been approached by recent studies e g burian et al 2013 ong ondo et al 2013 but nothing is known about the detailed structure and dynamics of these communities we do not understand how much a fusiformis is consumed by planktonic invertebrates as opposed to how much enters the decomposer chain in different lakes we do not know how much of the cyanobacterial turnover is caused by viral predation which has been shown to be a key driver in ocean systems dominated by cyanobacteria sepulveda et al 2016 we do not know the extent to which the microbial loop is able to regenerate inorganic phosphate as opposed to its continuous regeneration from geochemical sources 6 concluding remarks future climate changes could cause unpredictable ecohydrological changes within lake basins throughout east africa at the same time local impacts are pervasive with rampant deforestation land use intensification water abstraction for irrigation and inter basin transfer the high lake level phase that started in 2011 and continued until present does not seem to match higher rainfall and probably could be ascribed to higher runoff rainfall ratio caused by basin degradation odongo et al 2015 interpreting and predicting the factors that rule lake hydrology represent an increasingly urgent challenge dilution engendered by increased runoff is tied to changes in lake biogeochemistry with cascading effects onto bacterial communities and the food chains they support up to flamingos greater research effort is needed to investigate the highly diverse bacterial communities that develop in the rift valley lakes whose biodiversity is yet to be revealed this can be highly beneficial for our understanding of bacterial ecology and dynamics in general as well as for the development of new biotechnologies that can be supported by new enzymes isolated from natural bacterial communities academic research should provide a coherent interdisciplinary perspective of the overall value of the ecosystems services offered by these lakes these include cultural services linked to tourism that need to be preserved through adequate conservation measures as well as enhanced by tourism development strategies the management of these lakes will require a multi disciplinary

lake sonachi indicated that a fusiformis can achieve rates of primary productivity that place it among the fastest growing planktonic organisms in the world melack 1979a b overall saline alkaline lakes dominated by a fusiformis colonies are characterised by high ph and strong light inhibition through self shading but no lake remains consistently highly productive the onset and the crash of cyanobacterial blooms seem to be disconnected from the availability of elements that commonly limit primary production one cause may be changes in hydrology that affect lake alkalinity causing a disruption of the monoculture of a fusiformis in favour of more complex assemblages typically dominated by colonial diatoms aulacoseira achnanthes and other cyanobacteria e g microcystis another may be the wax and wane of cyanophages known to be abundant in these waters junaideen 2010 foster 2013 peduzzi et al 2014 fig 2 few organisms have developed adaptations to feed on a fusiformis the most renown being the lesser flamingo phoeniconaias minor these large birds are entirely dependent on their a fusiformis diet and have to feed during most of their waking hours the long term survival of their population depends upon the preservation of the regional network of lakes enabling them to move away from lakes whose food supply unexpectedly drops in search of an alkaline lake with adequate a fusiformis blooms harper et al 2016 flamingo movements support lake connectivity along the rift valley and contribute to the dispersal of microorganisms and invertebrates that remain attached to their feathers fig 3 details about factors controlling the main a fusiformis p minor food chain have not improved significantly since early studies carried out in nakuru during the 1970s e g vareschi 1978 studies on a fusiformis are frequent addressing either a wide context phytoplankton community or focussing on the physiology and ecomorphology of the species e g schagerl 2016 and references therein a fusiformis can synthetise tryptophan an amino acid with well known fluorescent properties in water however the availability of dom associated tryptophane has been largely disregarded as well as the potential impact of large scale dom tryptophan leaching on the diversity and production of bacterial plankton monitoring the availability and the fate of dom tryptophan by detecting fluorescence could reveal microbial loop interactions among primary and secondary producers in soda lakes suksomjit et al 2009 recent work has quantified the high dynamics of natural populations tebbs 2014 and provided support for the hypothesis that infection by cyanophages could represent an important factor controlling their growth next to nutrient and or light limitation marine research showed that cyanobacterial viruses tend to be tightly linked to their hosts to the extent that they are able to acquire from them a large number of genes e g clokie et al 2006 these can be used to sustain host physiology during infection in order to ensure that cells are healthy and can maintain an energy source to produce more viruses it is also known that the diversity of the cyanoviruses may drive bacterial diversity this indicates that viruses are important for bacterial population dynamics as well as their long term horizontal evolution parsons et al 2012 these relationships have been far less studied in lake systems than in the ocean but are likely to be important here also and are likely to become a key to our understanding of lake microbiology virus bacteria dynamics may change under climate change or other anthropogenic factors with implications for species reliant on a fusiformis a serious limitation to our understanding of arthrospira virus dynamics has been represented by the difficulty involved in isolating them this is due to the fact that arthrospira does not grow well on a plate and typical virus isolation assays cannot be applied recently peduzzi and co workers 2014 provided strong evidence for the role of viruses in population crashes they showed that virus like particles accumulated inside arthrospira just before the population contracted and concomitantly flamingos departed other organisms of the a fusiformis food chain have also received attention rotifers who are able to consume a fusiformis have been the object of a few papers focusing on grazing community diversity and genetics table 2 the east african saline alkaline lakes are renowned as the kingdom of prokaryotes and in this respect they represent biodiversity foci of global relevance dense communities of cyanobacteria archaea and microalgae often forming mats and biofilms grow upon bottom or littoral substrata of each lake along natural alkalinity and temperature gradients that develop as a result of inflowing freshwater tributaries presence of brackish riparian swamps hot springs and geysers bacterial communities in alkaline lakes have fascinated biologists all over the world as they host diverse microbial populations adapted to chemolithotrophic modes of energy conversion the study of east african extremophiles their metabolism biology and ability to thrive in a range of extreme chemical and physical conditions has promoted a deeper fundamental understanding of bacterial physiology grant and jones 2016 relatively little work on strain isolation has actually been carried out in this region but data assembled so far suggest that the extant biological diversity provides options for huge biotechnological potential as reviewed in grant and jones 2016 important applications can result from the characterisation of novel genes encoded within microbes in particular those encoding proteins that are resistant to high temperatures high alkalinity and salinity such proteins are used in pharmaceutical industries but also in wood processing and in biotechnology it should be expected that bacterial and archaeal communities encode for genes whose proteins could host precursors of novel antimicrobial and other therapeutic properties cragg and newman 2013 5 open issues and information gaps the main topic of published researches addressed structure and characterisation of microbial communities especially cyanobacteria including the genomic code of a restricted number of species new species of bacteria have been isolated and described taking a food web perspective however there are several key gaps in our understanding of how the geochemistry may promote such a large microbial biodiversity and yet despite this the energy derived from microbial production enters very short low diversity food chains it is probable that given the moderate lake volume hydrological processes have a much stronger influence upon ecosystem structure and function in alkaline lakes than in larger freshwater lakes because of radical changes that may occur following lake level rise and dilution as an example the only planktonic invertebrate consumers in lake bogoria up to 2010 were rotifers and protozoa burian et al 2013 ong ondo et al 2013 since that time lake levels have risen throughout the rift valley 2011 2016 and salinity became diluted by half amer unpublished data since 2013 at least the plankton has been invaded by moina sp a cladoceran crustacean never previously recorded from alkaline soda lakes concomitantly rotifera and protozoa have become irrelevant probably being out competed by the large sized filter feeder while the population of a fusiformis remained at about half the density of the previous 20 years tebbs 2014 a further gap in our understanding concerns the range of energy transfer mechanisms that sustain microbial communities there is weak evidence that inorganic energy rich compounds can be reduced by unique microbial assemblages in a parallel situation to deep sea vents the composition of the microbial loop has been approached by recent studies e g burian et al 2013 ong ondo et al 2013 but nothing is known about the detailed structure and dynamics of these communities we do not understand how much a fusiformis is consumed by planktonic invertebrates as opposed to how much enters the decomposer chain in different lakes we do not know how much of the cyanobacterial turnover is caused by viral predation which has been shown to be a key driver in ocean systems dominated by cyanobacteria sepulveda et al 2016 we do not know the extent to which the microbial loop is able to regenerate inorganic phosphate as opposed to its continuous regeneration from geochemical sources 6 concluding remarks future climate changes could cause unpredictable ecohydrological changes within lake basins throughout east africa at the same time local impacts are pervasive with rampant deforestation land use intensification water abstraction for irrigation and inter basin transfer the high lake level phase that started in 2011 and continued until present does not seem to match higher rainfall and probably could be ascribed to higher runoff rainfall ratio caused by basin degradation odongo et al 2015 interpreting and predicting the factors that rule lake hydrology represent an increasingly urgent challenge dilution engendered by increased runoff is tied to changes in lake biogeochemistry with cascading effects onto bacterial communities and the food chains they support up to flamingos greater research effort is needed to investigate the highly diverse bacterial communities that develop in the rift valley lakes whose biodiversity is yet to be revealed this can be highly beneficial for our understanding of bacterial ecology and dynamics in general as well as for the development of new biotechnologies that can be supported by new enzymes isolated from natural bacterial communities academic research should provide a coherent interdisciplinary perspective of the overall value of the ecosystems services offered by these lakes these include cultural services linked to tourism that need to be preserved through adequate conservation measures as well as enhanced by tourism development strategies the management of these lakes will require a multi disciplinary

1161,using the loicz and the uee models we estimated the nutrient budget in the wami river estuary tanzania to better understand the functioning of the ecosystem and assess its health we found that during the wet season when river flows are high the residence time of the estuary is typically one day or less and thus little of the riverine nutrients are processed in the estuary during the dry season the residence time is much longer and as a result the nutrients are processed in the system the nutrient budget reveals the importance of other sources of nutrients than just dissolved riverine nutrients these include riverine detritus inflow mangrove litter fall and nutrients from hippo excretion we found no sign of eutrophication the estuarine food web thus appears healthy in the saline region of the estuary however excessive water abstraction in the catchment has resulted in severely decreased flows in the wami river in the dry season to the point that the freshwater part of the estuary has essentially disappeared i e the estuary is now saline up to the tidal limit during the dry season though the estuary is protected by being included in the saadani national park the system is stressed by dry season salinization which is seriously affecting the freshwater dependent flora and fauna this calls for remedial ecohydrology based measures at both the watershed scale and the local scale keywords loicz model uee model nutrient budget net ecosystem metabolism ecosystem modeling ecohydrology 1 introduction estuaries receive dissolved and particulate nutrients from different sources in the water catchment e g land run off sediments atmospheric deposition and underlying bedrock and coastal waters langston et al 2003 these nutrients are processed through various hydrodynamic biogeochemical and sediment transport processes day et al 2006 wolanski and elliott 2015 increasing populations and socioeconomic activities as well as changing land use practice in many catchments and coastal areas have to a large extent contributed to a global increase in nutrient loading to estuaries and coastal zones worldwide this can lead to enhanced biological productivity which may be good and eutrophication which is generally bad for the ecosystem and can also negatively affect human health and the provision of ecosystem services however eutrophication may be inhibited by increased turbidity resulting from increased soil erosion from poor land use valiela et al 1997 smith et al 2003 cardoso et al 2004 wolanski et al 2004 kennison et al 2004 painting et al 2007 van den belt and costanza 2012 wolanski and elliott 2015 thus to avoid or temper such problems the management of estuaries and associated coastal zones requires a proper understanding of sources and sinks of nutrients in the estuary nixon et al 1995 humborg et al 2000 there are various models that can be used to estimate the net budget of c n and p in estuaries the basic question posed for such models to answer is where do the nutrients go the simplest models are based on simple mass balance calculations that ignore the processing of nutrients within the estuarine food web chen and wang 1999 eyre and mckee 2002 maher and eyre 2012 a more realistic model that has been used in more than 250 estuaries worldwide is the loicz estuarine biogeochemical model which considers only dissolved nutrients ignores the particulate nutrients and the detritus but includes the net ecosystem metabolism gordon et al 1996 swaney et al 2011 this model has been recently improved to consider also the particulate nutrients i e the sorption desorption of nutrients on the suspended fine sediment xu et al 2013 2015 though it still ignores the role of detritus as well as the processing of nutrients in the trophic food web above the phytoplankton to overcome these shortcomings the unesco estuarine ecohydrology uee model was developed wolanski et al 2004 2006 ben hamadou et al 2011 wolanski and elliott 2015 bonthu et al 2016 our study aims to compare the findings of these two models in the wami estuary tanzania and to use these results as well as those from field studies to estimate its ecosystem health the whole wami estuary is protected in the saadani national park both models suggest that the ecosystem is healthy with no sign of eutrophication and that the system depends on additional nutrients than just riverine dissolved nutrients and these include detritus mangrove litter fall and hippo excreta the major threat to the ecosystem is the lack of governance as there is no enforcement of minimum environmental flows of the river excessive water withdrawal occurs in the catchment and results in the freshwater part of the estuary disappearing in the dry season with major impacts on the wildlife of saadani national park we suggest the need for remedial measures at both the watershed and the local scale in managing water resources this study complements previous studies which have addressed the socioeconomic importance ecosystem services and environmental flow assessments for the wami river and its estuary but not its ecosystem health anderson et al 2007 wrbwo 2008 mcnally et al 2011 mosha and gallardo 2013 kiwango et al 2015 fiu glows 2016 as such this study provides scientific information to serve as the basis for proper management options and decision making processes for the wami river at the catchment scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area our study site was the wami estuary in tanzania fig 1 one of the most productive areas of tanzania in terms of prawn fisheries tobey 2008 mosha and gallardo 2013 it is strictly protected as it is included in the saadani national park sanapa it experiences semi diurnal tides with strong diurnal inequality the tidal range reaches up to 4m during spring tides and the influence may extend up to 8km upstream the first five kilometers of the estuary are occupied by mangroves followed by acacia trees and palms the mangroves serve as breeding and nursery grounds for fish prawns and birds anderson et al 2007 the estuary also supports terrestrial wildlife by providing drinking water in its freshwater region near the tidal limit during the dry season when other water sources in sanapa are dry and it also provides a habitat for mammals crustaceans reptiles and birds kiwango et al 2015 2 2 physical properties data on river discharge rainfall nutrients dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip salinity and suspended particulate matter spm were obtained from kiwango et al 2015 a summary of all data used in the model is shown in table 1 the estuary has a surface area of 1 098 106 m2 and a mean volume of 3 106 m3 the estuary is shallow the average depth is 2 5m and the depth may be as small as 0 5m at some points along the river recently water is increasingly being extracted from the river upstream from the estuary as a result of which the river discharge q f during the dry season is much reduced nowadays and flows of 0 2m3 s 1 now commonly occur during the dry season kiwango et al 2015 it is a turbid estuary with turbidity reaching up to more than 400 ntu and suspended sediment concentration 100mgl 1 during the dry season and 800mgl 1 during the wet season anderson et al 2007 kiwango et al 2015 as a result the secchi depth is 0 025 0 04m during the wet season and 0 2 0 7m during the dry season throughout the year the estuarine water is warm with water temperature ranging between 27 5 c and 31 9 c at high tide during the wet season vertical salinity stratification occurs in the lower 1 2km of the estuary with surface salinity 7psu and 35psu at the bottom the remaining part of the estuary is freshwater at low tide freshwater occurs throughout the estuary and a 1m thick river plume extends up to 2km offshore into the indian ocean by contrast during the dry season the system is vertically well mixed with salinity of 30psu at the mouth and 7psu at the tidal limit kiwango et al 2015 because of the absence of human settlement along the estuary and the presence of clay soils groundwater and sewage flow to the estuary are believed to be negligible though there are no actual data 2 3 the muddy loicz model the estuary was divided into three boxes river estuary and ocean following the classical loicz model gordon et al 1996 since the estuary is turbid we used the one layer muddy loicz model of xu et al 2013 for the dry season and the two layers model of xu et al 2015 for the wet season when the estuary is highly vertically stratified a list of parameters used in the model is shown in table 1 local data are lacking for the partition coefficient k d which is the fraction of the total nutrients that are in particulate form for the wami estuary we assumed it to be the same as in the chilika lagoon bonthu et al 2016 1 k d spm spm 72 where spm is the suspended matter concentration the desorption sorption of nutrients between boxes are calculated as a function of changes in k d between the boxes 2 3 1 water and salt budgets water and salt budgets were calculated based on the assumption that the system is at steady state salt behaves conservatively in the system thus the residual flow vr is 2 v r v q v p v e v g v o where v q v p v e v g and v o are the mean river inflow precipitation evaporation groundwater inflow to the estuary and advective inflow from the estuary freshwater has zero salinity and thus the salinity budget is 3 s r v r s oon s sys v x where s r salinity of residual flow at the ocean system boundary or the mean calculated as s oon s sys 2 and s ocn s sys are mean salinity of the estuarine system and ocean v x is the mixing flow from the seawater intrusion representing the tidal flushing process that occurs even in the absence of a river inflow and that can be enhanced by estuarine baroclinic flows rearranging the equation to solve for v x 4 v x s r v r s ocn s sys the total water exchange time or the residence time τ in days is calculated as 5 τ v sys v x v r where v sys is the volume of the estuary during wet season the wami estuary is highly stratified and therefore the equation for water balance is modified from the one box model to account for different layers i e water inflow from the sea deep layer is equal to the outflow from deep layer to the top layer v deep thus 6 v s v q v deep salinity in the bottom layer of the estuary is calculated as 7 v deep s oceandeep v deep s deep v z s deep s s transformation of the above equation to solve for unknown becomes 8 v s s s v q v r s r s oceandeep s s v q and 9 v z v s s s v deep s deep v r s r s deep s s where v s advective outflow from estuary surface layer to the sea and v z turbulent diffusive flow between the two layers in the estuary 2 3 2 nutrient budget nutrients in the estuary behave non conservatively as they are consumed or released by the biology in the system fluxes of nutrients with exclusion of nutrients from precipitation groundwater and evaporation are estimated from eqs 2 and 4 taking k d into account thus with a water flow q ij from compartment i to compartment j the corresponding outflow of dip is 10 dip outflow q i j dip i where dip i is the dip in compartment i this flux may not reach compartment j because it is modified by the phosphorus adsorption desorption that occurs when water transits between compartments with different values of spm thus of k d xu et al 2015 therefore the effective inflow of dip into box j is 11 dip inflow q i j tip i dip j tip j where dip j is the dip in compartment j and tip is the total inorganic phosphorus that is computed from dip using eq 1 the net budget was calculated as the difference between freshwater inflow to the estuary and outflow to the ocean and the difference between materials inflow from the ocean to the estuary and outflow from the estuary to the ocean if a nutrient y e g din or dip behaved conservatively when transported through the estuary by the water currents then 12 δ y y influx y outflux 0 but in the estuary dissolved nutrients are consumed or released by organisms as well as sorbed desorbed on suspended sediment then 13 δ y 0 2 3 3 net ecosystem metabolism and nitrification denitrification net ecosystem metabolism nem is the difference between primary production p and respiration r it was estimated stoichiometrically from din and dip which were used as proxies for c using the ratio of c n p 106 16 1 nitrogen metabolism explained as nitrogen fixation nfix conversion of n2 gas to organic n and denitrification denit conversion of no3 to n2 and n2o gases was estimated from the observed and expected δdin 14 n f i x d e n i t δ din observed δ din expected 15 δ din observed δ dip n p particulate where δdin and δdip are obtained from the nutrient budget assuming a n p ratio of 16 1 from the redfield ratio the loicz model uses only one nutrient dip for calculation of the c budget assuming stoichiometry between p and c and it uses the other nutrient din to calculate denitrification fixation rates it ignores the key role of detritus from the river inflow as well as that produced or removed by the fauna and flora in view of these pitfalls and the lack of data about k d the loicz model is somewhat qualitative conceptual 2 4 the uee model like the loicz model the uee model also uses only one dissolved nutrient in addition nutrients are remineralized from the detritus and nutrients are also directly extracted from the detritus by the fauna to drive the food chain model following the experience gained in the chilika lagoon india bonthu et al 2016 the uee model of wolanski et al 2006 was used for the wami estuary for the dry season to try to overcome the pitfall of the loicz in neglecting the role of detritus the model included the source of nutrients from hippo defecation and mangroves as an additional source of nutrients through degradation of litter fall following the loicz model predictions of a residence time 1 day in the wet season the uee model could only be applied for the dry season when the residence time is long enough 7 days that nutrients can be processed in the estuary the estuary was divided into five cells with cell 1 representing the river cells 2 3 and 4 representing the estuary and cell 5 the ocean fig 2 the open boundaries are located at the tidal limit where q f was specified and at the mouth where the salinity s was set equal to 33psu turbulent diffusion was parameterized by a tidal mixing coefficient e between the cells which quantifies the fraction of water in a cell that is exchanged with adjoining cells during one day 2 tidal cycles three values of the freshwater discharge q f 0 1 1 and 0 5m3 s 1 were used as the high and lows and the median values from the river discharge data during the dry season the net advective water flux between cells fig 3 was equal to the river discharge and the net mixing coefficients e fig 3 were set so that the observed and predicted salinity values in october 2010 differed for each cell by less than 1psu thus the hydrodynamic sub model of the uee model was verified against salinity data the values of the tidal mixing rates are shown in table 2 the ecology sub model fig 4 included nutrients n phytoplankton p zooplankton z zooplankivorous fish zf benthic animals b e g shrimp detritus d detritivorous fish df and carnivorous omnivorous fish cf it also included mangroves as a source of plant litter and as a nursery ground i e source of juvenile fauna and hippos as a source of detritus through defecation fig 4 the estuary received dissolved nutrients from freshwater inflows from the decomposition of mangrove litter and from remineralisation of detritus including hippo dung and as the nutrients were transported from cell to cell by the water currents it also gained or lost dissolved nutrients by sorption desorption from suspended sediment using the same formula for k d as in the loicz model fig 4 another source of nutrients was the mangrove litter in the form of leaves that drop off the trees their fate was measured by kiwango et al 2015 who found that about 32 of the fallen leaves were exported to the estuary these leaves decompose to produce nutrients robertson 1988 atmospheric deposition of nutrients was ignored suspended sediments from the catchment that entered the estuary formed the turbidity maximum zone tm in the area of low salinity which then acted as a nutrient trap whose efficiency was determined by k d wolanski et al 2006 wolanski and elliott 2015 nutrient transformations and their incorporation in the food web occurred initially within the pelagic microbial food webs these nutrients are then transferred to the upper trophic levels e g fish and prawns fig 4 alongi 1998 wolanski and elliott 2015 thus the wami estuary was modelled as a converter of phytoplankton to secondary consumers and detrital particles and a conveyor of detrital matter to the sea nutrients planktons detritus fish and shrimp are recognized as non consecutive constituents 2 5 data source for the uee model of the wami estuary the model requires a number of parameters that were obtained from the field data or from other studies in similar environments the main three parameters that are required by the model are the biomass transfer rate the predator saturation value and switch off value of a prey unfortunately there are no data for these three parameters for the wami estuary therefore we adopted the values for the chilika lagoon from bonthu et al 2016 mangrove production of effective plant litter i e the plant litter not consumed by crabs and its decomposition rate were assumed following robertson 1988 metcalfe et al 2011 roy et al 2012 and kiwango et al 2015 hippo production of detritus through defecation was modelled after subalusky et al 2015 and the number of hippo 100 was measured by one of the present authors hk the final values were selected based on the best fit between observed and predicted values of nutrients and suspended sediment concentration ssc ssc salinity nutrients and phytoplankton data came from kiwango et al 2015 and they were used in the model a list of final adopted values of parameters is shown in table 3 the final run was used as the basis for sensitivity tests by including and excluding mangroves and hippos in order to determine their likely contribution to the estuarine food web 3 results 3 1 results from the loicz model water salt and nutrient budget predictions are summarized in table 4 the estuary has a relatively long residence time of about 7 days in dry season and very short time of 0 5 days during wet season the model predicts that during the wet season the wami estuary exported to the ocean about twice the amount of din it received from the river and it retained about 22 of the riverine dip inflow in the dry season the estuary received a small amount of din and it exported to the ocean 700 times that amount furthermore it also exported to the ocean much more 6 4 times dip than it received from the river thus the loicz model suggests that in the dry season the wami estuary produced a large amount of nutrients but it does not suggest where those nutrients come from further the effect of spm on nem was also taken into account and results show that the value of nem increases by about 10 if the spm was excluded table 5 thus for the wami river the changes in the spm values from cell to cell are too small to generate through changes in k d a major sink or source of nutrients through sorption desorption on the suspended sediment the difference between primary productivity and ecosystem respiration is a measure of the net ecosystem metabolism nem during the wet season the nem was positive indicating an autotrophic system while in dry season the system was heterotrophic with negative nem the nitrogen metabolism expressed as n fix denit was positive during the wet season and negative during the dry season this implies that nitrogen fixation occurs during the dry season and de nitrification during the wet season however these predictions for nem and n fix denit may be inaccurate because they neglect the additional sources of nutrients 3 2 results from the uee model predicted and observed values of salinity nutrients and phytoplankton agree well with each other during the dry season fig 5 the results show that the small river flow q f leads to increased salinity in the upper reaches of the estuary for example with q f 0 1m3 s 1 the salinity is high in the area of tidal limit 17 7psu as observed in the field but when q f increases to 0 5m3 s 1 and 1m3 s 1 the salinity at the tidal limit decreases to 3 5psu and 1psu respectively phytoplankton biomass also shows an increasing trend with increasing values of q f fig 5 at cell no 2 i e in the upper estuary the phytoplankton biomass decreased sharply but it increased at the other cells and this increase was magnified with increasing values of q f fig 5 which is a characteristic of estuaries whitfield et al 2012 whereby there is a decrease in diversity with a progression from both the freshwater and marine ends of the spectrum with the 5 7psu salinity area being dominated by a small number of true brackish estuarine species the uee model thus appears able to reproduce the concept of the remane diagram whitfield et al 2012 the uee model was used to try to answer the question raised by the loicz model namely where do the extra nutrients that are needed to balance the nutrient budget come from to do that a number of sensitivity tests were carried out different scenarios that involve changing one parameter at a time were evaluated results from the sensitivity tests table 6 show that the mangroves double the shrimp biomass fig 6 this prediction is supported by mcnally et al 2011 who found that the increased mangrove cover in the wami estuary since it was protected in the saadani national park contributed to increasing income from shrimp fisheries the presence of mangroves also increased phytoplankton biomass and decreases zooplankton biomass table 6 the hippos measurably affected the nutrient concentration in the estuary for q f 0 1m3 s 1 but not for larger values of q f there were too few hippos to affect significantly the shrimp and fish stock fig 6 4 discussion the wami estuarine ecosystem depends on the river discharge and this discharge varies seasonally syvitski et al 2014 seyam and othman 2015 wolanski and elliott 2015 changes in river flow are associated with changes in transport of materials and energy to and from the estuary high amounts of riverine dip and din are transported to the estuary during the wet season and small amounts during the dry season with negligible amount of din this seasonal variation in river flow introduces a seasonal variation in the residence time which is an important parameter as it determines how much time the nutrients have to be processed in the estuary before being flushed seaward dettmann 2001 wang et al 2004 wolanski et al 2004 the loicz model estimated the residence time for wami estuary to be 7 days during the dry season and 0 5 day during the wet season as for using the loicz and uee models to estimate the net nutrient budgets in the estuary we must first ask the question of how robust these two models are any model is conceptual in the absence of field data the loicz model is mainly predictive and cannot be verified except through site specific extensive biophysical studies of the nutrient budget such as the oxygen incubation method dic budgeting through direct oceanographic measurements of fluxes and the response surface difference method based on diel o2 changes gazeau et al 2005 while the loicz model considers the hydrodynamics sediments nutrients and phytoplankton to quantify the net ecosystem metabolism it may lead to incorrect results as it greatly over simplifies the food chain and it neglects the role of detritus bonthu et al 2016 indeed it seems to predict possibly unrealistic results for the wami estuary in the dry season such as an outflow of nutrients that is several hundred times larger than the riverine inflow of the same nutrients the uee model combines all the processes in the loicz model plus the processing of nutrients through the estuarine food web including the role of detritus in fuelling the ecosystem however the uee model can only be verified for salinity nutrients and phytoplankton for which there are data and the rest of the model is thus conceptual in the absence of field data on the other components of the food web the loicz model predicted that the estuary flipped from autotrophic during the wet season to heterotrophic during the dry season however the loicz model predictions of the net nutrient budget for the dry season appear unrealistic because the predicted export of nutrients seems unrealistically large 700 times larger compared to the riverine inflow of the same nutrient and this casts doubt on the validity of the model this suggests that another source of nutrients exists we suggest that like in the chilika lagoon india this source may the riverine detritus bonthu et al 2016 because the sensitivity tests using the uee model on the two other likely sources of nutrients namely mangrove litter fall and hippo excreta are not able to account for the unrealistically large difference between riverine import and seaward export of the nutrients another source of error in the nutrient budget is that fauna such as fish and shrimp may also through migration transfer nutrients from estuaries to oceans or vice versa yáñez arancibia 1985 deegan 1993 studies of the dietary sources of fish in the wami estuary are needed to validate that part of the uee model about 32 of the stomach content of the detritivorous fish valamugil from the nearby pangani estuary was detritus mwijage et al unpublished data and as the pangani and wami estuaries appear similar we suspect that a similar high dependence on detritus may occur in the wami estuary the field data on nutrients and phytoplankton show no evidence of eutrophication and the uee model also suggests that the ecosystem is healthy there is no sign of eutrophication thus the wami estuarine ecosystem appears healthy in the saline region of the estuary however excessive water abstraction in the catchment has resulted in severely decreased flows in the wami river in the dry season so that in recent years the freshwater part of the estuary has essentially disappeared i e the estuary is now saline up to the tidal limit during the dry season the freshwater ecosystem is disappearing and the animals depending on freshwater for drinking are severely impacted one such animal is the hippo through their dung they provide food and nutrients for fish algae and aquatic plants thereby increasing fish population onyeanusi 1999 subalusky et al 2015 the results from the uee model show that for river discharge q f 0 5m3 s 1 the hippos in the wami estuary do not affect significantly the shrimp and the fish stock but they do affect nutrient concentration for q f 0 1m3 s 1 the hippos are thus an important part of the ecosystem this prediction is worrisome because low values of q f 0 1 0 2m3 s 1 sustained for 7 days generate high salinities 17psu at the tidal limit such high salinities are too high for the hippos to stay in the estuary the animals would have to migrate away in search of freshwater and saadani national park would be degraded this scenario unfortunately is increasingly likely and some precursors have already been observed in the field by one of the present authors kw the lack of freshwater in the wami river in the park is already affecting terrestrial wildlife in search of freshwater to drink as well as changing the distribution of flora all along the upper estuary further degrading the park h kiwango unpublished data thus the key management issue for the wami estuary is the reduction of the freshwater discharge q f as a result of excessive extraction of water in the watershed this impacts not only the ecosystem in saadani national park but also adjacent coastal communities in terms of wildlife tourism and local livelihoods 5 conclusion though both the loicz and the ueem models have shortcomings careful assessment of the field data and the results from the two models suggests that the wami estuary ecosystem appears healthy it may be evolving to increasingly using different sources of nutrients especially detritus as a result of decreasing river inflow during the dry season however the wami estuary has now lost its freshwater section during the dry season this has severe implications for the ecosystem while the mangroves may adapt by allowing more saline resistant species to move in the fish and animals that depend on freshwater are severely impacted this includes the hippos the crocodiles and all the land animals that come to the estuary to drink freshwater in the upper estuary the whole of the saadani national park wildlife is at risk therefore there is a pressing need for tanzania to implement governance of the wami river catchment and apply ecohydrology solutions to reduce riverine sediment and maintain minimum environmental flows in the absence of such governance by tanzania we suggest that to save wildlife in saadani national park and its wildlife tourism and local livelihoods a large water hole should be dug near the upper estuary

1161,using the loicz and the uee models we estimated the nutrient budget in the wami river estuary tanzania to better understand the functioning of the ecosystem and assess its health we found that during the wet season when river flows are high the residence time of the estuary is typically one day or less and thus little of the riverine nutrients are processed in the estuary during the dry season the residence time is much longer and as a result the nutrients are processed in the system the nutrient budget reveals the importance of other sources of nutrients than just dissolved riverine nutrients these include riverine detritus inflow mangrove litter fall and nutrients from hippo excretion we found no sign of eutrophication the estuarine food web thus appears healthy in the saline region of the estuary however excessive water abstraction in the catchment has resulted in severely decreased flows in the wami river in the dry season to the point that the freshwater part of the estuary has essentially disappeared i e the estuary is now saline up to the tidal limit during the dry season though the estuary is protected by being included in the saadani national park the system is stressed by dry season salinization which is seriously affecting the freshwater dependent flora and fauna this calls for remedial ecohydrology based measures at both the watershed scale and the local scale keywords loicz model uee model nutrient budget net ecosystem metabolism ecosystem modeling ecohydrology 1 introduction estuaries receive dissolved and particulate nutrients from different sources in the water catchment e g land run off sediments atmospheric deposition and underlying bedrock and coastal waters langston et al 2003 these nutrients are processed through various hydrodynamic biogeochemical and sediment transport processes day et al 2006 wolanski and elliott 2015 increasing populations and socioeconomic activities as well as changing land use practice in many catchments and coastal areas have to a large extent contributed to a global increase in nutrient loading to estuaries and coastal zones worldwide this can lead to enhanced biological productivity which may be good and eutrophication which is generally bad for the ecosystem and can also negatively affect human health and the provision of ecosystem services however eutrophication may be inhibited by increased turbidity resulting from increased soil erosion from poor land use valiela et al 1997 smith et al 2003 cardoso et al 2004 wolanski et al 2004 kennison et al 2004 painting et al 2007 van den belt and costanza 2012 wolanski and elliott 2015 thus to avoid or temper such problems the management of estuaries and associated coastal zones requires a proper understanding of sources and sinks of nutrients in the estuary nixon et al 1995 humborg et al 2000 there are various models that can be used to estimate the net budget of c n and p in estuaries the basic question posed for such models to answer is where do the nutrients go the simplest models are based on simple mass balance calculations that ignore the processing of nutrients within the estuarine food web chen and wang 1999 eyre and mckee 2002 maher and eyre 2012 a more realistic model that has been used in more than 250 estuaries worldwide is the loicz estuarine biogeochemical model which considers only dissolved nutrients ignores the particulate nutrients and the detritus but includes the net ecosystem metabolism gordon et al 1996 swaney et al 2011 this model has been recently improved to consider also the particulate nutrients i e the sorption desorption of nutrients on the suspended fine sediment xu et al 2013 2015 though it still ignores the role of detritus as well as the processing of nutrients in the trophic food web above the phytoplankton to overcome these shortcomings the unesco estuarine ecohydrology uee model was developed wolanski et al 2004 2006 ben hamadou et al 2011 wolanski and elliott 2015 bonthu et al 2016 our study aims to compare the findings of these two models in the wami estuary tanzania and to use these results as well as those from field studies to estimate its ecosystem health the whole wami estuary is protected in the saadani national park both models suggest that the ecosystem is healthy with no sign of eutrophication and that the system depends on additional nutrients than just riverine dissolved nutrients and these include detritus mangrove litter fall and hippo excreta the major threat to the ecosystem is the lack of governance as there is no enforcement of minimum environmental flows of the river excessive water withdrawal occurs in the catchment and results in the freshwater part of the estuary disappearing in the dry season with major impacts on the wildlife of saadani national park we suggest the need for remedial measures at both the watershed and the local scale in managing water resources this study complements previous studies which have addressed the socioeconomic importance ecosystem services and environmental flow assessments for the wami river and its estuary but not its ecosystem health anderson et al 2007 wrbwo 2008 mcnally et al 2011 mosha and gallardo 2013 kiwango et al 2015 fiu glows 2016 as such this study provides scientific information to serve as the basis for proper management options and decision making processes for the wami river at the catchment scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area our study site was the wami estuary in tanzania fig 1 one of the most productive areas of tanzania in terms of prawn fisheries tobey 2008 mosha and gallardo 2013 it is strictly protected as it is included in the saadani national park sanapa it experiences semi diurnal tides with strong diurnal inequality the tidal range reaches up to 4m during spring tides and the influence may extend up to 8km upstream the first five kilometers of the estuary are occupied by mangroves followed by acacia trees and palms the mangroves serve as breeding and nursery grounds for fish prawns and birds anderson et al 2007 the estuary also supports terrestrial wildlife by providing drinking water in its freshwater region near the tidal limit during the dry season when other water sources in sanapa are dry and it also provides a habitat for mammals crustaceans reptiles and birds kiwango et al 2015 2 2 physical properties data on river discharge rainfall nutrients dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip salinity and suspended particulate matter spm were obtained from kiwango et al 2015 a summary of all data used in the model is shown in table 1 the estuary has a surface area of 1 098 106 m2 and a mean volume of 3 106 m3 the estuary is shallow the average depth is 2 5m and the depth may be as small as 0 5m at some points along the river recently water is increasingly being extracted from the river upstream from the estuary as a result of which the river discharge q f during the dry season is much reduced nowadays and flows of 0 2m3 s 1 now commonly occur during the dry season kiwango et al 2015 it is a turbid estuary with turbidity reaching up to more than 400 ntu and suspended sediment concentration 100mgl 1 during the dry season and 800mgl 1 during the wet season anderson et al 2007 kiwango et al 2015 as a result the secchi depth is 0 025 0 04m during the wet season and 0 2 0 7m during the dry season throughout the year the estuarine water is warm with water temperature ranging between 27 5 c and 31 9 c at high tide during the wet season vertical salinity stratification occurs in the lower 1 2km of the estuary with surface salinity 7psu and 35psu at the bottom the remaining part of the estuary is freshwater at low tide freshwater occurs throughout the estuary and a 1m thick river plume extends up to 2km offshore into the indian ocean by contrast during the dry season the system is vertically well mixed with salinity of 30psu at the mouth and 7psu at the tidal limit kiwango et al 2015 because of the absence of human settlement along the estuary and the presence of clay soils groundwater and sewage flow to the estuary are believed to be negligible though there are no actual data 2 3 the muddy loicz model the estuary was divided into three boxes river estuary and ocean following the classical loicz model gordon et al 1996 since the estuary is turbid we used the one layer muddy loicz model of xu et al 2013 for the dry season and the two layers model of xu et al 2015 for the wet season when the estuary is highly vertically stratified a list of parameters used in the model is shown in table 1 local data are lacking for the partition coefficient k d which is the fraction of the total nutrients that are in particulate form for the wami estuary we assumed it to be the same as in the chilika lagoon bonthu et al 2016 1 k d spm spm 72 where spm is the suspended matter concentration the desorption sorption of nutrients between boxes are calculated as a function of changes in k d between the boxes 2 3 1 water and salt budgets water and salt budgets were calculated based on the assumption that the system is at steady state salt behaves conservatively in the system thus the residual flow vr is 2 v r v q v p v e v g v o where v q v p v e v g and v o are the mean river inflow precipitation evaporation groundwater inflow to the estuary and advective inflow from the estuary freshwater has zero salinity and thus the salinity budget is 3 s r v r s oon s sys v x where s r salinity of residual flow at the ocean system boundary or the mean calculated as s oon s sys 2 and s ocn s sys are mean salinity of the estuarine system and ocean v x is the mixing flow from the seawater intrusion representing the tidal flushing process that occurs even in the absence of a river inflow and that can be enhanced by estuarine baroclinic flows rearranging the equation to solve for v x 4 v x s r v r s ocn s sys the total water exchange time or the residence time τ in days is calculated as 5 τ v sys v x v r where v sys is the volume of the estuary during wet season the wami estuary is highly stratified and therefore the equation for water balance is modified from the one box model to account for different layers i e water inflow from the sea deep layer is equal to the outflow from deep layer to the top layer v deep thus 6 v s v q v deep salinity in the bottom layer of the estuary is calculated as 7 v deep s oceandeep v deep s deep v z s deep s s transformation of the above equation to solve for unknown becomes 8 v s s s v q v r s r s oceandeep s s v q and 9 v z v s s s v deep s deep v r s r s deep s s where v s advective outflow from estuary surface layer to the sea and v z turbulent diffusive flow between the two layers in the estuary 2 3 2 nutrient budget nutrients in the estuary behave non conservatively as they are consumed or released by the biology in the system fluxes of nutrients with exclusion of nutrients from precipitation groundwater and evaporation are estimated from eqs 2 and 4 taking k d into account thus with a water flow q ij from compartment i to compartment j the corresponding outflow of dip is 10 dip outflow q i j dip i where dip i is the dip in compartment i this flux may not reach compartment j because it is modified by the phosphorus adsorption desorption that occurs when water transits between compartments with different values of spm thus of k d xu et al 2015 therefore the effective inflow of dip into box j is 11 dip inflow q i j tip i dip j tip j where dip j is the dip in compartment j and tip is the total inorganic phosphorus that is computed from dip using eq 1 the net budget was calculated as the difference between freshwater inflow to the estuary and outflow to the ocean and the difference between materials inflow from the ocean to the estuary and outflow from the estuary to the ocean if a nutrient y e g din or dip behaved conservatively when transported through the estuary by the water currents then 12 δ y y influx y outflux 0 but in the estuary dissolved nutrients are consumed or released by organisms as well as sorbed desorbed on suspended sediment then 13 δ y 0 2 3 3 net ecosystem metabolism and nitrification denitrification net ecosystem metabolism nem is the difference between primary production p and respiration r it was estimated stoichiometrically from din and dip which were used as proxies for c using the ratio of c n p 106 16 1 nitrogen metabolism explained as nitrogen fixation nfix conversion of n2 gas to organic n and denitrification denit conversion of no3 to n2 and n2o gases was estimated from the observed and expected δdin 14 n f i x d e n i t δ din observed δ din expected 15 δ din observed δ dip n p particulate where δdin and δdip are obtained from the nutrient budget assuming a n p ratio of 16 1 from the redfield ratio the loicz model uses only one nutrient dip for calculation of the c budget assuming stoichiometry between p and c and it uses the other nutrient din to calculate denitrification fixation rates it ignores the key role of detritus from the river inflow as well as that produced or removed by the fauna and flora in view of these pitfalls and the lack of data about k d the loicz model is somewhat qualitative conceptual 2 4 the uee model like the loicz model the uee model also uses only one dissolved nutrient in addition nutrients are remineralized from the detritus and nutrients are also directly extracted from the detritus by the fauna to drive the food chain model following the experience gained in the chilika lagoon india bonthu et al 2016 the uee model of wolanski et al 2006 was used for the wami estuary for the dry season to try to overcome the pitfall of the loicz in neglecting the role of detritus the model included the source of nutrients from hippo defecation and mangroves as an additional source of nutrients through degradation of litter fall following the loicz model predictions of a residence time 1 day in the wet season the uee model could only be applied for the dry season when the residence time is long enough 7 days that nutrients can be processed in the estuary the estuary was divided into five cells with cell 1 representing the river cells 2 3 and 4 representing the estuary and cell 5 the ocean fig 2 the open boundaries are located at the tidal limit where q f was specified and at the mouth where the salinity s was set equal to 33psu turbulent diffusion was parameterized by a tidal mixing coefficient e between the cells which quantifies the fraction of water in a cell that is exchanged with adjoining cells during one day 2 tidal cycles three values of the freshwater discharge q f 0 1 1 and 0 5m3 s 1 were used as the high and lows and the median values from the river discharge data during the dry season the net advective water flux between cells fig 3 was equal to the river discharge and the net mixing coefficients e fig 3 were set so that the observed and predicted salinity values in october 2010 differed for each cell by less than 1psu thus the hydrodynamic sub model of the uee model was verified against salinity data the values of the tidal mixing rates are shown in table 2 the ecology sub model fig 4 included nutrients n phytoplankton p zooplankton z zooplankivorous fish zf benthic animals b e g shrimp detritus d detritivorous fish df and carnivorous omnivorous fish cf it also included mangroves as a source of plant litter and as a nursery ground i e source of juvenile fauna and hippos as a source of detritus through defecation fig 4 the estuary received dissolved nutrients from freshwater inflows from the decomposition of mangrove litter and from remineralisation of detritus including hippo dung and as the nutrients were transported from cell to cell by the water currents it also gained or lost dissolved nutrients by sorption desorption from suspended sediment using the same formula for k d as in the loicz model fig 4 another source of nutrients was the mangrove litter in the form of leaves that drop off the trees their fate was measured by kiwango et al 2015 who found that about 32 of the fallen leaves were exported to the estuary these leaves decompose to produce nutrients robertson 1988 atmospheric deposition of nutrients was ignored suspended sediments from the catchment that entered the estuary formed the turbidity maximum zone tm in the area of low salinity which then acted as a nutrient trap whose efficiency was determined by k d wolanski et al 2006 wolanski and elliott 2015 nutrient transformations and their incorporation in the food web occurred initially within the pelagic microbial food webs these nutrients are then transferred to the upper trophic levels e g fish and prawns fig 4 alongi 1998 wolanski and elliott 2015 thus the wami estuary was modelled as a converter of phytoplankton to secondary consumers and detrital particles and a conveyor of detrital matter to the sea nutrients planktons detritus fish and shrimp are recognized as non consecutive constituents 2 5 data source for the uee model of the wami estuary the model requires a number of parameters that were obtained from the field data or from other studies in similar environments the main three parameters that are required by the model are the biomass transfer rate the predator saturation value and switch off value of a prey unfortunately there are no data for these three parameters for the wami estuary therefore we adopted the values for the chilika lagoon from bonthu et al 2016 mangrove production of effective plant litter i e the plant litter not consumed by crabs and its decomposition rate were assumed following robertson 1988 metcalfe et al 2011 roy et al 2012 and kiwango et al 2015 hippo production of detritus through defecation was modelled after subalusky et al 2015 and the number of hippo 100 was measured by one of the present authors hk the final values were selected based on the best fit between observed and predicted values of nutrients and suspended sediment concentration ssc ssc salinity nutrients and phytoplankton data came from kiwango et al 2015 and they were used in the model a list of final adopted values of parameters is shown in table 3 the final run was used as the basis for sensitivity tests by including and excluding mangroves and hippos in order to determine their likely contribution to the estuarine food web 3 results 3 1 results from the loicz model water salt and nutrient budget predictions are summarized in table 4 the estuary has a relatively long residence time of about 7 days in dry season and very short time of 0 5 days during wet season the model predicts that during the wet season the wami estuary exported to the ocean about twice the amount of din it received from the river and it retained about 22 of the riverine dip inflow in the dry season the estuary received a small amount of din and it exported to the ocean 700 times that amount furthermore it also exported to the ocean much more 6 4 times dip than it received from the river thus the loicz model suggests that in the dry season the wami estuary produced a large amount of nutrients but it does not suggest where those nutrients come from further the effect of spm on nem was also taken into account and results show that the value of nem increases by about 10 if the spm was excluded table 5 thus for the wami river the changes in the spm values from cell to cell are too small to generate through changes in k d a major sink or source of nutrients through sorption desorption on the suspended sediment the difference between primary productivity and ecosystem respiration is a measure of the net ecosystem metabolism nem during the wet season the nem was positive indicating an autotrophic system while in dry season the system was heterotrophic with negative nem the nitrogen metabolism expressed as n fix denit was positive during the wet season and negative during the dry season this implies that nitrogen fixation occurs during the dry season and de nitrification during the wet season however these predictions for nem and n fix denit may be inaccurate because they neglect the additional sources of nutrients 3 2 results from the uee model predicted and observed values of salinity nutrients and phytoplankton agree well with each other during the dry season fig 5 the results show that the small river flow q f leads to increased salinity in the upper reaches of the estuary for example with q f 0 1m3 s 1 the salinity is high in the area of tidal limit 17 7psu as observed in the field but when q f increases to 0 5m3 s 1 and 1m3 s 1 the salinity at the tidal limit decreases to 3 5psu and 1psu respectively phytoplankton biomass also shows an increasing trend with increasing values of q f fig 5 at cell no 2 i e in the upper estuary the phytoplankton biomass decreased sharply but it increased at the other cells and this increase was magnified with increasing values of q f fig 5 which is a characteristic of estuaries whitfield et al 2012 whereby there is a decrease in diversity with a progression from both the freshwater and marine ends of the spectrum with the 5 7psu salinity area being dominated by a small number of true brackish estuarine species the uee model thus appears able to reproduce the concept of the remane diagram whitfield et al 2012 the uee model was used to try to answer the question raised by the loicz model namely where do the extra nutrients that are needed to balance the nutrient budget come from to do that a number of sensitivity tests were carried out different scenarios that involve changing one parameter at a time were evaluated results from the sensitivity tests table 6 show that the mangroves double the shrimp biomass fig 6 this prediction is supported by mcnally et al 2011 who found that the increased mangrove cover in the wami estuary since it was protected in the saadani national park contributed to increasing income from shrimp fisheries the presence of mangroves also increased phytoplankton biomass and decreases zooplankton biomass table 6 the hippos measurably affected the nutrient concentration in the estuary for q f 0 1m3 s 1 but not for larger values of q f there were too few hippos to affect significantly the shrimp and fish stock fig 6 4 discussion the wami estuarine ecosystem depends on the river discharge and this discharge varies seasonally syvitski et al 2014 seyam and othman 2015 wolanski and elliott 2015 changes in river flow are associated with changes in transport of materials and energy to and from the estuary high amounts of riverine dip and din are transported to the estuary during the wet season and small amounts during the dry season with negligible amount of din this seasonal variation in river flow introduces a seasonal variation in the residence time which is an important parameter as it determines how much time the nutrients have to be processed in the estuary before being flushed seaward dettmann 2001 wang et al 2004 wolanski et al 2004 the loicz model estimated the residence time for wami estuary to be 7 days during the dry season and 0 5 day during the wet season as for using the loicz and uee models to estimate the net nutrient budgets in the estuary we must first ask the question of how robust these two models are any model is conceptual in the absence of field data the loicz model is mainly predictive and cannot be verified except through site specific extensive biophysical studies of the nutrient budget such as the oxygen incubation method dic budgeting through direct oceanographic measurements of fluxes and the response surface difference method based on diel o2 changes gazeau et al 2005 while the loicz model considers the hydrodynamics sediments nutrients and phytoplankton to quantify the net ecosystem metabolism it may lead to incorrect results as it greatly over simplifies the food chain and it neglects the role of detritus bonthu et al 2016 indeed it seems to predict possibly unrealistic results for the wami estuary in the dry season such as an outflow of nutrients that is several hundred times larger than the riverine inflow of the same nutrients the uee model combines all the processes in the loicz model plus the processing of nutrients through the estuarine food web including the role of detritus in fuelling the ecosystem however the uee model can only be verified for salinity nutrients and phytoplankton for which there are data and the rest of the model is thus conceptual in the absence of field data on the other components of the food web the loicz model predicted that the estuary flipped from autotrophic during the wet season to heterotrophic during the dry season however the loicz model predictions of the net nutrient budget for the dry season appear unrealistic because the predicted export of nutrients seems unrealistically large 700 times larger compared to the riverine inflow of the same nutrient and this casts doubt on the validity of the model this suggests that another source of nutrients exists we suggest that like in the chilika lagoon india this source may the riverine detritus bonthu et al 2016 because the sensitivity tests using the uee model on the two other likely sources of nutrients namely mangrove litter fall and hippo excreta are not able to account for the unrealistically large difference between riverine import and seaward export of the nutrients another source of error in the nutrient budget is that fauna such as fish and shrimp may also through migration transfer nutrients from estuaries to oceans or vice versa yáñez arancibia 1985 deegan 1993 studies of the dietary sources of fish in the wami estuary are needed to validate that part of the uee model about 32 of the stomach content of the detritivorous fish valamugil from the nearby pangani estuary was detritus mwijage et al unpublished data and as the pangani and wami estuaries appear similar we suspect that a similar high dependence on detritus may occur in the wami estuary the field data on nutrients and phytoplankton show no evidence of eutrophication and the uee model also suggests that the ecosystem is healthy there is no sign of eutrophication thus the wami estuarine ecosystem appears healthy in the saline region of the estuary however excessive water abstraction in the catchment has resulted in severely decreased flows in the wami river in the dry season so that in recent years the freshwater part of the estuary has essentially disappeared i e the estuary is now saline up to the tidal limit during the dry season the freshwater ecosystem is disappearing and the animals depending on freshwater for drinking are severely impacted one such animal is the hippo through their dung they provide food and nutrients for fish algae and aquatic plants thereby increasing fish population onyeanusi 1999 subalusky et al 2015 the results from the uee model show that for river discharge q f 0 5m3 s 1 the hippos in the wami estuary do not affect significantly the shrimp and the fish stock but they do affect nutrient concentration for q f 0 1m3 s 1 the hippos are thus an important part of the ecosystem this prediction is worrisome because low values of q f 0 1 0 2m3 s 1 sustained for 7 days generate high salinities 17psu at the tidal limit such high salinities are too high for the hippos to stay in the estuary the animals would have to migrate away in search of freshwater and saadani national park would be degraded this scenario unfortunately is increasingly likely and some precursors have already been observed in the field by one of the present authors kw the lack of freshwater in the wami river in the park is already affecting terrestrial wildlife in search of freshwater to drink as well as changing the distribution of flora all along the upper estuary further degrading the park h kiwango unpublished data thus the key management issue for the wami estuary is the reduction of the freshwater discharge q f as a result of excessive extraction of water in the watershed this impacts not only the ecosystem in saadani national park but also adjacent coastal communities in terms of wildlife tourism and local livelihoods 5 conclusion though both the loicz and the ueem models have shortcomings careful assessment of the field data and the results from the two models suggests that the wami estuary ecosystem appears healthy it may be evolving to increasingly using different sources of nutrients especially detritus as a result of decreasing river inflow during the dry season however the wami estuary has now lost its freshwater section during the dry season this has severe implications for the ecosystem while the mangroves may adapt by allowing more saline resistant species to move in the fish and animals that depend on freshwater are severely impacted this includes the hippos the crocodiles and all the land animals that come to the estuary to drink freshwater in the upper estuary the whole of the saadani national park wildlife is at risk therefore there is a pressing need for tanzania to implement governance of the wami river catchment and apply ecohydrology solutions to reduce riverine sediment and maintain minimum environmental flows in the absence of such governance by tanzania we suggest that to save wildlife in saadani national park and its wildlife tourism and local livelihoods a large water hole should be dug near the upper estuary

1162,the great ruaha river grr in tanzania was perennial before 1993 its source the usangu wetlands was also perennial since then the grr has started drying out during the dry season with a trend towards earlier and longer periods of drying this drying process degrades the surrounding ecosystems along the entire length of the grr including the ruaha national park rnp and impacts human livelihoods throughout its course it also impairs the economy of tanzania through reduced hydropower generation at the mtera and kidatu power plants the usangu wetlands dried up in 2000 2002 and 2005 during the dry season and its areal extent has been shrinking intensive livestock grazing and both dry and wet season irrigated agriculture in the usangu wetlands were the main reasons for this water crisis in 2006 the government of tanzania moved to address the crisis by removing livestock from the usangu wetlands attempting to regulate water use in the grr catchment and expanding the rnp to include the usangu wetlands the present study uses satellite radar altimetry data dated 1992 to 2015 for the usangu wetlands verified using data from water level loggers to assess the effects of these hydrological changes the combined data sets show that the perennial usangu wetlands have become re established though somewhat diminished in size and that as a result of eutrophication from fertilizers leached from irrigated fields 95 of their surface is now covered by floating vegetation resulting in reduced loss of water by evaporation this reduction has extended the water flow to the grr by one to two months these figures highlight the important role played by the wetlands vegetation in controlling the water budget the hydrological model of the usangu wetlands was further developed and verified and then used to justify the construction of a low level v notch weir at the outlet of the usangu wetlands by slowing down the outflow from the wetlands this construction would reduce the period of zero flow in the grr during the dry season by one to two months additional ecohydrological solutions based on the improvement of water governance upstream of the usangu wetlands such as controlling rice and horticultural irrigation activities along the length of the grr should be integrated with this engineering solution this would meet the hydrological needs of the water users all along the grr keywords restoration wetlands irrigation water levels ecosystems satellite radar altimetry 1 introduction in africa and throughout the world humans have modified landscapes and

2012 was adapted to combine and verify the satellite in situ data sets by correcting the satellite altimetry data for the time lag between the water level at ngiriama and at the satellite track attributable to the vegetation induced friction on the water flow through the wetlands during flow recession to correct the altimetry data for this wetland drainage time lag the satellite altimeter data was compared with the hobo data in the centre of the wetlands an excellent fit was created between those two data sets see fig 5 discussed later by extending the flow recession curve from the satellite altimeter by three weeks the correction being linear in time also a rating curve was constructed for the outflow of the usangu wetlands at ngiriama by using the smuwc river gauging data at that point when the water level at ngiriama was zero the grr flow should be zero this was checked against the 2009 2015 river flow data at msembe revealing a maximum error of six days in identifying the start of the no flow period 5 days n 7 the resulting data allowed the history of the water level in the usangu wetlands and of the grr flow at ngiriama from 1993 to 2015 to be obtained the draining of usangu wetlands in the dry season was then modelled using the open channel flow model of brown et al 1981 the net loss of water by evaporation evapotranspiration in the usangu wetlands was then calculated by comparing the 2012 water level data with the model predictions to measure the percentage cover of the floating vegetation over the wetlands a wetland vegetation survey was conducted during august 2014 at three locations in the usangu wetlands mahongole within the western usangu wetland ikoga and nyota within the eastern usangu wetland a graduated wooden 1m 1m quadrant composed of 10cm 10cm sub quadrants was used to estimate the percentage cover a score of 1or 0 was assigned if the sub quadrant was either fully covered or fully uncovered by the wetland vegetation at each location three square plots of 50m 50m were randomly established in each site with the exception of the nature of the sampling quadrats the nested sampling technique described by stohlgren et al 1995 was adopted with some modifications in every 50m 50m area 10m 10m quadrats were nested followed by other 5m 5m quadrats finally 1m 1m quadrats were nested within the 5m 5m quadrats 3 results 3 1 overgrazing the relative degree of overgrazing was found to be 221 based on total biomass 301 n 33 and 315 based on total livestock units tlu 427 n 33 the reason for the higher standard deviation could possibly be attributed to the overgrazing that occurs everywhere outside the protected area and even in the protected area in the western usangu wetland which was not been cleared hence the extensive land clearing and even a trend towards dry season desertification can be attributed to the livestock grazing around usangu as observed visually this overgrazing is also visually indicated by the modis data in the sw usangu box shown in fig 2 from where cattle have not been removed and furthermore the data reveals that this level actually increased between 2009 and 2017 not shown 3 2 increased abstraction of water and use of fertilisers there has been a large increase in large scale irrigated rice farming with the trend projected to increase in the near future under the auspices of the agriculture first policy or kilimo kwanza in swahili implemented to address food security in tanzania within the usangu landscape large scale farms occupy about 25 of the rice cultivation areas table 1 and have water user rights while the remaining 75 use water illegally according to the allowable water abstraction and flow data table 2 the anticipated increase in onion and tomato farming is expected to reduce the river flows below 25 30 that currently reaches the wetlands a dry season survey of 2015 recorded 100 water pumps along a 1km stretch of the mbarali river illegally pumping water from the river fig 3 3 3 rainfall rainfall data from mbeya showed a marked seasonal and interannual variability fig 4a annual rainfall at unilever tea decreased at a rate of 3 88mm year fig 4b while that at mbeya increased slightly at a rate of 2 28mm year fig 4c these estimates of the net increase decrease in annual rainfall appear unreliable in view of the much larger interannual variability 3 4 usangu water budget the corrected satellite altimetry data closely matches the observations from the hobo water level loggers they show that the wetlands initially fill from the ruaha river near the centre and then empty from there resulting in the creation of small water slopes typically of less than 20cm across the wetlands this slope is the difference between the uncorrected altimetry water level from the edge of the wetlands and the water level at the smuwc side in the middle of the wetlands during flow recession before the removal of cattle from usangu wetlands 1992 2005 the water depth at the ngiriama rock bar commonly reached peaks of about 1 5 2m with mean annual depth decreasing at the rate of 3 65cm year fig 6a however following the removal of cattle from the wetlands 2006 2015 the water peaked at about 0 6 1 3m with mean annual water depth decreasing at rate of only 0 04cm year which is probably too small to be statistically significant fig 6b our findings suggest that the usangu wetlands are now stabilised but receiving much less water as a result of water abstraction for irrigation it is important to note that there are still extended periods of zero flow in the grr in fig 6b these are the periods when the water depth at the ngiriama rock bar was zero from this data it was possible to calculate the yearly water flows for each hydrologic year starting in 1993 when plotted against the annual rainfall the data suggests fig 7 that the total volume of water flowing annually in the grr increased by 200gl after the removal of the cattle and restoration of the wetlands 3 5 wetlands vegetation cover in 2014 the percentage cover by floating vegetation of three sampling sites in the usangu wetlands was 65 se for mahongole 98 se for ikoga and 85 se for nyota these are in general agreement with kihwele et al 2012 who reported a 95 cover in 2011 the lower wetland vegetation cover in mahongole can be explained by the existence of few settlements and cattle in that area however no data on their density is available the most dominant species encountered during the survey were echinochloa scabra ludwigia jusiaoides and panicum maximum 4 discussion the water volume in the usangu wetland has significantly increased following government intervention the increase in water has beneficial ecological and socio economic implications for water users downstream of usangu including rnp hydroelectricity production for tanzania and the fisheries of lake mtera although the water level in the wetland has now stabilised perennial water flow in the grr has still not yet been achieved with dry outs occurring for at least one month each year the floating vegetation that now covers the wetlands fig 8a has most likely arisen following eutrophication from fertilizers leached from irrigated farms in order for an acre of a rice to have maximum yields in large scale farms about 250kg of fertilizers are required per year thus approximately 6812 tonnes of fertilizers are used every year in the usangu catchment which ultimately find their way into the wetland and this does not account for other agricultural chemicals used for agricultural production this floating vegetation has reduced the potential evaporation rate the hydraulics model accurately reproduces the recession phase of usangu in 2012 fig 8b provided that the net loss of water by evaporation evapotranspiration over the wetlands is 0 3cm day hence the water budget of the usangu wetland is strongly controlled by the floating vegetation because to fit the predicted water level with the data the net evaporation rate has to be half the value observed in the absence of the floating vegetation therefore the physico biological feedback pathways between the inflows and outflows of water in the wetland and the floating vegetation cannot be neglected in eco hydrological processes a similar effect has been reported for the okavango swamp in the botswana and the sudd wetlands in the sudan bauer et al 2004 mohamed et al 2005 the usangu wetlands have once again become perennial and in doing so have regained their sponge effect of retaining water for a longer period kihwele et al 2012 however due to the lack of large floods the floating plants settle on the bottom and are not flushed out when they die instead they form an organic layer decaying on the bottom our findings indicate that in 2015 nine years since the cattle were removed a 0 5m thick unconsolidated organic ooze layer had built up on the bottom as this material is still not consolidated it is not known how long it will take it to fill the wetlands and transform them to a seasonal flood plain this is an important topic for further research climate change may exacerbate the effects of reduced flow levels to rnp through changes in rainfall the annual rainfall itself may not necessarily increase or decrease indeed no clear trend has been found fig 4 but annual variability may increase leading to a greater possibility of more common or more severe droughts wolff et al 2011 the increase of the grr flow from the usangu wetlands following cattle removal is not enough to ensure perennial water flow in the grr because water abstraction by irrigators is higher and that cannot allow usangu wetlands to completely fill to historical levels of 1 5 2m fig 6 like wetlands elsewhere in the world zalewski 2002 wolanski et al 2004 plater and kirby 2006 the usangu wetlands are important ecohydrological tools for regulating hydrology while reducing sediments nutrient enrichment to grr and pollutant sequestration the lack of flow within the park has severe ecological and environmental consequences for biodiversity conservation fig 1 importantly other stakeholders downstream of usangu who depend on the river are equally affected thus the water crisis within the catchment basin remains unresolved there is an urgent need to prolong the flow duration during the dry season for this to happen we suggest that engineering solutions have to be integrated with eco hydrological solutions the solution that we propose consists of construction of a 1 5m high v notch weir at the ngiriama rock bar fig 8c to slow the outflow from usangu so that while the same amount of water will still flow out of usangu it will be spread over an extra 64 days fig 8b in an average hydrological year this approach will ensure that there will be water flowing through the grr throughout the year which will provide water all year round in the top half of the grr in rnp where the river bed is rocky however near the end of the recession this flow will probably not provide surface water further downstream where the river bed is sandy as the water will infiltrate underground mtahiko et al 2006 5 conclusions in summary it may not be possible to restore the full ecosystem services provided by the great ruaha river grr in tanzania due to the irrigation farming that has expanded without governance however our findings demonstrate that the ecohydrology solution adopted by the government of tanzania to restore the usangu wetlands has been greatly beneficial for the water budget of the grr and the environment we argue that governance is desperately needed to prevent further deterioration of the water budget of the grr water governance at the basin scale has previously been lacking and is now urgently needed for the aim of managing water resource use and development this will require the allocation of water between competing uses enforcing water quality and quantity standards and protecting and conserving ecosystems while considering social institutional and political factors with the large overgrazing taking place in the communal lands around the usangu wetlands there is great pressure from local politicians to allow cattle to invade these protected wetlands as records have shown this will halve the grr annual water flow and increase the grr no flow period during the dry season by one to two months such a move must be resisted finally we argue that with the little remaining water that irrigators have not yet captured it is possible to restore perennial flow in the grr in rnp by constructing a small 1 5m high v notch weir at the outlet of the usangu wetlands the radar altimetry data was found to play a very useful and productive role in monitoring water level within the usangu wetlands the use of this altimetry data provided long term hydrological time series data on water level that was successfully verified by the data from the hobo water level loggers this remote

1162,the great ruaha river grr in tanzania was perennial before 1993 its source the usangu wetlands was also perennial since then the grr has started drying out during the dry season with a trend towards earlier and longer periods of drying this drying process degrades the surrounding ecosystems along the entire length of the grr including the ruaha national park rnp and impacts human livelihoods throughout its course it also impairs the economy of tanzania through reduced hydropower generation at the mtera and kidatu power plants the usangu wetlands dried up in 2000 2002 and 2005 during the dry season and its areal extent has been shrinking intensive livestock grazing and both dry and wet season irrigated agriculture in the usangu wetlands were the main reasons for this water crisis in 2006 the government of tanzania moved to address the crisis by removing livestock from the usangu wetlands attempting to regulate water use in the grr catchment and expanding the rnp to include the usangu wetlands the present study uses satellite radar altimetry data dated 1992 to 2015 for the usangu wetlands verified using data from water level loggers to assess the effects of these hydrological changes the combined data sets show that the perennial usangu wetlands have become re established though somewhat diminished in size and that as a result of eutrophication from fertilizers leached from irrigated fields 95 of their surface is now covered by floating vegetation resulting in reduced loss of water by evaporation this reduction has extended the water flow to the grr by one to two months these figures highlight the important role played by the wetlands vegetation in controlling the water budget the hydrological model of the usangu wetlands was further developed and verified and then used to justify the construction of a low level v notch weir at the outlet of the usangu wetlands by slowing down the outflow from the wetlands this construction would reduce the period of zero flow in the grr during the dry season by one to two months additional ecohydrological solutions based on the improvement of water governance upstream of the usangu wetlands such as controlling rice and horticultural irrigation activities along the length of the grr should be integrated with this engineering solution this would meet the hydrological needs of the water

was adopted with some modifications in every 50m 50m area 10m 10m quadrats were nested followed by other 5m 5m quadrats finally 1m 1m quadrats were nested within the 5m 5m quadrats 3 results 3 1 overgrazing the relative degree of overgrazing was found to be 221 based on total biomass 301 n 33 and 315 based on total livestock units tlu 427 n 33 the reason for the higher standard deviation could possibly be attributed to the overgrazing that occurs everywhere outside the protected area and even in the protected area in the western usangu wetland which was not been cleared hence the extensive land clearing and even a trend towards dry season desertification can be attributed to the livestock grazing around usangu as observed visually this overgrazing is also visually indicated by the modis data in the sw usangu box shown in fig 2 from where cattle have not been removed and furthermore the data reveals that this level actually increased between 2009 and 2017 not shown 3 2 increased abstraction of water and use of fertilisers there has been a large increase in large scale irrigated rice farming with the trend projected to increase in the near future under the auspices of the agriculture first policy or kilimo kwanza in swahili implemented to address food security in tanzania within the usangu landscape large scale farms occupy about 25 of the rice cultivation areas table 1 and have water user rights while the remaining 75 use water illegally according to the allowable water abstraction and flow data table 2 the anticipated increase in onion and tomato farming is expected to reduce the river flows below 25 30 that currently reaches the wetlands a dry season survey of 2015 recorded 100 water pumps along a 1km stretch of the mbarali river illegally pumping water from the river fig 3 3 3 rainfall rainfall data from mbeya showed a marked seasonal and interannual variability fig 4a annual rainfall at unilever tea decreased at a rate of 3 88mm year fig 4b while that at mbeya increased slightly at a rate of 2 28mm year fig 4c these estimates of the net increase decrease in annual rainfall appear unreliable in view of the much larger interannual variability 3 4 usangu water budget the corrected satellite altimetry data closely matches the observations from the hobo water level loggers they show that the wetlands initially fill from the ruaha river near the centre and then empty from there resulting in the creation of small water slopes typically of less than 20cm across the wetlands this slope is the difference between the uncorrected altimetry water level from the edge of the wetlands and the water level at the smuwc side in the middle of the wetlands during flow recession before the removal of cattle from usangu wetlands 1992 2005 the water depth at the ngiriama rock bar commonly reached peaks of about 1 5 2m with mean annual depth decreasing at the rate of 3 65cm year fig 6a however following the removal of cattle from the wetlands 2006 2015 the water peaked at about 0 6 1 3m with mean annual water depth decreasing at rate of only 0 04cm year which is probably too small to be statistically significant fig 6b our findings suggest that the usangu wetlands are now stabilised but receiving much less water as a result of water abstraction for irrigation it is important to note that there are still extended periods of zero flow in the grr in fig 6b these are the periods when the water depth at the ngiriama rock bar was zero from this data it was possible to calculate the yearly water flows for each hydrologic year starting in 1993 when plotted against the annual rainfall the data suggests fig 7 that the total volume of water flowing annually in the grr increased by 200gl after the removal of the cattle and restoration of the wetlands 3 5 wetlands vegetation cover in 2014 the percentage cover by floating vegetation of three sampling sites in the usangu wetlands was 65 se for mahongole 98 se for ikoga and 85 se for nyota these are in general agreement with kihwele et al 2012 who reported a 95 cover in 2011 the lower wetland vegetation cover in mahongole can be explained by the existence of few settlements and cattle in that area however no data on their density is available the most dominant species encountered during the survey were echinochloa scabra ludwigia jusiaoides and panicum maximum 4 discussion the water volume in the usangu wetland has significantly increased following government intervention the increase in water has beneficial ecological and socio economic implications for water users downstream of usangu including rnp hydroelectricity production for tanzania and the fisheries of lake mtera although the water level in the wetland has now stabilised perennial water flow in the grr has still not yet been achieved with dry outs occurring for at least one month each year the floating vegetation that now covers the wetlands fig 8a has most likely arisen following eutrophication from fertilizers leached from irrigated farms in order for an acre of a rice to have maximum yields in large scale farms about 250kg of fertilizers are required per year thus approximately 6812 tonnes of fertilizers are used every year in the usangu catchment which ultimately find their way into the wetland and this does not account for other agricultural chemicals used for agricultural production this floating vegetation has reduced the potential evaporation rate the hydraulics model accurately reproduces the recession phase of usangu in 2012 fig 8b provided that the net loss of water by evaporation evapotranspiration over the wetlands is 0 3cm day hence the water budget of the usangu wetland is strongly controlled by the floating vegetation because to fit the predicted water level with the data the net evaporation rate has to be half the value observed in the absence of the floating vegetation therefore the physico biological feedback pathways between the inflows and outflows of water in the wetland and the floating vegetation cannot be neglected in eco hydrological processes a similar effect has been reported for the okavango swamp in the botswana and the sudd wetlands in the sudan bauer et al 2004 mohamed et al 2005 the usangu wetlands have once again become perennial and in doing so have regained their sponge effect of retaining water for a longer period kihwele et al 2012 however due to the lack of large floods the floating plants settle on the bottom and are not flushed out when they die instead they form an organic layer decaying on the bottom our findings indicate that in 2015 nine years since the cattle were removed a 0 5m thick unconsolidated organic ooze layer had built up on the bottom as this material is still not consolidated it is not known how long it will take it to fill the wetlands and transform them to a seasonal flood plain this is an important topic for further research climate change may exacerbate the effects of reduced flow levels to rnp through changes in rainfall the annual rainfall itself may not necessarily increase or decrease indeed no clear trend has been found fig 4 but annual variability may increase leading to a greater possibility of more common or more severe droughts wolff et al 2011 the increase of the grr flow from the usangu wetlands following cattle removal is not enough to ensure perennial water flow in the grr because water abstraction by irrigators is higher and that cannot allow usangu wetlands to completely fill to historical levels of 1 5 2m fig 6 like wetlands elsewhere in the world zalewski 2002 wolanski et al 2004 plater and kirby 2006 the usangu wetlands are important ecohydrological tools for regulating hydrology while reducing sediments nutrient enrichment to grr and pollutant sequestration the lack of flow within the park has severe ecological and environmental consequences for biodiversity conservation fig 1 importantly other stakeholders downstream of usangu who depend on the river are equally affected thus the water crisis within the catchment basin remains unresolved there is an urgent need to prolong the flow duration during the dry season for this to happen we suggest that engineering solutions have to be integrated with eco hydrological solutions the solution that we propose consists of construction of a 1 5m high v notch weir at the ngiriama rock bar fig 8c to slow the outflow from usangu so that while the same amount of water will still flow out of usangu it will be spread over an extra 64 days fig 8b in an average hydrological year this approach will ensure that there will be water flowing through the grr throughout the year which will provide water all year round in the top half of the grr in rnp where the river bed is rocky however near the end of the recession this flow will probably not provide surface water further downstream where the river bed is sandy as the water will infiltrate underground mtahiko et al 2006 5 conclusions in summary it may not be possible to restore the full ecosystem services provided by the great ruaha river grr in tanzania due to the irrigation farming that has expanded without governance however our findings demonstrate that the ecohydrology solution adopted by the government of tanzania to restore the usangu wetlands has been greatly beneficial for the water budget of the grr and the environment we argue that governance is desperately needed to prevent further deterioration of the water budget of the grr water governance at the basin scale has previously been lacking and is now urgently needed for the aim of managing water resource use and development this will require the allocation of water between competing uses enforcing water quality and quantity standards and protecting and conserving ecosystems while considering social institutional and political factors with the large overgrazing taking place in the communal lands around the usangu wetlands there is great pressure from local politicians to allow cattle to invade these protected wetlands as records have shown this will halve the grr annual water flow and increase the grr no flow period during the dry season by one to two months such a move must be resisted finally we argue that with the little remaining water that irrigators have not yet captured it is possible to restore perennial flow in the grr in rnp by constructing a small 1 5m high v notch weir at the outlet of the usangu wetlands the radar altimetry data was found to play a very useful and productive role in monitoring water level within the usangu wetlands the use of this altimetry data provided long term hydrological time series data on water level that was successfully verified by the data from the hobo water level loggers this remote

1163,the spatial and temporal variability of aquatic macroinvertebrates in relation to eco hydrological variables was investigated along the zigi river in tanzania during the end of the dry early march and wet may seasons of 2012 we studied a number of ecohydrological variables such as discharge depth velocity froude number ph temperature substrate type and conductivity together with macroinvertebrate sampling along a set of five river zones delineated based on slope identified as mountain streams ms upper foothills uf lower foothills lf rejuvenated foothills rej and mature lower river mr in the two seasons the macroinvertebrate assemblages varied significantly along the zigi river the five river zones proving to be significantly different from each other in terms of number of taxa total abundance species richness and species diversity indices while the sampling season temporal variation was not found to be significant in relation to macroinvertebrate assemblages conductivity substrate type discharge temperature and ph were found to be important factors influencing their distribution analysis further showed that the life cycle of an macroinvertebrate afronurus sp may be important in determining its temporal variability the ecohydrological approach aimed at understanding the relationships between hydrological variables and the biotic component lays the ground for prediction of macroinvertebrate indicative species based on physical parameters in tanzania and east africa as well as proper watershed management to support sustainable ecosystems keywords macroinvertebrates distribution and abundance eco hydrological factors river zonation temporal changes 1 introduction spatial and temporal variability in biological communities in particular aquatic macroinvertebrates is a widely studied characteristic of lotic ecosystems hawkins et al 1997 several studies have used aquatic macroinvertebrates as bioindicators for assessing water quality in surface waters such studies have been conducted in tanzania and east africa masese et al 2009 2010 ngupula and kayanda 2010 macroinvertebrates have also been used as indicators in determining minimum flow requirements environmental flow assessment in rivers of eastern and southern africa glows fiu 2012 2014 king et al 2000 there is strong evidence that aquatic macroinvertebrate distribution is influenced by eco hydrological variables and processes including hydrological dynamics hydraulics and in channel processes and environmental changes that occur in the river kemp et al 2000 rossaro et al 2006 rossaro et al 2006 presented different curves describing the preference of various macroinvertebrate species for velocity depth discharge froude number and substrate size demonstrating that a range of species preferences do exist other physical factors like water temperature camur elipek et al 2010 conductivity mesa 2010 dissolved oxygen gabriels et al 2007 substratum and channel geomorphology goncalves et al 2004 have also been shown to influence the distribution of macroinvertebrate assemblages the relative importance of eco hydrological processes on macroinvertebrate life varies inter and intra regionally park et al 2007 song et al 2007 hydrological hydraulic and environmental conditions in a river have been identified by many authors as the best predictive variable of macroinvertebrate distribution barmuta 1990 kemp et al 2000 blettler et al 2012 although there is a close linkage between eco hydrological factors and macroinvertebrate assemblages the understanding of how and which variables of hydrology hydraulics and environmental processes influence the macroinvertebrate assemblages is still less explored moreover this knowledge is particularly limited in tanzania this research aimed to assess the spatial and temporal distribution of macroinvertebrate assemblages along the zigi river and its relationship with eco hydrological hydrological hydraulics and environmental variables knowledge which is essential for aquatic ecosystem conservation protection and management regulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the zigi river is a perennial water body located in the tanga region north eastern tanzania fig 1 the river catchment lies between latitudes 04 48 s and 05 15 s and longitudes 38 34 e and 39 03 e with a catchment area of about 1100km2 it rises in the amani nature reserve on the eastern slopes of the east usambara mountains at an altitude of 1130masl the zigi river has two main tributaries flowing from the north muzi stream and south kihuhwi stream and after their confluence it drains eastwards out of the usambara mountains and north of the city of tanga into the indian ocean via the mabayani dam a source for the tanga municipal water supply the zigi river catchment is characterized by a bi modal rainfall pattern with long rains from march to may and short rains from october to december the annual average rainfall in the zigi catchment varies between 1000mm and 2000mm iucn 2003 the annual mean temperature ranges from 21 c in the mountainous areas to 30 c in the lower zones coastal areas the upper reaches of the catchment are mountainous consisting mainly of dense forest interspersed with tea plantations its lower parts are flat with some parts being rejuvenated comprising dry savannah type bushes and low trees as well as sisal estates coconut and palm trees are common along the coast 2 2 sampling design and site selection physical chemical parameters ph temperature and conductivity selected hydrological variables river discharge velocity depth and aquatic macroinvertebrates were sampled and measured in two sampling seasons the dry season early march and wet season may of 2012 eleven 11 sites table 1 were selected along the longitudinal zonation of the zigi river as derived from analyses of gradients measured from a 1 50 000 topographic map of the zigi catchment from topographic maps the stream gradient w was calculated as the change in elevation the difference between upper and lower contour at each site divided by the distance length of the stream segment the gradients so obtained were then used to identify river zones following a modification of the gradient scales described for south african rivers by rowntree and wadeson 1999 table 2 2 3 eco hydrological variables physico chemical parameters ph water temperature and conductivity were measured in situ using a multi meter probe hydraulic variables depth and velocity were also measured in situ using a current meter depth and velocity measurements were used to calculate the froude number using the formula from newman 1997 river discharge was measured using a signal counter current meter during the dry season and adc acoustic digital current meter and q liner during the wet season 2 4 macroinvertebrate sampling three samples from occurring biotopes were collected from each site during the wet and dry seasons at 5 different river zones ms lf uf rej and mr along the zigi river mountain torrent streams were not easily accessible thus not selected for sampling macroinvertebrates were collected by the same operator using a 30cm 30cm kick net with a 1mm mesh size and sampling time was limited to 3min samples were fixed in 80 ethanol transported to the laboratory where they were rinsed using a sieve of 1mm mesh size sorted under magnification and preserved in 70 ethanol all individuals in a sample were counted and most were identified to the genus level except for a few to the family level baetidae leptophlebiidae polycentropodidae polymitarcyidae tricorythidae veliidae and hirudinea and chironomidae and elmidae were identified to sub family level gillies 1990 mccafferty and gillies 1979 the substrate for each river zone was described following the scale sands 1 gravels 2 cobbles 3 boulders 4 and bedrock 5 the substrate was considered an environmental variable table 3 summarizes the data organization 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 eco hydrological variables hydrology hydraulic and environmental factors were studied in relation to macroinvertebrate assemblages the bioenv routine primer 6 was used for this purpose spearman rank correlation methods were used which involved random selection of variables prior to bioenv variables were subjected to the anova test using river zones and time as factors variables which showed stronger correlations with biological data 10 number of best results was selected were further analyzed using the distance based linear model distlm to assess their relative contributions to structuring biological assemblages and identify macroinvertebrate taxa that were best related to these variables 2 5 2 macroinvertebrates several metrics and diversity measures such as number of taxa total abundance the margalef species richness index d and the shannon diversity index h were calculated two way analyses of variance anova were used for testing whether there were significant differences in the diversity indices among the river zones and between the two sampling seasons multivariate analyses were also used to analyze macroinvertebrate assemblages in this study the one way anosim routine followed by the pairwise test were used to determine the macroinvertebrate community variation among sites and simper analysis clarke 1993 was performed to identify the taxa responsible for the difference between the river zones all taxa were used in the simper analysis the cut off point was not selected and to identify their percentage contribution to the dissimilarity between the zones at the end the average contribution of each taxon to the overall dissimilar existing among the river zones was calculated and ranked from the most contributing taxa to the least ones all multivariate analyses in this study were performed using the primer version 6 software package for windows in order to assess the variations in macroinvertebrate assemblages during the dry and wet seasons the data used were in two forms binary i e the presence absence of each taxonomic group and untransformed data i e the actual abundances of each taxonomic group the identified taxa that highly contributed to the overall dissimilarity among the river zones and those taxa contributed within two group dissimilarity in both seasons during simper analysis were subjected to univariate analysis two way anova testing the influence of river zones and time to their distribution differences between means have been considered statistically significant for p 0 05 when appropriate multiple comparisons for means were done on significant main effects using student newman keuls snk tests the univariate analyses were performed using the sigma plot version 11 software package for windows 3 results 3 1 eco hydrological variables the mean conductivity showed an increasing trend from the upper reaches toward the lower reaches of the river upper reaches of the river ms and uf have lower ph conductivity temperature and discharge while the lower reaches lf rej and mr proved to have the higher values of ph conductivity temperatures and discharge a similar trend was observed in both sampling seasons anova showed significant variation in the mean depth discharge temperature and ph among the river zones and between the two sampling seasons while velocity froude number and conductivity showed significant variation with respect to the river zones discharge temperature and ph showed significant differences between the two sampling seasons table 4 conductivity increased in lowland reaches with mr and rej zones registering the highest values in both sampling seasons the lowest temperatures were recorded in the upland reaches ms and uf 3 2 diversity indices number of taxa total abundance richness index and diversity index diversity indices varied significantly among the river zones defined along the zigi river anova table 5 seasonality was found to have no influence on the variation of the indices and thus the same pattern was detected in both sampling seasons the post hoc tests showed that the mature river mr zone had significantly fewer taxa smaller abundances and smaller values of the indices relative to the other river zones fig 2 3 3 macroinvertebrate assemblages a total of 956 individuals distributed in 54 taxa were collected at 9 sites along the river in the dry season the samples were numerically dominated by ephemerythidae sp ephemerythus potamonautidae sp potamonautes hydropsychidae sp and leptonema sp hydropsyche and cleopatra sp thiaridae in the wet season 1280 individuals and 56 taxa of macroinvertebrates were collected at 11 sites along the zigi river from its headwaters to the lowland areas caridina sp atyidae melanoides sp and cleopatra sp thiaridae afronurus sp heptageniidae and potamonautes sp potamonautidae were the most abundant taxa anosim analyses indicated there were significant differences in the macroinvertebrate assemblages among the five zones defined along the river table 6 in both sampling seasons for actual abundance data global r 0 8 p 0 05 global r 0 5 p 0 05 for dry and wet seasons respectively and presence absence transformed data global r 0 8 p 0 05 and global r 0 5 p 0 05 for dry and wet seasons respectively pair wise tests showed there were significant differences in each pair of the river zones except the mr and rej zones in the dry season p 10 both in terms of taxonomic composition and abundance the high global r for actual abundance data global r 0 825 and presence absence transformed data global r 0 593 was observed in the pair of mr vs rej this unexpected lack of significant difference could be due to the lowest number of permutations which was 10 in the wet season three pairs of river zones mr rej rej lf and lf uf were not significantly different from each other the remaining pairs were significantly different from each other both in terms of taxa composition and abundance table 6 taxa contributing to the dissimilarity in macroinvertebrate assemblages among the river zones are tabulated on basis of the overall average contribution to the difference among the river zones in dry season amphipsyche elminae chironominae cleopatra and potamonautes in wet season melanoides caridina afronurus potamonautes and cleopatra are the taxa contributed above 5 for the dissimilarity among the river zones based on their abundances the greatest contributors to dissimilarities with respect to the frequency of occurrence were ceratogomphus cleopatra cheumatopsyche elminae and plantala during the dry season and cleopatra potamonautes euthraulus caridina and rhagovelia in the wet season table 7 3 4 single species analysis twelve of the most important taxa contributing to the dissimilarity among the five river zones identified during simper analysis were amphipsyche afronurus melanoides caridina cleopatra elminae potamonautes ephemerythus neoperla caenis ceratogomphus and cheumatopsyche table 8 shows the analyses of variance for the most important taxa among the river zones the test showed a significant interaction between the seasons and river zones on the abundances of amphipsyche and melanoides the abundances of amphipsyche and elminae were both recorded to be high during dry season in the rejuvenated zone and melanoides was found to be abundant in the wet season in the mature river zone which could be due to the addition of the site at the mature river zone afronurus sp showed a significant difference in abundance between the two sampling seasons where the higher abundances were recorded in the wet season its distribution among the river zones did not vary significantly showing to be present in river zones fig 3 the remaining taxa cleopatra potamonautes ephemerythus neoperla caenis ceratogomphus and cheumatopsyche showed significantly different abundances among the river zones potamonautes ephemerythus and cheumatopsyche were found to be abundant in the mountain streams zone neoperla dominated the upper foothill zone while caenis and ceratogomphus were abundant in the lower foothill zone fig 3 3 5 macroinvertebrate distribution in relation to eco hydrological variables correlation of biota and physical variables revealed combinations of variables considered to influence the macroinvertebrate assemblages among the five river zones table 9 a combination of three environmental variables temperature conductivity and substrate rho 0 51 provided the best match to the macroinvertebrates patterns the best variable combinations in describing the macroinvertebrate assemblages in bioenv analysis were subjected to distance linear models distlm the results of the distance based redundancy analysis db rda showed velocity was not significantly important in influencing the distribution of macroinvertebrate assemblages table 10 it is evident from fig 4 that the mountain stream ms and upper foothill uf sites were almost all clustered in a position featured by low conductivity the lower foothill lf and rejuvenated foothill rej sites were clustered in a position indicating high ph discharge and temperature while a few sites in the mature river zone mr featured the position high conductivity the results of distlm showed a relationship between macroinvertebrate distribution and eco hydrological variables conductivity tended to have a positive effect on the abundance of caridina and melanoides substrate type were found to influence potamonautes ephemerythus and cheumatopsyche temperature and discharge were found to have the same influence toward the macroinvertebrate community while ph was shown to positively influence the distribution of cleopatra fig 4 4 discussion 4 1 eco hydrological variables conductivity showed a spatial trend of increasing along the river whereby it was observed to have highest values in the lower reaches in both sampling seasons this could be associated with the impact from the ocean tides since the sampling stations at zone mr and rej were located close to the ocean approximately 20km furthermore the presence of the dam upstream of the stations magnifies the impacts from the ocean by lowering the freshwater discharges hence increasing the estuarine conduction toward upstream which is characterized by high electrical conductivity the fact that the upper reaches that is ms and uf showed low temperatures compared to the lower reaches was due to good riparian vegetation cover at those stations vegetation cover limits solar radiation reaching the water thus contributing to minimal fluctuations of temperature giller and malmqvist 1998 4 2 spatial and temporal variation of macroinvertebrates the macroinvertebrate assemblages varied significantly along the zigi river the five river zones proving to be significantly different from each other in terms of number of taxa total abundance species richness and species diversity indices however the sampling season temporal variation was not found to be significant this could be due to a lack of or less variation in hydrological hydraulic and environmental variables measured in relation to macroinvertebrate assemblages conductivity substrate type discharge temperature and ph were found to be important factors influencing their distribution the mature river zone is exposed to a harsh environment therefore it provide to have the lowest values in terms of diversity indices the sites representing this zone are within 10km from the indian ocean and the presence of the dam upstream further prohibits the normal flow of river water this results in a complete change of water constituents becoming rich in chloride this has led to the exclusion of many taxa sensitive to this change therefore the zone has become colonized by few taxa for example thiaridae melanoides tuberculatus was the most abundant taxa in this zone the lower mature zone mr can be compared to intertidal and estuarine areas which are subjected to strong variations in physical and biological condition related to tidal cycles as a result only few species are able to survive in such conditions salgado et al 2007 arimoro et al 2011 the taxa of invertebrates able to survive and more tolerant were gastropoda m tuberculatus cleopatra and crustaceans caridina which were also observed in our study for example m tuberculatus was reported in the study of giovanelli et al 2005 as being a good invader due to its ability to adapt a wide range of environmental conditions and high reproductive rate the decreasing of the diversity indices downstream is highly linked to an increase in human population and pressure such as sand mining bathing washing clothes sand mining is a more destructive activity as it tends to ruin the habitat and change of flow regime by the creation of pools it also increases the residence time of water in these areas as pools will result to longer time expose of water to solar radiation and thus allow for more warming hawkins et al 1997 which in turn negatively affects the metabolic and life cycle of many species of macroinvertebrates apart from sand mining bathing and washing clothes alter the water quality due to addition of nutrients phosphates and nitrogen from detergents and as a result the most sensitive taxa such as plecoptera neoperla sp and ephemeroptera baetidae disappear the ms and uf zones of the zigi river where dominated by taxa associated with least impacted waters characterized by less anthropogenic activities more sensitive groups of macroinvertebrates such as baetidae some species and neoperla the abundances of which showed a decline downstream areas represented by lf caenis dominated in the middle section and amphypsyche hydropsychidae in the rejuvenated area while in the more downstream end mr single species abundance was observed in which cardina and melonoides accounted for more than 50 of the total population ms and uf were observed to have higher diversity richness abundance and number of taxa compared to the lowland zones lf rej mr the higher diversity indices in the ms and uf zones were expected because of the difference in habitat the stones type of habitat a general term we use to represent substrata of bedrock boulders cobblers and gravels the dominant habitat observed in upland zones contributed to the higher diversity indices in these zones on the contrary the sand substrate dominating the lower land areas lf and mr comprised few species of macroinvertebrates due to its instability sand is considered a poor habitat supporting fewer macroinvertebrates also tight packing of sand grains reduces the trapping of detritus and can further limit the availability of oxygen which is crucial to organisms the rej zones were dominated by the bedrock habitat which is part of the stones type of habitat but for which low abundances were observed compared to ms zones it has been described minshall et al 1985 bonada et al 2006 that abundance and taxa richness typically increase with substrate size at least up to gravels and cobbles which have been found to hold maximum abundance and taxa richness beyond that bedrock boulders the richness and diversity of macroinvertebrates decreases due to increased turbulence which can sometimes create falls especially during high flow and create pools during low flow seasons dry seasons the temporal variation of macroinvertebrate assemblages was found to be small which could also be linked to the variation in environmental and hydrological factors between the two samplings which showed a small range of change however the two samplings were very different based on taxa composition and individual abundances of macroinvertebrates the change of pattern may reflect habitat preference life history characteristics and changes of abiotic factors for example temperature discharge conductivity or flow velocity afronurus showed a significant difference in mean abundance between the dry and wet seasons but not significantly among the river zone yanoviak and mccafferty 1996 reported that the variation in the taxonomic makeup of macroinvertebrate assemblages may be due to the differences in insect life cycles while the seasonal variation in abundances and distribution often reflect the life history in our study higher abundances of afronurus were recorded during the wet season it is possible that by the time that the dry sampling was conducted the emergence had just taken place and individuals of the next generation were too small to be caught in the 1mm net similarly the studies of king 1981 and dallas 2004b have described the seasonal variation of afronurus to be related to their small sizes thus not being caught during their emergence 4 3 influence of eco hydrological variables in this study discharge and temperature showed similar influence on macroinvertebrate community structure the variation in temperature occurs longitudinally down a river system with headwaters typically cooler than lowland areas vannote et al 1980 a similar gradient was observed for the zigi river canopy cover which affects water temperature graynorth 1979 was also found to be an important factor contributing to the variations of temperatures along the zigi river discharge was also found to vary among the river zones and between times variation in discharge can lead to differences in wetted perimeter hydraulic conditions and biotope availability chessman 1995 discharge has been reported to affect the community of macroinvertebrates by lowering their abundances masese et al 2010 discharge can also have a cascade impact by affecting water temperature dallas 2004b and thus oxygen solubility seasons of low discharge are usually associated with higher temperatures and vice versa this scenario is important in explaining the spatial and temporal variation of macroinvertebrate assemblages conductivity was observed to be an important variable determining the distribution of macroinvertebrate in the zigi river the ms and uf zones featured water of low conductivity and as a result were found to contain different invertebrate communities compared to the zones in the lower reaches were conductivity was seen to increase the distribution of thiaridae melanoides and atyidae caridina were positively correlated to conductivity the type of substratum i e boulders cobbles gravels sand bedrock was identified as an important predictor of the observed macroinvertebrate assemblages distribution the river substrate changes from the upland to lowland reaches the mountain stream zone of the zigi river were dominated by boulders and some bedrock substrate the upper foothill zone substrate was composed of cobbles and gravels the lower foothill and mature river zones had sandy substrates and the rejuvenated foothill zone substrate was composed of bedrock with cascades these different types of substrates where the result of different gradient which in turn determine the habitat quality and kinds of favorable species most aquatic macroinvertebrate have specific substrate requirements and are therefore influenced by the nature and quality of the habitat available at a site for example the presence of mud or silt in a stones biotope may reduce the quality of the habitat for stone dwelling organisms dallas 2004a 2007 depth velocity and froude number have been mentioned in several studies e g kemp et al

1163,the spatial and temporal variability of aquatic macroinvertebrates in relation to eco hydrological variables was investigated along the zigi river in tanzania during the end of the dry early march and wet may seasons of 2012 we studied a number of ecohydrological variables such as discharge depth velocity froude number ph temperature substrate type and conductivity together with macroinvertebrate sampling along a set of five river zones delineated based on slope identified as mountain streams ms upper foothills uf lower foothills lf rejuvenated foothills rej and mature lower river mr in the two seasons the macroinvertebrate assemblages varied significantly along the zigi river the five river zones proving to be significantly different from each other in terms of number of taxa total abundance species richness and species diversity indices while the sampling season temporal variation was not found to be significant in relation to macroinvertebrate assemblages conductivity substrate type discharge temperature and ph were found to be important factors influencing their distribution analysis further showed that the life cycle of an macroinvertebrate afronurus sp may be important in determining its temporal variability the ecohydrological approach aimed at understanding the relationships between hydrological variables and the biotic component lays the ground for prediction of macroinvertebrate indicative species based on physical parameters in tanzania and east africa as well as proper watershed management to support sustainable ecosystems keywords macroinvertebrates distribution and abundance eco hydrological factors river zonation temporal changes 1 introduction spatial and temporal variability in biological communities in particular aquatic macroinvertebrates is a widely studied characteristic of lotic ecosystems hawkins et al 1997 several studies have used aquatic macroinvertebrates as bioindicators for assessing water quality in surface waters such studies have been conducted in tanzania and east africa masese et al 2009 2010 ngupula and kayanda 2010 macroinvertebrates have also been used as indicators in determining minimum flow requirements environmental flow assessment in rivers of eastern and southern africa glows fiu 2012 2014 king et al 2000 there is strong evidence that aquatic macroinvertebrate distribution is influenced by eco hydrological variables and processes including hydrological dynamics hydraulics and in channel processes and environmental changes that occur in the river kemp et al 2000 rossaro et al 2006 rossaro et al 2006 presented different curves describing the preference of various macroinvertebrate species for velocity depth discharge froude number and substrate size demonstrating that a range of species preferences do exist other physical factors like water temperature camur elipek et al 2010 conductivity mesa 2010 dissolved oxygen gabriels et al 2007 substratum and channel geomorphology goncalves et al 2004 have also been shown to influence the distribution of macroinvertebrate assemblages the relative importance of eco hydrological processes on macroinvertebrate life varies inter and intra regionally park et al 2007 song et al 2007 hydrological hydraulic and environmental conditions in a river have been identified by many authors as the best predictive variable of macroinvertebrate distribution barmuta 1990 kemp et al 2000 blettler et al 2012 although there is a close linkage between eco hydrological factors and macroinvertebrate assemblages the understanding of how and which variables of hydrology hydraulics and environmental processes influence the macroinvertebrate assemblages is still less explored moreover this knowledge is particularly limited in tanzania this research aimed to assess the spatial and temporal distribution of macroinvertebrate assemblages along the zigi river and its relationship with eco hydrological hydrological hydraulics and environmental variables knowledge which is essential for aquatic ecosystem conservation protection and management regulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the zigi river is a perennial water body located in the tanga region north eastern tanzania fig 1 the river catchment lies between latitudes 04 48 s and 05 15 s and longitudes 38 34 e and 39 03 e with a catchment area of about 1100km2 it rises in the amani nature reserve on the eastern slopes of the east usambara mountains at an altitude of 1130masl the zigi river has two main tributaries flowing from the north muzi stream and south kihuhwi stream and after their confluence it drains eastwards out of the usambara mountains and north of the city of tanga into the indian ocean via the mabayani dam a source for the tanga municipal water supply the zigi river catchment is characterized by a bi modal rainfall pattern with long rains from march to may and short rains from october to december the annual average rainfall in the zigi catchment varies between 1000mm and 2000mm iucn 2003 the annual mean temperature ranges from 21 c in the mountainous areas to 30 c in the lower zones coastal areas the upper reaches of the catchment are mountainous consisting mainly of dense forest interspersed with tea plantations its lower parts are flat with some parts being rejuvenated comprising dry savannah type bushes and low trees as well as sisal estates coconut and palm trees are common along the coast 2 2 sampling design and site selection physical chemical parameters ph temperature and conductivity selected hydrological variables river discharge velocity depth and aquatic macroinvertebrates were sampled and measured in two sampling seasons the dry season early march and wet season may of 2012 eleven 11 sites table 1 were selected along the longitudinal zonation of the zigi river as derived from analyses of gradients measured from a 1 50 000 topographic map of the zigi catchment from topographic maps the stream gradient w was calculated as the change in elevation the difference between upper and lower contour at each site divided by the distance length of the stream segment the gradients so obtained were then used to identify river zones following a modification of the gradient scales described for south african rivers by rowntree and wadeson 1999 table 2 2 3 eco hydrological variables physico chemical parameters ph water temperature and conductivity were measured in situ using a multi meter probe hydraulic variables depth and velocity were also measured in situ using a current meter depth and velocity measurements were used to calculate the froude number using the formula from newman 1997 river discharge was measured using a signal counter current meter during the dry season and adc acoustic digital current meter and q liner during the wet season 2 4 macroinvertebrate sampling three samples from occurring biotopes were collected from each site during the wet and dry seasons at 5 different river zones ms lf uf rej and mr along the zigi river mountain torrent streams were not easily accessible thus not selected for sampling macroinvertebrates were collected by the same operator using a 30cm 30cm kick net with a 1mm mesh size and sampling time was limited to 3min samples were fixed in 80 ethanol transported to the laboratory where they were rinsed using a sieve of 1mm mesh size sorted under magnification and preserved in 70 ethanol all individuals in a sample were counted and most were identified to the genus level except for a few to the family level baetidae leptophlebiidae polycentropodidae polymitarcyidae tricorythidae veliidae and hirudinea and chironomidae and elmidae were identified to sub family level gillies 1990 mccafferty and gillies 1979 the substrate for each river zone was described following the scale sands 1 gravels 2 cobbles 3 boulders 4 and bedrock 5 the substrate was considered an environmental variable table 3 summarizes the data organization 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 eco hydrological variables hydrology hydraulic and environmental factors were studied in relation to macroinvertebrate assemblages the bioenv routine primer 6 was used for this purpose spearman rank correlation methods were used which involved random selection of variables prior to bioenv variables were subjected to the anova test using river zones and time as factors variables which showed stronger correlations with biological data 10 number of best results was selected were further analyzed using the distance based linear model distlm to assess their relative contributions to structuring biological assemblages and identify macroinvertebrate taxa that were best related to these variables 2 5 2 macroinvertebrates several metrics and diversity measures such as number of taxa total abundance the margalef species richness index d and the shannon diversity index h were calculated two way analyses of variance anova were used for testing whether there were significant differences in the diversity indices among the river zones and between the two sampling seasons multivariate analyses were also used to analyze macroinvertebrate assemblages in this study the one way anosim routine followed by the pairwise test were used to determine the macroinvertebrate community variation among sites and simper analysis clarke 1993 was performed to identify the taxa responsible for the difference between the river zones all taxa were used in the simper analysis the cut off point was not selected and to identify their percentage contribution to the dissimilarity between the zones at the end the average contribution of each taxon to the overall dissimilar existing among the river zones was calculated and ranked from the most contributing taxa to the least ones all multivariate analyses in this study were performed using the primer version 6 software package for windows in order to assess the variations in macroinvertebrate assemblages during the dry and wet seasons the data used were in two forms binary i e the presence absence of each taxonomic group and untransformed data i e the actual abundances of each taxonomic group the identified taxa that highly contributed to the overall dissimilarity among the river zones and those taxa contributed within two group dissimilarity in both seasons during simper analysis were subjected to univariate analysis two way anova testing the influence of river zones and time to their distribution differences between means have been considered statistically significant for p 0 05 when appropriate multiple comparisons for means were done on significant main effects using student newman keuls snk tests the univariate analyses were performed using the sigma plot version 11 software package for windows 3 results 3 1 eco hydrological variables the mean conductivity showed an increasing trend from the upper reaches toward the lower reaches of the river upper reaches of the river ms and uf have lower ph conductivity temperature and discharge while the lower reaches lf rej and mr proved to have the higher values of ph conductivity temperatures and discharge a similar trend was observed in both sampling seasons anova showed significant variation in the mean depth discharge temperature and ph among the river zones and between the two sampling seasons while velocity froude number and conductivity showed significant variation with respect to the river zones discharge temperature and ph showed significant differences between the two sampling seasons table 4 conductivity increased in lowland reaches with mr and rej zones registering the highest values in both sampling seasons the lowest temperatures were recorded in the upland reaches ms and uf 3 2 diversity indices number of taxa total abundance richness index and diversity index diversity indices varied significantly among the river zones defined along the zigi river anova table 5 seasonality was found to have no influence on the variation of the indices and thus the same pattern was detected in both sampling seasons the post hoc tests showed that the mature river mr zone had significantly fewer taxa smaller abundances and smaller values of the indices relative to the other river zones fig 2 3 3 macroinvertebrate assemblages a total of 956 individuals distributed in 54 taxa were collected at 9 sites along the river in the dry season the samples were numerically dominated by ephemerythidae sp ephemerythus potamonautidae sp potamonautes hydropsychidae sp and leptonema sp hydropsyche and cleopatra sp thiaridae in the wet season 1280 individuals and 56 taxa of macroinvertebrates were collected at 11 sites along the zigi river from its headwaters to the lowland areas caridina sp atyidae melanoides sp and cleopatra sp thiaridae afronurus sp heptageniidae and potamonautes sp potamonautidae were the most abundant taxa anosim analyses indicated there were significant differences in the macroinvertebrate assemblages among the five zones defined along the river table 6 in both sampling seasons for actual abundance data global r 0 8 p 0 05 global r 0 5 p 0 05 for dry and wet seasons respectively and presence absence transformed data global r 0 8 p 0 05 and global r 0 5 p 0 05 for dry and wet seasons respectively pair wise tests showed there were significant differences in each pair of the river zones except the mr and rej zones in the dry season p 10 both in terms of taxonomic composition and abundance the high global r for actual abundance data global r 0 825 and presence absence transformed data global r 0 593 was observed in the pair of mr vs rej this unexpected lack of significant difference could be due to the lowest number of permutations which was 10 in the wet season three pairs of river zones mr rej rej lf and lf uf were not significantly different from each other the remaining pairs were significantly different from each other both in terms of taxa composition and abundance table 6 taxa contributing to the dissimilarity in macroinvertebrate assemblages among the river zones are tabulated on basis of the overall average contribution to the difference among the river zones in dry season amphipsyche elminae chironominae cleopatra and potamonautes in wet season melanoides caridina afronurus potamonautes and cleopatra are the taxa contributed above 5 for the dissimilarity among the river zones based on their abundances the greatest contributors to dissimilarities with respect to the frequency of occurrence were ceratogomphus cleopatra cheumatopsyche elminae and plantala during the dry season and cleopatra potamonautes euthraulus caridina and rhagovelia in the wet season table 7 3 4 single species analysis twelve of the most important taxa contributing to the dissimilarity among the five river zones identified during simper analysis were amphipsyche afronurus melanoides caridina cleopatra elminae potamonautes ephemerythus neoperla caenis ceratogomphus and cheumatopsyche table 8 shows the analyses of variance for the most important taxa among the river zones the test showed a significant interaction between the seasons and river zones on the abundances of amphipsyche and melanoides the abundances of amphipsyche and elminae were both recorded to be high during dry season in the rejuvenated zone and melanoides was found to be abundant in the wet season in the mature river zone which could be due to the addition of the site at the mature river zone afronurus sp showed a significant difference in abundance between the two sampling seasons where the higher abundances were recorded in the wet season its distribution among the river zones did not vary significantly showing to be present in river zones fig 3 the remaining taxa cleopatra potamonautes ephemerythus neoperla caenis ceratogomphus and cheumatopsyche showed significantly different abundances among the river zones potamonautes ephemerythus and cheumatopsyche were found to be abundant in the mountain streams zone neoperla dominated the upper foothill zone while caenis and ceratogomphus were abundant in the lower foothill zone fig 3 3 5 macroinvertebrate distribution in relation to eco hydrological variables correlation of biota and physical variables revealed combinations of variables considered to influence the macroinvertebrate assemblages among the five river zones table 9 a combination of three environmental variables temperature conductivity and substrate rho 0 51 provided the best match to the macroinvertebrates patterns the best variable combinations in describing the macroinvertebrate assemblages in bioenv analysis were subjected to distance linear models distlm the results of the distance based redundancy analysis db rda showed velocity was not significantly important in influencing the distribution of macroinvertebrate assemblages table 10 it is evident from fig 4 that the mountain stream ms and upper foothill uf sites were almost all clustered in a position featured by low conductivity the lower foothill lf and rejuvenated foothill rej sites were clustered in a position indicating high ph discharge and temperature while a few sites in the mature river zone mr featured the position high conductivity the results of distlm showed a relationship between macroinvertebrate distribution and eco hydrological variables conductivity tended to have a positive effect on the abundance of caridina and melanoides substrate type were found to influence potamonautes ephemerythus and cheumatopsyche temperature and discharge were found to have the same influence toward the macroinvertebrate community while ph was shown to positively influence the distribution of cleopatra fig 4 4 discussion 4 1 eco hydrological variables conductivity showed a spatial trend of increasing along the river whereby it was observed to have highest values in the lower reaches in both sampling seasons this could be associated with the impact from the ocean tides since the sampling stations at zone mr and rej were located close to the ocean approximately 20km furthermore the presence of the dam upstream of the stations magnifies the impacts from the ocean by lowering the freshwater discharges hence increasing the estuarine conduction toward upstream which is characterized by high electrical conductivity the fact that the upper reaches that is ms and uf showed low temperatures compared to the lower reaches was due to good riparian vegetation cover at those stations vegetation cover limits solar radiation reaching the water thus contributing to minimal fluctuations of temperature giller and malmqvist 1998 4 2 spatial and temporal variation of macroinvertebrates the macroinvertebrate assemblages varied significantly along the zigi river the five river zones proving to be significantly different from each other in terms of number of taxa total abundance species richness and species diversity indices however the sampling season temporal variation was not found to be significant this could be due to a lack of or less variation in hydrological hydraulic and environmental variables measured in relation to macroinvertebrate assemblages conductivity substrate type discharge temperature and ph were found to be important factors influencing their distribution the mature river zone is exposed to a harsh environment therefore it provide to have the lowest values in terms of diversity indices the sites representing this zone are within 10km from the indian ocean and the presence of the dam upstream further prohibits the normal flow of river water this results in a complete change of water constituents becoming rich in chloride this has led to the exclusion of many taxa sensitive to this change therefore the zone has become colonized by few taxa for example thiaridae melanoides tuberculatus was the most abundant taxa in this zone the lower mature zone mr can be compared to intertidal and estuarine areas which are subjected to strong variations in physical and biological condition related to tidal cycles as a result only few species are able to survive in such conditions salgado et al 2007 arimoro et al 2011 the taxa of invertebrates able to survive and more tolerant were gastropoda m tuberculatus cleopatra and crustaceans caridina which were also observed in our study for example m tuberculatus was reported in the study of giovanelli et al 2005 as being a good invader due to its ability to adapt a wide range of environmental conditions and high reproductive rate the decreasing of the diversity indices downstream is highly linked to an increase in human population and pressure such as sand mining bathing washing clothes sand mining is a more destructive activity as it tends to ruin the habitat and change of flow regime by the creation of pools it also increases the residence time of water in these areas as pools will result to longer time expose of water to solar radiation and thus allow for more warming hawkins et al 1997 which in turn negatively affects the metabolic and life cycle of many species of macroinvertebrates apart from sand mining bathing and washing clothes alter the water quality due to addition of nutrients phosphates and nitrogen from detergents and as a result the most sensitive taxa such as plecoptera neoperla sp and ephemeroptera baetidae disappear the ms and uf zones of the zigi river where dominated by taxa associated with least impacted waters characterized by less anthropogenic activities more sensitive groups of macroinvertebrates such as baetidae some species and neoperla the abundances of which showed a decline downstream areas represented by lf caenis dominated in the middle section and amphypsyche hydropsychidae in the rejuvenated area while in the more downstream end mr single species abundance was observed in which cardina and melonoides accounted for more than 50 of the total population ms and uf were observed to have higher diversity richness abundance and number of taxa compared to the lowland zones lf rej mr the higher diversity indices in the ms and uf zones were expected because of the difference in habitat the stones type of habitat a general term we use to represent substrata of bedrock boulders cobblers and gravels the dominant habitat observed in upland zones contributed to the higher diversity indices in these zones on the contrary the sand substrate dominating the lower land areas lf and mr comprised few species of macroinvertebrates due to its instability sand is considered a poor habitat supporting fewer macroinvertebrates also tight packing of sand grains reduces the trapping of detritus and can further limit the availability of oxygen which is crucial to organisms the rej zones were dominated by the bedrock habitat which is part of the stones type of habitat but for which low abundances were observed compared to ms zones it has been described minshall et al 1985 bonada et al 2006 that abundance and taxa richness typically increase with substrate size at least up to gravels and cobbles which have been found to hold maximum abundance and taxa richness beyond that bedrock boulders the richness and diversity of macroinvertebrates decreases due to increased turbulence which can sometimes create falls especially during high flow and create pools during low flow seasons dry seasons the temporal variation of macroinvertebrate assemblages was found to be small which could also be linked to the variation in environmental and hydrological factors between the two samplings which showed a small range of change however the two samplings were very different based on taxa composition and individual abundances of macroinvertebrates the change of pattern may reflect habitat preference life history characteristics and changes of abiotic factors for example temperature discharge conductivity or flow velocity afronurus showed a significant difference in mean abundance between the dry and wet seasons but not significantly among the river zone yanoviak and mccafferty 1996 reported that the variation in the taxonomic makeup of macroinvertebrate assemblages may be due to the differences in insect life cycles while the seasonal variation in abundances and distribution often reflect the life history in our study higher abundances of afronurus were recorded during the wet season it is possible that by the time that the dry sampling was conducted the emergence had just taken place and individuals of the next generation were too small to be caught in the 1mm net similarly the studies of king 1981 and dallas 2004b have described the seasonal variation of afronurus to be related to their small sizes thus not being caught during their emergence 4 3 influence of eco hydrological variables in this study discharge and temperature showed similar influence on macroinvertebrate community structure the variation in temperature occurs longitudinally down a river system with headwaters typically cooler than lowland areas vannote et al 1980 a similar gradient was observed for the zigi river canopy cover which affects water temperature graynorth 1979 was also found to be an important factor contributing to the variations of temperatures along the zigi river discharge was also found to vary among the river zones and between times variation in discharge can lead to differences in wetted perimeter hydraulic conditions and biotope availability chessman 1995 discharge has been reported to affect the community of macroinvertebrates by lowering their abundances masese et al 2010 discharge can also have a cascade impact by affecting water temperature dallas 2004b and thus oxygen solubility seasons of low discharge are usually associated with higher temperatures and vice versa this scenario is important in explaining the spatial and temporal variation of macroinvertebrate assemblages conductivity was observed to be an important variable determining the distribution of macroinvertebrate in the zigi river the ms and uf zones featured water of low conductivity and as a result were found to contain different invertebrate communities compared to the zones in the lower reaches were conductivity was seen to increase the distribution of thiaridae melanoides and atyidae caridina were positively correlated to conductivity the type of substratum i e boulders cobbles gravels sand bedrock was identified as an important predictor of the observed macroinvertebrate assemblages distribution the river substrate changes from the upland to lowland reaches the mountain stream zone of the zigi river were dominated by boulders and some bedrock substrate the upper foothill zone substrate was composed of cobbles and gravels the lower foothill and mature river zones had sandy substrates and the rejuvenated foothill zone substrate was composed of bedrock with cascades these different types of substrates where the result of different gradient which in turn determine the habitat quality and kinds of favorable species most aquatic macroinvertebrate have specific substrate requirements and are therefore influenced by the nature and quality of the habitat available at a site for example the presence of mud or silt in a stones biotope may reduce the quality of the habitat for stone dwelling organisms dallas 2004a 2007 depth velocity and froude number have been mentioned in several studies e g kemp et al

1164,east african wetlands are naturally dominated by papyrus the world s fastest growing herbaceous plant reaching up to 5m in height and 3kgm 2 of standing biomass per year while its provisioning services are well known papyrus plays a less evident role in supporting tropical swamp ecosystems by controlling nutrient balances as well as hydrological flows and through the provision of critical biotopes vital for the reproduction of insects fishes and birds including a small number of endemic species claims are made condemning papyrus for enhancing water loss yet only few proper evapotranspiration studies have been carried out conflicting evidence indicates that papyrus swamps could be important in regulating local climate through evapotranspiration and hold significant potential in climate mitigation through carbon sequestration and carbon storage as peat these benefits may become soon severely eroded because papyrus swamps are degrading rapidly due to direct exploitation to agricultural encroachment and to extensive trampling and feeding by cattle we review papyrus ecosystem services with a focus on its role on biodiversity enhancement and regulating functions we present new evidence showing an inverse temperature gradient within papyrus swamps indicative of an optimised water retention capacity with examples from lake naivasha and lake victoria better understanding of papyrus regulating services should underpin papyrus restoration as an ecohydrological tool to improve water quality to moderate local climate by regulating the water cycle to

evapotranspiration climate change 1 introduction the concept of ecohydrology stressing the inter relationship that exists between macrophytes and aquatic ecosystem health harper et al 2016 originates from the scientific recognition of the dominant impact that vegetation can have on the physico chemical conditions of lakes and streams riparian macrophytes play a key role in the control of wetland ecosystem processes by acting as chemical filters as well as hydrological and climatic buffers wetland managers can strengthen environmental health and progress towards conservation targets by maintaining or re establishing submerged and or riparian macrophyte beds stands the effective functioning of stands of macrophytes particularly emergent macrophytes at the land water interface thus becomes an important tool for ecohydrological management the most widespread emergent macrophyte in africa is the giant sedge cyperus papyrus l cyperaceae the largest of the 400 tropical sedge species within the genus which represents perhaps the best known example of long standing human use of a riparian resource since the early holocene human populations living along the lower nile have harvested papyrus and used it for multiple needs including building materials baskets as well as canoes and sailing boats used for transporting light cargo and during religious events gaudet 2014 it is estimated that by 3000 b c egyptians had invented paper using papyrus thus it became widely known across the mediterranean the original name of the plant derived from an ancient egyptian term meaning royal papyrus then gave origin to the word paper as well as to bible which derives from the ancient greek biblon book a term which originally referred to the bundle of fine papyrus strips that were assembled together to compose a single paper sheet phoenicians greeks and later arabs traded papyrus and attempted to grow it abroad in ancient times papyrus swamps used to be grown in mesopotamia and

century täckholm and drar 1950 it has recently been re recorded in the nile delta but with low occurrence el ghani et al 2011 in east africa papyrus swamps probably do not exceed 40 000km2 an average figure estimated in the early 1990s hughes and hughes 1992 this surface is believed to undergo frequent inter annual variations because of the water level changes that are common in afrotropical swamps throughout east africa now papyrus wetlands are polluted by wastes from industry agriculture and households owino and ryan 2007 kansiime et al 2007 munabi et al 2009 more than 70 of the upper nile and congo wetlands have been lost during the last two decades of the twentieth century maclean 2004 papyrus swamps on lake victoria have been extensively destroyed by overharvesting osumba et al 2010 and references therein and often replaced by subsistence crops such as cocoyam colocasia esculenta kansiime et al 2005a sugarcane and or rice or even common vegetables tomatoes cabbages carrots potatoes maclean et al 2011 when swamps have been drained for large scale agricultural exploitation papyrus has specifically been targeted maclean et al 2014 papyrus swamps are drained 4 times more often than wetland ecosystems in general and this is leading to a severe restriction of available habitat for papyrus endemic birds mafabi 2000 maclean et al 2014 deliberate swamp drainage as well as natural water level fluctuations can turn papyrus swamps into significant carbon sources through peat decomposition jones and humphries 2002 their conversion to agricultural land reduces valuable ecosystem services kansiime et al 2007 with a severe economic loss for local communities maclean et al 2011 van dam et al 2014 damming and channelisation also increase malaria incidence by raising water temperature and by increasing the occurrence of biotopes that shelter mosquitoes conversely papyrus establishment shades out mosquito breeding sites and reduces their suitability to develop dense mosquito colonies mekonnen et al 2005 lindblade et al 2000 goma 1960 the value of papyrus in providing ecosystem services to the human populations surrounding swamps has been highlighted by several authors in attempts to prevent them from destruction and we review these studies concisely here this sets the scene for addressing regulating services of prime ecohydrological relevance that we argue are the most important yet poorly studied and poorly understood we summarise and discuss the existing evidence for processes indicating that papyrus can be vital in moderating local climate and in preventing desiccation through its contribution to the water cycle this evidence also includes limited measurements carried out by us of temperature gradients within papyrus swamps we thus argue that papyrus protection and enhancement should be pursued as an important management tool in afrotropical wetlands particularly in the face of the recent and greater hydrological uncertainties brought about by climate change 2 ecosystem services 2 1 provisioning services several authors reviewed the ecosystem services provided by papyrus swamps most of them have highlighted direct human uses and the high value of provisioning services maclean et al 2011 terer et al 2012a 2012b morrison et al 2012 including water food materials for building crafts and fuel medicinal herbs among others bacon 1997 van dam et al 2011 maclean et al 2011 riparian sedges and grasses are used for weaving baskets thatching roofs assembling fish traps and building canoes as in ancient egypt for more than 5000 years until 2000 years ago these activities still occur on lake tana in ethiopia gaudet 2014 riparian macrophytes are important forage resources especially at times of drought papyrus wetlands have been regularly used to feed cattle muthuri and kinyamario 1989 because of its rapid growth the wise use of papyrus fibre can be a source of valuable sustainable resources for direct use balanced by natural regrowth this explains the high value attributed to its provisioning services it has been estimated that average aerial dry weight biomass regeneration can reach 6 28kgm 2 y 1 similar to a sugarcane crop muthuri et al 1989 more recently estimated production rates derived from different swamps ranged widely between 0 09 and 14 3kgm 2 year 1 osumba et al 2010 this suggests that with responsible husbandry in some swamps papyrus could be more widely exploited in a multipurpose wise use fashion that would take advantage of its water treatment capacity as well as its sustainably renewable standing biomass as a source of fuel and fibre perbangkhem and polprasert 2010 a sustainable annual harvest of up to 15tha 1 yr 1 was suggested by jones 1982 1983 it takes only 6 months for germinating papyrus to reach maturity van dam et al 2011 and a harvesting rate between 9 and 12 months was recommended to maintain high standing biomass van dam et al 2007 no further increment in biomass was detected beyond 14 months growth thenya 2006 maclean et al 2003a show that the net present value of harvested papyrus and fish derived from swamps greatly exceeds the value of the crops grown following swamp drainage 2 2 cultural services society tends to typically overestimate the value of provisioning ecosystem services because they are represented by marketable goods and therefore there are market substitutes that can be readily compared with them this is usually impossible with regulating services whose values are thus overlooked and or underscored similarly cultural services tend to be overestimated because they are readily measurable in particular using indicators such as number of visitors to fish landing beaches or number of nights spent in local hotels as well as average distance travelled to reach tourist destination a common method used to evaluate the service value of protected areas in the case of papyrus it is difficult to separate the cultural service value of papyrus alone from the value attributed by tourists to tropical wetlands in general not all agree that papyrus increases amenity for instance recently revamped building enterprise activities around lake naivasha advertising villas with a lake view provided one further means of estimating cultural value by hedonic pricing however in some cases this worked out as a paradox while wetland views enhance the value of private property at lake naivasha according to a preliminary survey we conducted in 2013 the presence of papyrus is considered negative by some hoteliers because it blocks the view of open water aspects of cultural value linked to indigenous knowledge and traditions are evident from reports made by several observers see below but harder to evaluate socio cultural uses of papyrus swamps developed among most populations living along the nile gaudet 2014 van dam et al 2014 the present day values of papyrus are deeply embedded in the cultural identity of indigenous tribes thriving along the shores of lake victoria maclean et al 2011 morrison 2013 and this is the case also with less extensive swamps papyrus is an important component of traditional rituals and dances during cleansing and blessing ceremonies such as with the endoroi tribe living around loboi swamp on the shores of lake bogoria kenya as described by terer et al 2012a who also cite analogous ritual practices being carried out in gabon burkill 1985 cited in terer et al 2012a the endoroi name given to papyrus translates into crown of majesty terer et al 2012a which incidentally recalls the original meaning of the name given to papyrus by ancient egyptians 2 3 regulating services 2 3 1 biodiversity papyrus swamps are dense macrophyte stands with little space left for accessory species other than on the margin few organisms have developed adaptations to dwell within papyrus swamps as papyrus grows in monospecific assemblages that exclude other emergent vegetation at the same time however the hydrological and chemical buffering see below offered by papyrus dominated wetlands favours the persistence of a diverse community of submerged macrophytes in nearby aquatic ecosystems harper et al 1995 because of its high specificity and of the ecological conditions it supports papyrus contributes significantly to mesoscale or regional biodiversity a large number of fish amphibian reptile mammal and bird species live in afrotropical wetlands the sitatunga or marshbuck tragelaphus spekei can be considered endemic to papyrus swamps papyrus provides breeding grounds for fish mnaya and wolanski 2002 and refuge from predators endemic lake victoria cichlids find refuge from nile perch chapman et al 2002 hickley et al 2004 few species of birds can be said to be endemic to papyrus dominated biotopes passerines from the upper nile such as the near threatened papyrus gonolek laniarius mufumbiri fig 1 the greater swamp warbler acrocephalus rufescens and the white winged scrub warbler bradypterus carpalis are entirely confined to papyrus swamps maclean et al 2014 donaldson et al 2016 also the papyrus canary serinus koliensis breeds within papyrus bennun and njoroge 1999 but it sometimes forages in adjacent crops vandeweghe 1981 similarly to the black crake amaurornis flavirostra t mwinami pers obs while the vulnerable papyrus yellow warbler chloropeta gracilirostris and carruthers s cisticola cisticola carruthersi are principally confined to papyrus bennun and njoroge 1999 donaldson et al 2016 but also occupy mixed emergent macrophyte wetlands particularly at high altitude maclean et al 2014 several other species feed within papyrus on insect and aquatic macroinvertebrates and utilise other aquatic macrophytes for roosting and breeding the pied kingfisher ceryle rudis the cattle egret bubulcus ibis the marsh harrier the reed cormorant phalacrocorax africanus and the great cormorant phalacrocorax carbo the malachite kingfisher alcedo cristata the african pygmy kingfisher ceyx pictus the giant kingfisher megaceryle maxima and the squacco heron ardeola ralloides on the shore of lakes victoria and baringo papyrus hosts nesting colonies of lesser masked weaver ploceus intermedius northern masked weaver ploceus taeniopterus and golden weaver ploceus superciliosus along the tana river in kenya the only known nesting site of clarks weaver ploceus golandi is on a papyrus vandeweghe 1981 most papyrus related species manifested significant declines throughout east africa between the periods 1984 1987 and 1999 2001 maclean et al 2014 very little appears to be known about the terrestrial insects associated with papyrus a preliminary survey of the coleoptera and hemiptera associated with the flowering heads of papyrus at lake naivasha on the landward side of papyrus swamps found 26 species a cook a drane personal communication the community of insects varied according to the age of the papyrus flowering heads changing in composition between flower buds and senescent flowers how many of the species recorded are closely tied to papyrus is unknown although one of the dominant species ischnodemus grossus slater fig 2 is likely to be specific because of its wing polymorphism the majority of the population found have reduced non functional wings brachypters while few were fully winged macropters studies of other bugs e g denno et al 2001 have shown that the proportion of winged to non winged morphs elsewhere varies according to the stability and continuity of the habitat at naivasha i grossus life cycle is closely linked to umbel development and it occurs only during the early stages of umbel growth other groups of insects present particularly lepidoptera diptera hymenoptera and dermaptera and numerous collembola and arachnida indicate that the community of papyrus flowering heads is very diverse and a description of all invertebrates present would be a major undertaking 2 3 2 carbon sequestration papyrus represents a significant carbon sink because of its rapid growth jones and muthuri 1997 with rates of the order of 10tcha 1 year 1 saunders et al 2012 c4 photosynthesis allows it to perform high rates of c assimilation under intense radiation and high temperature low photorespiration and lack of inhibition even under conditions of high vapour pressure deficit an ability that cannot be matched by c3 plants saunders et al 2012 its competitive superiority is supported by the chlorophyll content of papyrus umbels which is about 25 higher than equivalent photosynthetic tissue of emergent c3 macrophytes jones and muthuri 1985 the energy capturing efficiency of papyrus the proportion of solar energy that can be converted into biomass is high estimated to reach between 4 4 and 6 0 in artificial papyrus wetlands developed for water treatment in tropical thailand perbangkhem and polprasert 2010 the actual productivity of single papyrus wetlands is likely to be site specific and related to local temperature thompson et al 1979 light intensity jones 1987 nutrient status jones and muthuri 1985 hydrological regime saunders et al 2007 altitude jones 1983 and seasonality jones and muthuri 1985 biomass accumulation is thought to increase at higher altitudes such as at lake naivasha 1890m a s l wanjala et al 2018 because lower night time temperatures reduce losses of carbon through respiration jones 1983 papyrus growth at a single location is likely to change over time with the intensification of human impact affecting nutrient influx into the swamp at lake naivasha where papyrus grows under similar conditions all year round jones and muthuri 1985 carbon assimilation was estimated to reach 2 51kgcm 2 yr 1 in the early 1980s muthuri et al 1989 however recent estimates obtained with an alternative method are significantly higher morrison 2013 this is likely to be explained by the on going eutrophication of lake naivasha next to high productivity rates slow decomposition and long term storage of degrading detritus within the swamp jones and muthuri 1997 also contribute to high c accumulation papyrus wetlands generate the largest portion of anaerobic tropical peat present on the african continent representing a significant carbon store above ground papyrus biomass is high for a herbaceous plant greatest among all sedges yet far greater is the below ground debris compartment which can attain 20 times the above ground biomass jones and muthuri 1997 work on east african wetlands has revealed that typically when the detrital c present in a 1m deep peat layer is added to the living biomass that on average constitutes papyrus swamps this can represent up to 728tcha 1 this estimate exceeds standing and detrital c present in tropical forests saunders et al 2014 considering that papyrus swamps can accumulate peat for an average depth of 5 75m for the whole of east africa this could represent up to 11 36gt c saunders et al 2014 a large portion of this carbon could end up being released to the atmosphere upon conversion of tropical swamps into drained farmland as well as during swamp drawdown that is common at lake naivasha jones and humphries 2002 characterised by a particularly unstable hydrology a synthesis of more than 20 studies concluded that the sum of aboveground and belowground living biomass may reach up to 88tcha 1 which is comparable to the standing biomass of natural forests saunders et al 2014 2 3 3 nutrient regulation the ecohydrology concept of mutual regulation harper et al 2016 explains how nutrient availability in swamps is determined by the presence of emergent macrophytes themselves papyrus is able to dominate the riparian fringe of tropical swamps where continuous growth conditions naturally lead to intense biotic interactions and steep competition papyrus can have very high c n p ratio in naivasha 565 8 1 boar 2006 in comparison to temperate wetland plants a characteristic that provides an indication of its high nutrient efficiency its high rates of n assimilation jones 1987 and its high efficiency in nutrient utilisation boar 2006 enable papyrus to outcompete most other emergent macrophytes most of which carry out c3 photosynthesis papyrus swamps trap sediments and pollutants entering water bodies from the surrounding catchment boar et al 1999 azza et al 2000 boar and harper 2002 kipkemboi et al 2002 serag 2003 kelderman et al 2007 however their buffering efficiency is likely to be highly dependent on the width and continuity of the riparian vegetation boar 2006 phosphorus is adsorbed onto slowly decaying particulate organic matter and becomes part of the peat its storage is temporary because peat slowly decays and p will eventually be released as soon as local biogeochemical conditions reduction of fe and mn hydroxides redox change will allow the swamp does not function as a p barrier but rather as a p buffer gaudet 1976 by intercepting and temporarily fixing any sudden increase in p availability that may be caused by sudden discharge pulses long term storage of phosphorus may take place in papyrus wetlands by incorporation into buried organic sediments howard williams and gaudet 1985 nitrogen is a constituent of the chlorophyll molecule and plant growth in tropical swamps which are not limited by low temperatures is highly dependent upon its availability nitrogen concentrations within papyrus swamps are relatively low and constant first of all because allochthonous forms of n are readily taken up by the papyrus rhizome and shoots secondly because in pristine swamps the total amount of n forms present is regulated by the highly effective atmospheric nitrogen fixation mwaura 1981 mwaura and widdowson 1992 at naivasha during the 1970s it was estimated that n2 fixation performed by bacteria symbiotic to the swamp root system was greater than n imports delivered by the lake tributaries gaudet 1977 nitrogen fixing rates are self regulated because the responsible enzyme nitrogenase becomes significantly suppressed as soon as dissolved nitrogen concentrations start increasing vymazal 1995 throughout africa the balance between nitrogen fixation and external loading may be progressively changing as agricultural effluents increase along with population growth and more intensive farming in swamps receiving large loads of residential effluents such as in parts of lake victoria nitrogen buffering occurs because the papyrus root system can provide ideal conditions for bacterial denitrification and for dead biomass accumulation kansiime et al 2007 kanyiginya et al 2010 these systems may eventually release significant quantities of reduced greenhouse gases such as methane and n2o2 saunders et al 2014 especially when swamps are fed with nitrogen rich wastewater and exhibit high amounts of nitrifying bacteria kyambadde et al 2004 according to a recently proposed model hes et al 2014 the highest nitrogen retention occurs within the outer submerged portion of the swamp which first receives the external effluents while in the permanently flooded portion of the swamp papyrus growth is relatively limited by low ambient nitrate concentrations in nutrient rich systems n accumulation in papyrus biomass can be high chale 1987 ammonia release is considered of little relevance in papyrus swamps because of their tendency to create relatively acidic conditions hes et al 2014 2 3 4 hydrological buffering papyrus buffers the landscape against sudden flood surges due to the high potential infiltration of swamp soils dixon and wood 2003 and because of the physical barrier to flow represented by papyrus culms kansiime et al 2005b thereafter moisture can be released both as underground and as an atmospheric flux acting as a moderator of seasonal moisture deficits during drought moisture is slowly released from the sponge of water saturated swamp soils embedded in a network of roots and decaying vegetation sheltered from direct sunshine and from air movement by the dense array of papyrus culms the canopy structure is able to create a nearly continuous cover intercepting as much as 90 of the incident radiation jones and muthuri 1985 rapid growth and high seed production make papyrus highly adapted to withstand the periodical drawdown cycles that are typical of the monsoon driven east african climate terer et al 2014 the extent of hydrological and sediment load buffering through enhanced evapotranspiration infiltration and sediment deposition provided by papyrus swamps has been illustrated by ryken et al 2015 in their study on a small ugandan subcatchment draining into lake victoria 2 3 5 water cycle and climate regulation an insufficiently documented but potentially very relevant service provided by wetlands is their role in regulating air temperature hence climate through evapotranspiration et demonstrated by the difference between the dispersal of incoming solar radiation by wetlands compared to dry biomass poor ecosystems huryna et al 2014 evaporation is the result of the impact of solar energy upon water molecules phase change between liquid and water vapour is linked to the consumption of a large amount of energy needed to break the hydrogen bonds formed between single h2o molecules in liquid water because evaporation is an endothermic reaction the body which loses water tends to decrease its temperature the balance between water vapour and sensible heat implies that ambient temperature will be moderated by the release of water vapour through evaporation until water is present in the landscape it can be estimated that the decrease in potential evaporation resulting from swamp drainage can cause a release of the order of 250wm 2 of heat equivalent to a release of 100mgs 1 of water vapour the drainage of a 1km2 surface can thus release 250mw of assimilated solar energy back to the atmosphere as warm air sensible heat sensible heat fluxes produce changes to local air movements local temperature and precipitation it is commonly believed that emergent macrophytes are characterised by extremely high transpiration rates resulting in a far greater water vapour loss than would occur from an open water surface in reality within most wetlands a stable radiation sheltered and a relatively cool vapour saturated environment develops evapotranspiration condensation processes are responsible for the re distribution of the incoming solar energy and are mainly driven by vegetation plants control the daily temperature changes at local scale and contribute to the definition of local climate huryna et al 2014 wetland ecosystems are particularly effective in this respect in wetlands thanks to the permanent availability of water latent heat tends to prevail all year round the conversion of solar energy into evapotranspiration may consume about 60 80 of the net incoming radiation sensible heat then may account for only about 20 30 while the ground heat flux amounts to approx 10 20 kedziora 2011 the latent heat flux generated by water vapour release consumes energy during the phase transition process during the day flows of energy take place along gradients caused by differences in water vapour and temperature between the land surface and the atmosphere at night a downward latent heat flux occurs as condensation at the edge of cool surfaces and with the formation of dew evapotranspiration is thus a powerful temperature control process having a double air conditioning effect upon the landscape over a 24h period a evaporation cools surfaces consuming solar energy by transforming liquid water into water vapour b condensation of water vapour warms the air releasing the energy of latent heat when dew point is achieved evapotranspiration can thus be considered as a process of temperature equalisation and reduction of physical gradients controlled by natural wetland vegetation pokorný et al 2016a b water vapour release occurs through the stomata of higher plants and is therefore modulated by the physiological requirements temperature humidity hydrostatic pressure of the vegetation plants can exert a relative control over water loss and ambient temperature by controlling gas exchange through the stomata estimating evapotranspiration in wetlands is a difficult science requiring sophisticated equipment therefore studies are few field measurements can often be muddled by local effects evapotranspiration is influenced by atmospheric pressure above the swamp and wind exposure can be a factor that can induce localised vapour pressure deficit wetzel 1983 which in turn induces higher evapotranspiration several artefacts can thus impact on field measurements high water vapour fluxes measured above swamps are likely to be influenced by advected hot and dry air fluxes generated from overheated bare surface areas that surround the swamps themselves and that are naturally attracted by the cooler swamp environment these hot fluxes are capable of charging up with a lot of moisture the potential moisture content of air increases steeply with temperature creating strong ascending air currents that transfer large amounts of water from the swamp towards the atmosphere this could partly explain why there is limited evidence indicating that papyrus swamps are able to exert a significant control over local state conditions temperature humidity and actually prevent the water loss that would be realised by simple evaporation from an equivalent open water surface in general c4 species tend to have lower rates of transpiration than c3 species because they avoid photorespiration and tend therefore to have higher water use efficiency hasegawa 1977 o toole and tomar 1982 long 1999 because of culm height and high standing biomass papyrus swamps are better adapted at creating a low evapotranspiration microclimate than most other swamps jones and muthuri 1985 strong resistance by papyrus to vapour pressure deficit enhances this advantage the incoming energy is transformed into a balanced proportion of sensible and latent heat and the swamp acts as an air conditioning device near permanent temperature and moisture conditions tend to reduce rising air currents that generally cause progressive landscape desiccation from overheated dryland surfaces such as in the dry savannah in some papyrus wetlands evapotranspiration 1500 1600mmyear 1 was lower than evaporation from open water butcher 1938 jones and humphries 2002 mohamed et al 2004 ecohydrological research carried out at lake naivasha in the early 1980s jones and muthuri 1984 demonstrated that stomatal conductance rate of gas exchange through plant stomata which bears a high impact on evapotranspiration in papyrus tended to decrease during midday while vapour pressure deficit was increasing and this despite freely available water i e the stomata release little vapour despite a high air to leaf water vapour gradient it was postulated that this remarkable stomatal regulation capacity served the purpose of reducing uptake of oxygen deficient water rich in toxic reduced iron this same reason would explain the xeromorphic shape of papyrus umbels and bracteoles jones and muthuri 1984 in any case papyrus stomata seem to have a remarkable control over water loss from swamps some years later still at lake naivasha jones and humphries 2002 measured evaporative losses from the main lake to be approximately 64 higher than losses due to evapotranspiration from the papyrus canopy 6 6 and 2 4kgh2om 2 d 1 respectively conversely at the kirinya wetland in uganda papyrus evapotranspiration was estimated by saunders et al 2007 to be on average 25 higher than evaporation from open water floating vegetation such as mature water hyacinth beds is known however to evaporate more than open water e g idso and anderson 1988 data sets seem inadequate for understanding the precise role of papyrus an analysis of papyrus swamp microclimate box 1 raises interesting new questions in fig 3 the bare soil 70 c is almost completely dry most of the solar energy is directly converted into sensible heat as no more latent heat can be produced in the absence of moisture the nearby sisal thrives at 41 c with a modulated water release to maintain its temperature within acceptable physiological range in fig 4 a light but consistent temperature gradient was detected within a dense papyrus swamp on the shore of lake victoria the infrared image illustrates that temperature is lowest at the foot of the swamp and increases by 1 3 c towards the swamp apex while the temperature of open water is greater this stratification indicates that a cushion of cool moist air tends to form at the foot of the papyrus swamp and remains trapped being denser and heavier than the warmer air above such stagnant cool air is likely to act by preventing ascending air currents and by reducing the release of vapour from the swamp base towards the atmosphere similar conditions are found in the acacia xanthophloea woodland upper portion of the riparian zone at lake naivasha fig 5 here low temperatures are maintained within the woodland compared to far higher temperatures outside only few metres further bare soil bakes at 60 c the heating of air above the soil surface and the lack of cover contribute to the creation of steadily rising streams of hot air that progressively extract all available humidity from the soil and desiccate the landscape the inverted vertical temperature gradient within the acacia woodland fig 6 as in the lake victoria papyrus swamp allows the development of stagnant cool air just above the soil within such woodlands the conversion of solar energy into latent heat prevents the warming of soil water and air while the soil is protected from desiccation by the inverse temperature gradient the large scale effects of progressive wetland drainage remain poorly investigated besides moderating evaporation from open water and ambient temperature papyrus swamps could be playing a significant role in supporting the small water cycle kravčík et al 2007 of evaporation precipitation relatively independent from the long distance monsoonal precipitation cycle that characterises tropical ecosystems savenije 1995a b pointed out that papyrus swamps are likely to play a highly significant role in moisture recycling and therefore may influence local climatic conditions in nearby ecosystems extending their influence over vast areas mohamed and savenije 2014 showed that the sudd swamps hydrologically dependent onto lake victoria water levels have a determining impact on regional moisture availability cloud formation and radiation intensity a model describing how forest vegetation impacts local climate has been proposed by makarieva et al 2013 further supported through measurements on a small scale by pokorný et al 2016a b and recently set in a broader context ellison et al 2017 this research could provide new perspectives for interpreting the link between papyrus swamps and the water cycle within the swamp water evaporates only from the top of papyrus culms evapotranspiration is controlled by the vegetation evaporation from open water or soil is just a physical process dependent on state conditions during the night filamentous threadlike papyrus stalks insulated from the ground tend to lose temperature rapidly against the cool sky until they serve as surfaces for water vapour condensation air pressure drops due to condensation and the surrounding air distributed horizontally within the lower atmosphere becomes attracted towards the condensation low pressure zone it is sucked in in this way papyrus swamps could act as acceptor zones sensu makarieva et al 2013 for catalysing rain events with swamp drainage vapour is carried up by rising air currents generated by soil overheating and moisture cannot revert at night due to the lack of a cool rainfall acceptor swamp drainage breaks the small water cycle according to this scenario the conversion of papyrus into arable land results in a dramatic increase of surface temperature and into progressive desiccation this process can be assessed by superimposing surface temperature changes detected by remote sensing and changes in land cover the mau forest which borders the western edge of the lake naivasha catchment was known as the largest single forest block in east africa until it shrank by 1800km2 starting from the 1980s hesslerová and pokorný 2010 the mau deforestation caused a massive reduction in evapotranspiration implying that as much as 2 6billionkwhday 1 that used to leave the region as latent heat eventually became converted into sensible heat causing a significant rise in ambient temperature detected through infrared satellite imagery hesslerová and pokorný 2010 by inference this reduced local rainfall as experienced by long term residents s higgins personal communication 2 3 6 the current status of papyrus ecosystem services at lake naivasha the areal extent of papyrus wetlands at lake naivasha kenya declined from approx 48km2 to approx 14km2 during the period 1960 1995 boar et al 1999 and continued to do so thereafter as a consequence of both natural and anthropogenic causes morrison and harper 2009 onywere et al 2012 estimated that papyrus occupied 17 7km2 throughout the entire lake naivasha catchment in 2006 from satellite imagery but since then drivers of wetland loss have remained largely unmitigated harper et al 2011 up to three decades ago papyrus used to grow in a virtually continuous riparian belt with a large floating swamp which developed at the mouth of the main tributary the malewa river the surface covered by c papyrus and by floating alien vegetation water hyacinth and salvinia between 1989 and 2013 showed a general decline with falling water levels as both become stranded on dry land and desiccated or destroyed fig 7 the lowest surface cover was recorded in 2008 after water levels had declined continuously during the previous 4 years both c papyrus and the floating aliens tended to increase in 2013 when water level rose and new land was flooded recent observations suggest that natural drawdown is exacerbated by anthropogenic water abstractions which increase steeply during the dry seasons as in 2009 and in 2017 on the other hand during reflooding of the lake shore disturbance by cattle and by wild herbivores morrison and harper 2009 pers obs prevents the regrowth of the young papyrus because grazing takes place at a critical time for the re establishment of the new riparian papyrus fringe morrison 2013 lake naivasha s papyrus swamp today occupies less than 10 of its 1970s surface described in detail by gaudet 1977 because of trampling and foraging by cattle as well as by wildlife encroachment by local farmers and elimination on the orders of hotel managers who try to preserve an open lake view for their customers on an interannual scale natural regeneration is enhanced by water level increases fig 7 however it deteriorates when human disturbance and drought periods occur in conjunction which encourages cattle and wildlife encroachment into the riparian zone an estimate based upon the size of naivasha s wetland suggests a theoretical potential to meet 40 of the annual cooking fuel requirements of the 650 000 basin residents using briquettes made of carbonised papyrus morrison et al 2013 the mean calorific value of papyrus briquettes 20mjkg 1 was similar to firewood 18mjkg 1 but lower than charcoal 32mjkg 1 in theory papyrus briquettes could be sustainable due to the rapid regeneration of the papyrus swamp however the moderate calorific value coupled to the relatively high labour investment required for papyrus harvesting drying and carbonising makes briquettes non competitive in relation to charcoal available in village markets which is presently illegally produced by exploiting scarce local forest resources similarly papyrus has been proposed for paper and board manufacture but neither has proved economically viable jones and muthuri 1985 no papyrus endemic birds thrive at lake naivasha however the lake fringe is visited by numerous dryland ungulates it hosts semi aquatic mammals as well as more than 300 species of birds common inhabitants of healthy portions of papyrus include the great reed warbler acrocephalus arundinaceus lesser swamp warbler acrocephalus gracilirostris goliath heron ardea goliath and purple heron ardea purpurea t mwinami personal observation the survival of this fauna is closely dependent upon a pristine riparian zone whose surface is continuously declining because of the reduction of the nutrient buffer offered by the swamp and because of increasing farming and residential effluent discharges the lake has undergone progressive eutrophication accelerated by the impact of alien species notably the crayfish procambarus clarkii responsible for the permanent loss of submerged macrophytes decreasing water transparency increasing algal planktonic biomass and planktonic primary production hubble and harper 2002 dissolved nutrients occasionally measured over the last decade indicate rising eutrophy soluble reactive silicate decreased from an original value of 14 15 7mgl 1 measured in the early 1960s talling and talling 1965 down to 1 2mgl 1 in 2015 unpublished data this phenomenon has also been documented in lake victoria verschuren et al 1998 and if this trend continues it could limit diatom growth in the future to the advantage of potentially toxic cyanobacteria soluble reactive phosphorus srp concentrations on the other hand are still constantly low under the sustained high biological demand driven by emergent and floating macrophytes mainly papyrus and water hyacinth and by the planktonic flora dominated by diatoms but with occasional blooms of cyanobacteria most incoming p remains trapped in the shallow oxygenated and fe rich sediment harper et al 1993 such that open water concentrations typically exhibit undetectable levels of soluble reactive phosphate i e 3μgsrpl 1 unpublished data however following papyrus degradation shallow littoral zones have been colonised by dense mats of water hyacinth that slowly decay forming an organic substrate low in dissolved oxygen and prone to phosphate release concentrations of about 20μgsrpl 1 have been occasionally measured in the early mornings by sampling underneath the littoral hyacinth mat unpublished data kalff 1983 and muthuri and jones 1997 reported very low concentrations of available phosphorus and nitrogen at lake naivasha slightly higher levels were reported by hubble and harper 2002 still higher dissolved nitrogen concentrations were recorded during occasional monitoring conducted in 2015 ammonia 0 1 0 6mgl 1 nitrate 0 1 0 3mgl 1 the loss of the papyrus fringe caused an increase of nitrogen release towards the atmosphere ph above 9 a pre condition for nh3 release was occasionally measured during the central hours of the day in warm shallow littoral areas dominated by submerged mats of benthic filamentous algae causing intense photosynthetic rates high oxygen supersaturation and undetectable ammonia personal observation papyrus influence on the local climate at naivasha can be only inferred as no detailed investigation has been carried out to document changes in landscape temperature concomitant with the degradation of the papyrus swamp demonstrations of papyrus fringe restoration have been carried out at lake naivasha by artificially flooding a portion of the delta of the gilgil river and by anchoring artificial islands planted with papyrus in shallow water see wanjala et al 2018 generally however papyrus has few supporters among the local population and its provisioning services are scarce and of low value ancient cultural practices tied to papyrus are unknown in naivasha where local maasai clans used to have limited interaction with the lake riparian zone the arrival of european settlers drove them away from the lake shores during the early twentieth century no local uses or papyrus based crafts ever developed in naivasha apart from rare small scale exceptions cattle grazing occurs in an unplanned and destructive unsustainable fashion over an increasing portion of the riparian zone 3 conclusive remarks the multifunctional use of papyrus swamps could provide greater direct benefits than conversion to agriculture maclean et al 2011 however this could be questionable in the case of lake naivasha where traditional provisioning uses have not developed despite its high growth rate and its natural tendency to regenerate jones et al 2016 the rapid degradation of tropical swamps that occurs in east african lakes and wetlands indicates that renewable provisional services managed by sustainable harvesting are not perceived as sufficiently valuable by local people or management authorities to motivate papyrus swamp protection in reality we have made the case here that regulating services are of far greater importance namely biodiversity support nutrient regulation hydrological and climate control the importance of papyrus swamps for the conservation of avifauna has been given greater attention now that papyrus swamps are on the decline maclean et al 2003b donaldson et al 2016 but we still do not understand the role that papyrus wetlands play for the fauna living in adjacent terrestrial ecosystems particularly at times of drought clearly papyrus degradation is likely to have an impact in areas that reach far beyond the wetland and the riparian zone itself assessments of papyrus role within the local climate and temperature control through evapotranspiration point to the great albeit underestimated economic significance of papyrus swamps the moisture and temperature balance of a large portion of south sudan is under the influence of the sudd swamps similarly there are good reasons to hypothesise that the presence of a pristine papyrus swamp fringing lake naivasha and lake victoria could have had a significant impact on water levels on nutrient equilibria within the lake as well as on average temperature and precipitation within their surrounding basins despite half a century of research on papyrus ecophysiology data that could support or disprove this contention are still very scanty lake naivasha is surrounded by drylands that experience a precipitation evaporation deficit where sensible heat is the main component of solar radiation partitioning during most of the year apart from the rainy seasons and evapotranspiration is mainly controlled by precipitation odongo et al 2016 within the basin wetlands and forests are the only ecosystems where vegetation can take control of energy partitioning and stabilise the ambient temperature and the available humidity concomitant deforestation and wetland drainage is progressively loosening the coupling between vegetation driven evapotranspiration and the small water cycle this will further desiccate the landscape enhancing local climate change irrespectively of predicted global temperature rise engelbrecht et al 2015 or of global circulation factors which are related to uncertain future precipitation predictions for this region klein et al 2016 papyrus protection and restoration at lake naivasha should be perceived as a main ecohydrological management tool to achieve a balanced ecosystem in which the vegetation can moderate energy and hydraulic fluxes the enhancement of the naivasha papyrus fringe should be actively supported by targeted replanting channel diversion for enlarging the river delta swamps protection from agricultural encroachment fencing off cattle and wildlife papyrus protection is possible through the involvement and the collaboration of local communities as demonstrated by the endoroi in loboi swamp who actively prevent access by cattle and wildlife to maintain the papyrus wetland terer et al 2012a action is urgent and necessary because papyrus swamps are vulnerable and vanishing from most rift valley lakes precautionary intervention is necessary despite the lack of a complete understanding and assessment of the value of the life supporting services provided by tropical papyrus swamps the increasing eutrophication of lake naivasha cannot be solely attributed to the degradation of the papyrus swamp because of the concomitant impact of multiple drivers however it should be expected that papyrus degradation represents an additional cause of reduced phosphorus and nitrogen retention within the lake littoral a similar situation could be common to most east african lakes studies of papyrus nutrient retention and water cycle moderation indicate that life supporting regulating services hold a far greater comparative advantage in respect of provisioning or cultural services but they are very hard to evaluate we face a difficult paradox 1 mankind cannot live solely off transformed capital in reality we are sustained by the regulating services performed by natural ecosystems 2 the more valuable these services are the more difficult they are to estimate and yet as underlined by j seják purkynĕ university czech republic only by focussing on regulating services and by bringing them to the decision making table where social and economic issues are discussed it is possible to elevate the expression sustainable development to its true meaning conflict

1164,east african wetlands are naturally dominated by papyrus the world s fastest growing herbaceous plant reaching up to 5m in height and 3kgm 2 of standing biomass per year while its provisioning services are well known papyrus plays a less evident role in supporting tropical swamp ecosystems by controlling nutrient balances as well as hydrological flows and through the provision of critical biotopes vital for the reproduction of insects fishes and birds including a small number of endemic species claims are made condemning papyrus for enhancing water loss yet only few proper evapotranspiration studies have been carried out conflicting evidence indicates that papyrus swamps could be important in regulating local climate through evapotranspiration and hold significant potential in climate mitigation through carbon sequestration and carbon storage as peat these benefits may become soon severely eroded because papyrus swamps are degrading rapidly due to direct exploitation to agricultural encroachment and to extensive trampling and feeding by cattle we review papyrus ecosystem services with a focus on its role on biodiversity enhancement and regulating functions we present new evidence showing an inverse temperature gradient within papyrus swamps indicative of an optimised water retention capacity with examples from lake naivasha and lake victoria better understanding of papyrus regulating services should underpin papyrus restoration as an ecohydrological tool to improve water quality to moderate local climate by regulating the water cycle to provide base material for a variety of provisioning ecosystem services to enhance biotope structure and to support biodiversity keywords ecosystem biotechnology tropical wetlands lake naivasha evapotranspiration climate change 1 introduction the concept of ecohydrology stressing the inter relationship that exists between macrophytes and aquatic ecosystem health harper et al 2016 originates from the scientific recognition of the dominant impact that vegetation can have on the physico chemical conditions of lakes and streams riparian macrophytes play a key role in the control of wetland ecosystem processes by acting as chemical filters as well as hydrological and climatic buffers wetland managers can strengthen environmental health and progress towards conservation targets by maintaining or re establishing submerged and or riparian macrophyte beds stands the effective functioning of stands of macrophytes particularly emergent macrophytes at the land water interface thus becomes an important tool for ecohydrological management the most widespread emergent macrophyte in africa is the giant sedge cyperus papyrus l cyperaceae the largest of the 400 tropical sedge species within the genus which represents perhaps the best known example of long standing human use of a riparian resource since the early holocene human populations living along the lower nile have harvested papyrus and used it for multiple needs including building materials baskets as well as canoes and sailing boats used for transporting light cargo and during religious events gaudet 2014 it is estimated that by 3000 b c egyptians had invented paper using papyrus thus it became widely known across the mediterranean the original name of the plant derived from an ancient egyptian term meaning royal papyrus then gave origin to the word paper as well as to bible which derives from the ancient greek biblon book a term which originally referred to the bundle of fine papyrus strips that were assembled together to compose a single paper sheet phoenicians greeks and later arabs traded papyrus and attempted to grow it abroad in ancient times papyrus swamps used to be grown in mesopotamia and in syria papyrus still grows today along the river banks of the ciane a small stream in southeastern sicily gaudet 2014 papyrus is a key species dominating afrotropical swamps across a wide latitudinal range 17 n 29 s jones and muthuri 1985 stretching well beyond the inter tropical belt it also grows across a high altitudinal range extending from sea level up to a maximum of 2300m a s l ol bolossat swamp in kenya grows right across the equator at 2340m a s l pers obs the original distribution of papyrus ranged from the southern african region up to the southern shores of the mediterranean leaving out much of west africa van dam et al 2014 the portion of the 2 072 775km2 of wetlands in the african continent mitchell 2013 that is covered by papyrus swamps is not well known despite technological advances that should enable tracing papyrus by means of satellite imagery adam and mutanga 2009 adam et al 2012 the main centres of papyrus distribution include the swamps in the sudd of south sudan the okavango inland delta in botswana the upemba region in congo including lakes tumba mai ndombe and the complex of wetlands bordering the lower ubangi and the mid congo rivers the bangweulu and kafue flats along the zambesi papyrus also grows along the shores of most freshwater lakes in east africa it used to be common all along the lower nile and in its delta but because of intense exploitation by humans riparian degradation by cattle and farming within the riparian zone it became progressively rare papyrus had virtually disappeared from egypt by the early twentieth century täckholm and drar 1950 it has recently been re recorded in the nile delta but with low occurrence el ghani et al 2011 in east africa papyrus swamps probably do not exceed 40 000km2 an average figure estimated in the early 1990s hughes and hughes 1992 this surface is believed to undergo frequent inter annual variations because of the water level changes that are common in afrotropical swamps throughout east africa now papyrus wetlands are polluted by wastes from industry agriculture and households owino and ryan 2007 kansiime et al 2007 munabi et al 2009 more than 70 of the upper nile and congo wetlands have been lost during the last two decades of the twentieth century maclean 2004 papyrus swamps on lake victoria have been extensively destroyed by overharvesting osumba et al 2010 and references therein and often replaced by subsistence crops such as cocoyam colocasia esculenta kansiime et al 2005a sugarcane and or rice or even common vegetables tomatoes cabbages carrots potatoes maclean et al 2011 when swamps have been drained for large scale agricultural exploitation papyrus has specifically been targeted maclean et al 2014 papyrus swamps are drained 4 times more often than wetland ecosystems in general and this is leading to a severe restriction of available habitat for papyrus endemic birds mafabi 2000 maclean et al 2014 deliberate swamp drainage as well as natural water level fluctuations can turn papyrus swamps into significant carbon sources through peat decomposition jones and humphries 2002 their conversion to agricultural land reduces valuable ecosystem services kansiime et al 2007 with a severe economic loss for local communities maclean et al 2011 van dam et al 2014 damming and channelisation also increase malaria incidence by raising water temperature and by increasing the occurrence of biotopes that shelter mosquitoes conversely papyrus establishment shades out mosquito breeding sites and reduces their suitability to develop dense mosquito colonies mekonnen et al 2005 lindblade et al 2000 goma 1960 the value of papyrus in providing ecosystem services to the human populations surrounding swamps has been highlighted by several authors in attempts to prevent them from destruction and we review these studies concisely here this sets the scene for addressing regulating services of prime ecohydrological relevance that we argue are the most important yet poorly studied and poorly understood we summarise and discuss the existing evidence for processes indicating that papyrus can be vital in moderating local climate and in preventing desiccation through its contribution to the water cycle this evidence also includes limited measurements carried out by us of temperature gradients within papyrus swamps we thus argue that papyrus protection and enhancement should be pursued as an important management tool in afrotropical wetlands particularly in the face of the recent and greater hydrological uncertainties brought about by climate change 2 ecosystem services 2 1 provisioning services several authors reviewed the ecosystem services provided by papyrus swamps most of them have highlighted direct human uses and the high value of provisioning services maclean et al 2011 terer et al 2012a 2012b morrison et al 2012 including water food materials for building crafts and fuel medicinal herbs among others bacon 1997 van dam et al 2011 maclean et al 2011 riparian sedges and grasses are used for weaving baskets thatching roofs assembling fish traps and building canoes as in ancient egypt for more than 5000 years until 2000 years ago these activities still occur on lake tana in ethiopia gaudet 2014 riparian macrophytes are important forage resources especially at times of drought papyrus wetlands have been regularly used to feed cattle muthuri and kinyamario 1989 because of its rapid growth the wise use of papyrus fibre can be a source of valuable sustainable resources for direct use balanced by natural regrowth this explains the high value attributed to its provisioning services it has been estimated that average aerial dry weight biomass regeneration can reach 6 28kgm 2 y 1 similar to a sugarcane crop muthuri et al 1989 more recently estimated production rates derived from different swamps ranged widely between 0 09 and 14 3kgm 2 year 1 osumba et al 2010 this suggests that with responsible husbandry in some swamps papyrus could be more widely exploited in a multipurpose wise use fashion that would take advantage of its water treatment capacity as well as its sustainably renewable standing biomass as a source of fuel and fibre perbangkhem and polprasert 2010 a sustainable annual harvest of up to 15tha 1 yr 1 was suggested by jones 1982 1983 it takes only 6 months for germinating papyrus to reach maturity van dam et al 2011 and a harvesting rate between 9 and 12 months was recommended to maintain high standing biomass van dam et al 2007 no further increment in biomass was detected beyond 14 months growth thenya 2006 maclean et al 2003a show that the net present value of harvested papyrus and fish derived from swamps greatly exceeds the value of the crops grown following swamp drainage 2 2 cultural services society tends to typically overestimate the value of provisioning ecosystem services because they are represented by marketable goods and therefore there are market substitutes that can be readily compared with them this is usually impossible with regulating services whose values are thus overlooked and or underscored similarly cultural services tend to be overestimated because they are readily measurable in particular using indicators such as number of visitors to fish landing beaches or number of nights spent in local hotels as well as average distance travelled to reach tourist destination a common method used to evaluate the service value of protected areas in the case of papyrus it is difficult to separate the cultural service value of papyrus alone from the value attributed by tourists to tropical wetlands in general not all agree that papyrus increases amenity for instance recently revamped building enterprise activities around lake naivasha advertising villas with a lake view provided one further means of estimating cultural value by hedonic pricing however in some cases this worked out as a paradox while wetland views enhance the value of private property at lake naivasha according to a preliminary survey we conducted in 2013 the presence of papyrus is considered negative by some hoteliers because it blocks the view of open water aspects of cultural value linked to indigenous knowledge and traditions are evident from reports made by several observers see below but harder to evaluate socio cultural uses of papyrus swamps developed among most populations living along the nile gaudet 2014 van dam et al 2014 the present day values of papyrus are deeply embedded in the cultural identity of indigenous tribes thriving along the shores of lake victoria maclean et al 2011 morrison 2013 and this is the case also with less extensive swamps papyrus is an important component of traditional rituals and dances during cleansing and blessing ceremonies such as with the endoroi tribe living around loboi swamp on the shores of lake bogoria kenya as described by terer et al 2012a who also cite analogous ritual practices being carried out in gabon burkill 1985 cited in terer et al 2012a the endoroi name given to papyrus translates into crown of majesty terer et al 2012a which incidentally recalls the original meaning of the name given to papyrus by ancient egyptians 2 3 regulating services 2 3 1 biodiversity papyrus swamps are dense macrophyte stands with little space left for accessory species other than on the margin few organisms have developed adaptations to dwell within papyrus swamps as papyrus grows in monospecific assemblages that exclude other emergent vegetation at the same time however the hydrological and chemical buffering see below offered by papyrus dominated wetlands favours the persistence of a diverse community of submerged macrophytes in nearby aquatic ecosystems harper et al 1995 because of its high specificity and of the ecological conditions it supports papyrus contributes significantly to mesoscale or regional biodiversity a large number of fish amphibian reptile mammal and bird species live in afrotropical wetlands the sitatunga or marshbuck tragelaphus spekei can be considered endemic to papyrus swamps papyrus provides breeding grounds for fish mnaya and wolanski 2002 and refuge from predators endemic lake victoria cichlids find refuge from nile perch chapman et al 2002 hickley et al 2004 few species of birds can be said to be endemic to papyrus dominated biotopes passerines from the upper nile such as the near threatened papyrus gonolek laniarius mufumbiri fig 1 the greater swamp warbler acrocephalus rufescens and the white winged scrub warbler bradypterus carpalis are entirely confined to papyrus swamps maclean et al 2014 donaldson et al 2016 also the papyrus canary serinus koliensis breeds within papyrus bennun and njoroge 1999 but it sometimes forages in adjacent crops vandeweghe 1981 similarly to the black crake amaurornis flavirostra t mwinami pers obs while the vulnerable papyrus yellow warbler chloropeta gracilirostris and carruthers s cisticola cisticola carruthersi are principally confined to papyrus bennun and njoroge 1999 donaldson et al 2016 but also occupy mixed emergent macrophyte wetlands particularly at high altitude maclean et al 2014 several other species feed within papyrus on insect and aquatic macroinvertebrates and utilise other aquatic macrophytes for roosting and breeding the pied kingfisher ceryle rudis the cattle egret bubulcus ibis the marsh harrier the reed cormorant phalacrocorax africanus and the great cormorant phalacrocorax carbo the malachite kingfisher alcedo cristata the african pygmy kingfisher ceyx pictus the giant kingfisher megaceryle maxima and the squacco heron ardeola ralloides on the shore of lakes victoria and baringo papyrus hosts nesting colonies of lesser masked weaver ploceus intermedius northern masked weaver ploceus taeniopterus and golden weaver ploceus superciliosus along the tana river in kenya the only known nesting site of clarks weaver ploceus golandi is on a papyrus vandeweghe 1981 most papyrus related species manifested significant declines throughout east africa between the periods 1984 1987 and 1999 2001 maclean et al 2014 very little appears to be known about the terrestrial insects associated with papyrus a preliminary survey of the coleoptera and hemiptera associated with the flowering heads of papyrus at lake naivasha on the landward side of papyrus swamps found 26 species a cook a drane personal communication the community of insects varied according to the age of the papyrus flowering heads changing in composition between flower buds and senescent flowers how many of the species recorded are closely tied to papyrus is unknown although one of the dominant species ischnodemus grossus slater fig 2 is likely to be specific because of its wing polymorphism the majority of the population found have reduced non functional wings brachypters while few were fully winged macropters studies of other bugs e g denno et al 2001 have shown that the proportion of winged to non winged morphs elsewhere varies according to the stability and continuity of the habitat at naivasha i grossus life cycle is closely linked to umbel development and it occurs only during the early stages of umbel growth other groups of insects present particularly lepidoptera diptera hymenoptera and dermaptera and numerous collembola and arachnida indicate that the community of papyrus flowering heads is very diverse and a description of all invertebrates present would be a major undertaking 2 3 2 carbon sequestration papyrus represents a significant carbon sink because of its rapid growth jones and muthuri 1997 with rates of the order of 10tcha 1 year 1 saunders et al 2012 c4 photosynthesis allows it to perform high rates of c assimilation under intense radiation and high temperature low photorespiration and lack of inhibition even under conditions of high vapour pressure deficit an ability that cannot be matched by c3 plants saunders et al 2012 its competitive superiority is supported by the chlorophyll content of papyrus umbels which is about 25 higher than equivalent photosynthetic tissue of emergent c3 macrophytes jones and muthuri 1985 the energy capturing efficiency of papyrus the proportion of solar energy that can be converted into biomass is high estimated to reach between 4 4 and 6 0 in artificial papyrus wetlands developed for water treatment in tropical thailand perbangkhem and polprasert 2010 the actual productivity of single papyrus wetlands is likely to be site specific and related to local temperature thompson et al 1979 light intensity jones 1987 nutrient status jones and muthuri 1985 hydrological regime saunders et al 2007 altitude jones 1983 and seasonality jones and muthuri 1985 biomass accumulation is thought to increase at higher altitudes such as at lake naivasha 1890m a s l wanjala et al 2018 because lower night time temperatures reduce losses of carbon through respiration jones 1983 papyrus growth at a single location is likely to change over time with the intensification of human impact affecting nutrient influx into the swamp at lake naivasha where papyrus grows under similar conditions all year round jones and muthuri 1985 carbon assimilation was estimated to reach 2 51kgcm 2 yr 1 in the early 1980s muthuri et al 1989 however recent estimates obtained with an alternative method are significantly higher morrison 2013 this is likely to be explained by the on going eutrophication of lake naivasha next to high productivity rates slow decomposition and long term storage of degrading detritus within the swamp jones and muthuri 1997 also contribute to high c accumulation papyrus wetlands generate the largest portion of anaerobic tropical peat present on the african continent representing a significant carbon store above ground papyrus biomass is high for a herbaceous plant greatest among all sedges yet far greater is the below ground debris compartment which can attain 20 times the above ground biomass jones and muthuri 1997 work on east african wetlands has revealed that typically when the detrital c present in a 1m deep peat layer is added to the living biomass that on average constitutes papyrus swamps this can represent up to 728tcha 1 this estimate exceeds standing and detrital c present in tropical forests saunders et al 2014 considering that papyrus swamps can accumulate peat for an average depth of 5 75m for the whole of east africa this could represent up to 11 36gt c saunders et al 2014 a large portion of this carbon could end up being released to the atmosphere upon conversion of tropical swamps into drained farmland as well as during swamp drawdown that is common at lake naivasha jones and humphries 2002 characterised by a particularly unstable hydrology a synthesis of more than 20 studies concluded that the sum of aboveground and belowground living biomass may reach up to 88tcha 1 which is comparable to the standing biomass of natural forests saunders et al 2014 2 3 3 nutrient regulation the ecohydrology concept of mutual regulation harper et al 2016 explains how nutrient availability in swamps is determined by the presence of emergent macrophytes themselves papyrus is able to dominate the riparian fringe of tropical swamps where continuous growth conditions naturally lead to intense biotic interactions and steep competition papyrus can have very high c n p ratio in naivasha 565 8 1 boar 2006 in comparison to temperate wetland plants a characteristic that provides an indication of its high nutrient efficiency its high rates of n assimilation jones 1987 and its high efficiency in nutrient utilisation boar 2006 enable papyrus to outcompete most other emergent macrophytes most of which carry out c3 photosynthesis papyrus swamps trap sediments and pollutants entering water bodies from the surrounding catchment boar et al 1999 azza et al 2000 boar and harper 2002 kipkemboi et al 2002 serag 2003 kelderman et al 2007 however their buffering efficiency is likely to be highly dependent on the width and continuity of the riparian vegetation boar 2006 phosphorus is adsorbed onto slowly decaying particulate organic matter and becomes part of the peat its storage is temporary because peat slowly decays and p will eventually be released as soon as local biogeochemical conditions reduction of fe and mn hydroxides redox change will allow the swamp does not function as a p barrier but rather as a p buffer gaudet 1976 by intercepting and temporarily fixing any sudden increase in p availability that may be caused by sudden discharge pulses long term storage of phosphorus may take place in papyrus wetlands by incorporation into buried organic sediments howard williams and gaudet 1985 nitrogen is a constituent of the chlorophyll molecule and plant growth in tropical swamps which are not limited by low temperatures is highly dependent upon its availability nitrogen concentrations within papyrus swamps are relatively low and constant first of all because allochthonous forms of n are readily taken up by the papyrus rhizome and shoots secondly because in pristine swamps the total amount of n forms present is regulated by the highly effective atmospheric nitrogen fixation mwaura 1981 mwaura and widdowson 1992 at naivasha during the 1970s it was estimated that n2 fixation performed by bacteria symbiotic to the swamp root system was greater than n imports delivered by the lake tributaries gaudet 1977 nitrogen fixing rates are self regulated because the responsible enzyme nitrogenase becomes significantly suppressed as soon as dissolved nitrogen concentrations start increasing vymazal 1995 throughout africa the balance between nitrogen fixation and external loading may be progressively changing as agricultural effluents increase along with population growth and more intensive farming in swamps receiving large loads of residential effluents such as in parts of lake victoria nitrogen buffering occurs because the papyrus root system can provide ideal conditions for bacterial denitrification and for dead biomass accumulation kansiime et al 2007 kanyiginya et al 2010 these systems may eventually release significant quantities of reduced greenhouse gases such as methane and n2o2 saunders et al 2014 especially when swamps are fed with nitrogen rich wastewater and exhibit high amounts of nitrifying bacteria kyambadde et al 2004 according to a recently proposed model hes et al 2014 the highest nitrogen retention occurs within the outer submerged portion of the swamp which first receives the external effluents while in the permanently flooded portion of the swamp papyrus growth is relatively limited by low ambient nitrate concentrations in nutrient rich systems n accumulation in papyrus biomass can be high chale 1987 ammonia release is considered of little relevance in papyrus swamps because of their tendency to create relatively acidic conditions hes et al 2014 2 3 4 hydrological buffering papyrus buffers the landscape against sudden flood surges due to the high potential infiltration of swamp soils dixon and wood 2003 and because of the physical barrier to flow represented by papyrus culms kansiime et al 2005b thereafter moisture can be released both as underground and as an atmospheric flux acting as a moderator of seasonal moisture deficits during drought moisture is slowly released from the sponge of water saturated swamp soils embedded in a network of roots and decaying vegetation sheltered from direct sunshine and from air movement by the dense array of papyrus culms the canopy structure is able to create a nearly continuous cover intercepting as much as 90 of the incident radiation jones and muthuri 1985 rapid growth and high seed production make papyrus highly adapted to withstand the periodical drawdown cycles that are typical of the monsoon driven east african climate terer et al 2014 the extent of hydrological and sediment load buffering through enhanced evapotranspiration infiltration and sediment deposition provided by papyrus swamps has been illustrated by ryken et al 2015 in their study on a small ugandan subcatchment draining into lake victoria 2 3 5 water cycle and climate regulation an insufficiently documented but potentially very relevant service provided by wetlands is their role in regulating air temperature hence climate through evapotranspiration et demonstrated by the difference between the dispersal of incoming solar radiation by wetlands compared to dry biomass poor ecosystems huryna et al 2014 evaporation is the result of the impact of solar energy upon water molecules phase change between liquid and water vapour is linked to the consumption of a large amount of energy needed to break the hydrogen bonds formed between single h2o molecules in liquid water because evaporation is an endothermic reaction the body which loses water tends to decrease its temperature the balance between water vapour and sensible heat implies that ambient temperature will be moderated by the release of water vapour through evaporation until water is present in the landscape it can be estimated that the decrease in potential evaporation resulting from swamp drainage can cause a release of the order of 250wm 2 of heat equivalent to a release of 100mgs 1 of water vapour the drainage of a 1km2 surface can thus release 250mw of assimilated solar energy back to the atmosphere as warm air sensible heat sensible heat fluxes produce changes to local air movements local temperature and precipitation it is commonly believed that emergent macrophytes are characterised by extremely high transpiration rates resulting in a far greater water vapour loss than would occur from an open water surface in reality within most wetlands a stable radiation sheltered and a relatively cool vapour saturated environment develops evapotranspiration condensation processes are responsible for the re distribution of the incoming solar energy and are mainly driven by vegetation plants control the daily temperature changes at local scale and contribute to the definition of local climate huryna et al 2014 wetland ecosystems are particularly effective in this respect in wetlands thanks to the permanent availability of water latent heat tends to prevail all year round the conversion of solar energy into evapotranspiration may consume about 60 80 of the net incoming radiation sensible heat then may account for only about 20 30 while the ground heat flux amounts to approx 10 20 kedziora 2011 the latent heat flux generated by water vapour release consumes energy during the phase transition process during the day flows of energy take place along gradients caused by differences in water vapour and temperature between the land surface and the atmosphere at night a downward latent heat flux occurs as condensation at the edge of cool surfaces and with the formation of dew evapotranspiration is thus a powerful temperature control process having a double air conditioning effect upon the landscape over a 24h period a evaporation cools surfaces consuming solar energy by transforming liquid water into water vapour b condensation of water vapour warms the air releasing the energy of latent heat when dew point is achieved evapotranspiration can thus be considered as a process of temperature equalisation and reduction of physical gradients controlled by natural wetland vegetation pokorný et al 2016a b water vapour release occurs through the stomata of higher plants and is therefore modulated by the physiological requirements temperature humidity hydrostatic pressure of the vegetation plants can exert a relative control over water loss and ambient temperature by controlling gas exchange through the stomata estimating evapotranspiration in wetlands is a difficult science requiring sophisticated equipment therefore studies are few field measurements can often be muddled by local effects evapotranspiration is influenced by atmospheric pressure above the swamp and wind exposure can be a factor that can induce localised vapour pressure deficit wetzel 1983 which in turn induces higher evapotranspiration several artefacts can thus impact on field measurements high water vapour fluxes measured above swamps are likely to be influenced by advected hot and dry air fluxes generated from overheated bare surface areas that surround the swamps themselves and that are naturally attracted by the cooler swamp environment these hot fluxes are capable of charging up with a lot of moisture the potential moisture content of air increases steeply with temperature creating strong ascending air currents that transfer large amounts of water from the swamp towards the atmosphere this could partly explain why there is limited evidence indicating that papyrus swamps are able to exert a significant control over local state conditions temperature humidity and actually prevent the water loss that would be realised by simple evaporation from an equivalent open water surface in general c4 species tend to have lower rates of transpiration than c3 species because they avoid photorespiration and tend therefore to have higher water use efficiency hasegawa 1977 o toole and tomar 1982 long 1999 because of culm height and high standing biomass papyrus swamps are better adapted at creating a low evapotranspiration microclimate than most other swamps jones and muthuri 1985 strong resistance by papyrus to vapour pressure deficit enhances this advantage the incoming energy is transformed into a balanced proportion of sensible and latent heat and the swamp acts as an air conditioning device near permanent temperature and moisture conditions tend to reduce rising air currents that generally cause progressive landscape desiccation from overheated dryland surfaces such as in the dry savannah in some papyrus wetlands evapotranspiration 1500 1600mmyear 1 was lower than evaporation from open water butcher 1938 jones and humphries 2002 mohamed et al 2004 ecohydrological research carried out at lake naivasha in the early 1980s jones and muthuri 1984 demonstrated that stomatal conductance rate of gas exchange through plant stomata which bears a high impact on evapotranspiration in papyrus tended to decrease during midday while vapour pressure deficit was increasing and this despite freely available water i e the stomata release little vapour despite a high air to leaf water vapour gradient it was postulated that this remarkable stomatal regulation capacity served the purpose of reducing uptake of oxygen deficient water rich in toxic reduced iron this same reason would explain the xeromorphic shape of papyrus umbels and bracteoles jones and muthuri 1984 in any case papyrus stomata seem to have a remarkable control over water loss from swamps some years later still at lake naivasha jones and humphries 2002 measured evaporative losses from the main lake to be approximately 64 higher than losses due to evapotranspiration from the papyrus canopy 6 6 and 2 4kgh2om 2 d 1 respectively conversely at the kirinya wetland in uganda papyrus evapotranspiration was estimated by saunders et al 2007 to be on average 25 higher than evaporation from open water floating vegetation such as mature water hyacinth beds is known however to evaporate more than open water e g idso and anderson 1988 data sets seem inadequate for understanding the precise role of papyrus an analysis of papyrus swamp microclimate box 1 raises interesting new questions in fig 3 the bare soil 70 c is almost completely dry most of the solar energy is directly converted into sensible heat as no more latent heat can be produced in the absence of moisture the nearby sisal thrives at 41 c with a modulated water release to maintain its temperature within acceptable physiological range in fig 4 a light but consistent temperature gradient was detected within a dense papyrus swamp on the shore of lake victoria the infrared image illustrates that temperature is lowest at the foot of the swamp and increases by 1 3 c towards the swamp apex while the temperature of open water is greater this stratification indicates that a cushion of cool moist air tends to form at the foot of the papyrus swamp and remains trapped being denser and heavier than the warmer air above such stagnant cool air is likely to act by preventing ascending air currents and by reducing the release of vapour from the swamp base towards the atmosphere similar conditions are found in the acacia xanthophloea woodland upper portion of the riparian zone at lake naivasha fig 5 here low temperatures are maintained within the woodland compared to far higher temperatures outside only few metres further bare soil bakes at 60 c the heating of air above the soil surface and the lack of cover contribute to the creation of steadily rising streams of hot air that progressively extract all available humidity from the soil and desiccate the landscape the inverted vertical temperature gradient within the acacia woodland fig 6 as in the lake victoria papyrus swamp allows the development of stagnant cool air just above the soil within such woodlands the conversion of solar energy into latent heat prevents the warming of soil water and air while the soil is protected from desiccation by the inverse temperature gradient the large scale effects of progressive wetland drainage remain poorly investigated besides moderating evaporation from open water and ambient temperature papyrus swamps could be playing a significant role in supporting the small water cycle kravčík et al 2007 of evaporation precipitation relatively independent from the long distance monsoonal precipitation cycle that characterises tropical ecosystems savenije 1995a b pointed out that papyrus swamps are likely to play a highly significant role in moisture recycling and therefore may influence local climatic conditions in nearby ecosystems extending their influence over vast areas mohamed and savenije 2014 showed that the sudd swamps hydrologically dependent onto lake victoria water levels have a determining impact on regional moisture availability cloud formation and radiation intensity a model describing how forest vegetation impacts local climate has been proposed by makarieva et al 2013 further supported through measurements on a small scale by pokorný et al 2016a b and recently set in a broader context ellison et al 2017 this research could provide new perspectives for interpreting the link between papyrus swamps and the water cycle within the swamp water evaporates only from the top of papyrus culms evapotranspiration is controlled by the vegetation evaporation from open water or soil is just a physical process dependent on state conditions during the night filamentous threadlike papyrus stalks insulated from the ground tend to lose temperature rapidly against the cool sky until they serve as surfaces for water vapour condensation air pressure drops due to condensation and the surrounding air distributed horizontally within the lower atmosphere becomes attracted towards the condensation low pressure zone it is sucked in in this way papyrus swamps could act as acceptor zones sensu makarieva et al 2013 for catalysing rain events with swamp drainage vapour is carried up by rising air currents generated by soil overheating and moisture cannot revert at night due to the lack of a cool rainfall acceptor swamp drainage breaks the small water cycle according to this scenario the conversion of papyrus into arable land results in a dramatic increase of surface temperature and into progressive desiccation this process can be assessed by superimposing surface temperature changes detected by remote sensing and changes in land cover the mau forest which borders the western edge of the lake naivasha catchment was known as the largest single forest block in east africa until it shrank by 1800km2 starting from the 1980s hesslerová and pokorný 2010 the mau deforestation caused a massive reduction in evapotranspiration implying that as much as 2 6billionkwhday 1 that used to leave the region as latent heat eventually became converted into sensible heat causing a significant rise in ambient temperature detected through infrared satellite imagery hesslerová and pokorný 2010 by inference this reduced local rainfall as experienced by long term residents s higgins personal communication 2 3 6 the current status of papyrus ecosystem services at lake naivasha the areal extent of papyrus wetlands at lake naivasha kenya declined from approx 48km2 to approx 14km2 during the period 1960 1995 boar et al 1999 and continued to do so thereafter as a consequence of both natural and anthropogenic causes morrison and harper 2009 onywere et al 2012 estimated that papyrus occupied 17 7km2 throughout the entire lake naivasha catchment in 2006 from satellite imagery but since then drivers of wetland loss have remained largely unmitigated harper et al 2011 up to three decades ago papyrus used to grow in a virtually continuous riparian belt with a large floating swamp which developed at the mouth of the main tributary the malewa river the surface covered by c papyrus and by floating alien vegetation water hyacinth and salvinia between 1989 and 2013 showed a general decline with falling water levels as both become stranded on dry land and desiccated or destroyed fig 7 the lowest surface cover was recorded in 2008 after water levels had declined continuously during the previous 4 years both c papyrus and the floating aliens tended to increase in 2013 when water level rose and new land was flooded recent observations suggest that natural drawdown is exacerbated by anthropogenic water abstractions which increase steeply during the dry seasons as in 2009 and in 2017 on the other hand during reflooding of the lake shore disturbance by cattle and by wild herbivores morrison and harper 2009 pers obs prevents the regrowth of the young papyrus because grazing takes place at a critical time for the re establishment of the new riparian papyrus fringe morrison 2013 lake naivasha s papyrus swamp today occupies less than 10 of its 1970s surface described in detail by gaudet 1977 because of trampling and foraging by cattle as well as by wildlife encroachment by local farmers and elimination on the orders of hotel managers who try to preserve an open lake view for their customers on an interannual scale natural regeneration is enhanced by water level increases fig 7 however it deteriorates when human disturbance and drought periods occur in conjunction which encourages cattle and wildlife encroachment into the riparian zone an estimate based upon the size of naivasha s wetland suggests a theoretical potential to meet 40 of the annual cooking fuel requirements of the 650 000 basin residents using briquettes made of carbonised papyrus morrison et al 2013 the mean calorific value of papyrus briquettes 20mjkg 1 was similar to firewood 18mjkg 1 but lower than charcoal 32mjkg 1 in theory papyrus briquettes could be sustainable due to the rapid regeneration of the papyrus swamp however the moderate calorific value coupled to the relatively high labour investment required for papyrus harvesting drying and carbonising makes briquettes non competitive in relation to charcoal available in village markets which is presently illegally produced by exploiting scarce local forest resources similarly papyrus has been proposed for paper and board manufacture but neither has proved economically viable jones and muthuri 1985 no papyrus endemic birds thrive at lake naivasha however the lake fringe is visited by numerous dryland ungulates it hosts semi aquatic mammals as well as more than 300 species of birds common inhabitants of healthy portions of papyrus include the great reed warbler acrocephalus arundinaceus lesser swamp warbler acrocephalus gracilirostris goliath heron ardea goliath and purple heron ardea purpurea t mwinami personal observation the survival of this fauna is closely dependent upon a pristine riparian zone whose surface is continuously declining because of the reduction of the nutrient buffer offered by the swamp and because of increasing farming and residential effluent discharges the lake has undergone progressive eutrophication accelerated by the impact of alien species notably the crayfish procambarus clarkii responsible for the permanent loss of submerged macrophytes decreasing water transparency increasing algal planktonic biomass and planktonic primary production hubble and harper 2002 dissolved nutrients occasionally measured over the last decade indicate rising eutrophy soluble reactive silicate decreased from an original value of 14 15 7mgl 1 measured in the early 1960s talling and talling 1965 down to 1 2mgl 1 in 2015 unpublished data this phenomenon has also been documented in lake victoria verschuren et al 1998 and if this trend continues it could limit diatom growth in the future to the advantage of potentially toxic cyanobacteria soluble reactive phosphorus srp concentrations on the other hand are still constantly low under the sustained high biological demand driven by emergent and floating macrophytes mainly papyrus and water hyacinth and by the planktonic flora dominated by diatoms but with occasional blooms of cyanobacteria most incoming p remains trapped in the shallow oxygenated and fe rich sediment harper et al 1993 such that open water concentrations typically exhibit undetectable levels of soluble reactive phosphate i e 3μgsrpl 1 unpublished data however following papyrus degradation shallow littoral zones have been colonised by dense mats of water hyacinth that slowly decay forming an organic substrate low in dissolved oxygen and prone to phosphate release concentrations of about 20μgsrpl 1 have been occasionally measured in the early mornings by sampling underneath the littoral hyacinth mat unpublished data kalff 1983 and muthuri and jones 1997 reported very low concentrations of available phosphorus and nitrogen at lake naivasha slightly higher levels were reported by hubble and harper 2002 still higher dissolved nitrogen concentrations were recorded during occasional monitoring conducted in 2015 ammonia 0 1 0 6mgl 1 nitrate 0 1 0 3mgl 1 the loss of the papyrus fringe caused an increase of nitrogen release towards the atmosphere ph above 9 a pre condition for nh3 release was occasionally measured during the central hours of the day in warm shallow littoral areas dominated by submerged mats of benthic filamentous algae causing intense photosynthetic rates high oxygen supersaturation and undetectable ammonia personal observation papyrus influence on the local climate at naivasha can be only inferred as no detailed investigation has been carried out to document changes in landscape temperature concomitant with the degradation of the papyrus swamp demonstrations of papyrus fringe restoration have been carried out at lake naivasha by artificially flooding a portion of the delta of the gilgil river and by anchoring artificial islands planted with papyrus in shallow water see wanjala et al 2018 generally however papyrus has few supporters among the local population and its provisioning services are scarce and of low value ancient cultural practices tied to papyrus are unknown in naivasha where local maasai clans used to have limited interaction with the lake riparian zone the arrival of european settlers drove them away from the lake shores during the early twentieth century no local uses or papyrus based crafts ever developed in naivasha apart from rare small scale exceptions cattle grazing occurs in an unplanned and destructive unsustainable fashion over an increasing portion of the riparian zone 3 conclusive remarks the multifunctional use of papyrus swamps could provide greater direct benefits than conversion to agriculture maclean et al 2011 however this could be questionable in the case of lake naivasha where traditional provisioning uses have not developed despite its high growth rate and its natural tendency to regenerate jones et al 2016 the rapid degradation of tropical swamps that occurs in east african lakes and wetlands indicates that renewable provisional services managed by sustainable harvesting are not perceived as sufficiently valuable by local people or management authorities to motivate papyrus swamp protection in reality we have made the case here that regulating services are of far greater importance namely biodiversity support nutrient regulation hydrological and climate control the importance of papyrus swamps for the conservation of avifauna has been given greater attention now that papyrus swamps are on the decline maclean et al 2003b donaldson et al 2016 but we still do not understand the role that papyrus wetlands play for the fauna living in adjacent terrestrial ecosystems particularly at times of drought clearly papyrus degradation is likely to have an impact in areas that reach far beyond the wetland and the riparian zone itself assessments of papyrus role within the local climate and temperature control through evapotranspiration point to the great albeit underestimated economic significance of papyrus swamps the moisture and temperature balance of a large portion of south sudan is under the influence of the sudd swamps similarly there are good reasons to hypothesise that the presence of a pristine papyrus swamp fringing lake naivasha and lake victoria could have had a significant impact on water levels on nutrient equilibria within the lake as well as on average temperature and precipitation within their surrounding basins despite half a century of research on papyrus ecophysiology data that could support or disprove this contention are still very scanty lake naivasha is surrounded by drylands that experience a precipitation evaporation deficit where sensible heat is the main component of solar radiation partitioning during most of the year apart from the rainy seasons and evapotranspiration is mainly controlled by precipitation odongo et al 2016 within the basin wetlands and forests are the only ecosystems where vegetation can take control of energy partitioning and stabilise the ambient temperature and the available humidity concomitant deforestation and wetland drainage is progressively loosening the coupling between vegetation driven evapotranspiration and the small water cycle this will further desiccate the landscape enhancing local climate change irrespectively of predicted global temperature rise engelbrecht et al 2015 or of global circulation factors which are related to uncertain future precipitation predictions for this region klein et al 2016 papyrus protection and restoration at lake naivasha should be perceived as a main ecohydrological management tool to achieve a balanced ecosystem in which the vegetation can moderate energy and hydraulic fluxes the enhancement of the naivasha papyrus fringe should be actively supported by targeted replanting channel diversion for enlarging the river delta swamps protection from agricultural encroachment fencing off cattle and wildlife papyrus protection is possible through the involvement and the collaboration of local communities as demonstrated by the endoroi in loboi swamp who actively prevent access by cattle and wildlife to maintain the papyrus wetland terer et al 2012a action is urgent and necessary because papyrus swamps are vulnerable and vanishing from most rift valley lakes precautionary intervention is necessary despite the lack of a complete understanding and assessment of the value of the life supporting services provided by tropical papyrus swamps the increasing eutrophication of lake naivasha cannot be solely attributed to the degradation of the papyrus swamp because of the concomitant impact of multiple drivers however it should be expected that papyrus degradation represents an additional cause of reduced phosphorus and nitrogen retention within the lake littoral a similar situation could be common to most east african lakes studies of papyrus nutrient retention and water cycle moderation indicate that life supporting regulating services hold a far greater comparative advantage in respect of provisioning or cultural services but they are very hard to evaluate we face a difficult paradox 1 mankind cannot live solely off transformed capital in reality we are sustained by the regulating services performed by natural ecosystems 2 the more valuable these services are the more difficult they are to estimate and yet as underlined by j seják purkynĕ university czech republic only by focussing on regulating services and by bringing them to the decision making table where social and economic issues are discussed it is possible to elevate the expression sustainable development to its true meaning conflict
