17520,due to highly recalcitrant and toxicological nature of n n dimethylformamide dmf efficient removal of dmf is challenging for biological wastewater treatment in this study an anoxic denitrification system was developed and continuously operated for 220 days in order to verify the enhanced dmf biodegradation mechanism as high as 41 05 mm dmf could be thoroughly removed in the anoxic denitrification reactor at hydraulic residence time hrt of 24 h while the total organic carbon toc and nitrate removal efficiencies were as high as 95 7 2 5 and 98 4 1 1 respectively microbial community analyses indicated that the species related to dmf hydrolysis paracoccus brevundimonas and chryseobacterium and denitrification paracoccus arenimonas hyphomicrobium aquamicrobium and bosea were effectively enriched in the anoxic denitrification system transcriptional analysis coupled with enzymatic activity assay indicated that both hydrolysis and mineralization of dmf were largely enhanced in the anoxic denitrification system moreover the occurrence of microbial denitrification distinctly facilitated carbon source utilization to produce electron and energy which was rather beneficial for better reactor performance this study demonstrated that the anoxic denitrification system would be a potential alternative for efficient treatment of wastewater polluted by recalcitrant pollutants such as dmf graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords n n dimethylformamide bio mineralization microbial denitrification transcriptional analysis functional genes 1 introduction n n dimethylformamide dmf ch3 2ncho an anthropogenic organic polar solvent has been widely employed in chemical pharmaceutical and textile industries because it is miscible with water and a wide variety of organic matters kong et al 2018a zhao et al 2018 with the increasing production and consumption of dmf wastewater containing dmf will be inevitably released into the environment välitalo et al 2017 torres et al 2018 prasse et al 2015 it was estimated that more than 5000 tons of dmf was discharged or transferred into the environment every year via the discharge of wastewater from related industries kong et al 2018a dmf displays adverse impacts on human health and environmental quality due to its numerous toxic effects such as embryotoxicity hepatotoxicity teratogenicity and carcinogenicity swaroop et al 2009 kumar et al 2012 moreover dmf is rather persistent in natural environment because of its thermal stability kong et al 2018a accordingly there is an urgent need to develop high efficient and environmental friendly methods to remove dmf from wastewater although various physico chemical methods such as advanced oxidation process sun et al 2008 photodegradation zhao et al 2018 membrane separation das et al 2006 and physical adsorption ye et al 2013 are available for dmf removal from contaminated wastewater biological treatment has turned out to be a favorable alternative because of its merits such as low cost and environmental friendliness kong et al 2018a swaroop et al 2009 kumar et al 2012 to date dmf biodegradation under aerobic condition has been extensively investigated swaroop et al 2009 zhou et al 2018 some species such as paracoccus nisha et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 ochrobactrum veeranagouda et al 2006 and alcaligenes hasegawa et al 1997 were found to be capable of degrading dmf under aerobic condition however the application of aerobic process was often limited by high aeration costs and disgusting smell caused by bubble aeration therefore dmf biodegradation under anaerobic condition has attracted increasing interests in recent years kong et al 2018a and 2018b unfortunately due to the poor biodegradability and high toxicity of dmf yang et al 2014 rahmaninezhad et al 2016 the conventional anaerobic process is usually limited by low removal efficiency and poor process stability kong et al 2018a hasegawa et al 1997 bromley challenor et al 2000b recently enhanced biodegradation of several recalcitrant pollutants including dimethyl phthalate zhang et al 2016 phenol ramos et al 2016 triclosan wang et al 2018b and pyridine hou et al 2018 at the presence of alternative electron acceptor such as nitrate has been demonstrated it was well known that the electrons and energy which could be produced by carbon metabolism were required in microbial denitrification in order to complete biological reduction of nitrate to n2 zheng et al 2014 electron acceptors such as nitrate could act as the electron pools which might be contributed to the enhanced biodegradation of various organic contaminants wang et al 2019 su et al 2019 electron production and consumption plays a crucial role in both carbon metabolism and denitrification therefore promotion of biodegradation efficiency towards various recalcitrant contaminants in the anoxic denitrification system is attracting increasing attention wang et al 2019 hou et al 2018 shen et al 2015 in addition predenitrification based on anoxic and aerobic process a o process was often used for the treatment of chemical wastewater containing various recalcitrant contaminants while the electron acceptor such as nitrate could be easily formed in the subsequent aerobic nitrification system hou et al 2018 wu et al 2019 it would be rather interesting that if the nitrate produced from the aerobic process could be removed through microbial denitrification in the anoxic reactors with recalcitrant compounds partially removed simultaneously however to our best knowledge information on the feasibility of dmf biodegradation in the anoxic denitrification system especially in the long term operation is still unclear bromley challenor et al 2000a furthermore several key insights into anoxic dmf biodegradation including the underlying metabolic mechanism dominating dmf biodegradation and denitrification the evolution of community structure key functional enzymes and electron transport pathway were deserved to be investigated in order to develop an efficient strategy for the treatment of dmf containing wastewater therefore in this study the promotion of dmf biodegradation at the presence of nitrate was verified during long term operation the effects of various operational factors including initial dmf concentration hydraulic retention time hrt and influent ph on reactor performance were investigated additionally the microbial community structures involved in dmf biodegradation were explored to further understand the role of nitrate on the enrichment of specific functional microorganisms finally transcriptional analysis the key enzymatic activity assays nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh and adenosine triphosphate atp content tests were performed to reveal and verify the proposed microbial metabolic mechanism involving dmf biodegradation and denitrification 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and synthetic wastewater in order to verify the positive effect of nitrate towards dmf biodegradation two identical tubular reactors fig s1 with working volume of 2 0 l were operated in parallel one of the reactors fed with synthetic wastewater with the addition of nitrate was named after the anoxic denitrification reactor while the other one fed with synthetic wastewater without the addition of nitrate was named after the anaerobic control reactor both reactors were inoculated with the sludge taken from an anaerobic bioreactor treating dmf containing wastewater at initial mlss of 2 0 g l 1 cylindrical suspended carriers made of high density polyethylene with the specific surface area of 820 m2 m 3 were used for the immobilization of microorganisms in both reactors mechanical stirrers were used to ensure the carriers and synthetic wastewater were in full contact the ph was monitored and kept constant through probes linked to the online real time control device with the automatic addition of 1 m hcl solution both reactors were maintained at 30 1 using water jacket throughout the entire operational period the synthetic wastewater was prepared as follows 7 mm phosphate buffer kh2po4 and na2hpo4 ph 7 0 0 05 g l 1 cacl2 0 1 g l 1 mgso4 7h2o and 10 ml l 1 trace element solution wang et al 2018a dmf was added at desired concentration and nitrate was added at dmf nitrate molar ratio of 0 8 before use the synthetic wastewater was purged with nitrogen gas for 20 min to remove dissolved oxygen followed by autoclaving at 121 for 20 min 2 2 reactor operation the experimental period of the anoxic denitrification reactor and the control reactor was divided into five phases and the operational conditions for each phase were summarized in table 1 in phase i i e start up period in order to confirm the key role of nitrate in dmf biodegradation both reactors were operated in parallel for 30 days with influent dmf concentration increased from 4 10 mm to 6 84 mm while hrt was maintained at 24 h resulting in dmf loading rate increased gradually from 2 05 mol m 3 d 1 to 3 42 mol m 3 d 1 in order to create denitrification environment nitrate was dosed into the anoxic denitrification reactor at dosage of 4 40 mol m 3 d 1 in phase ii in order to examine the ability of both reactors when suffering from high strength dmf loading influent dmf concentration was increased from 6 84 mm to 68 41 mm while hrt was controlled at 24 h resulting in dmf loading rate increased from 3 42 mol m 3 d 1 to 34 20 mol m 3 d 1 in phase iii the effect of hrt on reactor performance was investigated with hrt ranged from 96 to 24 h influent dmf concentration and ph was controlled at 68 41 mm and 7 0 respectively in phase iv influent ph was ranged from 6 0 to 8 0 via adjusting the proportion of kh2po4 and na2hpo4 in order to investigate the effect of ph on reactor performance the influent dmf concentration dmf loading rate and hrt were maintained at 6 84 mm 3 42 mol m 3 d 1 and 24 h respectively in phase v both reactors were operated at dmf loading rate of 20 52 mol m 3 d 1 for 60 days to evaluate the systems stability of both reactors while influent dmf concentration the influent ph and hrt were maintained at 41 05 mm 7 0 and 24 h respectively 2 3 analytical methods before analysis all water samples taken from both reactors were immediately filtered through 0 22 μm syringe filters dmf was identified and quantified using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc dad 3000 thermo scientific usa hplc analysis was performed using a c18 column 5 μm 4 6 250 mm at column temperature of 30 and uv vis wavelength of 205 nm the mobile phase was 15 methanol and 85 ultrapure water v v which was pumped at the flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 toc concentration was determined on vario toc analyzer germany elementar no3 n no2 n and nh4 n concentrations were measured according to previous study hou et al 2018 high throughput sequencing analysis was carried out to investigate the microbial community structures in both reactors after reaching a stable performance during the long term operation water samples were taken from both reactors to analyze microbial community structures and a sample collected from original inoculum for sequencing as a comparison the bacterial 16s rrna gene amplification and sequencing were performed in novogene bioinforatics technology co ltd beijing china the v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified using universal primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 pcr product was sequenced on an ion s5 xl platform according to standard protocols the data analysis was performed in accordance to chen et al 2019 2 4 transcriptomic sequencing transcriptomic analysis was performed to investigate the transcriptional profiles of functional microorganisms in the control rector and anoxic denitrification reactor after the long term operation the samples selected for transcriptome sequencing were taken from the control reactor and anoxic denitrification reactor in phase v subsequently all samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 for rna extraction transcript assembly and annotation before proceeding with the assembly sequenced reads were cleaned up from raw reads by removing reads with 1 sequence adapters 50 bp bases in each read 2 low quality reads 20 bases of q score and 3 poly n containing reads 5 of nucleotides in each read clean reads were assembled into unigenes by trinity platform the assembled unigenes were annotated using blastp searching in nr databases at e value 10 5 transcriptomic data analysis to analyze the differences in gene expression between the control reactor and anoxic denitrification reactor gene expression levels were analyzed by rsem using fragments per kilobase per million fragments fpkm method the quantification of differential gene expression was performed by edger software genes with absolute values of log2 fold change 1 and false discovery rate fdr 0 05 were considered as significantly differential expressed genes degs furthermore functional enrichment analysis such as go gene ontology and kegg kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes which was widely used to identify the biological function of degs and the metabolic pathways or signal transduction pathways associated with the degs wan et al 2019 was used to the classify function of degs with q value 0 05 were considered as significant enriched pathways besides transcriptomic sequences were submitted to ncbi s sequence read archive sra under the bioproject accession number prjna628882 2 5 key enzyme activity assay nadh and atp contents for the analysis of key enzyme activities water samples were taken from both anoxic denitrification system and anaerobic control system during long term period water samples were pretreated according to su et al 2019 with minor modification briefly 10 ml water sample was harvested by centrifugation at 2000 g at 4 for 5 min subsequently the sediment was washed three times with 10 ml 85 nacl solution and then resuspended in 10 ml 85 nacl solution at 4 for cell breaking the suspension was further treated by sonication for 10 min at 4 then the supernatant was harvested by centrifugation at 10 000 g 4 for 10 min and was immediately used to measure key enzymatic activities tetramethylbenzidine tmb chromogenic method was used to determine dmfase activity by measuring the absorbance of tmb at 450 nm after chromogenic reaction which showed positive correlation with the activity of dmfase similarly dimethylamine dehydrogenase dadh methylamine dehydrogenase madh formaldehyde dehydrogenase fdh and formic acid dehydrogenase fadh were analyzed based on the corresponding enzyme linked immunoassay kit 96t jingkang biological china the activities of four denitrifying enzymes namely nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nir nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrous oxide reductase n2or were analyzed using the corresponding denitrifying enzyme linked immunoassay kit 96t jingkang biological china lactate dehydrogenase ldh activity nadh electron carrier and atp energy source contents were determined by the corresponding enzyme linked immunoassay kits 48t jingkang biological china 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced dmf biodegradation in denitrification system during 30 days start up period dmf removal efficiency in the anoxic denitrification system rapidly increased from 75 3 2 3 on day 3 to 99 3 1 5 on day 8 at dmf loading rate of 2 05 mol m 3 d 1 fig 1 a thereafter dmf removal efficiency was kept higher than 98 in the following 22 days despite of further increase of influent dmf concentration up to 6 84 mm however the removal efficiency of dmf in the control system was always in the low range of 45 60 even at the low influent dmf concentration of 4 10 mm in addition more than 95 of toc could be removed in the anoxic denitrification system while it was only around 40 in the control reactor fig 1b suggesting almost complete mineralization of dmf could be achieved in the anoxic denitrification system similar phenomenon was also observed in previous study where the biodegradation of recalcitrant pyridine could be enhanced in the anoxic system at the presence of nitrate shen et al 2015 wang et al 2019 found that the supplementation of nitrate into anoxic system resulted in complete removal of 5 mm n methylpyrrolidone by paracoccus within incubation time as short as 11 h as compared to the removal efficiency as low as 24 in the anaerobic control system in the absence of nitrate specially no3 n was well removed along with dmf biodegradation in the anoxic denitrification system as indicated by effluent no3 n concentration decreased gradually from 0 66 0 18 mm on day 5 to 0 08 0 12 mm on day 9 and then kept below 0 04 mm in the following 21 days fig 1c no2 n concentration within the first 5 days was much higher than those in the following 25 days probably due to the unavailable of efficient electron donor li et al 2017 the formation of nh4 n was a key evidence for dmf mineralization since previous studies demonstrated that nitrogen in nitrogen containing compounds was usually transformed into nh4 n during biodegradation process kong et al 2018a wang et al 2018a jiang et al 2018 however nh4 n concentration in the effluent after day 17 only accounted for 62 9 4 1 of the nitrogen in influent dmf probably due to the consumption of nitrogen in dmf as nutrient substance for cell growth during microbial metabolism wang et al 2019 additionally both nh4 release and microbial denitrification were often accompanied by the increase of ph values fig 1d qian et al 2019 in order to keep ph constant hcl solution should be added into the anoxic denitrification system continuously confirming the occurrence of basicity producing reactions such as microbial denitrification and nh4 release in this study dmf biodegradation products in both anoxic denitrification system and anaerobic control system were identified using hplc analysis as shown in fig 2 for the anaerobic control system two new peaks were observed at retention time of 3 023 min and 3 527 min fig 2b which could be assigned to dimethylamine dma and formic acid respectively through comparison with the standards fig 2d in the effluent of the anaerobic control system the corresponding concentrations of dmf dma and formic acid were 3 76 0 25 mm 1 84 0 16 mm and 0 27 0 18 mm respectively indicating the obvious accumulation of intermediates such as dma and formic acid however only trace dma and formic acid could be observed for the effluent of anoxic denitrification system with their concentrations well below 0 25 mm and 0 15 mm respectively fig 2c compared to the anaerobic control system not only dmf depletion but also intermediates removal was substantially enhanced in the anoxic denitrification system due to the key role of nitrate as the electron acceptor wang et al 2019 kong et al 2018a and sanjeevkumar et al 2013 also found that dma and formic acid were the main intermediates involved in dmf biodegradation process therefore it could be speculated that hydrolysis was the initial step in dmf biodegradation process with dma and formic acid formed through this hydrolysis reaction dma could be converted to the downstream intermediate namely mono methylamine mma which could be further transformed to formic acid zhao et al 2018 sanjeevkumar et al 2013 kong et al 2018a nh4 could be released from mma via the cleavage of cn bond with the simultaneous generation of formaldehyde zhao et al 2018 however formaldehyde was not observed in this study probably due to its fast transformation into formic acid the intermediates such as formaldehyde and formic acid could be well utilized as the electron donors for microbial denitrification eiroa et al 2005 and 2007 found that simultaneous formaldehyde biodegradation and denitrification could be achieved in anoxic batch assays and continuous anoxic reactor even at different formaldehyde loading rates smith et al 2001 found that formic acid could serve as the electron donor to remediate nitrate contaminant under anoxic environment with the produced nitrite completely removed in the denitrification process based on the above analysis about dmf depletion toc decrease no3 n depletion no2 n formation nh4 release ph increase as well as the identification of biodegradation intermediates during simultaneous dmf biodegradation and denitrification it could be inferred that dmf could be mineralized in the anoxic denitrification system 3 2 the effect of key operational parameters 3 2 1 influent dmf concentration as shown in fig 3 a with the increase of influent dmf concentration from 6 84 mm to 13 68 mm dmf and toc removal efficiencies at hrt of 24 h and dmf nitrate molar ratio of 0 8 were as high as 99 2 2 0 and 96 1 1 9 respectively confirming the excellent dmf removal performance in the anoxic denitrification system however as influent dmf concentration further increased to 27 36 mm both dmf removal and toc removal efficiencies were firstly slightly decreased but then gradually recovered to 96 5 3 2 and 87 4 2 1 after day 85 even when influent dmf concentration further increased to 41 05 mm however when influent dmf concentration further increased to 54 73 mm and 68 41 mm dmf removal efficiency was sharply dropped to 81 3 3 7 and 68 5 2 3 respectively which could be attributed to the toxicity exerted by dmf at high concentration similarly no3 n reduction efficiency was always above 98 with the increase of influent dmf concentration from 6 84 mm to 41 05 mm but then decreased to 75 3 5 2 when the influent dmf concentration increased to 68 41 mm hou et al 2018 also indicated that both pyridine removal and denitrification were severely inhibited at high pyridine loading rate which could be attributed to microbial growth and activity repressed by the toxic substrate at high concentration 3 2 2 hrt it was well known that hrt is an important parameter for the bioprocess because the removal efficiency of various pollutants is associated with hrt closely wu et al 2018 as shown in fig 3b the anoxic denitrification reactor showed a stable performance in terms of dmf and toc removal efficiencies when hrt was varied within the range of 96 72 h however with the decrease of hrt to 48 h both dmf removal and toc removal efficiencies were sharply declined to 87 2 3 1 and 81 4 2 2 respectively further decrease of hrt to 24 h caused a significant deterioration of reactor performance in the anoxic denitrification system in terms of dmf removal and toc removal correspondingly with the decrease of hrt from 96 to 48 h no3 n removal efficiencies decreased from 99 3 2 1 to 90 1 3 4 at short hrt of 24 h abundant residual of no3 n was observed in the effluent this phenomenon could be attributed to the low denitrification rate when recalcitrant substrate was used as the sole electron donor shen et al 2015 therefore for the operation of the anoxic denitrification system relatively long hrt should be adopted when low quality carbon source such as dmf was used 3 2 3 influent ph for the biodegradation of various xenobiotics such as dmf under anoxic condition ph value in the incubation system plays an important role as both contaminant biodegradation and denitrification could be dramatically affected by incubation ph shen et al 2015 during phase iv in order to investigate the effect of influent ph on dmf biodegradation the influent ph was ranged from 6 0 to 8 0 as shown in fig 3c dmf removal and toc removal efficiencies were increased from 84 0 2 5 and 75 3 1 9 to 99 1 3 3 and 91 4 4 6 with the increase of the influent ph from 6 0 to 7 0 but were sharply decreased when the influent ph value further increased to 8 0 obvious deterioration of the reactor performance was observed when the influent ph value was maintained at 8 0 for 10 days which could be attributed to the inhibition of the bacterial community under the alkalescent condition wu et al 2019 nisha et al 2015 in addition under the alkalescent condition the occurrence of basicity producing reactions would be inhibited including dmf biodegradation and denitrification similarly optimal no3 n removal was also achieved at ph of 7 0 with the residual no3 n well maintained below 0 02 mm from these results it could be concluded that dmf biodegradation toc removal and denitrification were optimal at neutral condition which was also observed in tricyclazole biodegradation system wu et al 2018 3 3 long term stability long term performance is one of the major concerns regarding the practical application of the anoxic denitrification system developed for the treatment of dmf wastewater kong et al 2019a to assess the stability of the anoxic denitrification system during the long term operation the anoxic denitrification reactor was operated continuously from day 161 to day 220 at high dmf concentration of 41 05 mm as shown in fig s2 complete removal of dmf was maintained in the anoxic denitrification reactor while toc removal efficiency increased gradually from 90 1 2 5 on day 161 to 98 2 2 6 on day 220 correspondingly no3 n removal efficiency was well above 98 from day 161 to day 220 indicating the stable performance of microbial denitrification similar to phase i i e start up period nh4 n concentration in the effluent was always below 27 mm only accounting for 65 1 3 5 of the nitrogen in dmf in the influent probably due to the consumption of nh4 n in biosynthetic process wang et al 2019 these results further confirmed that the stable long term performance could be achieved in the anoxic denitrification reactor even under high dmf loading rate suggesting that the practical application of the anoxic denitrification system would be technically feasible for the treatment of dmf containing wastewater 3 4 microbial community analysis high throughput sequencing technology was employed to analyze the microbial community diversity and structure after the long term operation table s1 listed the parameters associated with microbial community diversity compared to the original inoculum sludge long term adaption to high strength dmf containing wastewater caused obvious decrease in microbial richness and diversity which was reflected by the lower chao and shannon index this result indicated that the metabolism of bacterial community sensitive to the toxicity of dmf could be inhibited chen et al 2019 in addition the principal component analysis pca based on the sequencing data indicated that the microbial populations have been significantly changed in both control reactor and anoxic denitrification reactor after the long term operation fig s3 compared with the initial inoculum kong et al 2019a also indicated that the presence of recalcitrant substrates such as dmf induced microbial selection in the anaerobic treatment system resulting into the reduced community diversity it was well known that microbial community structure played an important role in developing a successful biological system for treatment of various contaminants wu et al 2019 as shown in fig s4 the community structure analysis at the class level showed that gammaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria bacteroidia bacilli planctomycetacia ignavibacteria and clostridia were the major classes in the inoculum sludge accounting for 55 13 22 31 15 99 1 76 1 16 1 09 and 0 51 respectively after the long term acclimatization of high strength dmf the microbial community structure was varied obviously the abundance of alphaproteobacteria anoxic denitrification reactor 68 15 control reactor 78 39 was significantly increased in both reactors indicating the enrichment of the bacteria within this class however the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria the most dominant member in the inoculum sharply dropped to 21 11 in the anoxic denitrification reactor and 4 71 in the control reactor respectively indicating the inhibition of gammaproteobacteria by the toxicity of dmf the abundances of the classes namely bacteroidia bacilli planctomycetacia and ignavibacteria also obviously decreased under the selective pressure caused by the recalcitrant dmf the bacterial community at genus level indicated that paracoccus 18 40 arenimonas 15 93 hyphomicrobium 14 41 aquamicrobium 12 50 brevundimonas 7 72 methylopila 5 47 chryseobacterium 5 02 bosea 3 26 and brucella 2 40 were dominant in the anoxic denitrification reactor compared with the control reactor fig 4 paracoccus which was the most abundant species in the anoxic denitrification reactor could degrade dmf efficiently by producing the hydrolytic enzyme zhou et al 2018 kong et al 2019a 2019b hou et al 2018 and liu et al 2012 found that paracoccus was capable of denitrifying using recalcitrant contaminants as the electron donor the genus arenimonas was an excellent denitrifier which was documented to has ability of degrading refractory organics with carbon dioxide as the major product in the denitrification system even under a low cod n condition xing et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 the high abundance of arenimonas in the anoxic denitrification reactor might be account for the enhanced bio mineralization of dmf hyphomicrobium was reported to be a typical methylotrophic bacterium capable of denitrifying could use nitrogenous pollutants such as dimethyl sulfoxide as the sole carbon source supporting microbial denitrification martineau et al 2015 murakami nitta et al 2002 tairo et al 1996 sperl et al 1971 aquamicrobium has reported to be involved in the oxidation of low quality alkanes in the presence of high saline and high concentration of nitrate chang et al 2015 wang et al 2015a brevundimonas a member of the class alphaproteobacteria was reported to be mainly responsible for biotransformation of various complex substrates via hydrolysis xu et al 2019 lee et al 2010 liang et al 2010 methylopila which was a methylotrophic species might be responsible for the oxidation of dmf via demethylation pathway wang et al 2015b chryseobacterium was found to be involved in the hydrolysis of highly toxic acyl containing contaminants while the intermediates could be further degraded during biodegradation process guo et al 2008 gurav et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 rashid et al 2011 the genus brucella could metabolize various complex substrates muthukumar et al 2003 bosea was frequently observed in sewage effluent contaminated by hydrocarbons showing excellent performance in terms of efficiently remove nitrate and organics simultaneously in the denitrification system lu et al 2017 al mailem et al 2014 zeng et al 2019 in comparison to the anaerobic control reactor the growth of hydrolytic species paracoccus brevundimonas and chryseobacterium and denitrification related species paracoccus arenimonas hyphomicrobium aquamicrobium and bosea was distinctly promoted in the anoxic denitrification reactor after the long term acclimatization of high strength dmf the enrichment of these functional species would be contributed to the enhanced dmf biodegradation mineralization and nitrate reduction in the anoxic denitrification reactor 3 5 transcriptomic analysis and enzyme activity assay in order to explore the effect of microbial denitrification on dmf metabolism the differential genes expression in the anoxic denitrification system and control system were analyzed by rna sequencing compared with the control system a total of 1127 differential expressed genes degs in the anoxic denitrification system were significantly upregulated fig s5 significantly enriched go terms q value 0 05 were related to carbohydrate transport carbohydrate transmembrane transporter activity cellular aldehyde metabolic process hydrolase activity organic acid metabolic process small molecule metabolic process and transferase activity transferring nitrogenous groups fig s6 the upregulated expression of various transmembrane transporters and transferase might be beneficial for dmf diffusion into intracell during dmf metabolism since most of transmembrane transporters could transport various substrate binding proteins such as atp binding cassette transporter lu et al 2019 chang et al 2009 through kegg analysis enrich of these upregulated degs were related to microbial metabolism and energy metabolism including carbon metabolism ko01200 amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism ko00520 fatty acid degradation ko00071 biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids ko01040 nitrogen metabolism ko00910 fatty acid metabolism ko01212 and ribosome ko03010 fig s7 these results indicated that substantial stimulation on cellular regulation and microbial metabolism could be achieved in the anoxic denitrification system interestingly we also found that the key genes encoding lactate dehydrogenases ldh which was reported as an indicator of cell structure damage wan et al 2016 were significantly downregulated in the anoxic denitrification system compared to the control system without nitrate fig 5 a importantly the result of enzymatic activity assay was perfectly agreed with the gene expression level where the catalytic activity of ldh in the control reactor was 58 higher than that in the anoxic denitrification reactor fig 5b upregulated genes responsible for the release of ldh in the control reactor suggested that the high strength dmf loading had significant effects on cell structures thereby possibly causing the death of partial cells high strength organic solvents such as 1 methoxy 2 propanol and methanol would result into the reduced extracellular polymeric substances in bio aggregate and the disintegration of granules which was adverse for the stability of biological wastewater treatment system lafita et al 2015 lu et al 2015 in this study the poor performance of the control reactor could be partially attributed to the damage of cell structure and sludge structure at the presence of more residual dmf considering the fact that dmf was poorly removed in the control reactor torres et al 2018 on the contrary the upregulation of the genes responsible for dna repair was observed in the anoxic denitrification reactor fig s6 fig s7 which was beneficial for the maintenance of long term operation stability 3 6 mechanism dominating dmf biodegradation and denitrification in this study the highly toxic and recalcitrant dmf was efficiently utilized as the electron donor for microbial denitrification even at high dmf loading rate microbial denitrification needs to consume electrons to accomplish thoroughly reduction of no3 n to n2 providing the electron pools for the biodegradation of organic matters such as dmf the available of electron acceptor such as nitrate would be contributed to the enhanced biodegradation of organic contaminants through the rapid consumption of electrons wan et al 2016 for the first time the present study proved that simultaneous dmf biodegradation and microbial denitrification was technically feasible it was well known that biological denitrification occurs intracellularly through the sequent biological reductions of no3 n to no2 n and finally to n2 fig 6 a which were catalyzed by four essential denitrifying enzymes namely nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nir nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrous oxide reductase n2or wan et al 2016 wang et al 2019 by transcriptional analysis we found that the gene expression level involved in these denitrifying enzymes including quinone nitrate reductase ec 1 7 5 1 periplasmic nitrate reductase napa ec 1 7 99 4 and nitrite reductase ec 1 7 2 1 were significantly upregulated in the anoxic denitrification reactor whereas no significant variation was observed for nor and n2or fig 6b su et al 2019 has reported that both nor and n2or were freely distributed in periplasm which were more easily affected by the toxic dmf as compared to nar and nir moreover it should be noted that nitrate nitrite transporter nrt had a much higher expression level fig s8 which was rather beneficial for denitrification the results of enzymatic activity assay illustrated in fig 6c verified our speculation where the catalytic activities of nar and nir in the anoxic denitrification system were higher than those in the control system based on the analysis of dmf biodegradation products hydrolysis and oxidation were the major processes account for dmf metabolism in the anoxic denitrification system the abundance of the gene responsible for dmf hydrolysis was 5 6 fold of that in the control system fig 6d indicating that the presence of nitrate could significantly fastened the hydrolysis of dmf which was reported to occur intracellularly lu et al 2019 the gene expression of formate dehydrogenase fdh was remarkably upregulated in the anoxic denitrification reactor as compared to the control reactor correspondingly the activities of several key functional enzymes in the anoxic denitrification system including n n dimethylformamidase dmfase ec 3 5 1 56 dimethylamine dehydrogenase dmdh ec 1 5 8 2 formaldehyde dehydrogenase fadh ec 1 2 1 46 and formate dehydrogenase fdh ec 1 2 1 2 was obviously higher than those in the control system fig 6e during dmf biodegradation the step of dmf to dma catalyzed by dmfase was rather critical because it directly linked to dmf utilization rate the dehydrogenases such as fdh was rather crucial for the oxidative degradation of the intermediates such as dma mma formaldehyde and formic acid which was beneficial for the providing of electrons for microbial denitrification particularly fdh was responsible for catalyzing formic acid into co2 and h2o with electron and energy produced simultaneously wang et al 2019 both high gene expression and high fdh activity demonstrated that dmf could be oxidized into co2 to provide electron and energy for microbial denitrification since formic acid was the main intermediates during dmf biodegradation in the anoxic denitrification system these results further indicated that the occurrence of denitrification not only enhanced dmf hydrolysis but also facilitated dmf bio mineralization which was consistent with the high toc removal and nh4 n release nadh which is generated during the biodegradation of various organics can be used as the direct electron donor for biological reduction reactions including microbial denitrification su et al 2019 in organisms tricarboxylic acid tca cycle is the final pathway for the decomposition of major nutrients such as carbohydrates lipids and amino acids zhang et al 2018 in general more atp could be produced in denitrification bioprocess than anaerobic bioprocess due to the fact that organic substrate could be more effectively metabolized by denitrifier to provide electron and energy for nitrate reduction wan et al 2019 in this study the contents of nadh and atp in the anoxic denitrification reactor were much higher than those in the control reactor as shown in fig 6f however it was found that the upregulation of the expression level of the gene responsible for tca cycle were insignificant in the anoxic denitrification reactor table s2 since the gene expression variation of key enzymes related to conventional energy metabolism was negligible nitrate might play a key role in enhancing the catabolism of dmf and its derivatives to provide electron and energy for supporting microbial denitrification rather than the conventional tca cycle pathway in this study 4 conclusion this study demonstrated the feasibility of the anoxic denitrification system for the treatment of high strength dmf containing wastewater dmf could be completely removed at dmf loading rate as high as 20 52 mol m 3 d 1 our results found that the occurrence of denitrification not only improved the biodegradation capability of specific functional microorganisms but also promoted carbon source utilization to produce electron and energy in summary this is the first study for exploring the effect of microbial denitrification on dmf biodegradation at microbial metabolism and transcriptional level which provides a new insight for developing efficient and

17520,due to highly recalcitrant and toxicological nature of n n dimethylformamide dmf efficient removal of dmf is challenging for biological wastewater treatment in this study an anoxic denitrification system was developed and continuously operated for 220 days in order to verify the enhanced dmf biodegradation mechanism as high as 41 05 mm dmf could be thoroughly removed in the anoxic denitrification reactor at hydraulic residence time hrt of 24 h while the total organic carbon toc and nitrate removal efficiencies were as high as 95 7 2 5 and 98 4 1 1 respectively microbial community analyses indicated that the species related to dmf hydrolysis paracoccus brevundimonas and chryseobacterium and denitrification paracoccus arenimonas hyphomicrobium aquamicrobium and bosea were effectively enriched in the anoxic denitrification system transcriptional analysis coupled with enzymatic activity assay indicated that both hydrolysis and mineralization of dmf were largely enhanced in the anoxic denitrification system moreover the occurrence of microbial denitrification distinctly facilitated carbon source utilization to produce electron and energy which was rather beneficial for better reactor performance this study demonstrated that the anoxic denitrification system would be a potential alternative for efficient treatment of wastewater polluted by recalcitrant pollutants such as dmf graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords n n dimethylformamide bio mineralization microbial denitrification transcriptional analysis functional genes 1 introduction n n dimethylformamide dmf ch3 2ncho an anthropogenic organic polar solvent has been widely employed in chemical pharmaceutical and textile industries because it is miscible with water and a wide variety of organic matters kong et al 2018a zhao et al 2018 with the increasing production and consumption of dmf wastewater containing dmf will be inevitably released into the environment välitalo et al 2017 torres et al 2018 prasse et al 2015 it was estimated that more than 5000 tons of dmf was discharged or transferred into the environment every year via the discharge of wastewater from related industries kong et al 2018a dmf displays adverse impacts on human health and environmental quality due to its numerous toxic effects such as embryotoxicity hepatotoxicity teratogenicity and carcinogenicity swaroop et al 2009 kumar et al 2012 moreover dmf is rather persistent in natural environment because of its thermal stability kong et al 2018a accordingly there is an urgent need to develop high efficient and environmental friendly methods to remove dmf from wastewater although various physico chemical methods such as advanced oxidation process sun et al 2008 photodegradation zhao et al 2018 membrane separation das et al 2006 and physical adsorption ye et al 2013 are available for dmf removal from contaminated wastewater biological treatment has turned out to be a favorable alternative because of its merits such as low cost and environmental friendliness kong et al 2018a swaroop et al 2009 kumar et al 2012 to date dmf biodegradation under aerobic condition has been extensively investigated swaroop et al 2009 zhou et al 2018 some species such as paracoccus nisha et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 ochrobactrum veeranagouda et al 2006 and alcaligenes hasegawa et al 1997 were found to be capable of degrading dmf under aerobic condition however the application of aerobic process was often limited by high aeration costs and disgusting smell caused by bubble aeration therefore dmf biodegradation under anaerobic condition has attracted increasing interests in recent years kong et al 2018a and 2018b unfortunately due to the poor biodegradability and high toxicity of dmf yang et al 2014 rahmaninezhad et al 2016 the conventional anaerobic process is usually limited by low removal efficiency and poor process stability kong et al 2018a hasegawa et al 1997 bromley challenor et al 2000b recently enhanced biodegradation of several recalcitrant pollutants including dimethyl phthalate zhang et al 2016 phenol ramos et al 2016 triclosan wang et al 2018b and pyridine hou et al 2018 at the presence of alternative electron acceptor such as nitrate has been demonstrated it was well known that the electrons and energy which could be produced by carbon metabolism were required in microbial denitrification in order to complete biological reduction of nitrate to n2 zheng et al 2014 electron acceptors such as nitrate could act as the electron pools which might be contributed to the enhanced biodegradation of various organic contaminants wang et al 2019 su et al 2019 electron production and consumption plays a crucial role in both carbon metabolism and denitrification therefore promotion of biodegradation efficiency towards various recalcitrant contaminants in the anoxic denitrification system is attracting increasing attention wang et al 2019 hou et al 2018 shen et al 2015 in addition predenitrification based on anoxic and aerobic process a o process was often used for the treatment of chemical wastewater containing various recalcitrant contaminants while the electron acceptor such as nitrate could be easily formed in the subsequent aerobic nitrification system hou et al 2018 wu et al 2019 it would be rather interesting that if the nitrate produced from the aerobic process could be removed through microbial denitrification in the anoxic reactors with recalcitrant compounds partially removed simultaneously however to our best knowledge information on the feasibility of dmf biodegradation in the anoxic denitrification system especially in the long term operation is still unclear bromley challenor et al 2000a furthermore several key insights into anoxic dmf biodegradation including the underlying metabolic mechanism dominating dmf biodegradation and denitrification the evolution of community structure key functional enzymes and electron transport pathway were deserved to be investigated in order to develop an efficient strategy for the treatment of dmf containing wastewater therefore in this study the promotion of dmf biodegradation at the presence of nitrate was verified during long term operation the effects of various operational factors including initial dmf concentration hydraulic retention time hrt and influent ph on reactor performance were investigated additionally the microbial community structures involved in dmf biodegradation were explored to further understand the role of nitrate on the enrichment of specific functional microorganisms finally transcriptional analysis the key enzymatic activity assays nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh and adenosine triphosphate atp content tests were performed to reveal and verify the proposed microbial metabolic mechanism involving dmf biodegradation and denitrification 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and synthetic wastewater in order to verify the positive effect of nitrate towards dmf biodegradation two identical tubular reactors fig s1 with working volume of 2 0 l were operated in parallel one of the reactors fed with synthetic wastewater with the addition of nitrate was named after the anoxic denitrification reactor while the other one fed with synthetic wastewater without the addition of nitrate was named after the anaerobic control reactor both reactors were inoculated with the sludge taken from an anaerobic bioreactor treating dmf containing wastewater at initial mlss of 2 0 g l 1 cylindrical suspended carriers made of high density polyethylene with the specific surface area of 820 m2 m 3 were used for the immobilization of microorganisms in both reactors mechanical stirrers were used to ensure the carriers and synthetic wastewater were in full contact the ph was monitored and kept constant through probes linked to the online real time control device with the automatic addition of 1 m hcl solution both reactors were maintained at 30 1 using water jacket throughout the entire operational period the synthetic wastewater was prepared as follows 7 mm phosphate buffer kh2po4 and na2hpo4 ph 7 0 0 05 g l 1 cacl2 0 1 g l 1 mgso4 7h2o and 10 ml l 1 trace element solution wang et al 2018a dmf was added at desired concentration and nitrate was added at dmf nitrate molar ratio of 0 8 before use the synthetic wastewater was purged with nitrogen gas for 20 min to remove dissolved oxygen followed by autoclaving at 121 for 20 min 2 2 reactor operation the experimental period of the anoxic denitrification reactor and the control reactor was divided into five phases and the operational conditions for each phase were summarized in table 1 in phase i i e start up period in order to confirm the key role of nitrate in dmf biodegradation both reactors were operated in parallel for 30 days with influent dmf concentration increased from 4 10 mm to 6 84 mm while hrt was maintained at 24 h resulting in dmf loading rate increased gradually from 2 05 mol m 3 d 1 to 3 42 mol m 3 d 1 in order to create denitrification environment nitrate was dosed into the anoxic denitrification reactor at dosage of 4 40 mol m 3 d 1 in phase ii in order to examine the ability of both reactors when suffering from high strength dmf loading influent dmf concentration was increased from 6 84 mm to 68 41 mm while hrt was controlled at 24 h resulting in dmf loading rate increased from 3 42 mol m 3 d 1 to 34 20 mol m 3 d 1 in phase iii the effect of hrt on reactor performance was investigated with hrt ranged from 96 to 24 h influent dmf concentration and ph was controlled at 68 41 mm and 7 0 respectively in phase iv influent ph was ranged from 6 0 to 8 0 via adjusting the proportion of kh2po4 and na2hpo4 in order to investigate the effect of ph on reactor performance the influent dmf concentration dmf loading rate and hrt were maintained at 6 84 mm 3 42 mol m 3 d 1 and 24 h respectively in phase v both reactors were operated at dmf loading rate of 20 52 mol m 3 d 1 for 60 days to evaluate the systems stability of both reactors while influent dmf concentration the influent ph and hrt were maintained at 41 05 mm 7 0 and 24 h respectively 2 3 analytical methods before analysis all water samples taken from both reactors were immediately filtered through 0 22 μm syringe filters dmf was identified and quantified using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc dad 3000 thermo scientific usa hplc analysis was performed using a c18 column 5 μm 4 6 250 mm at column temperature of 30 and uv vis wavelength of 205 nm the mobile phase was 15 methanol and 85 ultrapure water v v which was pumped at the flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 toc concentration was determined on vario toc analyzer germany elementar no3 n no2 n and nh4 n concentrations were measured according to previous study hou et al 2018 high throughput sequencing analysis was carried out to investigate the microbial community structures in both reactors after reaching a stable performance during the long term operation water samples were taken from both reactors to analyze microbial community structures and a sample collected from original inoculum for sequencing as a comparison the bacterial 16s rrna gene amplification and sequencing were performed in novogene bioinforatics technology co ltd beijing china the v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified using universal primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 pcr product was sequenced on an ion s5 xl platform according to standard protocols the data analysis was performed in accordance to chen et al 2019 2 4 transcriptomic sequencing transcriptomic analysis was performed to investigate the transcriptional profiles of functional microorganisms in the control rector and anoxic denitrification reactor after the long term operation the samples selected for transcriptome sequencing were taken from the control reactor and anoxic denitrification reactor in phase v subsequently all samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 for rna extraction transcript assembly and annotation before proceeding with the assembly sequenced reads were cleaned up from raw reads by removing reads with 1 sequence adapters 50 bp bases in each read 2 low quality reads 20 bases of q score and 3 poly n containing reads 5 of nucleotides in each read clean reads were assembled into unigenes by trinity platform the assembled unigenes were annotated using blastp searching in nr databases at e value 10 5 transcriptomic data analysis to analyze the differences in gene expression between the control reactor and anoxic denitrification reactor gene expression levels were analyzed by rsem using fragments per kilobase per million fragments fpkm method the quantification of differential gene expression was performed by edger software genes with absolute values of log2 fold change 1 and false discovery rate fdr 0 05 were considered as significantly differential expressed genes degs furthermore functional enrichment analysis such as go gene ontology and kegg kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes which was widely used to identify the biological function of degs and the metabolic pathways or signal transduction pathways associated with the degs wan et al 2019 was used to the classify function of degs with q value 0 05 were considered as significant enriched pathways besides transcriptomic sequences were submitted to ncbi s sequence read archive sra under the bioproject accession number prjna628882 2 5 key enzyme activity assay nadh and atp contents for the analysis of key enzyme activities water samples were taken from both anoxic denitrification system and anaerobic control system during long term period water samples were pretreated according to su et al 2019 with minor modification briefly 10 ml water sample was harvested by centrifugation at 2000 g at 4 for 5 min subsequently the sediment was washed three times with 10 ml 85 nacl solution and then resuspended in 10 ml 85 nacl solution at 4 for cell breaking the suspension was further treated by sonication for 10 min at 4 then the supernatant was harvested by centrifugation at 10 000 g 4 for 10 min and was immediately used to measure key enzymatic activities tetramethylbenzidine tmb chromogenic method was used to determine dmfase activity by measuring the absorbance of tmb at 450 nm after chromogenic reaction which showed positive correlation with the activity of dmfase similarly dimethylamine dehydrogenase dadh methylamine dehydrogenase madh formaldehyde dehydrogenase fdh and formic acid dehydrogenase fadh were analyzed based on the corresponding enzyme linked immunoassay kit 96t jingkang biological china the activities of four denitrifying enzymes namely nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nir nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrous oxide reductase n2or were analyzed using the corresponding denitrifying enzyme linked immunoassay kit 96t jingkang biological china lactate dehydrogenase ldh activity nadh electron carrier and atp energy source contents were determined by the corresponding enzyme linked immunoassay kits 48t jingkang biological china 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced dmf biodegradation in denitrification system during 30 days start up period dmf removal efficiency in the anoxic denitrification system rapidly increased from 75 3 2 3 on day 3 to 99 3 1 5 on day 8 at dmf loading rate of 2 05 mol m 3 d 1 fig 1 a thereafter dmf removal efficiency was kept higher than 98 in the following 22 days despite of further increase of influent dmf concentration up to 6 84 mm however the removal efficiency of dmf in the control system was always in the low range of 45 60 even at the low influent dmf concentration of 4 10 mm in addition more than 95 of toc could be removed in the anoxic denitrification system while it was only around 40 in the control reactor fig 1b suggesting almost complete mineralization of dmf could be achieved in the anoxic denitrification system similar phenomenon was also observed in previous study where the biodegradation of recalcitrant pyridine could be enhanced in the anoxic system at the presence of nitrate shen et al 2015 wang et al 2019 found that the supplementation of nitrate into anoxic system resulted in complete removal of 5 mm n methylpyrrolidone by paracoccus within incubation time as short as 11 h as compared to the removal efficiency as low as 24 in the anaerobic control system in the absence of nitrate specially no3 n was well removed along with dmf biodegradation in the anoxic denitrification system as indicated by effluent no3 n concentration decreased gradually from 0 66 0 18 mm on day 5 to 0 08 0 12 mm on day 9 and then kept below 0 04 mm in the following 21 days fig 1c no2 n concentration within the first 5 days was much higher than those in the following 25 days probably due to the unavailable of efficient electron donor li et al 2017 the formation of nh4 n was a key evidence for dmf mineralization since previous studies demonstrated that nitrogen in nitrogen containing compounds was usually transformed into nh4 n during biodegradation process kong et al 2018a wang et al 2018a jiang et al 2018 however nh4 n concentration in the effluent after day 17 only accounted for 62 9 4 1 of the nitrogen in influent dmf probably due to the consumption of nitrogen in dmf as nutrient substance for cell growth during microbial metabolism wang et al 2019 additionally both nh4 release and microbial denitrification were often accompanied by the increase of ph values fig 1d qian et al 2019 in order to keep ph constant hcl solution should be added into the anoxic denitrification system continuously confirming the occurrence of basicity producing reactions such as microbial denitrification and nh4 release in this study dmf biodegradation products in both anoxic denitrification system and anaerobic control system were identified using hplc analysis as shown in fig 2 for the anaerobic control system two new peaks were observed at retention time of 3 023 min and 3 527 min fig 2b which could be assigned to dimethylamine dma and formic acid respectively through comparison with the standards fig 2d in the effluent of the anaerobic control system the corresponding concentrations of dmf dma and formic acid were 3 76 0 25 mm 1 84 0 16 mm and 0 27 0 18 mm respectively indicating the obvious accumulation of intermediates such as dma and formic acid however only trace dma and formic acid could be observed for the effluent of anoxic denitrification system with their concentrations well below 0 25 mm and 0 15 mm respectively fig 2c compared to the anaerobic control system not only dmf depletion but also intermediates removal was substantially enhanced in the anoxic denitrification system due to the key role of nitrate as the electron acceptor wang et al 2019 kong et al 2018a and sanjeevkumar et al 2013 also found that dma and formic acid were the main intermediates involved in dmf biodegradation process therefore it could be speculated that hydrolysis was the initial step in dmf biodegradation process with dma and formic acid formed through this hydrolysis reaction dma could be converted to the downstream intermediate namely mono methylamine mma which could be further transformed to formic acid zhao et al 2018 sanjeevkumar et al 2013 kong et al 2018a nh4 could be released from mma via the cleavage of cn bond with the simultaneous generation of formaldehyde zhao et al 2018 however formaldehyde was not observed in this study probably due to its fast transformation into formic acid the intermediates such as formaldehyde and formic acid could be well utilized as the electron donors for microbial denitrification eiroa et al 2005 and 2007 found that simultaneous formaldehyde biodegradation and denitrification could be achieved in anoxic batch assays and continuous anoxic reactor even at different formaldehyde loading rates smith et al 2001 found that formic acid could serve as the electron donor to remediate nitrate contaminant under anoxic environment with the produced nitrite completely removed in the denitrification process based on the above analysis about dmf depletion toc decrease no3 n depletion no2 n formation nh4 release ph increase as well as the identification of biodegradation intermediates during simultaneous dmf biodegradation and denitrification it could be inferred that dmf could be mineralized in the anoxic denitrification system 3 2 the effect of key operational parameters 3 2 1 influent dmf concentration as shown in fig 3 a with the increase of influent dmf concentration from 6 84 mm to 13 68 mm dmf and toc removal efficiencies at hrt of 24 h and dmf nitrate molar ratio of 0 8 were as high as 99 2 2 0 and 96 1 1 9 respectively confirming the excellent dmf removal performance in the anoxic denitrification system however as influent dmf concentration further increased to 27 36 mm both dmf removal and toc removal efficiencies were firstly slightly decreased but then gradually recovered to 96 5 3 2 and 87 4 2 1 after day 85 even when influent dmf concentration further increased to 41 05 mm however when influent dmf concentration further increased to 54 73 mm and 68 41 mm dmf removal efficiency was sharply dropped to 81 3 3 7 and 68 5 2 3 respectively which could be attributed to the toxicity exerted by dmf at high concentration similarly no3 n reduction efficiency was always above 98 with the increase of influent dmf concentration from 6 84 mm to 41 05 mm but then decreased to 75 3 5 2 when the influent dmf concentration increased to 68 41 mm hou et al 2018 also indicated that both pyridine removal and denitrification were severely inhibited at high pyridine loading rate which could be attributed to microbial growth and activity repressed by the toxic substrate at high concentration 3 2 2 hrt it was well known that hrt is an important parameter for the bioprocess because the removal efficiency of various pollutants is associated with hrt closely wu et al 2018 as shown in fig 3b the anoxic denitrification reactor showed a stable performance in terms of dmf and toc removal efficiencies when hrt was varied within the range of 96 72 h however with the decrease of hrt to 48 h both dmf removal and toc removal efficiencies were sharply declined to 87 2 3 1 and 81 4 2 2 respectively further decrease of hrt to 24 h caused a significant deterioration of reactor performance in the anoxic denitrification system in terms of dmf removal and toc removal correspondingly with the decrease of hrt from 96 to 48 h no3 n removal efficiencies decreased from 99 3 2 1 to 90 1 3 4 at short hrt of 24 h abundant residual of no3 n was observed in the effluent this phenomenon could be attributed to the low denitrification rate when recalcitrant substrate was used as the sole electron donor shen et al 2015 therefore for the operation of the anoxic denitrification system relatively long hrt should be adopted when low quality carbon source such as dmf was used 3 2 3 influent ph for the biodegradation of various xenobiotics such as dmf under anoxic condition ph value in the incubation system plays an important role as both contaminant biodegradation and denitrification could be dramatically affected by incubation ph shen et al 2015 during phase iv in order to investigate the effect of influent ph on dmf biodegradation the influent ph was ranged from 6 0 to 8 0 as shown in fig 3c dmf removal and toc removal efficiencies were increased from 84 0 2 5 and 75 3 1 9 to 99 1 3 3 and 91 4 4 6 with the increase of the influent ph from 6 0 to 7 0 but were sharply decreased when the influent ph value further increased to 8 0 obvious deterioration of the reactor performance was observed when the influent ph value was maintained at 8 0 for 10 days which could be attributed to the inhibition of the bacterial community under the alkalescent condition wu et al 2019 nisha et al 2015 in addition under the alkalescent condition the occurrence of basicity producing reactions would be inhibited including dmf biodegradation and denitrification similarly optimal no3 n removal was also achieved at ph of 7 0 with the residual no3 n well maintained below 0 02 mm from these results it could be concluded that dmf biodegradation toc removal and denitrification were optimal at neutral condition which was also observed in tricyclazole biodegradation system wu et al 2018 3 3 long term stability long term performance is one of the major concerns regarding the practical application of the anoxic denitrification system developed for the treatment of dmf wastewater kong et al 2019a to assess the stability of the anoxic denitrification system during the long term operation the anoxic denitrification reactor was operated continuously from day 161 to day 220 at high dmf concentration of 41 05 mm as shown in fig s2 complete removal of dmf was maintained in the anoxic denitrification reactor while toc removal efficiency increased gradually from 90 1 2 5 on day 161 to 98 2 2 6 on day 220 correspondingly no3 n removal efficiency was well above 98 from day 161 to day 220 indicating the stable performance of microbial denitrification similar to phase i i e start up period nh4 n concentration in the effluent was always below 27 mm only accounting for 65 1 3 5 of the nitrogen in dmf in the influent probably due to the consumption of nh4 n in biosynthetic process wang et al 2019 these results further confirmed that the stable long term performance could be achieved in the anoxic denitrification reactor even under high dmf loading rate suggesting that the practical application of the anoxic denitrification system would be technically feasible for the treatment of dmf containing wastewater 3 4 microbial community analysis high throughput sequencing technology was employed to analyze the microbial community diversity and structure after the long term operation table s1 listed the parameters associated with microbial community diversity compared to the original inoculum sludge long term adaption to high strength dmf containing wastewater caused obvious decrease in microbial richness and diversity which was reflected by the lower chao and shannon index this result indicated that the metabolism of bacterial community sensitive to the toxicity of dmf could be inhibited chen et al 2019 in addition the principal component analysis pca based on the sequencing data indicated that the microbial populations have been significantly changed in both control reactor and anoxic denitrification reactor after the long term operation fig s3 compared with the initial inoculum kong et al 2019a also indicated that the presence of recalcitrant substrates such as dmf induced microbial selection in the anaerobic treatment system resulting into the reduced community diversity it was well known that microbial community structure played an important role in developing a successful biological system for treatment of various contaminants wu et al 2019 as shown in fig s4 the community structure analysis at the class level showed that gammaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria bacteroidia bacilli planctomycetacia ignavibacteria and clostridia were the major classes in the inoculum sludge accounting for 55 13 22 31 15 99 1 76 1 16 1 09 and 0 51 respectively after the long term acclimatization of high strength dmf the microbial community structure was varied obviously the abundance of alphaproteobacteria anoxic denitrification reactor 68 15 control reactor 78 39 was significantly increased in both reactors indicating the enrichment of the bacteria within this class however the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria the most dominant member in the inoculum sharply dropped to 21 11 in the anoxic denitrification reactor and 4 71 in the control reactor respectively indicating the inhibition of gammaproteobacteria by the toxicity of dmf the abundances of the classes namely bacteroidia bacilli planctomycetacia and ignavibacteria also obviously decreased under the selective pressure caused by the recalcitrant dmf the bacterial community at genus level indicated that paracoccus 18 40 arenimonas 15 93 hyphomicrobium 14 41 aquamicrobium 12 50 brevundimonas 7 72 methylopila 5 47 chryseobacterium 5 02 bosea 3 26 and brucella 2 40 were dominant in the anoxic denitrification reactor compared with the control reactor fig 4 paracoccus which was the most abundant species in the anoxic denitrification reactor could degrade dmf efficiently by producing the hydrolytic enzyme zhou et al 2018 kong et al 2019a 2019b hou et al 2018 and liu et al 2012 found that paracoccus was capable of denitrifying using recalcitrant contaminants as the electron donor the genus arenimonas was an excellent denitrifier which was documented to has ability of degrading refractory organics with carbon dioxide as the major product in the denitrification system even under a low cod n condition xing et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 the high abundance of arenimonas in the anoxic denitrification reactor might be account for the enhanced bio mineralization of dmf hyphomicrobium was reported to be a typical methylotrophic bacterium capable of denitrifying could use nitrogenous pollutants such as dimethyl sulfoxide as the sole carbon source supporting microbial denitrification martineau et al 2015 murakami nitta et al 2002 tairo et al 1996 sperl et al 1971 aquamicrobium has reported to be involved in the oxidation of low quality alkanes in the presence of high saline and high concentration of nitrate chang et al 2015 wang et al 2015a brevundimonas a member of the class alphaproteobacteria was reported to be mainly responsible for biotransformation of various complex substrates via hydrolysis xu et al 2019 lee et al 2010 liang et al 2010 methylopila which was a methylotrophic species might be responsible for the oxidation of dmf via demethylation pathway wang et al 2015b chryseobacterium was found to be involved in the hydrolysis of highly toxic acyl containing contaminants while the intermediates could be further degraded during biodegradation process guo et al 2008 gurav et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 rashid et al 2011 the genus brucella could metabolize various complex substrates muthukumar et al 2003 bosea was frequently observed in sewage effluent contaminated by hydrocarbons showing excellent performance in terms of efficiently remove nitrate and organics simultaneously in the denitrification system lu et al 2017 al mailem et al 2014 zeng et al 2019 in comparison to the anaerobic control reactor the growth of hydrolytic species paracoccus brevundimonas and chryseobacterium and denitrification related species paracoccus arenimonas hyphomicrobium aquamicrobium and bosea was distinctly promoted in the anoxic denitrification reactor after the long term acclimatization of high strength dmf the enrichment of these functional species would be contributed to the enhanced dmf biodegradation mineralization and nitrate reduction in the anoxic denitrification reactor 3 5 transcriptomic analysis and enzyme activity assay in order to explore the effect of microbial denitrification on dmf metabolism the differential genes expression in the anoxic denitrification system and control system were analyzed by rna sequencing compared with the control system a total of 1127 differential expressed genes degs in the anoxic denitrification system were significantly upregulated fig s5 significantly enriched go terms q value 0 05 were related to carbohydrate transport carbohydrate transmembrane transporter activity cellular aldehyde metabolic process hydrolase activity organic acid metabolic process small molecule metabolic process and transferase activity transferring nitrogenous groups fig s6 the upregulated expression of various transmembrane transporters and transferase might be beneficial for dmf diffusion into intracell during dmf metabolism since most of transmembrane transporters could transport various substrate binding proteins such as atp binding cassette transporter lu et al 2019 chang et al 2009 through kegg analysis enrich of these upregulated degs were related to microbial metabolism and energy metabolism including carbon metabolism ko01200 amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism ko00520 fatty acid degradation ko00071 biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids ko01040 nitrogen metabolism ko00910 fatty acid metabolism ko01212 and ribosome ko03010 fig s7 these results indicated that substantial stimulation on cellular regulation and microbial metabolism could be achieved in the anoxic denitrification system interestingly we also found that the key genes encoding lactate dehydrogenases ldh which was reported as an indicator of cell structure damage wan et al 2016 were significantly downregulated in the anoxic denitrification system compared to the control system without nitrate fig 5 a importantly the result of enzymatic activity assay was perfectly agreed with the gene expression level where the catalytic activity of ldh in the control reactor was 58 higher than that in the anoxic denitrification reactor fig 5b upregulated genes responsible for the release of ldh in the control reactor suggested that the high strength dmf loading had significant effects on cell structures thereby possibly causing the death of partial cells high strength organic solvents such as 1 methoxy 2 propanol and methanol would result into the reduced extracellular polymeric substances in bio aggregate and the disintegration of granules which was adverse for the stability of biological wastewater treatment system lafita et al 2015 lu et al 2015 in this study the poor performance of the control reactor could be partially attributed to the damage of cell structure and sludge structure at the presence of more residual dmf considering the fact that dmf was poorly removed in the control reactor torres et al 2018 on the contrary the upregulation of the genes responsible for dna repair was observed in the anoxic denitrification reactor fig s6 fig s7 which was beneficial for the maintenance of long term operation stability 3 6 mechanism dominating dmf biodegradation and denitrification in this study the highly toxic and recalcitrant dmf was efficiently utilized as the electron donor for microbial denitrification even at high dmf loading rate microbial denitrification needs to consume electrons to accomplish thoroughly reduction of no3 n to n2 providing the electron pools for the biodegradation of organic matters such as dmf the available of electron acceptor such as nitrate would be contributed to the enhanced biodegradation of organic contaminants through the rapid consumption of electrons wan et al 2016 for the first time the present study proved that simultaneous dmf biodegradation and microbial denitrification was technically feasible it was well known that biological denitrification occurs intracellularly through the sequent biological reductions of no3 n to no2 n and finally to n2 fig 6 a which were catalyzed by four essential denitrifying enzymes namely nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nir nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrous oxide reductase n2or wan et al 2016 wang et al 2019 by transcriptional analysis we found that the gene expression level involved in these denitrifying enzymes including quinone nitrate reductase ec 1 7 5 1 periplasmic nitrate reductase napa ec 1 7 99 4 and nitrite reductase ec 1 7 2 1 were significantly upregulated in the anoxic denitrification reactor whereas no significant variation was observed for nor and n2or fig 6b su et al 2019 has reported that both nor and n2or were freely distributed in periplasm which were more easily affected by the toxic dmf as compared to nar and nir moreover it should be noted that nitrate nitrite transporter nrt had a much higher expression level fig s8 which was rather beneficial for denitrification the results of enzymatic activity assay illustrated in fig 6c verified our speculation where the catalytic activities of nar and nir in the anoxic denitrification system were higher than those in the control system based on the analysis of dmf biodegradation products hydrolysis and oxidation were the major processes account for dmf metabolism in the anoxic denitrification system the abundance of the gene responsible for dmf hydrolysis was 5 6 fold of that in the control system fig 6d indicating that the presence of nitrate could significantly fastened the hydrolysis of dmf which was reported to occur intracellularly lu et al 2019 the gene expression of formate dehydrogenase fdh was remarkably upregulated in the anoxic denitrification reactor as compared to the control reactor correspondingly the activities of several key functional enzymes in the anoxic denitrification system including n n dimethylformamidase dmfase ec 3 5 1 56 dimethylamine dehydrogenase dmdh ec 1 5 8 2 formaldehyde dehydrogenase fadh ec 1 2 1 46 and formate dehydrogenase fdh ec 1 2 1 2 was obviously higher than those in the control system fig 6e during dmf biodegradation the step of dmf to dma catalyzed by dmfase was rather critical because it directly linked to dmf utilization rate the dehydrogenases such as fdh was rather crucial for the oxidative degradation of the intermediates such as dma mma formaldehyde and formic acid which was beneficial for the providing of electrons for microbial denitrification particularly fdh was responsible for catalyzing formic acid into co2 and h2o with electron and energy produced simultaneously wang et al 2019 both high gene expression and high fdh activity demonstrated that dmf could be oxidized into co2 to provide electron and energy for microbial denitrification since formic acid was the main intermediates during dmf biodegradation in the anoxic denitrification system these results further indicated that the occurrence of denitrification not only enhanced dmf hydrolysis but also facilitated dmf bio mineralization which was consistent with the high toc removal and nh4 n release nadh which is generated during the biodegradation of various organics can be used as the direct electron donor for biological reduction reactions including microbial denitrification su et al 2019 in organisms tricarboxylic acid tca cycle is the final pathway for the decomposition of major nutrients such as carbohydrates lipids and amino acids zhang et al 2018 in general more atp could be produced in denitrification bioprocess than anaerobic bioprocess due to the fact that organic substrate could be more effectively metabolized by denitrifier to provide electron and energy for nitrate reduction wan et al 2019 in this study the contents of nadh and atp in the anoxic denitrification reactor were much higher than those in the control reactor as shown in fig 6f however it was found that the upregulation of the expression level of the gene responsible for tca cycle were insignificant in the anoxic denitrification reactor table s2 since the gene expression variation of key enzymes related to conventional energy metabolism was negligible nitrate might play a key role in enhancing the catabolism of dmf and its derivatives to provide electron and energy for supporting microbial denitrification rather than the conventional tca cycle pathway in this study 4 conclusion this study demonstrated the feasibility of the anoxic denitrification system for the treatment of high strength dmf containing wastewater dmf could be completely removed at dmf loading rate as high as 20 52 mol m 3 d 1 our results found that the occurrence of denitrification not only improved the biodegradation capability of specific functional microorganisms but also promoted carbon source utilization to produce electron and energy in summary this is the first study for exploring the effect of microbial denitrification on dmf biodegradation at microbial metabolism and transcriptional level which provides a new insight for developing efficient and

17521,understanding the transport behaviors of thallium tl in porous media is of considerable interest for both natural soils and artificial filtration removal of tl in this context the transport behaviors of tl i in water saturated sand columns under different conditions were systematically investigated it was found that in addition to the effects of ph and ionic strength is the transport of tl i depended on the carbonate phosphate and macromolecular organic matter as well tl i broken the columns more difficultly under higher ph and lower is conditions moreover the adsorption of carbonate and phosphate on sand surfaces may increase the retention of tl i in columns as for macromolecular organic matter humic acid ha facilitated tl i transport especially under neutral and alkaline conditions 7 0 and 9 8 which was possibly associated with tl complexes formation and competed adsorption between tl i and ha however bovine serum albumin bsa impeded tl i transport for the reason that deposited bsa might provide more adsorption sites for tl i though tl i had a slight effect on bsa transport in order to evaluate the mechanisms of transport a dual sites non equilibrium model was applied to fit the breakthrough curves of tl i retardation factor r values of individual tl i transport from model calculations were found to be higher than that of tl i transport with ha and lower than that of tl i transport with bsa the fraction of instantaneous sorption sites β was found to decrease with increasing ph implying nonequilibrium sorption is a main sorption mechanism of tl i with ph increasing the fundamental data obtained herein demonstrated that carbonate phosphate and macromolecular organic matter significantly influenced the tl i migration and could lead to the leaking or bindings of tl i at tl occurring sites graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords tl i transport behaviors water saturated porous media macromolecular organic matter nonequilibrium cde 1 introduction thallium tl is a toxic element and is commonly enriched in silicate and sulfide minerals potassium feldspar alunite mica pyrite and sphalerite liu et al 2018 nriagu 1998 tl occurs in two valent states tl i and tl iii and tl i is the dominant tl species in ambient environment nriagu 1998 although typical tl contents in soils and sediments range between 0 1 and 1 mg kg elevated geogenic

processes chen et al 2013 liu et al 2019 thallium 1996 in recent years serious tl pollution accidents outbreak frequently posing human concern owing to the higher toxicity of tl than that of cd cr and

turner and furniss 2012 similar to many other toxic heavy metals u cd and as tl can enter into soil pores and cause extensive dispersal of contaminants ge et al 2018b rodriguez mercado et al 2017 xiao et al 2004 yang et al 2005 some suitable methods for remediation in tl polluted soils and underground water depend on the water chemical conditions and hydrodynamic factors ph ionic strength is redox

be chosen to remove tl in porous silica columns and removal efficiency of tl was influenced by ph competed ions and macro organic matters huangfu et al 2017 however few studies were conducted to systematically investigate the tl transport characteristics and mechanisms it was found that elevated ph increased the retention of tl onto the soils vaněk et al 2011 therefore it is necessary to systematically investigate the transport behaviors of tl in porous media under varying conditions heavy metal transport in porous media or packed columns was governed by adsorption and metal speciation which were sensitive to ph and is cruz hernandez et al 2019 liu et al 2011 martin et al 2018 villalobos et al 2018 wick et al 2018 it is reported that potential release of thallium may occur after an acid rain in a waste copper mining site guo et al 2018a higher carbonate concentration may be found in groundwater and phosphate and organic substances can also occur in eutrophic lake water borzi et al 2019 these water bodies nearby tl mine sites can possibly be exposed to tl ghezzi et al 2019 our previous and other studies about tl adsorption showed that oxygen containing anion co 3 2 po 4 3 and sio 3 2 can also influence the uptake of tl i on mineral materials huangfu et al 2014 wan et al 2014 carbonate may influence tl speciation and casiot et al compared tl speciation with thermodynamic predictions in amous river including carbonate 13 9 mg l casiot et al 2011 phosphate can also influence the adsorption of metals aide and cummings 1997 liu et al 2001 as p may bind with metal to form a p metal complex and it is reported that phosphate group increased the retention of zn by formation complexes with zn2 on the surface media perez novo et al 2011 in the case of macro organic matters widely distributed in subsurface water environments it could change the properties of porous media surfaces and associate with metals through various mechanisms including ion exchange coordination complexation electron donor receptor interactions and van der waals forces philippe and schaumann 2014 stoliker et al 2013 yang et al 2015 several studies showed that humic acid ha substantially enhanced the transport of metals in natural porous media by binding with metals and thus increased the transport ability of metals ge et al 2018b town et al 2019 yang et al 2019d for instance ha promoted u transport was attributed to the formation of aqueous u ha complexes and that ha competed against aqueous u for surface sites on porous media wang et al 2014 in engineering water filtration systems tl removal was also evidently decreased in the presence of ha chen et al 2019 huangfu et al 2017 besides deposited bovine serum albumin bsa on surface media may also provide more adsorption sites which also could impact matter transport huangfu et al 2019 and though relatively less attentions have been paid to explore the influence of bsa on the transport of metals including tl i it is hypothesized that the effects of proteins on the mobility of metal are different from humic substances depending on its interactions with metals and the migration features of proteins themselves alhazmi 2019 therefore exploring transport behaviors of tl i under all kinds of water chemical conditions is fundamental to understand both natural tl mobility and engineering tl removal in porous media equilibrium cde equilibrium convection diffusion equation models langmuir and freundlich adsorptions and nonequilibrium cde models chemical or physical non equilibrium and two sites non equilibrium adsorptions based on the principles of mass balance have been developed to describe the breakthrough curves btcs of solute in porous media battiato et al 2019 kantar 2007 simunek and van genuchten 2008 between them non equilibrium two sites models were widely applied for simulating the transport of metals in porous media due to its versatility and convenient operation chen et al 2018 chung et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 jiang et al 2018 ma et al 2018 mahler and persson 2013 montalvo et al 2018 wang et al 2014 wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 yang et al 2019c d 2012 yuan and peng 2017 for instance the btcs of u vi and akaganeite colloids were well described using a two sites non equilibrium model and a two sites kinetic attachment detachment model respectively ge et al 2018b the transportation of cd in montmorillonite ksf colloid systems followed a chemical non equilibrium model when the ph was higher than the point of zero charge of the colloids ph 6 chotpantarat and kiatvarangkul 2018 therefore using chemical non equilibrium cde models may be a feasible tool to explain the transport behaviors of tl i in porous media in the present work the transport behaviors and dynamic mechanisms of tl i in water saturated quartz sand media are systematically investigated by considering the effects of inorganic anions i e carbonate phosphate or macromolecular organic matter i e ha and bsa under acidic neutral and alkaline conditions for different iss at the beginning our experiments were designed to examine the btcs of tl i in the absence and presence of carbonate or phosphate at ph 3 2 7 0 and 9 8 moreover ha and bsa the typical representatives of humic substances and proteins were chosen in cotransport systems to understand the effects of macromolecular organic matter on tl i mobility finally a chemical non equilibrium dual sites transport model was used to fit the btcs of tl i to elucidate the primary mechanisms and evaluate dynamic behaviors of tl i this present work could help understand the roles which carbonate phosphate and macromolecular organic matter play in tl i migration in natural soils or artificial filtration systems 2 methods and materials 2 1 materials all chemicals were reagent grade or higher and ultrapure water was employed in all solutions and dilutions tlno3 99 9 ha fluka no 53680 and bsa no v900933 were purchased from sigma aldrich a stock solution of tl i was prepared by dissolving tlno3 powder in deionized water the concentration of tl i used in this study was 10 mg l which possibly occur in tl bearing tailing minerals guo et al 2018b liu et al 2019 the ha and bsa stock solutions were prepared by dissolving 50 mg of powder in 100 ml ultrapure water then filtrated by a cellulose acetate filter whatman me 24 0 45μm and both were stored in 4 c the total organic carbon toc concentrations of ha and bsa were analyzed by the oxidation method under high temperature conditions model multi3100 jana germany the experimental concentrations of ha and bsa were set to be 10 mg l toc the ph of the solution was adjusted by either hno3 or naoh 0 1 mol l and the co existed suspensions tl i with carbonate phosphate ha or bsa were equilibrated for at least 24 h prior to use quartz sands 40 80 mesh were used as typical porous media in this work no s861672 5kg shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai p r china and the granular distribution lists of sands was listed in table s1 the method of sands cleaning followed our previous methods charbonnet et al 2018 huangfu et al 2017 briefly quartz sands were firstly soaked in hydroxylamine hydrochloride 1 mol l overnight to remove impurities and then repeatedly rinsed with di water subsequently sands were scrubbed by hno3 1 mol l for 12 h and again rinsed with di water until the value of ph of the rinsed water was above 6 finally the sand specimens were dried in an oven at 105 c 12 h and baked at 600 c 4 h with a muffle furnace to remove any organic matter the pristine sand specimens were stored in polytetrafluoroethylene bottles 2 2 column experiments each transport experiment was separately conducted in a cylindrical glass column and all investigations were carried out in duplicate or triplicate at 25 0 c column properties were listed in table s2 the glass column was cleaned by hno3 0 01 mol l before using approximate 29 g sands were wet packed on the 0 5 cm coarse sand cushion which was used to keep the flow even and both ends of column were covered to avoid air entrap all prepared solutions were previously purged with n2 in a sealed regent bottle to avoid co2 contamination and maintain the ph then the column was saturated with pumping 3 pore volumes pvs deionized water and 5 pvs desired background electrolyte solution by a bt 100 peristaltic pump baoding longer precision pump ltd china the influents of individual ha or bsa tl i were pumped into the columns at a constant flow rate q 0 65 ml min υ 0 75 cm min after approximately 6 pvs 80 mins the columns were eluted with several pvs of tl i free background solutions the effluents were collected with a fraction collector at a regular time interval 10 mins the recovery of tl in the column experiments was checked by numerical integration of btcs relative high pore velocity used in this work is to better elucidate the transport process of tl in engineering heterogeneous porous media under various conditions which is a common practice in literature to study the fate and transport of metal and other contaminants dong et al 2018 ge et al 2018a the non reactive tracer no 3 was also conducted to get parameter dispersion coefficient table s3 and fig s1 2 3 measurement methods tl contents were measured by icp oes inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry optima 8000 perkinelmer inc america after cellulose acetate membrane filtration 0 45μm and acidification 1 hno3 ha and bsa were analyzed by uv vis adsorption spectroscopy uv 1800 mapada co shanghai china the concentration of ha was directly determined at 254 nm yang et al 2019d the concentration of bsa was determined at 575 nm according to a reagent color developing method by a bradford protein assay kit no pc0010 solarbio science technology co ltd beijing p r china 2 4 mathematical model for btc fitting in column experiments the time of advection 13 3 min is shorter than that of adsorption 14 day wick et al 2018 indicating that adsorption of tl to sands in the columns cannot be considered at local equilibrium therefore in this work a kinetic description was adopted in ced models to describe the tl mass transfer between the aqueous and the solid phases tl i and macromolecular organic matter ha and bsa transports in water saturated porous media were simulated using a modified convection dispersion equation with two sites non equilibrium sorption model and two kinetic retention sites model respectively the retardation factor r the fraction of instantaneous sorption sites β and the dimensionless mass transfer coefficient ω were estimated in the models the stanmod and hydrus 1d programs were applied to obtain the model parameters details of mathematical model including operative equations and parameter specification were given in supplementary materials text 1 and 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 carbonate and phosphate impeded the migration of tl i at varying phs 3 1 1 ph dependent individual transport of tl i the tl i solution was injected into the water saturated porous media at ph 3 2 7 0 and 9 8 to investigate the influence of ph on tl i transport fig 1 a the btcs of the tl i at ph 3 2 showed that c c0 of tl i arrived at peak at approximately 3 pvs followed by rapidly dropping without tailing whereas those at ph 7 0 and 9 8 exhibited distinct tailing phenomenon this implied that the tl i transport in the saturated sand columns became a more prominent nonequilibrium process with ph increasing in addition the btcs of tl i could be fitted well with models and when ph increased from 3 2 to 9 8 the calculated r values and retention capacity of tl i transported through columns were increased from 1 91 to 3 8 and 5 1 10 3 to 9 2 10 3 mg g respectively table 1 which meant that tl i broken the columns more difficultly at higher ph retention of tl i on mineral surfaces with different phs can be found in other studies aguilar carrillo et al 2020 wick et al 2018 wick et al 2019 the maximum sorption capacity of tl i adsorption onto the jarosite and birnessite increased from 0 58 to 2 80 mg g and from 16 2 to 20 0 mg g respectively when ph varied from 2 to 6 aguilar carrillo et al 2020 the maximum sorption of tl i adsorption onto the activated carbon was 2 27 mg g at ph 7 and temperature 20 c santonastaso et al 2018 these studies indicated that higher ph increased the tl retention in porous media the effects of ph on tl i transport could be explained by changes of sand surfaces and the competition for sorption sites between tl ions and hydrogen ions in the systems it is reported that the delayed breakthrough of u vi at higher ph was attributed to the more negatively charged sand grains and positively charged u vi species ge et al 2018a the absolute specie of tl i in aqueous was tl over ph 2 to 13 fig s2 99 9 and the main group of pure quartz sand on the surface is si oh which is strongly deprotonated at higher ph chotpantarat and kiatvarangkul 2018 moreover the point of zero charge of sio2 was 3 and the zeta potentials of sio2 were more negative with ph increase kosmulski 2011 liu et al 2012 thus these sites are available for sorption and naturally carry negative charges to adsorb t l si oh t l si otl h casiot et al 2011 consequently in highly acidic porous media the mobility of tl is possibly significantly higher than that in neutral or alkaline soils as previous studies reported guo et al 2018b 3 1 2 effects of carbonate and phosphate on the transport of tl i to examine the effect of carbonate and phosphate on the retention and transport of tl i in porous media the transport behaviors of tl i in the presence of carbonate 5 10 3 m and phosphate 3 3 10 3 m were investigated at ph 3 2 7 0 and 9 8 in packed quartz sands the btcs of tl i with carbonate and phosphate at varying phs were shown in fig 1 b and c the results presented that despite the absence and presence of inorganic anions breakthrough plateaus of tl i at ph 3 2 were higher relative to those at higher ph 7 0 and 9 8 in addition the initial breakthrough time of total tl with carbonate and phosphate at the top of the column was slightly faster than that with nitrate under tested ph conditions tl i migration through the water saturated porous media was evaluated by the r and retention capacity retardation factor of tl i transporting with carbonate and phosphate through the water saturated porous media were increased from 2 48 to 4 37 and from 2 2 to 4 05 respectively as the solution ph increased from 3 2 to 9 8 table 1 furthermore the sorption capacity of tl i in columns was also increased as the ph increased because the variable negative charge sites on the surface increased while the retention capacity of tl without inorganic anions were lower than those including the inorganic anions under the same ph this confirmed that both carbonate and phosphate inhibited the tl mobility previous studies also found that the phosphate inhibited the mobility of metals phosphate increased the adsorption of u vi on goethite coated sand which was attributed to the formation of ternary surface complexes involving both u vi and phosphate cheng et al 2004 the retention uo2 2 in a silica column was enhanced by phosphate which preliminarily adsorbed on the silica column zhang et al 2008 it is well known that inorganic ligands could complex with tl i and thus changes the tl species which might affect the transport of tl i casiot et al 2011 nriagu 1998 the distribution of tl i species with carbonate 5 10 3 m and phosphate 3 3 10 3 m have been calculated by mineql software figs s3 and s4 accordingly tl complexes species could only be found under neutral and alkaline conditions the formation of tl carbonate was only less than 20 and tl phosphate complexes under tested conditions was less than 10 although the tl complexes formation was a factor resulting in the morphology of tl i changed which might produce a favorable effect on tl mobility the impeded transport of tl i was examined in this study fig 1 this occurred possibly because that the tl is still the major species of tl i which was the predominating factors on tl i transport in tested systems in conclusion compared with background electrolyte of 10 mmol l no 3 both carbonate and phosphate inhibited tl i transport especially in the rising period of btcs of tl i indicating that the carbonate and phosphate ions which adsorbed on the surface of sands acted as inhibitors for tl i 3 2 ha facilitated tl i transport 3 2 1 tl i individual transport at varying iss is is also an important water chemical condition which could influence metals mobility is at different nano3 concentrations 1 10 and 50 mm led to apparent shift of tl mobility in porous quartz sand media fig s4 as can be seen the delayed breakthrough of tl i was observed at lower is the retention capacities of tl i were found to decline from 7 5 10 3 to 5 2 10 3 mg g when the is decreased from 50 to 1 mmol l moreover r values were 3 43 3 23 and 2 63 with is 1 10 and 50 mm respectively table 1 which demonstrated that an increase in is can improve the transport of tl i through saturated sand media due to a decrease in tl i retention on the quartz sands tl i generated delayed breakthrough at nano3 of 1 mmol l since is may boost retention of tl i on sand surfaces tl is similar to alkaline metal and might compete with na where a cation exchange mechanism dominated uptake processes wick et al 2018 there might be a competed phenomenon between na and tl at higher background ions additionally the dual layers on the surface of quartz sand were compressed at higher background electrolyte solutions huang et al 2019 and diminished the surface potentials which strengthened the electrostatic attractions between the sand surfaces and tl as a result tl i broke through the sand column earlier at higher is the same pattern of btcs was also observed in cd2 and cs transporting through quartz sands flury et al 2004 wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 though ionic strength had no discernible effects on the mobility of the hexavalent uranium ge et al 2018b which might be explained that high valence ions have an overwhelming force to compete with one valence ions 3 2 2 the role of ha fig 2 presented the btcs of individual and co transport of tl i 5 10 5 mol l and ha 10 mgc l at varying phs 3 2 7 0 and 9 8 and iss 1 10 3 1 10 2 and 5 10 2 m nano3 generally speaking ha facilitated the transport of tl i under most of the tested conditions while only a slight shift was observed at ph 3 2 and is 10 mm fig 2 a e which was consistent with r values obtained from model calculations table 1 when ph increased from 3 2 to 9 8 r values of tl i were increased from 2 02 to 2 89 in the presence of ha compared with that from 1 91 to 3 8 in individual transport systems additionally results from co transport column experiments showed that the total amount of breakthrough of tl i in tested conditions were higher with ha than that without ha table 1 this demonstrated that the improved breakthrough of tl i by ha was observed but also ha could have a more obvious facilitated effect at higher ph in other fields and studies ha can improve the metal mobility as well chen et al 2018 wang et al 2014 yang et al 2019c although low concentration of ha 5 mg l did not change the impediment of gibbsite colloids on u vi transport relatively high concentration of ha 20 mg l improved the transport of u vi and gibbsite colloids yang et al 2019a ha colloids can also enhance the transport of ferrihydrite colloids and arsenic at ph 7 0 and 9 8 ma et al 2018 in this work the tl i mobility was obviously accelerated consistent with other studies these facilitated trends might be caused by either the association of aqueous metals with ha via complexing with functional groups carboxylic phenolic alkyl and aromatic into tl i ha complexes or the competed effects between ha and aqueous metals for adsorption sites on sand surfaces chen et al 2020 nriagu 1998 wang et al 2014 as previous studies reported huangfu et al 2019 the potentials of ha and surfaces of quartz sands tend to become more negative with ph increasing where ha attached onto the surfaces of quartz sands more difficultly and the amount of ha tl complexes increased both situations above may further promote the transport of tl i under higher ph conditions therefore ha exhibited a higher facilitated effect on the transport of tl i at higher ph in contrast under lower ph conditions the electrostatic repulsion between ha and quartz sands would become weak and thus van der waals forces were dominant indicating that more ha attached onto the quartz sands including part ha tl complexes in addition the presence of organic matter constituents would change the zeta potentials of quartz sand by their adsorption onto the sand surfaces zhang et al 2020 which might increase the amount of tl adsorption under lower ph conditions it is reported that a ha coated sand was regarded as a novel sorbent in permeable reactive barrier for environmental remediation of groundwater polluted with copper and cadmium ions faisal et al 2020 these explanations could give an insight into the effects of ha on the metal transport therefore in this study ha significantly improved the transport of tl i under neutral and alkaline conditions while ha might slightly inhibited tl i mobility under the acid condition ph 3 2 3 2 3 the transport of ha the overall btcs of ha in the individual and binary systems were shown in fig s5 which were asymmetric and strongly influenced by ph and is it was presented that the c c0 of ha jumped before approximately 2 5 pvs then slowly climbed and arrived at peak at approximately 7 0 pvs followed by plummeting without tailing this was recognized to occur the blocking process where the deposited ha might have prevented growing colloids from attaching to the quartz sand surface babakhani et al 2017 in ha individual systems with ph increasing the ha broke the columns easier and the effluent recovery of ha were 46 50 65 28 and 67 32 at ph 3 2 7 0 and 9 8 respectively table 1 in the case of is when nano3 was at 1 and 50 mmol l 64 44 and 57 05 of ha can pass through the porous media the breakthrough of ha in binary systems was less than that in individual systems in general improved breakthrough of ha could obtained under higher ph or lower is conditions which was consistent with other research reports and predictions of derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory yang et al 2019c accordingly the electrostatic interactions are dependent of ph and is liu et al 1995 higher ph can decrease the zeta potentials of ha colloids while increasing is can diminish the thickness of diffuse double layers both situations weakened the electrostatic repulsions between ha particles and sand surfaces and thus amplified retention capability compared with individual ha the presence of tl i impeded to some extent the ha breakthrough tl i might screen the surface potentials of ha by formation of tl ha complexes and thus decreased negative charges on ha so electrostatic repulsion between ha and quartz surfaces was decreased similar results could be obtained in their studies chen et al 2018 wang et al 2014 yang et al 2019c d it is reported that u vi decreased the ha colloidal stability a higher size and a lower zeta potential and thus improved the ha mobility yang et al 2019b 3 3 bsa inhibited tl i transport to explicate the effects of bsa on tl i transport comparison of the btcs of tl i with or without bsa was presented in fig 3 generally speaking the tl movement was inhibited by the bsa and the recovery of tl i decreased almost a quarter as can be seen btcs of tl i both with or without bsa were well fitted with the non equilibrium two sites model and the r of tl i with bsa through the column was higher than that without bsa table 1 it was also showed that the retention capacity of tl i in sand columns increased approximately 1 59 folds from 7 18 10 3 to 11 39 10 3 mg g when the ph increased from 3 2 to 9 8 the effluent recovery of tl transport with the bsa were lower than those without bsa at the same conditions because the bsa behaved as the inhibitors on tl and decreased its mobility btcs of individual bsa in varying conditions were presented in fig s6 and the two sites model also well described the bsa transport in water saturated porous media sole bsa transport was less sensitive to ph and is the recovery of bsa were increased from 45 37 to 59 55 as ph increased from 3 2 to 9 8 while 60 80 and 51 06 broke through the columns at is 1 and 50 table s7 respectively the level of bsa recovery in the binary systems was slightly greater than that in the absence of the tl i table s7 indicating that the presence of tl i has a little influence on the transport of bsa this possibly resulted from that bsa has a molecular mass of 66 4 kda which was not susceptible to the chemical conditions bal et al 2013 moreover approximate half bsa in binary systems deposited on the sands and the retention capacities of bsa on columns were 9 28 10 3 7 57 10 3 and 6 28 10 3 mg g at ph 3 2 7 0 and 9 8 respectively when is increased from 1 to 50 mmol l the retention capacities of bsa improved from 6 51 10 3 to 7 90 10 3 mg g bsa is an amphiphilic molecule and commonly contains various metal binding sites including the cys34 residue and its environment containing s site n teminal site nts site a and multi metal binding site depending on its structure and metal ion specificity bal et al 2013 it also has been reported that biosorption s site exhibited a stronger complexed ability for tl i stability constants log k 1 25 nriagu 1998 moreover the deposition of bsa onto sand surfaces had been observed thus the inhibition of tl i in the presence of bsa may result from complexed sites provided by deposited bsa macromolecular yang et al reported that the stronger effects of bsa than that of humic substances on biochar carbon transport were attributed that bsa had larger molecular weight and caused the larger thickness of bsa adsorption layer yang et al 2019e consequently such a preferential retention of tl i was expected to occur in the presence of bsa 3 4 mathematical model in order to understand the transport mechanisms of tl i in water saturated porous media modified cde models were used in this study the one site kinetic model incorporating the langmurian or blocking function failed to fit the entire btcs of tl i and ha or bsa at various conditions data not showed however the two sites chemical non equilibrium model and two sites kinetics attachment detachment model were applied to simulate the transport behavior of tl i and ha or bsa in water saturated sand columns babakhani et al 2017 3 4 1 tl i transport model a two sites non equilibrium model was used to describe tl i transport the fitted btcs were presented as dash lines in figs 1 to 3 fitted parameter r was an applicable coefficient for evaluation of the retention of tl i on sands with ph increasing and is decreasing r for tl i was greatly increased additionally at ph 7 0 r for tracer was 1 whereas for tl i r was 3 23 and the kd 0 64 can be easily calculated according to eq s2 the parameter β represented the fraction of exchange sites partitioning coefficient and β of tl i transport tended to decrease with ph increasing table 1 one possible explanation was that tl i retention in columns was dominated by non equilibrium adsorption with ph increasing with respect to the first order kinetic rate coefficient mass transfer coefficient the lower ω values could be obtained at higher is which was related to the stronger competition of tl with na under higher is conditions wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 3 4 2 ha and bsa transport model model fitted first order attachment rate coefficients k1a k2a and first order detachment rate coefficients k1d were used to describe ha attachment and detachment on the sand surfaces respectively smax2 was defined as the maximum solid phase retention capacity of site 2 the fitted parameters for ha were summarized in table s6 in general the values of k2a were lower than that of k1a and k1d indicating that ha attachment was dominated by reversible attachment on site 2 this phenomenon might be caused by the presence of unfavorable surfaces i e unfavorable attachment condition for ha attachment with ph increasing k1a and k1d steadily increased while k1a and k1d diminished with is increasing both the smax2 and k2a also decreased which could be attributed to unfavorable transport of ha under higher ph and lower is it was reported that the akaganeite colloids with positive potential exhibited a gradual increase value of k1a in the presence of u vi as ph increased ge et al 2018b the btcs of bsa can be simulated by the two sites kinetic model with a langmurian blocking function for each site fig s6 and fig 3 in general the btcs were initially delayed 1 pore volume next they rapidly increased and then they slowly approached the plateau the value of k1 was approximately one order of magnitude greater than k2 and smax1 was approximate to smax2 the time of breakthrough was mainly determined by k1 and smax1 and more delay is expected for higher values of k1 and smax1 bsa reached to complete deposition until both the solid phase concentration of bsa in site 1 and site 2 were approximate to smax1 and smax1 respectively after the bsa filled fully in sites 1 the shapes of btcs was sharply rising and strongly affected by the values of k2 and smax2 other studies on colloids transport in porous media have observed a similar delay sasidharan et al 2014 the greatest discrepancy between the measured data and model calculated curve occurs under higher ph conditions in the tailing segment part when the model slightly overpredicts tl retention ability this model data deviation probably resulted from overestimation of tl the model can also underestimate the ha or bsa mobility ha or bsa should not have been released from porous media surface because of irreversible deposition but slight complexed ha or bsa metal might release overall the model fitted parameters and high pearson s correlation coefficient r2 0 96 between observed and fitted data reflected that the two sites models can capture the main transport features of tl i ha and bsa in water saturated porous media 4 conclusions the transport behaviors of tl i have the potential to influence the environmental fate in natural water systems and the removal of tl in engineering water systems in this study we systematically explored the effects of inorganic anions carbonate and phosphate and macro organic matters ha and bsa which are important components of natural water bodies on the transport of tl i in water saturated sand column under different conditions ph and is the transport of tl i was significantly influenced by is and ph and delay breakthrough of tl i could be examined at higher ph and lower is the presence of carbonate or phosphate inhibited the mobility of tl i in columns ha could not only compete adsorption sites with tl i on sand surface but also complex tl i and thus facilitated the tl i mobility however bsa has a large molecular weight and added extra retention regions for tl i the transport of tl i became tough in the presence of bsa the btcs of tl i were simulated by stanmod software with a dual sites non equilibrium model which may predict the tl i transport behaviors in water saturated porous media ha transport and bsa transport were simulated using hydrus 1d software with dual sites kinetic models revealing that blocking or kinetic attachments dominated the ha interactions with porous media and langmuir type blocking dominated the bsa transport this work will contribute to understand the environmental processes of tl i first the outcomes of this investigation will help understand the environmental fate and transport of tl i e g soils groundwater and subsurface environments second it is beneficial to adjust conditions of engineered infiltration systems for removing tl from contaminated waters declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17521,understanding the transport behaviors of thallium tl in porous media is of considerable interest for both natural soils and artificial filtration removal of tl in this context the transport behaviors of tl i in water saturated sand columns under different conditions were systematically investigated it was found that in addition to the effects of ph and ionic strength is the transport of tl i depended on the carbonate phosphate and macromolecular organic matter as well tl i broken the columns more difficultly under higher ph and lower is conditions moreover the adsorption of carbonate and phosphate on sand surfaces may increase the retention of tl i in columns as for macromolecular organic matter humic acid ha facilitated tl i transport especially under neutral and alkaline conditions 7 0 and 9 8 which was possibly associated with tl complexes formation and competed adsorption between tl i and ha however bovine serum albumin bsa impeded tl i transport for the reason that deposited bsa might provide more adsorption sites for tl i though tl i had a slight effect on bsa transport in order to evaluate the mechanisms of transport a dual sites non equilibrium model was applied to fit the breakthrough curves of tl i retardation factor r values of individual tl i transport from model calculations were found to be higher than that of tl i transport with ha and lower than that of tl i transport with bsa the fraction of instantaneous sorption sites β was found to decrease with increasing ph implying nonequilibrium sorption is a main sorption mechanism of tl i with ph increasing the fundamental data obtained herein demonstrated that carbonate phosphate and macromolecular organic matter significantly influenced the tl i migration and could lead to the leaking or bindings of tl i at tl occurring sites graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords tl i transport behaviors water saturated porous media macromolecular organic matter nonequilibrium cde 1 introduction thallium tl is a toxic element and is commonly enriched in silicate and sulfide minerals potassium feldspar alunite mica pyrite and sphalerite liu et al 2018 nriagu 1998 tl occurs in two valent states tl i and tl iii and tl i is the dominant tl species in ambient environment nriagu 1998 although typical tl contents in soils and sediments range between 0 1 and 1 mg kg elevated geogenic tl contents up to several thousand mg kg may be found in tl rich metal sulfide deposits and soils liu et al 2019 xiao et al 2012 human activities mining and smelting activities can result in tl

processes chen et al 2013 liu et al 2019 thallium 1996 in recent years serious tl pollution accidents outbreak frequently posing human concern owing to the higher toxicity of tl than that of cd cr and hg perez et al 2018 yang et al 2005 yu et al 2018 zou et al 2020 tl can inhibit the transport of k across the nacl kcl co transporter sites and bind with n and s ligands tightly belzile and chen 2017 turner and furniss 2012 similar to many other toxic heavy metals u cd and as tl can enter into soil pores and cause extensive dispersal of contaminants ge et al 2018b rodriguez mercado et al 2017 xiao et al 2004 yang et al 2005 some suitable methods for remediation in tl polluted soils and underground water depend on the water chemical conditions and hydrodynamic factors ph ionic strength is redox

be chosen to remove tl in porous silica columns and removal efficiency of tl was influenced by ph competed ions and macro organic matters huangfu et al 2017 however few studies were conducted to systematically investigate the tl transport characteristics and mechanisms it was found that elevated ph increased the retention of tl onto the soils vaněk et al 2011 therefore it is necessary to systematically investigate the transport behaviors of tl in porous media under varying conditions heavy metal transport in porous media or packed columns was governed by adsorption and metal speciation which were sensitive to ph and is cruz hernandez et al 2019 liu et al 2011 martin et al 2018 villalobos et al 2018 wick et al 2018 it is reported that potential release of thallium may occur after an acid rain in a waste copper mining site guo et al 2018a higher carbonate concentration may be found in groundwater and phosphate and organic substances can also occur in eutrophic lake water borzi et al 2019 these water bodies nearby tl mine sites can possibly be exposed to tl ghezzi et al 2019 our previous and other studies about tl adsorption showed that oxygen containing anion co 3 2 po 4 3 and sio 3 2 can also influence the uptake of tl i on mineral materials huangfu et al 2014 wan et al 2014 carbonate may influence tl speciation and casiot et al compared tl speciation with thermodynamic predictions in amous river including carbonate 13 9 mg l casiot et al 2011 phosphate can also influence the adsorption of metals aide and cummings 1997 liu et al 2001 as p may bind with metal to form a p metal complex and it is reported that phosphate group increased the retention of zn by formation complexes with zn2 on the surface media perez novo et al 2011 in the case of macro organic matters widely distributed in subsurface water environments it could change the properties of porous media surfaces and associate with metals through various mechanisms including ion exchange coordination complexation electron donor receptor interactions and van der waals forces philippe and schaumann 2014 stoliker et al 2013 yang et al 2015 several studies showed that humic acid ha substantially enhanced the transport of metals in natural porous media by binding with metals and thus increased the transport ability of metals ge et al 2018b town et al 2019 yang et al 2019d for instance ha promoted u transport was attributed to the formation of aqueous u ha complexes and that ha competed against aqueous u for surface sites on porous media wang et al 2014 in engineering water filtration systems tl removal was also evidently decreased in the presence of ha chen et al 2019 huangfu et al 2017 besides deposited bovine serum albumin bsa on surface media may also provide more adsorption sites which also could impact matter transport huangfu et al 2019 and though relatively less attentions have been paid to explore the influence of bsa on the transport of metals including tl i it is hypothesized that the effects of proteins on the mobility of metal are different from humic substances depending on its interactions with metals and the migration features of proteins themselves alhazmi 2019 therefore exploring transport behaviors of tl i under all kinds of water chemical conditions is fundamental to understand both natural tl mobility and engineering tl removal in porous media equilibrium cde equilibrium convection diffusion equation models langmuir and freundlich adsorptions and nonequilibrium cde models chemical or physical non equilibrium and two sites non equilibrium adsorptions based on the principles of mass balance have been developed to describe the breakthrough curves btcs of solute in porous media battiato et al 2019 kantar 2007 simunek and van genuchten 2008 between them non equilibrium two sites models were widely applied for simulating the transport of metals in porous media due to its versatility and convenient operation chen et al 2018 chung et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 jiang et al 2018 ma et al 2018 mahler and persson 2013 montalvo et al 2018 wang et al 2014 wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 yang et al 2019c d 2012 yuan and peng 2017 for instance the btcs of u vi and akaganeite colloids were well described using a two sites non equilibrium model and a two sites kinetic attachment detachment model respectively ge et al 2018b the transportation of cd in montmorillonite ksf colloid systems followed a chemical non equilibrium model when the ph was higher than the point of zero charge of the colloids ph 6 chotpantarat and kiatvarangkul 2018 therefore using chemical non equilibrium cde models may be a feasible tool to explain the transport behaviors of tl i in porous media in the present work the transport behaviors and dynamic mechanisms of tl i in water saturated quartz sand media are systematically investigated by considering the effects of inorganic anions i e carbonate phosphate or macromolecular organic matter i e ha and bsa under acidic neutral and alkaline conditions for different iss at the beginning our experiments were designed to examine the btcs of tl i in the absence and presence of carbonate or phosphate at ph 3 2 7 0 and 9 8 moreover ha and bsa the typical representatives of humic substances and proteins were chosen in cotransport systems to understand the effects of macromolecular organic matter on tl i mobility finally a chemical non equilibrium dual sites transport model was used to fit the btcs of tl i to elucidate the primary mechanisms and evaluate dynamic behaviors of tl i this present work could help understand the roles which carbonate phosphate and macromolecular organic matter play in tl i migration in natural soils or artificial filtration systems 2 methods and materials 2 1 materials all chemicals were reagent grade or higher and ultrapure water was employed in all solutions and dilutions tlno3 99 9 ha fluka no 53680 and bsa no v900933 were purchased from sigma aldrich a stock solution of tl i was prepared by dissolving tlno3 powder in deionized water the concentration of tl i used in this study was 10 mg l which possibly occur in tl bearing tailing minerals guo et al 2018b liu et al 2019 the ha and bsa stock solutions were prepared by dissolving 50 mg of powder in 100 ml ultrapure water then filtrated by a cellulose acetate filter whatman me 24 0 45μm and both were stored in 4 c the total organic carbon toc concentrations of ha and bsa were analyzed by the oxidation method under high temperature conditions model multi3100 jana germany the experimental concentrations of ha and bsa were set to be 10 mg l toc the ph of the solution was adjusted by either hno3 or naoh 0 1 mol l and the co existed suspensions tl i with carbonate phosphate ha or bsa were equilibrated for at least 24 h prior to use quartz sands 40 80 mesh were used as typical porous media in this work no s861672 5kg shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai p r china and the granular distribution lists of sands was listed in table s1 the method of sands cleaning followed our previous methods charbonnet et al 2018 huangfu et al 2017 briefly quartz sands were firstly soaked in hydroxylamine hydrochloride 1 mol l overnight to remove impurities and then repeatedly rinsed with di water subsequently sands were scrubbed by hno3 1 mol l for 12 h and again rinsed with di water until the value of ph of the rinsed water was above 6 finally the sand specimens were dried in an oven at 105 c 12 h and baked at 600 c 4 h with a muffle furnace to remove any organic matter the pristine sand specimens were stored in polytetrafluoroethylene bottles 2 2 column experiments each transport experiment was separately conducted in a cylindrical glass column and all investigations were carried out in duplicate or triplicate at 25 0 c column properties were listed in table s2 the glass column was cleaned by hno3 0 01 mol l before using approximate 29 g sands were wet packed on the 0 5 cm coarse sand cushion which was used to keep the flow even and both ends of column were covered to avoid air entrap all prepared solutions were previously purged with n2 in a sealed regent bottle to avoid co2 contamination and maintain the ph then the column was saturated with pumping 3 pore volumes pvs deionized water and 5 pvs desired background electrolyte solution by a bt 100 peristaltic pump baoding longer precision pump ltd china the influents of individual ha or bsa tl i were pumped into the columns at a constant flow rate q 0 65 ml min υ 0 75 cm min after approximately 6 pvs 80 mins the columns were eluted with several pvs of tl i free background solutions the effluents were collected with a fraction collector at a regular time interval 10 mins the recovery of tl in the column experiments was checked by numerical integration of btcs relative high pore velocity used in this work is to better elucidate the transport process of tl in engineering heterogeneous porous media under various conditions which is a common practice in literature to study the fate and transport of metal and other contaminants dong et al 2018 ge et al 2018a the non reactive tracer no 3 was also conducted to get parameter dispersion coefficient table s3 and fig s1 2 3 measurement methods tl contents were measured by icp oes inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry optima 8000 perkinelmer inc america after cellulose acetate membrane filtration 0 45μm and acidification 1 hno3 ha and bsa were analyzed by uv vis adsorption spectroscopy uv 1800 mapada co shanghai china the concentration of ha was directly determined at 254 nm yang et al 2019d the concentration of bsa was determined at 575 nm according to a reagent color developing method by a bradford protein assay kit no pc0010 solarbio science technology co ltd beijing p r china 2 4 mathematical model for btc fitting in column experiments the time of advection 13 3 min is shorter than that of adsorption 14 day wick et al 2018 indicating that adsorption of tl to sands in the columns cannot be considered at local equilibrium therefore in this work a kinetic description was adopted in ced models to describe the tl mass transfer between the aqueous and the solid phases tl i and macromolecular organic matter ha and bsa transports in water saturated porous media were simulated using a modified convection dispersion equation with two sites non equilibrium sorption model and two kinetic retention sites model respectively the retardation factor r the fraction of instantaneous sorption sites β and the dimensionless mass transfer coefficient ω were estimated in the models the stanmod and hydrus 1d programs were applied to obtain the model parameters details of mathematical model including operative equations and parameter specification were given in supplementary materials text 1 and 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 carbonate and phosphate impeded the migration of tl i at varying phs 3 1 1 ph dependent individual transport of tl i the tl i solution was injected into the water saturated porous media at ph 3 2 7 0 and 9 8 to investigate the influence of ph on tl i transport fig 1 a the btcs of the tl i at ph 3 2 showed that c c0 of tl i arrived at peak at approximately 3 pvs followed by rapidly dropping without tailing whereas those at ph 7 0 and 9 8 exhibited distinct tailing phenomenon this implied that the tl i transport in the saturated sand columns became a more prominent nonequilibrium process with ph increasing in addition the btcs of tl i could be fitted well with models and when ph increased from 3 2 to 9 8 the calculated r values and retention capacity of tl i transported through columns were increased from 1 91 to 3 8 and 5 1 10 3 to 9 2 10 3 mg g respectively table 1 which meant that tl i broken the columns more difficultly at higher ph retention of tl i on mineral surfaces with different phs can be found in other studies aguilar carrillo et al 2020 wick et al 2018 wick et al 2019 the maximum sorption capacity of tl i adsorption onto the jarosite and birnessite increased from 0 58 to 2 80 mg g and from 16 2 to 20 0 mg g respectively when ph varied from 2 to 6 aguilar carrillo et al 2020 the maximum sorption of tl i adsorption onto the activated carbon was 2 27 mg g at ph 7 and temperature 20 c santonastaso et al 2018 these studies indicated that higher ph increased the tl retention in porous media the effects of ph on tl i transport could be explained by changes of sand surfaces and the competition for sorption sites between tl ions and hydrogen ions in the systems it is reported that the delayed breakthrough of u vi at higher ph was attributed to the more negatively charged sand grains and positively charged u vi species ge et al 2018a the absolute specie of tl i in aqueous was tl over ph 2 to 13 fig s2 99 9 and the main group of pure quartz sand on the surface is si oh which is strongly deprotonated at higher ph chotpantarat and kiatvarangkul 2018 moreover the point of zero charge of sio2 was 3 and the zeta potentials of sio2 were more negative with ph increase kosmulski 2011 liu et al 2012 thus these sites are available for sorption and naturally carry negative charges to adsorb t l si oh t l si otl h casiot et al 2011 consequently in highly acidic porous media the mobility of tl is possibly significantly higher than that in neutral or alkaline soils as previous studies reported guo et al 2018b 3 1 2 effects of carbonate and phosphate on the transport of tl i to examine the effect of carbonate and phosphate on the retention and transport of tl i in porous media the transport behaviors of tl i in the presence of carbonate 5 10 3 m and phosphate 3 3 10 3 m were investigated at ph 3 2 7 0 and 9 8 in packed quartz sands the btcs of tl i with carbonate and phosphate at varying phs were shown in fig 1 b and c the results presented that despite the absence and presence of inorganic anions breakthrough plateaus of tl i at ph 3 2 were higher relative to those at higher ph 7 0 and 9 8 in addition the initial breakthrough time of total tl with carbonate and phosphate at the top of the column was slightly faster than that with nitrate under tested ph conditions tl i migration through the water saturated porous media was evaluated by the r and retention capacity retardation factor of tl i transporting with carbonate and phosphate through the water saturated porous media were increased from 2 48 to 4 37 and from 2 2 to 4 05 respectively as the solution ph increased from 3 2 to 9 8 table 1 furthermore the sorption capacity of tl i in columns was also increased as the ph increased because the variable negative charge sites on the surface increased while the retention capacity of tl without inorganic anions were lower than those including the inorganic anions under the same ph this confirmed that both carbonate and phosphate inhibited the tl mobility previous studies also found that the phosphate inhibited the mobility of metals phosphate increased the adsorption of u vi on goethite coated sand which was attributed to the formation of ternary surface complexes involving both u vi and phosphate cheng et al 2004 the retention uo2 2 in a silica column was enhanced by phosphate which preliminarily adsorbed on the silica column zhang et al 2008 it is well known that inorganic ligands could complex with tl i and thus changes the tl species which might affect the transport of tl i casiot et al 2011 nriagu 1998 the distribution of tl i species with carbonate 5 10 3 m and phosphate 3 3 10 3 m have been calculated by mineql software figs s3 and s4 accordingly tl complexes species could only be found under neutral and alkaline conditions the formation of tl carbonate was only less than 20 and tl phosphate complexes under tested conditions was less than 10 although the tl complexes formation was a factor resulting in the morphology of tl i changed which might produce a favorable effect on tl mobility the impeded transport of tl i was examined in this study fig 1 this occurred possibly because that the tl is still the major species of tl i which was the predominating factors on tl i transport in tested systems in conclusion compared with background electrolyte of 10 mmol l no 3 both carbonate and phosphate inhibited tl i transport especially in the rising period of btcs of tl i indicating that the carbonate and phosphate ions which adsorbed on the surface of sands acted as inhibitors for tl i 3 2 ha facilitated tl i transport 3 2 1 tl i individual transport at varying iss is is also an important water chemical condition which could influence metals mobility is at different nano3 concentrations 1 10 and 50 mm led to apparent shift of tl mobility in porous quartz sand media fig s4 as can be seen the delayed breakthrough of tl i was observed at lower is the retention capacities of tl i were found to decline from 7 5 10 3 to 5 2 10 3 mg g when the is decreased from 50 to 1 mmol l moreover r values were 3 43 3 23 and 2 63 with is 1 10 and 50 mm respectively table 1 which demonstrated that an increase in is can improve the transport of tl i through saturated sand media due to a decrease in tl i retention on the quartz sands tl i generated delayed breakthrough at nano3 of 1 mmol l since is may boost retention of tl i on sand surfaces tl is similar to alkaline metal and might compete with na where a cation exchange mechanism dominated uptake processes wick et al 2018 there might be a competed phenomenon between na and tl at higher background ions additionally the dual layers on the surface of quartz sand were compressed at higher background electrolyte solutions huang et al 2019 and diminished the surface potentials which strengthened the electrostatic attractions between the sand surfaces and tl as a result tl i broke through the sand column earlier at higher is the same pattern of btcs was also observed in cd2 and cs transporting through quartz sands flury et al 2004 wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 though ionic strength had no discernible effects on the mobility of the hexavalent uranium ge et al 2018b which might be explained that high valence ions have an overwhelming force to compete with one valence ions 3 2 2 the role of ha fig 2 presented the btcs of individual and co transport of tl i 5 10 5 mol l and ha 10 mgc l at varying phs 3 2 7 0 and 9 8 and iss 1 10 3 1 10 2 and 5 10 2 m nano3 generally speaking ha facilitated the transport of tl i under most of the tested conditions while only a slight shift was observed at ph 3 2 and is 10 mm fig 2 a e which was consistent with r values obtained from model calculations table 1 when ph increased from 3 2 to 9 8 r values of tl i were increased from 2 02 to 2 89 in the presence of ha compared with that from 1 91 to 3 8 in individual transport systems additionally results from co transport column experiments showed that the total amount of breakthrough of tl i in tested conditions were higher with ha than that without ha table 1 this demonstrated that the improved breakthrough of tl i by ha was observed but also ha could have a more obvious facilitated effect at higher ph in other fields and studies ha can improve the metal mobility as well chen et al 2018 wang et al 2014 yang et al 2019c although low concentration of ha 5 mg l did not change the impediment of gibbsite colloids on u vi transport relatively high concentration of ha 20 mg l improved the transport of u vi and gibbsite colloids yang et al 2019a ha colloids can also enhance the transport of ferrihydrite colloids and arsenic at ph 7 0 and 9 8 ma et al 2018 in this work the tl i mobility was obviously accelerated consistent with other studies these facilitated trends might be caused by either the association of aqueous metals with ha via complexing with functional groups carboxylic phenolic alkyl and aromatic into tl i ha complexes or the competed effects between ha and aqueous metals for adsorption sites on sand surfaces chen et al 2020 nriagu 1998 wang et al 2014 as previous studies reported huangfu et al 2019 the potentials of ha and surfaces of quartz sands tend to become more negative with ph increasing where ha attached onto the surfaces of quartz sands more difficultly and the amount of ha tl complexes increased both situations above may further promote the transport of tl i under higher ph conditions therefore ha exhibited a higher facilitated effect on the transport of tl i at higher ph in contrast under lower ph conditions the electrostatic repulsion between ha and quartz sands would become weak and thus van der waals forces were dominant indicating that more ha attached onto the quartz sands including part ha tl complexes in addition the presence of organic matter constituents would change the zeta potentials of quartz sand by their adsorption onto the sand surfaces zhang et al 2020 which might increase the amount of tl adsorption under lower ph conditions it is reported that a ha coated sand was regarded as a novel sorbent in permeable reactive barrier for environmental remediation of groundwater polluted with copper and cadmium ions faisal et al 2020 these explanations could give an insight into the effects of ha on the metal transport therefore in this study ha significantly improved the transport of tl i under neutral and alkaline conditions while ha might slightly inhibited tl i mobility under the acid condition ph 3 2 3 2 3 the transport of ha the overall btcs of ha in the individual and binary systems were shown in fig s5 which were asymmetric and strongly influenced by ph and is it was presented that the c c0 of ha jumped before approximately 2 5 pvs then slowly climbed and arrived at peak at approximately 7 0 pvs followed by plummeting without tailing this was recognized to occur the blocking process where the deposited ha might have prevented growing colloids from attaching to the quartz sand surface babakhani et al 2017 in ha individual systems with ph increasing the ha broke the columns easier and the effluent recovery of ha were 46 50 65 28 and 67 32 at ph 3 2 7 0 and 9 8 respectively table 1 in the case of is when nano3 was at 1 and 50 mmol l 64 44 and 57 05 of ha can pass through the porous media the breakthrough of ha in binary systems was less than that in individual systems in general improved breakthrough of ha could obtained under higher ph or lower is conditions which was consistent with other research reports and predictions of derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory yang et al 2019c accordingly the electrostatic interactions are dependent of ph and is liu et al 1995 higher ph can decrease the zeta potentials of ha colloids while increasing is can diminish the thickness of diffuse double layers both situations weakened the electrostatic repulsions between ha particles and sand surfaces and thus amplified retention capability compared with individual ha the presence of tl i impeded to some extent the ha breakthrough tl i might screen the surface potentials of ha by formation of tl ha complexes and thus decreased negative charges on ha so electrostatic repulsion between ha and quartz surfaces was decreased similar results could be obtained in their studies chen et al 2018 wang et al 2014 yang et al 2019c d it is reported that u vi decreased the ha colloidal stability a higher size and a lower zeta potential and thus improved the ha mobility yang et al 2019b 3 3 bsa inhibited tl i transport to explicate the effects of bsa on tl i transport comparison of the btcs of tl i with or without bsa was presented in fig 3 generally speaking the tl movement was inhibited by the bsa and the recovery of tl i decreased almost a quarter as can be seen btcs of tl i both with or without bsa were well fitted with the non equilibrium two sites model and the r of tl i with bsa through the column was higher than that without bsa table 1 it was also showed that the retention capacity of tl i in sand columns increased approximately 1 59 folds from 7 18 10 3 to 11 39 10 3 mg g when the ph increased from 3 2 to 9 8 the effluent recovery of tl transport with the bsa were lower than those without bsa at the same conditions because the bsa behaved as the inhibitors on tl and decreased its mobility btcs of individual bsa in varying conditions were presented in fig s6 and the two sites model also well described the bsa transport in water saturated porous media sole bsa transport was less sensitive to ph and is the recovery of bsa were increased from 45 37 to 59 55 as ph increased from 3 2 to 9 8 while 60 80 and 51 06 broke through the columns at is 1 and 50 table s7 respectively the level of bsa recovery in the binary systems was slightly greater than that in the absence of the tl i table s7 indicating that the presence of tl i has a little influence on the transport of bsa this possibly resulted from that bsa has a molecular mass of 66 4 kda which was not susceptible to the chemical conditions bal et al 2013 moreover approximate half bsa in binary systems deposited on the sands and the retention capacities of bsa on columns were 9 28 10 3 7 57 10 3 and 6 28 10 3 mg g at ph 3 2 7 0 and 9 8 respectively when is increased from 1 to 50 mmol l the retention capacities of bsa improved from 6 51 10 3 to 7 90 10 3 mg g bsa is an amphiphilic molecule and commonly contains various metal binding sites including the cys34 residue and its environment containing s site n teminal site nts site a and multi metal binding site depending on its structure and metal ion specificity bal et al 2013 it also has been reported that biosorption s site exhibited a stronger complexed ability for tl i stability constants log k 1 25 nriagu 1998 moreover the deposition of bsa onto sand surfaces had been observed thus the inhibition of tl i in the presence of bsa may result from complexed sites provided by deposited bsa macromolecular yang et al reported that the stronger effects of bsa than that of humic substances on biochar carbon transport were attributed that bsa had larger molecular weight and caused the larger thickness of bsa adsorption layer yang et al 2019e consequently such a preferential retention of tl i was expected to occur in the presence of bsa 3 4 mathematical model in order to understand the transport mechanisms of tl i in water saturated porous media modified cde models were used in this study the one site kinetic model incorporating the langmurian or blocking function failed to fit the entire btcs of tl i and ha or bsa at various conditions data not showed however the two sites chemical non equilibrium model and two sites kinetics attachment detachment model were applied to simulate the transport behavior of tl i and ha or bsa in water saturated sand columns babakhani et al 2017 3 4 1 tl i transport model a two sites non equilibrium model was used to describe tl i transport the fitted btcs were presented as dash lines in figs 1 to 3 fitted parameter r was an applicable coefficient for evaluation of the retention of tl i on sands with ph increasing and is decreasing r for tl i was greatly increased additionally at ph 7 0 r for tracer was 1 whereas for tl i r was 3 23 and the kd 0 64 can be easily calculated according to eq s2 the parameter β represented the fraction of exchange sites partitioning coefficient and β of tl i transport tended to decrease with ph increasing table 1 one possible explanation was that tl i retention in columns was dominated by non equilibrium adsorption with ph increasing with respect to the first order kinetic rate coefficient mass transfer coefficient the lower ω values could be obtained at higher is which was related to the stronger competition of tl with na under higher is conditions wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 3 4 2 ha and bsa transport model model fitted first order attachment rate coefficients k1a k2a and first order detachment rate coefficients k1d were used to describe ha attachment and detachment on the sand surfaces respectively smax2 was defined as the maximum solid phase retention capacity of site 2 the fitted parameters for ha were summarized in table s6 in general the values of k2a were lower than that of k1a and k1d indicating that ha attachment was dominated by reversible attachment on site 2 this phenomenon might be caused by the presence of unfavorable surfaces i e unfavorable attachment condition for ha attachment with ph increasing k1a and k1d steadily increased while k1a and k1d diminished with is increasing both the smax2 and k2a also decreased which could be attributed to unfavorable transport of ha under higher ph and lower is it was reported that the akaganeite colloids with positive potential exhibited a gradual increase value of k1a in the presence of u vi as ph increased ge et al 2018b the btcs of bsa can be simulated by the two sites kinetic model with a langmurian blocking function for each site fig s6 and fig 3 in general the btcs were initially delayed 1 pore volume next they rapidly increased and then they slowly approached the plateau the value of k1 was approximately one order of magnitude greater than k2 and smax1 was approximate to smax2 the time of breakthrough was mainly determined by k1 and smax1 and more delay is expected for higher values of k1 and smax1 bsa reached to complete deposition until both the solid phase concentration of bsa in site 1 and site 2 were approximate to smax1 and smax1 respectively after the bsa filled fully in sites 1 the shapes of btcs was sharply rising and strongly affected by the values of k2 and smax2 other studies on colloids transport in porous media have observed a similar delay sasidharan et al 2014 the greatest discrepancy between the measured data and model calculated curve occurs under higher ph conditions in the tailing segment part when the model slightly overpredicts tl retention ability this model data deviation probably resulted from overestimation of tl the model can also underestimate the ha or bsa mobility ha or bsa should not have been released from porous media surface because of irreversible deposition but slight complexed ha or bsa metal might release overall the model fitted parameters and high pearson s correlation coefficient r2 0 96 between observed and fitted data reflected that the two sites models can capture the main transport features of tl i ha and bsa in water saturated porous media 4 conclusions the transport behaviors of tl i have the potential to influence the environmental fate in natural water systems and the removal of tl in engineering water systems in this study we systematically explored the effects of inorganic anions carbonate and phosphate and macro organic matters ha and bsa which are important components of natural water bodies on the transport of tl i in water saturated sand column under different conditions ph and is the transport of tl i was significantly influenced by is and ph and delay breakthrough of tl i could be examined at higher ph and lower is the presence of carbonate or phosphate inhibited the mobility of tl i in columns ha could not only compete adsorption sites with tl i on sand surface but also complex tl i and thus facilitated the tl i mobility however bsa has a large molecular weight and added extra retention regions for tl i the transport of tl i became tough in the presence of bsa the btcs of tl i were simulated by stanmod software with a dual sites non equilibrium model which may predict the tl i transport behaviors in water saturated porous media ha transport and bsa transport were simulated using hydrus 1d software with dual sites kinetic models revealing that blocking or kinetic attachments dominated the ha interactions with porous media and langmuir type blocking dominated the bsa transport this work will contribute to understand the environmental processes of tl i first the outcomes of this investigation will help understand the environmental fate and transport of tl i e g soils groundwater and subsurface environments second it is beneficial to adjust conditions of engineered infiltration systems for removing tl from contaminated waters declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17522,agriculture the largest global water consumer accounts for 70 of freshwater use thereby considerably influencing water availability the use of treated wastewater tww for agricultural irrigation has been suggested as a possible solution to help mitigate water scarcity without disrupting food production however despite the benefits of tww irrigation it is often characterized by high salinity that can reduce crop performance and damage soil structure in israel over 50 of the water used for irrigation is tww and a third of the produced tww undergoes soil aquifer treatment sat i e infiltration and percolation to groundwater through the soil before utilization for irrigation in parallel seawater desalination provides about 80 of the urban and industrial sector water use these developments in israel s water economy during the last three decades accompanied by extensive governmental monitoring enabled us to harness high resolution nation wide datasets to study the effects of the large scale introduction of desalination and sat on tww quality and salinity in particular the analyses revealed that large scale desalination considerably reduced the salinity of tww to levels similar to freshwater up to 70 and 60 for cl and na respectively however sodium absorption ratio remained unchanged due to the concurrent reductions of na ca and mg mg was reduced to levels that can potentially harm both crops and human health while b concentrations increased to levels of possible toxicity to crops suggesting the need for stringent requirements in the post treatment process salinity of groundwater was increased by sat in the long term but was reduced after the introduction of desalination the results encompassing almost three decades of water monitoring suggest that high quality tww with a significant portion of desalinated base water can provide groundwater salinity remediation services keywords agriculture irrigation water reuse water treatment sustainability 1 introduction many arid and semi arid regions are experiencing water shortage and diminishing water supplies due to population growth pollution of natural water resources and climate change in the face of these paramount challenges utilization of treated wastewater tww for irrigation is increasingly considered as a viable option to reduce the stress on natural water resources while providing a cost effective alternative water source for irrigation kalavrouziotis et al 2015 across the globe tww use for irrigation is increasing sato et al 2013 for example in israel spain and california 85 40 70 and 30 of the tww respectively is reused for irrigation jodar abellan et al 2019 reznik et al 2017 sheikh et al 2018 an additional benefit of tww is that they are rich in nutrients thus reducing the need for fertilization while providing an alternative to discharge into rivers or the sea which entails environmental implications the food and agriculture organization fao along with other un agencies consider tww reuse for irrigation as part of the solution for urgent global environmental problems un water 2017 winpenny et al 2010 despite the benefits of tww reuse there are growing concerns involving the long term environmental and agronomic effects of irrigation with tww which contain higher levels of salts then the source water global salt nacl consumption is immense with over 30 million tons a year consumed in the european union alone leading to an increase of salinity and sodicity of the urban effluents and consequently of the derived tww bernstein 2009 lefebvre and moletta 2006 conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtp remove organic matter and suspended solids from tww but not salts thus tww is often characterized by high electrical conductivity ec that reflects the total electrolyte load as well as high sodium absorption ratio sar an irrigation water quality parameter that is determined from concentrations of the ions na ca and mg sonune and ghate 2004 salt concentration in tww may further increase due to water evaporation during the treatment process and storage in reservoirs before utilization for irrigation thus irrigation with tww potentially exposes irrigated crops and soils to high levels of salinity causing negative effects on crop yield and the soil elgallal et al 2016 irrigation with tww was demonstrated to affect plant performance friedman et al 2007 and long term irrigation with tww was reported to increase the accumulation of salts and sar value reduce soil hydraulic conductivity and water retention and to increase soil degradation and erosion for various soil types jaramillo and restrepo 2017 lado and ben hur 2010 levy et al 2014 the negative effects of irrigation with tww on crops and the soil raises doubts regarding the long term agricultural and environmental sustainability of tww irrigation khanpae et al 2020 tal 2016 due to severe water shortage israel heavily relies on tww for agricultural irrigation in 2016 35 of the total agricultural lands in israel over 50 of the irrigated area 150 000 ha were irrigated with tww cohen et al 2018 fig 1 describes the extent and distribution of agricultural fields throughout the country which were irrigated with tww in 2016 about a third of the tww produced in israel are post treated by soil aquifer treatment sat at the shafdan which is the largest wwtp in israel sat includes percolation of tww through the soil to an underground aquifer in which it undergoes several processes including filtration biodegradation chemical precipitation adsorption ion exchange and finally dilution sharma and kennedy 2017 sat systems do not remove salts from effluents pescod 1992 therefore reductions of salts concentrations are caused by dilution due to mixing with groundwater another recent major development in israel s water economy is the introduction of seawater desalination for drinking water by reverse osmosis swro the first desalination plant began contributing water to the national water grid by the end of 2005 today desalinated water production capacity is about 580 mcm year and together with an additional 80 mcm year of brackish water desalination constitutes 80 of the total urban and industrial sector water use israel water authority 2019 table 1s supplemental describes the five seawater desalination plants in israel their locations can be observed in fig 1 desalination which aims to cope with the lack of drinking water in the domestic sector indirectly improves the quality of the base water that reaches the wwtp and therefore the quality of tww used for irrigation removal of chemical elements by desalination varies between elements with high rejection of na and cl in comparison to boron b tu et al 2010 several other issues related to the sustainability of desalination tww approach include the high energy demand of desalination potential microbiological and chemical pollution and the implications of discharge into the oceans hanjra et al 2012 missimer and maliva 2018 these developments in israel s water economy during the last three decades i e extensive wastewater treatment and sea water desalination for drinking water accompanied by extensive governmental high resolution monitoring provided a unique opportunity to evaluate on a nation wide scale the influence of desalination on tww quality furthermore examining changes in the quality of shafdan tww which is used extensively for agricultural irrigation provided an opportunity to examine how desalination affected pre and post sat water quality to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that a long term tww monitoring reflecting over a decade of nation wide sampling was used for spatial analysis of desalination s influence on tww quality considering the long term negative effects of tww irrigation and the unique position of israel s substantial utilization of both tww reuse and drinking water desalination the present study focused on two main goals 1 evaluating effects of large scale desalination on the chemical quality of the produced tww 2 evaluating long term effects of sat on the chemical quality of the tww and groundwater the hypotheses guiding the work plan were 1 desalination for drinking water reduces the salinity of the produced tww cl na and ec as well as the concentration of mg and ca and increases b 2 desalination is more effective than sat in reducing salt concentrations in the long term 3 the temporal changes in the chemical properties of the produced tww vary between wwtp and chemical parameters in relation to the quality of the source water which reaches the city to test these hypotheses we analyzed temporal changes in tww quality over ten years on a nation wide scale we compared wwtp throughout the country both affected and unaffected by desalination as well as the effect of sat treatment the chemical parameters examined were salinity cl na and ec as well as ca mg b and sar apart from contributing to understanding the effects of desalination on the quality of tww the information obtained is instrumental for better planning of integrated water resource management systems especially in arid and semi arid areas that suffer from water scarcity high salinity and unreliable water supplies 2 materials and methods the study was designed to accomplish four major tasks first we compiled nationwide high resolution governmental data sources to characterize changes and trends in the israel water economy over the last two decades next we compared six large wwtp half of which serve areas receiving desalinated drinking water and half that do not third we performed a basin wide decade long comparison of tww quality changes in two aquifer basins one that relies heavily on desalinated drinking water coastal and one that does not receive desalinated water kinneret finally we compared 30 years of data of shafdan tww quality before and after sat both the selected wwtp and aquifer basin analyses took advantage of israel s national park authority s unique high resolution dataset nituran which includes thousands of individual tww quality samples cohen et al 2018 the dataset contains sampling information for 80 different wwtp throughout israel out of which 24 are located within the coastal aquifer basin and seven in the kinneret basin the three selected wwtp without desalinated base water are located outside the kinneret basin fig 1 they were chosen because they are larger than the wwtp within the kinneret basin while still serving towns that do not receive desalinated drinking water 2 1 water economy trends data describing the changes in water consumption volumes by sector and water type was compiled by israel s water authority wa israel water authority 2016 the different water types include freshwater fw including desalination from 2006 tww shafdan tww sat floodwater saline and marginal desalinated water volumes were taken from israel s central bureau of statistics yearly reports which are based on wa data and were deducted from fw in the annual national water consumption results marginal water was combined with floodwater and saline water types from 2015 onwards industry was no longer calculated as a separate category and was combined with the domestic sector 2 2 analysis of selected wwtp the effect of desalination on the quality of the produced tww was evaluated by comparing changes in qualities of the tww over 10 years 2006 2016 six wwtps were selected for an in depth analysis of the changes in tww quality by two main criteria size treatment of at least 2 mcm year and location signifying whether a significant portion of water received comes from desalination the three selected desalinated base water plants wwtpdesal are shafdan pre sat beer sheva and ashdod and the three selected non desalinated base water plants wwtpfw are karmiel tiberias and hasolelim detailed in supplemental table 2s and fig 1 it is important to note that although general trends are known the exact percentage of desalinated water from the total volume of water supplied to the urban areas that each wwtp serves is not constant and precise records for this percentage are not available chemical parameters of tww samples from the six studied wwtps were plotted on an ordinary least squares ols regression model for the sampling period of 31 01 2006 to 28 09 2016 a total of 3893 days the samples were analyzed for cl na ca mg b and sar results presented for the tiberias wwtp represent a combination of the lower and upper tiberias plants cl na ca mg and b concentrations in the tww were compared to those of fw in israel which were adapted from tarchitzky et al 2016 the values were presented as a range to exhibit the large regional variability of these parameters 2 3 desalinated vs non desalinated source water basin wide analysis an analysis similar to the individual plants analysis was performed for all wwtp that are located in two aquifer basins the coastal aquifer basin in which all 5 desalination plants in israel are located and which therefore receives a high percentage of desalinated water and the kinneret basin includes the eastern galilee and golan basins which does not receive any desalinated water fig 1 the areas of the aquifer basins were based on the wa gis layer israel water authority 2013 that divides israel into seven aquifer basins with a modification to the coastal aquifer based on kurtzman et al 2013 the results were plotted on an ols regression model for the sampling period of 15 01 2006 to 24 11 2016 3967 days in total 2 4 soil aquifer treatment sat data collected by mekorot the national water company was used to analyze the influence of sat this data comprises tww quality parameters after the infiltration into the coastal aquifer reclaimed water for the years 1990 2017 based on samples from the monitoring wells of the aquifer in the infiltration zone aharoni et al 2017 2018 halperin and aharoni 2005 2006 2007 2011 2013 2014 the pre sat tww chemical quality namely the quality of the water after undergoing mechanical and biological treatment primary and secondary treatment of the effluents but before infiltration is also presented based on the data from the mekorot reports there are differences between the pre sat shafdan results of the nituran and mekorot dataset as they represent separate sampling methodology both in sampling location and their frequency the results of tww quality were also compared to recommended water quality values for irrigation based on the fao irrigation and drainage paper 29 ayers and westcot 1985 2 5 data sources procedures and scripts data of annual water use is based on israel water authority 2016 data on the quality of the tww at the end of the treatment process was based on the nituran database which is maintained by the israel nature and parks authority npa on behalf of wa cohen et al 2018 it contains cl na mg ca and b data which facilitated the calculation of sar due to gaps in monitoring in the selected wwtp ec values were available only for the regional analysis and shafdan sat results although tens of samples are available for each chemical parameter per wwtp variability is expected in the results due to the dynamic nature of the wwtp processes and constantly changing quality of the effluent inputs data analysis and graphing were accomplished using python 3 using the anaconda distribution relying heavily on the numpy pandas and geopandas modules statistics calculations were executed using the statsmodels module graphs were created using matplotlib and seaborn modules maps were created using qgis 3 with belltopo sans fonts selected scripts used and data tables are available in github 3 results and discussion despite the improvement in treatment technologies in the past decades salinity levels of tww continues to be relatively high kalavrouziotis et al 2015 in recent decades desalination became an affordable solution to overcome the shortage of water for the urban and industrial sectors with the potential to reduce urban tww salinity yet the high costs of desalination restricts usage of desalinated water for agriculture jones et al 2019 quist jensen et al 2015 thus the goal of this study was to assess the impact of the introduction of large scale desalination on the salinity and quality of tww irrigation 3 1 multiyear trends in israel s water economy between 1998 and 2016 despite annual variations the agricultural domestic and industrial sectors continued to consume a similar volume of water fig 2 a however the type of the water used changed considerably fig 2b while freshwater usage dropped by 40 during this period tww use including shafdan more than doubled from 271 to 567 mcm year desalination which was introduced in 2006 increased steadily to 543 mcm year by 2016 or 38 of israel s potable water fig 2c presents the change in annual agricultural water consumption by water type tww was divided into shafdan tww and other tww which provided 45 and 33 of the total tww volume in 2006 and 2016 respectively in 2006 tww constituted only 32 of the total water used for agriculture while by 2016 it increased to 44 whereas fw comprised less than 40 the remaining irrigation water was saline water used in the arava desert region and to a lesser degree storm runoff in essence the results demonstrate how the introduction of desalination for domestic use and the increased use of tww for agricultural use filled the gap created by the significant decrease in fw availability while the majority of freshwater used for agriculture comes from groundwater and surface reservoirs an unknown portion of water supplied from mekorot contains desalinated water 3 2 effects of desalination on tww quality 3 2 1 selected wwtp the results in figs 3 5 present the decade long changes in concentrations of cl na mg ca sar and b for the three wwtpdesal shafdan ashdod and beer sheva and the three wwtpfw karmiel hasolelim and tiberias for all three wwtpdesal cl concentration in the tww significantly decreased over the ten years fig 3a1 the rate of decrease in the ashdod plant was three times higher compared to beer sheva and shafdan fig 3a1 the wwtpfw show no significant trend except karmiel that shows a slight increase fig 3a2 na concentration in the tww from the three wwtpdesal decreased over the ten years the rate of decrease in the ashdod plant was about double the rate of the shafdan and nearly six times the rate of the beer sheva wwtp fig 3b1 no significant trends were observed for na in the wwtpfw fig 3b2 the faster rate of change of na and cl in the ashdod plant compared to compared to shafdan and beer sheva can be explained by the higher fraction of desalinated base water reaching the wwtp similar to the tww concentrations of cl and na ca and mg concentrations in all three wwtpdesal decreased throughout the 10 years fig 4 a1 b1 for ca the rate of decrease over time was similar for the beer sheva and ashdod wwtp but unlike cl and na the rate of change for the shafdan was slightly lower fig 4 a possible explanation for the less pronounced changes in ca compared to cl and na is that as part of the post treatment sulfuric acid is used to dissolve calcite to reach ca concentration of 40 45 mg l to maintain stable alkalinity and hardness levels of the water yermiyahu et al 2007 for mg the rate of decrease for ashdod 2 6 mg l year was larger compared to shafdan and beer sheva 1 8 mg l year fig 4b1 in the case of ashdod and beer sheva by 2016 mg concentrations were approaching 0 mg l fig 4b1 for ashdod this is due to the higher fraction of desalinated base water as explained above while beer sheva began with a lower concentration of mg the wwtpfw showed no significant trends for both ca and mg fig 4a2 b2 no significant trends were apparent for the calculated sar in most of the wwtpdesal fig 5 a1 and wwtpfw fig 5a2 with only ashdod showing a decrease over time p 0 04 this may reflect an outcome of the concomitant reduction in na mg and ca concentrations and thus the sar value which is based on a ratio of these ions was unaffected thus we did not observe an increase in sar as predicted by lahav et al 2010 nonetheless mg supplementation can contribute to a decrease in sar and is also advantageous for drinking water quality requiring further cost benefit analysis b is the only element that increased in concentration over time in the tww for the wwtpdesal a 38 51 increase in concentration was observed fig 5b1 an increase was also observed for two wwtpfw tiberias by 32 and karmiel by 95 although the karmiel results are highly variable and are based on relatively few samples fig 5b2 according to the regulation in israel average monthly concentrations of b in tww used for irrigation may not surpass 0 4 mg l israel ministry of health 2010 while the beer sheva results tended to be higher compared to the shafdan and ashdod there were number of values for ashdod that surpass this threshold table 1 presents the chemical quality in the middle of the first and the last years of study i e 2006 and 2016 and the mean and median values over the 10 years the percent of change for this duration is presented only for cases where the p value is 0 05 the analysis of the selected wwtpdesal especially ashdod emphasizes the full potential impact of desalination on tww quality with changes of up to 70 decrease in cl 60 decrease in na 50 decrease in ca and above 90 decrease in mg concentrations over 10 years since the introduction of desalination to israel in comparison tww quality in wwtpfw figs 3 5 a b2 did not change and even increased in the case of karmiel cl results see fig 3a2 this suggests desalination is the main driver for the significant decrease of the tww salinity these results highlight the immense effect of desalination on reducing the salinity of tww the decrease in salinity of the tww can in turn reduce salt accumulation in the irrigated plants as is indirectly supported by previous evidence for reduced concentrations in citrus leaves raveh and ben gal 2018 reduced salinity of the irrigation water may also decrease irrigation requirements as less water will be required for leaching salts from the soil letey et al 2011 3 2 2 basin wide analysis analysis of the variability of tww quality applied for irrigation in different aquifer basins allows for a better understanding of regional and local differences between the potential pollution of the different aquifers the aquifer basin results show a decrease of 20 23 for cl na and ca concentrations and almost 38 for mg coastal concentrations supplemental fig 1s table 2 overall the basin wide analysis shows a similar trend to the selected wwtp results as can be seen in table 2 which summarizes the initial mid 2006 and final mid 2016 results moreover the results of wide basin analysis fall within the range of results of the selected plants coastal for wwtpdesal and kinneret for wwtpfw 3 3 sat analysis the shafdan pre and post sat results further support the conclusion concerning the potential of desalination for drinking water for reducing tww salinity these results also suggest that the quality of the tww is sufficient in regards to salt contents to potentially improve the quality of groundwater that has been polluted by salts the shafdan sat operation began in 1987 until 2006 groundwater salinity both as ec fig 6 g and cl and na concentrations fig 6a b constantly increased over time raising doubts regarding the long term sustainability of sat systems see also cikurel et al 2012 oren et al 2007 additionally ca fig 6c and mg fig 6d also increased during this time the increase in groundwater salinity over the pre desalination years is unsurprising considering that sat does not remove salts from the tww sharma and kennedy 2017 in essence the reduction in salinity is a direct result of the dilution of the relatively high salinity water with the lower salinity groundwater while in the short term this strategy might be successful in the long term the groundwater increases in salinity and can lose its potential to dilute the salts once desalination s influence took effect it resulted in a steep drop of pre sat yearly average concentrations of cl na mg ca and ec as a result the post sat values of these parameters began to stabilize and then decrease fig 6a d g reverting to their levels in the first year of sat operation hence sat alone especially in large volumes is not a sufficient solution for high salinity tww however in combination with desalination base water the salinity of the groundwater recharged by sat begins to decrease significantly by 2017 the aquifer water quality began to return to concentrations seen only in the first few years of the plant s operation this strongly suggests that high quality tww together with desalination base water can help remediate groundwater salinity for cl na and ec fig 6a b g the dilution factor of the aquifer is clearly demonstrated for the pre desalination period from 2006 onwards the pre sat concentrations began to drop significantly and from 2011 the dilution no longer played a role with minimal difference between pre and post sat levels on the other hand ca fig 6c pre sat concentrations were consistently below the post sat values this can reflect remineralization from the calcareous sandstone at the aquifer unsaturated zone due to calcite dissolution ganot et al 2018 mg fig 6d exhibits a similar dilution trend to cl and na in the pre desalination period however once concentrations began to drop after the introduction of desalination at around 20 mg l the trend reverses with post sat concentration beginning to be higher than pre sat this process can be explained by cation exchange processes with ca that begins below a threshold mg concentration similar trend of cation exchange was demonstrated in managed aquifer recharge of desalinated water in the northern part of the coastal aquifer ganot et al 2018 change in pre and post sat sar fig 6e resemble the trend for na although the reduction post desalination is less marked this can be explained by the desalination induced decrease in ca and mg as well however further study is required into the dynamics of desalination effects on sar interestingly b fig 6f concentration steadily increased until the year 2000 and then decreased until 2006 when the concentrations stabilized pre sat b concentrations before 2004 significantly decreased with time due to the reduction of b in laundry detergents as a result of stricter regulations mandated by the israeli ministry of environment kloppmann et al 2009 vengosh et al 2005 between 2002 2005 post sat concentrations of b were higher than pre sat concentrations this may reflect processes occurring at the unsaturated zone it was suggested that high b concentrations in the infiltrated tww led to adsorption of b to clay minerals leading to saturation of the adsorption sites and a reverse process when b concentrations decreased vengosh et al 1994 vengosh and keren 1996 therefore the recharge of b depleted tww can trigger mobilization of b from the unsaturated zone into the tww however after 2007 pre sat concentration are slightly higher than post sat levels one possible explanation is adsorption of b ions to organic matter and suspended solids in the infiltrations ponds sat is an expensive and land consuming process in recent years the shafdan plant has experienced a reduction in the infiltration rate due to long term processes that are currently under investigation aharoni et al 2017 in terms of cl na ec and sar the results suggest that sat of desalinated base water no longer improves quality we do see a slight reduction in b and an increase in mg which may prove beneficial however these results raise questions concerning the cost effectiveness of long term sat for desalinated base water tww this issue requires further study focusing also on effects of sat on organic matter suspended solids and major nutrients n and p 3 4 understanding the different rates of change between selected wwtp in all three wwtp cl na ca and mg decrease with desalination base water but to varying degrees figs 3 4 however in all cases the change is gradual and linear the continuous and linear change can be explained by the extent of the blending of natural and desalinated water in the water supplied for urban use the gradual increase in desalination volume in israel throughout the study period as more desalination plants became operational supplemental table 1s increased over time the proportion of desalinated water in the water supplied for urban use the source of the base water of effluents received in the wwtp represents a mixture of desalinated water with freshwater sources including the kinneret sea of galilee water which is characterized by relatively high cl concentrations 240 300 mg l markel 2014 and a blend of water from the coastal and yartan aquifers that have variable concentrations temporally and spatially as the volume of desalinated water produced increased the percentage of natural sources decreased thereby lowering concentrations of salts na cl and micro nutrients ca mg in drinking water and consequently in the tww the blending of natural and desalinated water can also explain the difference between the rates of change of concentrations between the different wwtp while both the ashdod and shafdan wwtp are situated near desalination plants fig 1 the ashdod plant has less than 10 the capacity of the shafdan supplemental table 1s this capacity reflects the population size of the municipalities they serve the ashdod plant reflects mostly the tww of the ashdod municipality pop of 220 000 shafdan on the other hand serves 2 5 million people and 7000 factories and includes a wide range of municipalities including the large cities of the tel aviv municipality area some of these municipalities such as kfar qassam which is located 25 km northeast of the desalination plants obtain some of their drinking water from groundwater wells beer sheva while in size is similar in scale to ashdod is located almost 50 km southeast of the ashkelon desalination plant see fig 1 and therefore its lower rate of change reflects a lower ratio of desalinated and natural water ashdod in contrast received desalinated water first from the nearby ashkelon plant and later from the ashdod plant these differences represent three different models of tww with desalination base water the ashdod wwtp represents a one major source of effluents from the ashdod municipality high percentage of desalination base water and high salinity in the pre desalination freshwater the beer sheva wwtp represents a single source of effluents medium percentage of desalination base water and low salinity in the pre desalination freshwater finally shafdan represents multiple sources of effluents medium percentage of desalination base water and medium salinity in the pre desalination freshwater as the results show figs 3 5 the single source effluents ashdod beer sheva with a high percentage of desalination water ashdod are the most effective in regards of salinity sodification sar reduction for areas with high background concentrations of salinity 3 5 a closer look at the temporal changes in tww water quality the most significant change observed in the tww of the selected plants was in cl which decreased by 24 68 during the ten years fig 3a1 2 table 1 this reduction reflects the stringent requirement for cl concentration in the desalination plants 20 mg l for all plants except palmahim 80 mg l israel water authority 2019 for na these changes are slightly smaller fig 3b with a 21 58 decrease over ten years table 1 however for wwtpfw no decline was apparent fig 3b1 2 and a slight increase was recorded for cl in the karmiel plant fig 3b1 in all three cases of wwtpdesal the na concentrations by 2016 were beneath the threshold allowed for agricultural irrigation 150 mg l israel ministry of health 2010 while in 2006 only the beer sheva water quality was at the permitted concentrations it appears that without the introduction of desalination the wwtp would not have been able to adhere to the qualities mandated by the regulations the full potential of desalination in improving tww quality is represented by the upper values of this decrease seen in the ashdod twwp as the volume of the desalinated water introduced into the system will become steady as long as no new plants are built we expect the salt concentrations of tww to eventually reach a steady state crops sensitive to cl such as avocado for example tolerate concentrations of 180 mg l or less ayers and westcot 1985 these concentrations were achieved in 2016 by both the ashdod and beer sheva wwtp while the shafdan concentrations in 2016 were 220 mg l which is still lower than the concentration allowed for unlimited tww irrigation according to israel s ministry of health regulations 250 mg l israel ministry of health 2010 the karmiel plant which demonstrated an increase in cl from 50 mg l in 2006 to 200 mg l in 2016 fig 3a2 due to the low salinity of the base water supplied to the city this suggests that in areas with low groundwater salinity desalination may not be required however this might change if the trend of salinity increase continues overall the introduction of desalination in addition to providing a much needed source of freshwater for domestic use helped to reduce tww salinity significantly by 2016 cl levels in both ashdod and beer sheva and na levels in ashdod were reduced to levels within the range of israel s freshwater sources table 1 in the long run the improvement of water quality can lead to reduced irrigation requirements other potential benefits include higher crop productivity and reduced soil damage becker et al 2011 tenne et al 2013 both ca and mg are good indicators for the impact of desalination on water quality as they are not as prevalent in effluents compared to cl and na therefore the rate of their decrease is mostly affected by the percentage of blending with natural fw and less by the quality of the effluents the added ca serves as a buffer that limits the total reduction and reduction rate mg on the other hand is not added to the water and indeed the mg concentrations decreased to beneath 5 mg l by 2016 fig 4b1 and table 1 at both the ashdod and beer sheva wwtp mg deficiency in crops which is increasingly becoming a limiting factor in intensive crop production under desalinated base water can harm essential plant functions including chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthesis and thereby adversely affect plant growth and development guo et al 2016 moreover some studies show a connection between low concentrations of mg 10 mg l in drinking water and increased risk for coronary heart disease rosen et al 2018 since levels lower than 10 mg l were observed in the tww we can assume that the drinking water in many cases do not reach that threshold further research is warranted to analyze the cost benefit of adding mg to desalinated water the recommended b concentration range for irrigation of b sensitive crops is 0 5 0 75 mg l ayers and westcot 1985 moreover the range of b concentrations in israel s freshwater is between 0 08 0 25 mg l table 1 results in fig 5b1 and table 1 show that especially in the beer sheva and ashdod plants the number of samples that approach and surpass the 0 5 mg l threshold increases with time this may indicate that the prolonged use of desalinated water may lead to b toxicity for sensitive plants as was already demonstrated for citrus pereira et al 2011 because of the high b concentrations in seawater ranging 4 5 6 5 mg l even with high filtration ability of the newest ro desalination technology it is challenging to reach concentrations below 0 5 mg l without an additional post treatment process shaffer et al 2012 while the initial relatively high b concentrations in the beer sheva wwtp can be attributed to natural causes leading to higher concentrations in groundwater in the area the concentration of the majority of groundwater in the coastal aquifer is lower than 0 3 mg l including in the ashdod area vengosh et al 2005 this suggests that the increase of desalinated source water is the cause of this change the requirement for b concentration in desalinated water in israel ranges from 0 3 mg l for sorek ashdod and hadera plants to 0 4 mg l for ashkelon and palmahim plants israel water authority 2019 this removal of b from tww is performed by increasing ph and converting b into borate ion which can be more easily removed kloppmann et al 2018 despite these requirements within the study timeframe b concentrations in several tww samples ranged between 0 5 0 7 mg l for the ashdod and beer sheva wwtp fig 5b1 thus two main factors may have induced the observed increase in b concentrations a high concentrations of b added to the urban wastewater from detergents and washing powders due to regulations for limiting b in these products not fully enforced b unenforced regulations for restriction of b concentration in desalinated water to levels lower than 0 4 mg l the sharp reduction in pre sat b concentrations from 2000 to 2005 fig 6f pre desalination can be attributed to the enforced regulations for low b in detergents while the increase in pre sat b concentrations over time albeit still gradual begins a year after the onset of large scale desalination in 2006 this suggests that desalination is the significant factor leading to the increase in b this is further supported by the fact that for the hasolelim and tiberias twwpfw b concentrations did not increase fig 5b2 however further research including b isotope analysis is required to provide a more comprehensive answer concerning the source of the increasing b concentrations achieving b concentrations lower than 0 4 mg l as mandated by the regulation in israel will require more stringent post treatment or blending with low concentration b water while taking into account their cost effectiveness 4 conclusions the drinking water desalination approach resulted in a dramatic reduction of cl na and ec in the tww cl levels were reduced to the natural fw concentrations range rendering them sustainable in terms of salinity which entails positive ramifications for agriculture by reducing long term damage to soil and crops and reducing irrigation requirements while sat technology can provide high quality tww for agriculture in the long term it can increase groundwater salinity the introduction of desalination reversed the trend returning groundwater salinity to levels similar to the pre infiltration values these changes suggest that high quality tww with desalinated base water can remediate groundwater salinity desalination entails potential negative implications for agriculture such as reduction in ca and mg and an increase in b concentrations reductions in ca levels in the tww are prevented by the post treatment process of ca supplementation and the reduction in mg can cause deficiency in crops despite the reduction in na concentrations the drop in ca and mg prevents the decrease of sar while large scale desalination plants are not an appropriate solution for all countries especially for those landlocked the results of this study contain valuable insights for countries seeking to convert wastewater from an environmental nuisance to a valuable resource specifically to fully utilize the benefits and minimize the drawbacks of tww irrigation extensive and frequent monitoring of tww and groundwater quality is required to support informed management and policy decisions declaration of

17522,agriculture the largest global water consumer accounts for 70 of freshwater use thereby considerably influencing water availability the use of treated wastewater tww for agricultural irrigation has been suggested as a possible solution to help mitigate water scarcity without disrupting food production however despite the benefits of tww irrigation it is often characterized by high salinity that can reduce crop performance and damage soil structure in israel over 50 of the water used for irrigation is tww and a third of the produced tww undergoes soil aquifer treatment sat i e infiltration and percolation to groundwater through the soil before utilization for irrigation in parallel seawater desalination provides about 80 of the urban and industrial sector water use these developments in israel s water economy during the last three decades accompanied by extensive governmental monitoring enabled us to harness high resolution nation wide datasets to study the effects of the large scale introduction of desalination and sat on tww quality and salinity in particular the analyses revealed that large scale desalination considerably reduced the salinity of tww to levels similar to freshwater up to 70 and 60 for cl and na respectively however sodium absorption ratio remained unchanged due to the concurrent reductions of na ca and mg mg was reduced to levels that can potentially harm both crops and human health while b concentrations increased to levels of possible toxicity to crops suggesting the need for stringent requirements in the post treatment process salinity of groundwater was increased by sat in the long term but was reduced after the introduction of desalination the results encompassing almost three decades of water monitoring suggest that high quality tww with a significant portion of desalinated base water can provide groundwater salinity remediation services keywords agriculture irrigation water reuse water treatment sustainability 1 introduction many arid and semi arid regions are experiencing water shortage and diminishing water supplies due to population growth pollution of natural water resources and climate change in the face of these paramount challenges utilization of treated wastewater tww for irrigation is increasingly considered as a viable option to reduce the stress on natural water resources while providing a cost effective alternative water source for irrigation kalavrouziotis et al 2015 across the globe tww use for irrigation is increasing sato et al 2013 for example in israel spain and california 85 40 70 and 30 of the tww respectively is reused for irrigation jodar abellan et al 2019 reznik et al 2017 sheikh et al 2018 an additional benefit of tww is that they are rich in nutrients thus reducing the need for fertilization while providing an alternative to discharge into rivers or the sea which entails environmental implications the food and agriculture organization fao along with other un agencies consider tww reuse for irrigation as part of the solution for urgent global environmental problems un water 2017 winpenny et al 2010 despite the benefits of tww reuse there are growing concerns involving the long term environmental and agronomic effects of irrigation with tww which contain higher levels of salts then the source water global salt nacl consumption is immense with over 30 million tons a year consumed in the european union alone leading to an increase of salinity and sodicity of the urban effluents and consequently of the derived tww bernstein 2009 lefebvre and moletta 2006 conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtp remove organic matter and suspended solids from tww but not salts thus tww is often characterized by high electrical conductivity ec that reflects the total electrolyte load as well as high sodium absorption ratio sar an irrigation water quality parameter that is determined from concentrations of the ions na ca and mg sonune and ghate 2004 salt concentration in tww may further increase due to water evaporation during the treatment process and storage in reservoirs before utilization for irrigation thus irrigation with tww potentially exposes irrigated crops and soils to high levels of salinity causing negative effects on crop yield and the soil elgallal et al 2016 irrigation with tww was demonstrated to affect plant performance friedman et al 2007 and long term irrigation with tww was reported to increase the accumulation of salts and sar value reduce soil hydraulic conductivity and water retention and to increase soil degradation and erosion for various soil types jaramillo and restrepo 2017 lado and ben hur 2010 levy et al 2014 the negative effects of irrigation with tww on crops and the soil raises doubts regarding the long term agricultural and environmental sustainability of tww irrigation khanpae et al 2020 tal 2016 due to severe water shortage israel heavily relies on tww for agricultural irrigation in 2016 35 of the total agricultural lands in israel over 50 of the irrigated area 150 000 ha were irrigated with tww cohen et al 2018 fig 1 describes the extent and distribution of agricultural fields throughout the country which were irrigated with tww in 2016 about a third of the tww produced in israel are post treated by soil aquifer treatment sat at the shafdan which is the largest wwtp in israel sat includes percolation of tww through the soil to an underground aquifer in which it undergoes several processes including filtration biodegradation chemical precipitation adsorption ion exchange and finally dilution sharma and kennedy 2017 sat systems do not remove salts from effluents pescod 1992 therefore reductions of salts concentrations are caused by dilution due to mixing with groundwater another recent major development in israel s water economy is the introduction of seawater desalination for drinking water by reverse osmosis swro the first desalination plant began contributing water to the national water grid by the end of 2005 today desalinated water production capacity is about 580 mcm year and together with an additional 80 mcm year of brackish water desalination constitutes 80 of the total urban and industrial sector water use israel water authority 2019 table 1s supplemental describes the five seawater desalination plants in israel their locations can be observed in fig 1 desalination which aims to cope with the lack of drinking water in the domestic sector indirectly improves the quality of the base water that reaches the wwtp and therefore the quality of tww used for irrigation removal of chemical elements by desalination varies between elements with high rejection of na and cl in comparison to boron b tu et al 2010 several other issues related to the sustainability of desalination tww approach include the high energy demand of desalination potential microbiological and chemical pollution and the implications of discharge into the oceans hanjra et al 2012 missimer and maliva 2018 these developments in israel s water economy during the last three decades i e extensive wastewater treatment and sea water desalination for drinking water accompanied by extensive governmental high resolution monitoring provided a unique opportunity to evaluate on a nation wide scale the influence of desalination on tww quality furthermore examining changes in the quality of shafdan tww which is used extensively for agricultural irrigation provided an opportunity to examine how desalination affected pre and post sat water quality to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that a long term tww monitoring reflecting over a decade of nation wide sampling was used for spatial analysis of desalination s influence on tww quality considering the long term negative effects of tww irrigation and the unique position of israel s substantial utilization of both tww reuse and drinking water desalination the present study focused on two main goals 1 evaluating effects of large scale desalination on the chemical quality of the produced tww 2 evaluating long term effects of sat on the chemical quality of the tww and groundwater the hypotheses guiding the work plan were 1 desalination for drinking water reduces the salinity of the produced tww cl na and ec as well as the concentration of mg and ca and increases b 2 desalination is more effective than sat in reducing salt concentrations in the long term 3 the temporal changes in the chemical properties of the produced tww vary between wwtp and chemical parameters in relation to the quality of the source water which reaches the city to test these hypotheses we analyzed temporal changes in tww quality over ten years on a nation wide scale we compared wwtp throughout the country both affected and unaffected by desalination as well as the effect of sat treatment the chemical parameters examined were salinity cl na and ec as well as ca mg b and sar apart from contributing to understanding the effects of desalination on the quality of tww the information obtained is instrumental for better planning of integrated water resource management systems especially in arid and semi arid areas that suffer from water scarcity high salinity and unreliable water supplies 2 materials and methods the study was designed to accomplish four major tasks first we compiled nationwide high resolution governmental data sources to characterize changes and trends in the israel water economy over the last two decades next we compared six large wwtp half of which serve areas receiving desalinated drinking water and half that do not third we performed a basin wide decade long comparison of tww quality changes in two aquifer basins one that relies heavily on desalinated drinking water coastal and one that does not receive desalinated water kinneret finally we compared 30 years of data of shafdan tww quality before and after sat both the selected wwtp and aquifer basin analyses took advantage of israel s national park authority s unique high resolution dataset nituran which includes thousands of individual tww quality samples cohen et al 2018 the dataset contains sampling information for 80 different wwtp throughout israel out of which 24 are located within the coastal aquifer basin and seven in the kinneret basin the three selected wwtp without desalinated base water are located outside the kinneret basin fig 1 they were chosen because they are larger than the wwtp within the kinneret basin while still serving towns that do not receive desalinated drinking water 2 1 water economy trends data describing the changes in water consumption volumes by sector and water type was compiled by israel s water authority wa israel water authority 2016 the different water types include freshwater fw including desalination from 2006 tww shafdan tww sat floodwater saline and marginal desalinated water volumes were taken from israel s central bureau of statistics yearly reports which are based on wa data and were deducted from fw in the annual national water consumption results marginal water was combined with floodwater and saline water types from 2015 onwards industry was no longer calculated as a separate category and was combined with the domestic sector 2 2 analysis of selected wwtp the effect of desalination on the quality of the produced tww was evaluated by comparing changes in qualities of the tww over 10 years 2006 2016 six wwtps were selected for an in depth analysis of the changes in tww quality by two main criteria size treatment of at least 2 mcm year and location signifying whether a significant portion of water received comes from desalination the three selected desalinated base water plants wwtpdesal are shafdan pre sat beer sheva and ashdod and the three selected non desalinated base water plants wwtpfw are karmiel tiberias and hasolelim detailed in supplemental table 2s and fig 1 it is important to note that although general trends are known the exact percentage of desalinated water from the total volume of water supplied to the urban areas that each wwtp serves is not constant and precise records for this percentage are not available chemical parameters of tww samples from the six studied wwtps were plotted on an ordinary least squares ols regression model for the sampling period of 31 01 2006 to 28 09 2016 a total of 3893 days the samples were analyzed for cl na ca mg b and sar results presented for the tiberias wwtp represent a combination of the lower and upper tiberias plants cl na ca mg and b concentrations in the tww were compared to those of fw in israel which were adapted from tarchitzky et al 2016 the values were presented as a range to exhibit the large regional variability of these parameters 2 3 desalinated vs non desalinated source water basin wide analysis an analysis similar to the individual plants analysis was performed for all wwtp that are located in two aquifer basins the coastal aquifer basin in which all 5 desalination plants in israel are located and which therefore receives a high percentage of desalinated water and the kinneret basin includes the eastern galilee and golan basins which does not receive any desalinated water fig 1 the areas of the aquifer basins were based on the wa gis layer israel water authority 2013 that divides israel into seven aquifer basins with a modification to the coastal aquifer based on kurtzman et al 2013 the results were plotted on an ols regression model for the sampling period of 15 01 2006 to 24 11 2016 3967 days in total 2 4 soil aquifer treatment sat data collected by mekorot the national water company was used to analyze the influence of sat this data comprises tww quality parameters after the infiltration into the coastal aquifer reclaimed water for the years 1990 2017 based on samples from the monitoring wells of the aquifer in the infiltration zone aharoni et al 2017 2018 halperin and aharoni 2005 2006 2007 2011 2013 2014 the pre sat tww chemical quality namely the quality of the water after undergoing mechanical and biological treatment primary and secondary treatment of the effluents but before infiltration is also presented based on the data from the mekorot reports there are differences between the pre sat shafdan results of the nituran and mekorot dataset as they represent separate sampling methodology both in sampling location and their frequency the results of tww quality were also compared to recommended water quality values for irrigation based on the fao irrigation and drainage paper 29 ayers and westcot 1985 2 5 data sources procedures and scripts data of annual water use is based on israel water authority 2016 data on the quality of the tww at the end of the treatment process was based on the nituran database which is maintained by the israel nature and parks authority npa on behalf of wa cohen et al 2018 it contains cl na mg ca and b data which facilitated the calculation of sar due to gaps in monitoring in the selected wwtp ec values were available only for the regional analysis and shafdan sat results although tens of samples are available for each chemical parameter per wwtp variability is expected in the results due to the dynamic nature of the wwtp processes and constantly changing quality of the effluent inputs data analysis and graphing were accomplished using python 3 using the anaconda distribution relying heavily on the numpy pandas and geopandas modules statistics calculations were executed using the statsmodels module graphs were created using matplotlib and seaborn modules maps were created using qgis 3 with belltopo sans fonts selected scripts used and data tables are available in github 3 results and discussion despite the improvement in treatment technologies in the past decades salinity levels of tww continues to be relatively high kalavrouziotis et al 2015 in recent decades desalination became an affordable solution to overcome the shortage of water for the urban and industrial sectors with the potential to reduce urban tww salinity yet the high costs of desalination restricts usage of desalinated water for agriculture jones et al 2019 quist jensen et al 2015 thus the goal of this study was to assess the impact of the introduction of large scale desalination on the salinity and quality of tww irrigation 3 1 multiyear trends in israel s water economy between 1998 and 2016 despite annual variations the agricultural domestic and industrial sectors continued to consume a similar volume of water fig 2 a however the type of the water used changed considerably fig 2b while freshwater usage dropped by 40 during this period tww use including shafdan more than doubled from 271 to 567 mcm year desalination which was introduced in 2006 increased steadily to 543 mcm year by 2016 or 38 of israel s potable water fig 2c presents the change in annual agricultural water consumption by water type tww was divided into shafdan tww and other tww which provided 45 and 33 of the total tww volume in 2006 and 2016 respectively in 2006 tww constituted only 32 of the total water used for agriculture while by 2016 it increased to 44 whereas fw comprised less than 40 the remaining irrigation water was saline water used in the arava desert region and to a lesser degree storm runoff in essence the results demonstrate how the introduction of desalination for domestic use and the increased use of tww for agricultural use filled the gap created by the significant decrease in fw availability while the majority of freshwater used for agriculture comes from groundwater and surface reservoirs an unknown portion of water supplied from mekorot contains desalinated water 3 2 effects of desalination on tww quality 3 2 1 selected wwtp the results in figs 3 5 present the decade long changes in concentrations of cl na mg ca sar and b for the three wwtpdesal shafdan ashdod and beer sheva and the three wwtpfw karmiel hasolelim and tiberias for all three wwtpdesal cl concentration in the tww significantly decreased over the ten years fig 3a1 the rate of decrease in the ashdod plant was three times higher compared to beer sheva and shafdan fig 3a1 the wwtpfw show no significant trend except karmiel that shows a slight increase fig 3a2 na concentration in the tww from the three wwtpdesal decreased over the ten years the rate of decrease in the ashdod plant was about double the rate of the shafdan and nearly six times the rate of the beer sheva wwtp fig 3b1 no significant trends were observed for na in the wwtpfw fig 3b2 the faster rate of change of na and cl in the ashdod plant compared to compared to shafdan and beer sheva can be explained by the higher fraction of desalinated base water reaching the wwtp similar to the tww concentrations of cl and na ca and mg concentrations in all three wwtpdesal decreased throughout the 10 years fig 4 a1 b1 for ca the rate of decrease over time was similar for the beer sheva and ashdod wwtp but unlike cl and na the rate of change for the shafdan was slightly lower fig 4 a possible explanation for the less pronounced changes in ca compared to cl and na is that as part of the post treatment sulfuric acid is used to dissolve calcite to reach ca concentration of 40 45 mg l to maintain stable alkalinity and hardness levels of the water yermiyahu et al 2007 for mg the rate of decrease for ashdod 2 6 mg l year was larger compared to shafdan and beer sheva 1 8 mg l year fig 4b1 in the case of ashdod and beer sheva by 2016 mg concentrations were approaching 0 mg l fig 4b1 for ashdod this is due to the higher fraction of desalinated base water as explained above while beer sheva began with a lower concentration of mg the wwtpfw showed no significant trends for both ca and mg fig 4a2 b2 no significant trends were apparent for the calculated sar in most of the wwtpdesal fig 5 a1 and wwtpfw fig 5a2 with only ashdod showing a decrease over time p 0 04 this may reflect an outcome of the concomitant reduction in na mg and ca concentrations and thus the sar value which is based on a ratio of these ions was unaffected thus we did not observe an increase in sar as predicted by lahav et al 2010 nonetheless mg supplementation can contribute to a decrease in sar and is also advantageous for drinking water quality requiring further cost benefit analysis b is the only element that increased in concentration over time in the tww for the wwtpdesal a 38 51 increase in concentration was observed fig 5b1 an increase was also observed for two wwtpfw tiberias by 32 and karmiel by 95 although the karmiel results are highly variable and are based on relatively few samples fig 5b2 according to the regulation in israel average monthly concentrations of b in tww used for irrigation may not surpass 0 4 mg l israel ministry of health 2010 while the beer sheva results tended to be higher compared to the shafdan and ashdod there were number of values for ashdod that surpass this threshold table 1 presents the chemical quality in the middle of the first and the last years of study i e 2006 and 2016 and the mean and median values over the 10 years the percent of change for this duration is presented only for cases where the p value is 0 05 the analysis of the selected wwtpdesal especially ashdod emphasizes the full potential impact of desalination on tww quality with changes of up to 70 decrease in cl 60 decrease in na 50 decrease in ca and above 90 decrease in mg concentrations over 10 years since the introduction of desalination to israel in comparison tww quality in wwtpfw figs 3 5 a b2 did not change and even increased in the case of karmiel cl results see fig 3a2 this suggests desalination is the main driver for the significant decrease of the tww salinity these results highlight the immense effect of desalination on reducing the salinity of tww the decrease in salinity of the tww can in turn reduce salt accumulation in the irrigated plants as is indirectly supported by previous evidence for reduced concentrations in citrus leaves raveh and ben gal 2018 reduced salinity of the irrigation water may also decrease irrigation requirements as less water will be required for leaching salts from the soil letey et al 2011 3 2 2 basin wide analysis analysis of the variability of tww quality applied for irrigation in different aquifer basins allows for a better understanding of regional and local differences between the potential pollution of the different aquifers the aquifer basin results show a decrease of 20 23 for cl na and ca concentrations and almost 38 for mg coastal concentrations supplemental fig 1s table 2 overall the basin wide analysis shows a similar trend to the selected wwtp results as can be seen in table 2 which summarizes the initial mid 2006 and final mid 2016 results moreover the results of wide basin analysis fall within the range of results of the selected plants coastal for wwtpdesal and kinneret for wwtpfw 3 3 sat analysis the shafdan pre and post sat results further support the conclusion concerning the potential of desalination for drinking water for reducing tww salinity these results also suggest that the quality of the tww is sufficient in regards to salt contents to potentially improve the quality of groundwater that has been polluted by salts the shafdan sat operation began in 1987 until 2006 groundwater salinity both as ec fig 6 g and cl and na concentrations fig 6a b constantly increased over time raising doubts regarding the long term sustainability of sat systems see also cikurel et al 2012 oren et al 2007 additionally ca fig 6c and mg fig 6d also increased during this time the increase in groundwater salinity over the pre desalination years is unsurprising considering that sat does not remove salts from the tww sharma and kennedy 2017 in essence the reduction in salinity is a direct result of the dilution of the relatively high salinity water with the lower salinity groundwater while in the short term this strategy might be successful in the long term the groundwater increases in salinity and can lose its potential to dilute the salts once desalination s influence took effect it resulted in a steep drop of pre sat yearly average concentrations of cl na mg ca and ec as a result the post sat values of these parameters began to stabilize and then decrease fig 6a d g reverting to their levels in the first year of sat operation hence sat alone especially in large volumes is not a sufficient solution for high salinity tww however in combination with desalination base water the salinity of the groundwater recharged by sat begins to decrease significantly by 2017 the aquifer water quality began to return to concentrations seen only in the first few years of the plant s operation this strongly suggests that high quality tww together with desalination base water can help remediate groundwater salinity for cl na and ec fig 6a b g the dilution factor of the aquifer is clearly demonstrated for the pre desalination period from 2006 onwards the pre sat concentrations began to drop significantly and from 2011 the dilution no longer played a role with minimal difference between pre and post sat levels on the other hand ca fig 6c pre sat concentrations were consistently below the post sat values this can reflect remineralization from the calcareous sandstone at the aquifer unsaturated zone due to calcite dissolution ganot et al 2018 mg fig 6d exhibits a similar dilution trend to cl and na in the pre desalination period however once concentrations began to drop after the introduction of desalination at around 20 mg l the trend reverses with post sat concentration beginning to be higher than pre sat this process can be explained by cation exchange processes with ca that begins below a threshold mg concentration similar trend of cation exchange was demonstrated in managed aquifer recharge of desalinated water in the northern part of the coastal aquifer ganot et al 2018 change in pre and post sat sar fig 6e resemble the trend for na although the reduction post desalination is less marked this can be explained by the desalination induced decrease in ca and mg as well however further study is required into the dynamics of desalination effects on sar interestingly b fig 6f concentration steadily increased until the year 2000 and then decreased until 2006 when the concentrations stabilized pre sat b concentrations before 2004 significantly decreased with time due to the reduction of b in laundry detergents as a result of stricter regulations mandated by the israeli ministry of environment kloppmann et al 2009 vengosh et al 2005 between 2002 2005 post sat concentrations of b were higher than pre sat concentrations this may reflect processes occurring at the unsaturated zone it was suggested that high b concentrations in the infiltrated tww led to adsorption of b to clay minerals leading to saturation of the adsorption sites and a reverse process when b concentrations decreased vengosh et al 1994 vengosh and keren 1996 therefore the recharge of b depleted tww can trigger mobilization of b from the unsaturated zone into the tww however after 2007 pre sat concentration are slightly higher than post sat levels one possible explanation is adsorption of b ions to organic matter and suspended solids in the infiltrations ponds sat is an expensive and land consuming process in recent years the shafdan plant has experienced a reduction in the infiltration rate due to long term processes that are currently under investigation aharoni et al 2017 in terms of cl na ec and sar the results suggest that sat of desalinated base water no longer improves quality we do see a slight reduction in b and an increase in mg which may prove beneficial however these results raise questions concerning the cost effectiveness of long term sat for desalinated base water tww this issue requires further study focusing also on effects of sat on organic matter suspended solids and major nutrients n and p 3 4 understanding the different rates of change between selected wwtp in all three wwtp cl na ca and mg decrease with desalination base water but to varying degrees figs 3 4 however in all cases the change is gradual and linear the continuous and linear change can be explained by the extent of the blending of natural and desalinated water in the water supplied for urban use the gradual increase in desalination volume in israel throughout the study period as more desalination plants became operational supplemental table 1s increased over time the proportion of desalinated water in the water supplied for urban use the source of the base water of effluents received in the wwtp represents a mixture of desalinated water with freshwater sources including the kinneret sea of galilee water which is characterized by relatively high cl concentrations 240 300 mg l markel 2014 and a blend of water from the coastal and yartan aquifers that have variable concentrations temporally and spatially as the volume of desalinated water produced increased the percentage of natural sources decreased thereby lowering concentrations of salts na cl and micro nutrients ca mg in drinking water and consequently in the tww the blending of natural and desalinated water can also explain the difference between the rates of change of concentrations between the different wwtp while both the ashdod and shafdan wwtp are situated near desalination plants fig 1 the ashdod plant has less than 10 the capacity of the shafdan supplemental table 1s this capacity reflects the population size of the municipalities they serve the ashdod plant reflects mostly the tww of the ashdod municipality pop of 220 000 shafdan on the other hand serves 2 5 million people and 7000 factories and includes a wide range of municipalities including the large cities of the tel aviv municipality area some of these municipalities such as kfar qassam which is located 25 km northeast of the desalination plants obtain some of their drinking water from groundwater wells beer sheva while in size is similar in scale to ashdod is located almost 50 km southeast of the ashkelon desalination plant see fig 1 and therefore its lower rate of change reflects a lower ratio of desalinated and natural water ashdod in contrast received desalinated water first from the nearby ashkelon plant and later from the ashdod plant these differences represent three different models of tww with desalination base water the ashdod wwtp represents a one major source of effluents from the ashdod municipality high percentage of desalination base water and high salinity in the pre desalination freshwater the beer sheva wwtp represents a single source of effluents medium percentage of desalination base water and low salinity in the pre desalination freshwater finally shafdan represents multiple sources of effluents medium percentage of desalination base water and medium salinity in the pre desalination freshwater as the results show figs 3 5 the single source effluents ashdod beer sheva with a high percentage of desalination water ashdod are the most effective in regards of salinity sodification sar reduction for areas with high background concentrations of salinity 3 5 a closer look at the temporal changes in tww water quality the most significant change observed in the tww of the selected plants was in cl which decreased by 24 68 during the ten years fig 3a1 2 table 1 this reduction reflects the stringent requirement for cl concentration in the desalination plants 20 mg l for all plants except palmahim 80 mg l israel water authority 2019 for na these changes are slightly smaller fig 3b with a 21 58 decrease over ten years table 1 however for wwtpfw no decline was apparent fig 3b1 2 and a slight increase was recorded for cl in the karmiel plant fig 3b1 in all three cases of wwtpdesal the na concentrations by 2016 were beneath the threshold allowed for agricultural irrigation 150 mg l israel ministry of health 2010 while in 2006 only the beer sheva water quality was at the permitted concentrations it appears that without the introduction of desalination the wwtp would not have been able to adhere to the qualities mandated by the regulations the full potential of desalination in improving tww quality is represented by the upper values of this decrease seen in the ashdod twwp as the volume of the desalinated water introduced into the system will become steady as long as no new plants are built we expect the salt concentrations of tww to eventually reach a steady state crops sensitive to cl such as avocado for example tolerate concentrations of 180 mg l or less ayers and westcot 1985 these concentrations were achieved in 2016 by both the ashdod and beer sheva wwtp while the shafdan concentrations in 2016 were 220 mg l which is still lower than the concentration allowed for unlimited tww irrigation according to israel s ministry of health regulations 250 mg l israel ministry of health 2010 the karmiel plant which demonstrated an increase in cl from 50 mg l in 2006 to 200 mg l in 2016 fig 3a2 due to the low salinity of the base water supplied to the city this suggests that in areas with low groundwater salinity desalination may not be required however this might change if the trend of salinity increase continues overall the introduction of desalination in addition to providing a much needed source of freshwater for domestic use helped to reduce tww salinity significantly by 2016 cl levels in both ashdod and beer sheva and na levels in ashdod were reduced to levels within the range of israel s freshwater sources table 1 in the long run the improvement of water quality can lead to reduced irrigation requirements other potential benefits include higher crop productivity and reduced soil damage becker et al 2011 tenne et al 2013 both ca and mg are good indicators for the impact of desalination on water quality as they are not as prevalent in effluents compared to cl and na therefore the rate of their decrease is mostly affected by the percentage of blending with natural fw and less by the quality of the effluents the added ca serves as a buffer that limits the total reduction and reduction rate mg on the other hand is not added to the water and indeed the mg concentrations decreased to beneath 5 mg l by 2016 fig 4b1 and table 1 at both the ashdod and beer sheva wwtp mg deficiency in crops which is increasingly becoming a limiting factor in intensive crop production under desalinated base water can harm essential plant functions including chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthesis and thereby adversely affect plant growth and development guo et al 2016 moreover some studies show a connection between low concentrations of mg 10 mg l in drinking water and increased risk for coronary heart disease rosen et al 2018 since levels lower than 10 mg l were observed in the tww we can assume that the drinking water in many cases do not reach that threshold further research is warranted to analyze the cost benefit of adding mg to desalinated water the recommended b concentration range for irrigation of b sensitive crops is 0 5 0 75 mg l ayers and westcot 1985 moreover the range of b concentrations in israel s freshwater is between 0 08 0 25 mg l table 1 results in fig 5b1 and table 1 show that especially in the beer sheva and ashdod plants the number of samples that approach and surpass the 0 5 mg l threshold increases with time this may indicate that the prolonged use of desalinated water may lead to b toxicity for sensitive plants as was already demonstrated for citrus pereira et al 2011 because of the high b concentrations in seawater ranging 4 5 6 5 mg l even with high filtration ability of the newest ro desalination technology it is challenging to reach concentrations below 0 5 mg l without an additional post treatment process shaffer et al 2012 while the initial relatively high b concentrations in the beer sheva wwtp can be attributed to natural causes leading to higher concentrations in groundwater in the area the concentration of the majority of groundwater in the coastal aquifer is lower than 0 3 mg l including in the ashdod area vengosh et al 2005 this suggests that the increase of desalinated source water is the cause of this change the requirement for b concentration in desalinated water in israel ranges from 0 3 mg l for sorek ashdod and hadera plants to 0 4 mg l for ashkelon and palmahim plants israel water authority 2019 this removal of b from tww is performed by increasing ph and converting b into borate ion which can be more easily removed kloppmann et al 2018 despite these requirements within the study timeframe b concentrations in several tww samples ranged between 0 5 0 7 mg l for the ashdod and beer sheva wwtp fig 5b1 thus two main factors may have induced the observed increase in b concentrations a high concentrations of b added to the urban wastewater from detergents and washing powders due to regulations for limiting b in these products not fully enforced b unenforced regulations for restriction of b concentration in desalinated water to levels lower than 0 4 mg l the sharp reduction in pre sat b concentrations from 2000 to 2005 fig 6f pre desalination can be attributed to the enforced regulations for low b in detergents while the increase in pre sat b concentrations over time albeit still gradual begins a year after the onset of large scale desalination in 2006 this suggests that desalination is the significant factor leading to the increase in b this is further supported by the fact that for the hasolelim and tiberias twwpfw b concentrations did not increase fig 5b2 however further research including b isotope analysis is required to provide a more comprehensive answer concerning the source of the increasing b concentrations achieving b concentrations lower than 0 4 mg l as mandated by the regulation in israel will require more stringent post treatment or blending with low concentration b water while taking into account their cost effectiveness 4 conclusions the drinking water desalination approach resulted in a dramatic reduction of cl na and ec in the tww cl levels were reduced to the natural fw concentrations range rendering them sustainable in terms of salinity which entails positive ramifications for agriculture by reducing long term damage to soil and crops and reducing irrigation requirements while sat technology can provide high quality tww for agriculture in the long term it can increase groundwater salinity the introduction of desalination reversed the trend returning groundwater salinity to levels similar to the pre infiltration values these changes suggest that high quality tww with desalinated base water can remediate groundwater salinity desalination entails potential negative implications for agriculture such as reduction in ca and mg and an increase in b concentrations reductions in ca levels in the tww are prevented by the post treatment process of ca supplementation and the reduction in mg can cause deficiency in crops despite the reduction in na concentrations the drop in ca and mg prevents the decrease of sar while large scale desalination plants are not an appropriate solution for all countries especially for those landlocked the results of this study contain valuable insights for countries seeking to convert wastewater from an environmental nuisance to a valuable resource specifically to fully utilize the benefits and minimize the drawbacks of tww irrigation extensive and frequent monitoring of tww and groundwater quality is required to support informed management and policy decisions declaration of

17523,the accumulation of fat oil and grease fog deposits in sewer pipes reduces their conveyance and results in sanitary sewer overflows ssos previous research has shown that concrete used in sewer lines is a significant source for calcium ion which participates in the fog deposit formation mechanism however no research has been conducted to understand the effect of calcium leaching from cement on fog deposits formation and adhesion this study quantifies the reduction in fog deposit formation when fly ash fa a supplementary cementitious material scm is used to replace cement in the production of high volume fly ash hvfa concrete materials results show that after 90 days of leaching test under controlled ph conditions 75 and 86 reduction in calcium release were achieved from 50 and 75 fa replacement respectively after 30 days of fog deposits formation tests on hvfa samples 58 and 81 reduction in fog deposit formation was found for 50 and 75 fa replacement respectively ftir analyses of fog deposits formed on concrete samples without fa replacement exhibited high calcium soap content 48 while fog deposit formed on hvfa concrete materials showed low calcium soap percentage 22 29 furthermore ftir analyses report the first spatial variation found in fog deposits that includes a surface layer of hard fog deposits with high calcium soap absorbance and an outer layer of soft fog deposits consisting of a low calcium absorbance ftir analyses revealed that the fog deposit formation mechanism is affected by the availability of calcium and ph near the concrete surface finally hvfa concrete materials were tested for compressive strength and durability against microbially induced concrete corrosion micc after 180 days of sealed curing hvfa concrete exhibited adequate compressive strength necessary for the sewer line construction and 50 fa replacement revealed satisfactory durability against micc keywords fog ssos calcium leaching hvfa collection system wastewater 1 introduction fat oil and grease fog in wastewater undergoes chemical reactions with other wastewater constituents to form insoluble solid deposits that exhibit adhesive properties and accumulates inside sewer lines these solid fog deposits ultimately reduce the drainage capacity of sewer lines and lead to sanitary sewer overflows ssos along with the rapid urbanization increase in food service establishments fses and growth in population the global per capita fat consumption also proliferated which eventually increased the discharge of fog into the sanitary sewer system del mundo and sutheerawattananonda 2017 in the united states ssos release approximately 3 to 10 billion gallons of untreated wastewater annually 25 of which is due to fog related line blockages usepa 2004 resulting in an estimated fog control cost of 25 billion williams et al 2012 prevention strategies such as increasing the frequency of sewer lines inspection and grease interceptors maintenance are routinely performed yet the effectiveness of these prevention strategies is inadequate gross et al 2017 he et al 2017 therefore it is important to investigate innovative fog deposit prevention strategies to avoid its formation as well as adhesion inside sewer collection system surfaces a significant number of research studies have been conducted to understand the fog deposit formation mechanism sources of chemical constituents involved in fog deposit formation and engineering solutions to overcome the fog deposit related problems he et al 2017 research studies have shown that the fog discharged from fses and domestic kitchen sink hydrolyses through deep frying baking and grilling to produce long chain free fatty acids lcffas which undergo a saponification reaction with calcium ion to form insoluble calcium soap he et al 2013 2011 keener et al 2008 a recent study stated that saponification is not the only process for fog deposits formation inside sewer lines crystallization of fatty acids can also form fog deposits without the presence of metals such as calcium gross et al 2017 however unlike the calcium soap produced in the laboratory gross et al 2017 did not confirm the occurrence of crystallized fog particles in any of their collected field fog deposit samples research has also revealed that the presence of excess fat or calcium affects the physical properties of fog deposits and soap formed with excess fat or oil is a smooth paste like material in contrast to soap formed with excess calcium that is granular and semi solid substance del mundo and sutheerawattananonda 2017 he et al 2013 reported that both saturated and unsaturated lcffas lead to the formation of fog deposits and that unsaturated lcffas produce more viscous fog deposits additionally previous research showed that fog deposits formation and its properties are influenced by factors such as ph temperature sources of calcium and type of lcffas iasmin et al 2014 the sources of lcffas are chemical and microbial hydrolysis of fog while the sources of calcium could be attributed to the water hardness microbial reaction concrete corrosion and other background sources in wastewater iasmin et al 2014 williams et al 2012 iasmin et al 2014 also found that calcium present in wastewater forms smaller but more granulated saponified solids while calcium released from high ph conditions such as concrete corrosion produces significantly larger and more viscous solids potentially adhering more readily to pipe surfaces hence in fog deposition calcium released from the corrosion of cementitious materials may have a more adverse impact than calcium found in background wastewater as a high ph saponification reaction occurs at the cementitious materials surface therefore in addition to the current strategies of limiting fog discharge from the kitchen sink the reduction of calcium ions released into wastewater from concrete corrosion can be an alternative strategy to reduce the fog deposits formation calcium leaching from sewer line construction materials can be reduced through the use of supplementary cementitious materials scms previous research has shown that substitution of portland cement by scms such as fly ash fa decreases calcium leaching from concrete exposed to corrosive media hartwich and vollpracht 2017 müllauer et al 2015 however no laboratory studies have been performed to assess the effect of this reduced calcium leaching on fog deposits formation and its adhesion on the sewer line surface the main objective of this research is to reduce or minimize fog deposits formation and its adhesion by reducing calcium leaching from sewer line concrete structures using fa as a cement replacement for concrete production high volume fly ash hvfa concrete samples were prepared by replacing 50 and 75 of cement by weight with fa and were used for fog deposits formation and adhesion tests the prepared concrete samples were also tested for compressive strength and chemical durability tests to evaluate their suitability as sewer line construction materials to our knowledge this research is the first to evaluate hvfa concrete as a solution to reduce the fog deposit formation and its adhesion inside sewer line surfaces 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of cement paste and concrete samples table s1 provides the mixture proportioning that was used to make paste a mixture of cement fa and water samples by using ordinary portland cement opc type i ii and class f fa three paste mixtures were made with an overall water to cementitious w cm ratio of 0 42 paste 0 was cast without fa replacement and used as a control paste 50 and paste 75 represent pastes with fa replacement of 50 and 75 respectively paste mixtures were cast into a 2 2 12 inch rectangular pvc molds in three layers vibrated for compaction after each layer and sealed cured for 90 days before conducting the calcium leaching test concrete samples concrete 0 concrete 50 and concrete 75 were prepared by following the mixture proportioning provided in table s2 and used for compressive strength measurements fog deposits formation and chemical durability against acid attack tests in all concrete mixtures granite was used as a coarse aggregate and washed natural river sand as a fine aggregate concrete mixtures were cast in a 4 inch dia by 8 inch long cylindrical mold and sealed cured at room temperature followed by compressive strength tests for the fog deposit formation tests concrete mixtures were cast in a 2 2 12 inch rectangular pvc mold and for chemical durability test 2 2 inch cube mold was used 2 2 thermogravimetric analysis tga hydration of opc constituents namely tricalcium silicates with cement chemistry notation of c3s and dicalcium silicates c2s produce calcium hydroxide ch and calcium silicate hydroxide csh mehta and monteiro 2006 ch is a water soluble phase and releases calcium readily in water and corrosive media however the addition of fa causes a pozzolanic reaction that converts ch to the more stable hydration product csh hemalatha and ramaswamy 2017 mehta and monteiro 2006 therefore it is expected that the replacement of cement with fa will reduce the ch content of fa replaced samples thermogravimetric analysis tga was performed on different binders paste 0 paste 50 and paste 75 to determine the change in ch content at different extents of hydration i e age in brief a sample was crushed and 10 mg to 20 mg of the crushed sample was used for the tga test the rate of temperature rise was set to 2 ᵒc per minute and the maximum temperature was 1000 ᵒc 2 3 leaching test after 90 days of sealed curing paste samples were cut to the desired size of 1 1 0 5 inch for the leaching test at ph values of 5 and 7 to simulate the wastewater conditions inside sewer lines 3 l deionized water di was used as a leachate solution to fully immerse paste samples followed by continuous mixing at room temperature for 90 days the ph of the leachate solution tends to increase due to the dissolution of ch from the paste to adjust the ph 0 1 m nitric acid hno3 solution was supplied through a controlled syringe infusion pump 15 ml of leachate solution was collected from each test container three times a week to determine the calcium leaching potential of paste 0 paste 50 and paste 75 by using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes fa is not a pure material and contains toxic heavy metals that potentially can leach from fa replaced samples if used as sanitary sewer line construction materials hence a heavy metal leaching potential test was performed that measured arsenic as cadmium cd chromium cr mercury hg lead pb and selenium se leached from paste samples 2 4 fog deposit formation test for the fog deposit formation test all the concrete coupons of 1 1 3 inch were polished using 400 and 800 sandpaper following the same polishing method to avoid surface irregularities in the experimental setup concrete 0 concrete 50 and concrete 75 specimens were exposed to a synthetic wastewater for 30 days at ph 7 the synthetic wastewater was prepared by mixing 700 ml of di 30 g of oleic acid as lcffa source and 20 g of canola oil these specific concentrations were selected such that the saponification reaction between lcffa and calcium leached from concrete is not limited by the availability of lcffa additionally oleic acid is selected as the lcffa source to address the formation and accumulation of more viscous fog deposits on concrete surfaces oil and oleic acid were initially mixed using a magnetic stir bar for 15 min after properly mixing oil and oleic acid di water was added into the container after mixing the resulting solution overnight one third of the 3 long concrete coupon was submerged into the synthetic wastewater this experiment was designed to observe the effect of calcium leaching from concrete corrosion on fog deposit formation inside sewer lines a similar experimental setup was designed with the addition of calcium chloride 75 mg l ca2 as a background calcium source to evaluate the effect of calcium present in wastewater on fog deposit formation inside sewer lines after 30 days of testing at ph 7 the fog deposit formed on the sample surfaces were scrapped off and weighed to measure the amount of fog deposit formed on each sample surface 2 5 fourier transform infrared ftir analysis of fog deposit fourier transform infrared ftir analysis was performed on all the fog deposit samples to determine the saponified solids content of the fog deposits by identifying the characteristic calcium soap bands ftir analysis was also performed on pure canola oil and oleic acid to observe the peak absorbance at their characteristic bands the soap content of the fog deposit was determined by using eq 1 poulenat et al 2003 infrared absorption spectra of fog deposits were determined with a bruker alpha spectrometer using a diamond attenuated total reflection atr sampling attachment the absorbance spectra were computed from 400 cm 1 to 4000 cm 1 wavelengths and baseline correction was performed using the opus spectroscopy software the absorbance and wavelength data were then processed using a data processing software origin pro 1 s o a p s o a p a b s o r b a n c e 1577 c m 1 1541 c m 1 100 s o a p a b s o

measurements were performed on concrete specimens according to astm c39 to determine the suitability of these concrete materials for sewer line applications end caps were used during testing and the test was performed at a loading rate of 35 psi s three replicates were used for each test and the average of the three measurements are reported the production of sulfuric acid due to the microbially induced concrete corrosion micc causes durability issues inside sewer lines due to the complexities of micc and difficulties in reproducing such process in the laboratory often accelerated sulfuric acid exposure tests are performed to evaluate the damaging effect of micc on concrete structures gutberlet et al 2015 gutiérrez padilla et al 2010 huber et al 2017 although significant differences between micc and sulfuric acid attacks were reported in previous research in this study durability against sulfuric acid attack is only used as a comparative test to evaluate the relative performance of different hvfa concrete materials against micc the chemical durability test was performed following astm c267 but with slight adaptation from previous studies to determine the suitability of concrete 0 concrete 50 and concrete 75 as sewer line construction materials ariffin et al 2013 house 2013 in brief cube samples were initially removed from the casting molds and weighed after 90 days of curing a test media of ph 1 was prepared using sulfuric acid to simulate the microbial acid attack inside sewer lines three different containers were used to submerge different concrete samples by keeping the liquid to solid ratio constant at 4 72 the test media solution was replaced when the solution ph exceeded 1 5 the test was conducted for 120 days after 10 15 35 75 and 120 days of the submerged acid attack three replicates from each container were taken out of the acid solution and washed with a soft bristle brush under tap water to remove loose particles from the sample surface finally these clean samples were observed to identify changes in physical appearance weight and compressive strength the percentage loss or gain in properties weight and compressive strength of the specimens during immersion for each examination period were monitored and reported 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermogravimetric analysis tga tga results are displayed in fig 1 previous research studies that investigated the effect of fa in hvfa materials fa replacement level ranged from 5 to 60 found that with an increasing amount of fa ch content decreased hemalatha et al 2016 shaikh and supit 2015 a similar trend is also observed in fig 1 for paste 0 samples with increasing hydration period from 13 days to 135 days the ch content increased to approximately 25 on the other hand for concrete 50 samples the ch content decreased by approximately 4 from its initial value the highest reduction in ch content is 75 which was achieved by 75 cement replacement in concrete 75 samples reduction in ch content is attributed to two factors i the reduction of overall cement content that ultimately produces less ch as a result of hydration and ii the conversion of ch to csh or its more complex variants such as calcium aluminum silicate hydrates by pozzolanic reaction due to the addition of fa in the mixture in the case of 50 fa replacement level we see a steady level ch throughout the hydration period which is attributed to the balanced production of ch and continuous conversion of ch to csh due to the presence of 50 fa and 50 cement whereas for 75 fa replacement level we observed a steep decline in ch due to the low cement content 25 and the subsequent conversion of some ch to csh the benefit of a pozzolanic reaction is that it produces csh which is a known stable hydration constituent that does not readily release calcium and contributes to the compressive strength of concrete cao et al 2000 this lack of ch content in hvfa paste can be further verified by analyzing the results of the calcium leaching test in the following section 3 2 calcium leaching test the results of the calcium leaching test on paste 0 paste 50 and paste 75 samples are shown in fig 2 and fig s1 a where cumulative calcium concentration of the leachate solution is plotted against the square root of time a trend line of the leaching behavior is used to visualize the calcium ion leaching profile when a binder coupon is fully submerged into di water at ph 5 and 7 all samples followed the same calcium leaching profile because the calcium leaching potential under ph 5 and ph 7 conditions were very similar fig 2 only displays the combined ph leaching profile for the different samples the linearity of the calcium concentration against the square root of time shown in fig 2 indicates that calcium leaching from paste samples are diffusion dominated similar leaching profiles for concrete coupons were obtained in a previous study when the ph varied from 4 to 10 he et al 2013 results clearly show that the cumulative calcium leaching from paste 0 was significantly higher than the paste 50 and paste 75 samples the maximum cumulative calcium leached from the hvfa samples at the end of 90 days was below 5 mg l g of paste sample whereas paste 0 samples leached more than that within the initial 5 days this result is in good agreement with the result found in tga analysis fig s1 b displays the relative percent reduction in calcium ion leaching from hvfa samples when compared to paste 0 results indicate that with 50 and 75 cement replacement calcium leaching is reduced by 74 71 and 86 44 respectively therefore major reduction i e 74 71 in calcium leaching comes from the initial 50 fa replacement whereas an additional 25 replacement of cement reduces calcium leaching by 11 73 which can be attributed to the overall low ch content of paste 75 samples heavy metals from fa can also leach from binders containing fa the measurement of heavy metals leached from paste 50 and paste 75 after 90 days of leaching are provided in table s3 which shows that only cr concentration was above the instrument s detection limit after 90 days of leaching and it did not exceed the pollutant discharge limit provided by usepa clean water act assuming a linear leaching profile for the heavy metals a daily average cr leaching per square inch of the test sample was calculated from the 90 day cumulative data this daily average chromium leaching was found to be 0 0025 mg l for paste 50 and 0 00375 mg l for paste 75 respectively these concentrations are significantly lower than the cr discharge limits shown in table s3 for a typical 40 inch diameter concrete sewer pipe that is running 75 full of wastewater we can approximate the cr leaching to be 0 008 mg l per day per meter therefore we propose that the fa replaced materials developed in this study can effectively reduce calcium leaching potential from sewer lines without excessive leaching of heavy metals that can cause pollution the results found here however are unique to the source of fa and therefore should not be used as a standard measure for any other fa sources we recommend that a heavy metal leaching test be performed before using any type of fa as sewer line construction material to avoid potential occurrence for heavy metal accumulation in wastewater 3 3 fog deposit formation test to identify the effect of calcium availability on fog deposit formation and its adhesion fog deposit formation tests were conducted under two different test conditions in the absence and the presence of background calcium during this test the initial rapid mixing of the oleic acid oil and di water solution created an oil in water type of emulsion when concrete samples were submerged and the mixing rate was decreased the solution became phase separated with an oil layer at the air water interface and a clear solution underneath however when saponification of the lcffas oleic acid started for both test conditions the clear solution turned milky and soap formed on sample surfaces as well as at the air water interface fig s2 fog formation test results are presented in fig 3 where the error bar indicates standard deviation in fig 3 an increase in fa replacement resulted in a decrease in fog deposit formation regardless of the presence of background calcium when compared to concrete 0 samples in the absence of background calcium reduction in fog deposit formation was 58 and 81 for concrete 50 and concrete 75 respectively in the case of the fog deposition test without any background calcium leaching of ch from the concrete specimen was the only source of calcium and the factor that controlled fog deposit formation on sample surfaces previously tga analysis and leaching test results revealed that calcium leaching from the hvfa sample is significantly lower than the sample without any fa addition therefore in the absence of background calcium a decreasing trend in fog deposit formation on fa replaced samples was expected and this decrease is attributed to the reduction in ch content due to fa replacement in the presence of background calcium the reduction in fog deposit formation on concrete 50 and concrete 75 was 55 and 67 respectively when compared to the fog deposit formed on concrete 0 samples even with the presence of background calcium a decreasing trend in fog deposit accumulation on fa replaced samples was found for this test condition however when comparing the two fog deposit test conditions as seen in fig 3 the reduction in fog deposit accumulation on the surface of the concrete 75 sample is not as high 67 vs 81 when background calcium is present this increased accumulation on the surface of the concrete 75 sample may be due to changes in surface characteristics such as surface roughness caused by loss of fa particles from samples surface that allowed for more sites for the attachment of fog deposits however surface properties were not explored in this present research the fog deposit formation tests also revealed changes in the physical appearance of the fog deposit formed on different concrete sample surfaces calcium soap that formed on 0 fa replaced samples were white initially and turned brownish with time whereas soap formed on concrete 50 and concrete 75 samples were gray fig s3 s5 show the difference in the fog depositions color formed on different concrete samples the transition of soap color from white to brown could be a result of fatty acid and oil oxidative rancidity that is initiated by the metal ions like iron available in cement he et al 2013 on the other hand the gray color of soap formed on fa replaced samples can be the result of the carbon present in fa particles released during this test period we also observed that 0 fa replaced sample produced granular solid soap that was difficult to remove from the sample s surfaces as oppose to soft semi solid soap for fa replaced samples that were easy to detach from these surfaces this difference in soap s physical properties could be a result of the calcium content as well as ph that affect the saponification reaction iasmin et al 2014 previous research showed that concrete has a high pore ph 13 5 plusquellec et al 2017 therefore significant ch leaching from concrete 0 samples may cause a high ph and calcium availability at the concrete surface resulting in a granular solid soap formation at the air water interface of the samples this type of granular solid soap structure was found in previous research where saponification reaction occurred at high ph conditions he et al 2013 iasmin et al 2014 conversely the soft and weakly adhered fog deposits formed on fa replaced sample surface for both background calcium conditions may have resulted from the low ch leaching from hvfa concrete which eventually caused low calcium availability and surface ph while these observations were made qualitatively they suggest that the ph and calcium availability at the surface of the sewer line materials not only play a significant role in fog deposit formation they also affect its physical properties and thereby affect the adhesion mechanism finally these results imply that the fog deposit formation potential for the fa replaced samples are always lower than the concrete samples without any fa regardless of the presence of background calcium in the wastewater therefore the conveyance of sewer lines could be enhanced with fa replaced construction materials due to its reduced fog deposit formation and adhesion potential 3 4 ftir analysis of fog deposits the fog deposits formed on different concrete surfaces were analyzed using ftir to observe peaks at different wavelengths according to a previous research study calcium soap exhibits different characteristics ftir wave bands poulenat et al 2003 however other research studies did not report the presence of ca o band at 665 cm 1 as reported by poulenat et al 2003 rather stated that the calcium soap in hydrated form exhibits two strong characteristic asymmetric stretching vibrations at 1577 cm 1 and 1541 cm 1 casadio et al 2019 otero et al 2014 putinier 1970 therefore in this study to determine the percentage calcium soap content of the fog deposit formed on the concrete surface 1577 cm 1 and 1541 cm 1 absorption maxima were considered fig s6 and s7 represent the ftir spectra of fog deposit formed on concrete 0 concrete 50 and concrete 75 samples with and without background calcium test conditions respectively similar ftir spectra were observed for fog deposits collected from sewer systems or produced in labs del mundo and sutheerawattananonda 2017 he et al 2011 from these figures we observe that the ftir spectrum displays the characteristics of calcium soap band at 1468 cm 1 1541 cm 1 1577 cm 1 broad spectrum at 3400 cm 1 and the disappearance of 1740 cm 1 and 1707 cm 1 due to the consumption of ffa and oil during saponification reaction in addition to these characteristics calcium soap bands we observe absorbance spectra near 3000 2800 cm 1 containing four peaks located at 3004 cm 1 c h stretching vibration 2955 cm 1 c h ch3 asymmetric stretching vibration 2922 cm 1 c h ch2 asymmetric stretching vibration and 2851 cm 1 c h ch2 symmetric stretching vibration poulenat et al 2003 these frequencies of the aliphatic chains do not change during the saponification reaction similar ftir spectra of fog deposit formed on different concrete surfaces indicates that the addition of fa in concrete production does not alter the fog deposit formation mechanism moreover apart from the strong asymmetric stretching vibration of calcium soap at 1541 cm 1 and 1577 cm 1 we notice a single peak at 722 cm 1 which indicates that the fog deposit is indeed made of calcium poulenat et al 2003 the characteristic calcium oxygen ca o band near 665 cm 1 was present in the ftir spectra fig s6 and s7 of fog deposits however the intensity of this absorption varied based on the availability of background calcium for the fog deposit formed on samples without background calcium ca o band absorption was lower in comparison to the fog deposit formed on samples with background calcium similarly band absorption near 665 cm 1 also decreased as the fa replacement increased previous studies showed that the intensity of the 665 cm 1 band is positively associated with higher calcium level in fog deposits del mundo and sutheerawattananonda 2017 poulenat et al 2003 the presence of a strong ca o bond intensity near 665 cm 1 for fog deposits formed on the concrete 0 fig s6 with decreasing intensity for fog deposits formed on concrete 50 to concrete 75 samples fig s6 further confirms the effect of calcium availability near the concrete surface on saponification reaction soap formed on the concrete sample surfaces did not exhibit a uniform appearance the soap adhered closest to the concrete surface was firm to the touch while the soap exposed to the wastewater was soft therefore ftir analysis was performed on soap samples separately collected from two different locations one from the concrete surface layer sl and another one from the outer layer ol exposed to the wastewater fig s8 s11 in fig 4 ftir results of concrete 0 show that the characteristics calcium soap absorbance 665 cm 1 1541 cm 1 and 1577 cm 1 at sl was 83 higher than the ol similarly for concrete 50 the characteristic soap absorbance at sl was 68 higher than the ol higher calcium soap absorbance of sl confirms that the hard calcium soap forms where calcium availability and ph are conducive to the formation of harder soaps as described in the literature iasmin et al 2016 table 1 displays the soap content determined from the ftir spectrum fig s6 s7 using eq 1 overall the soap content of the fog deposit on different concrete surfaces decreased from concrete 0 to concrete 75 not surprisingly the soap content increased with the presence of background calcium additionally fog deposits with higher soap content are comparatively rigid soap that adheres firmly to the concrete surface and may aid in further accumulation of unreacted and or partially reacted calcium soap and fog on its surfaces overall from ftir spectra we confirm that the fog deposit formed on concrete surfaces is indeed calcium soap of lcffa however the different ch dissolution from concrete materials resulted in a high to low ph and calcium ion gradient from the concrete surface towards the bulk wastewater solution as a result granular and hard calcium soap formed on sl through saponification reaction at a higher ph and calcium availability whereas the soft soap formed on the ol showing high absorbance at 1740 cm 1 and 1707 cm 1 indicates the accumulation of partially saponified or unreacted fog at a low ph and calcium availability moreover we hypothesize that the hard soap formed on the sl may aid in further adhesion of unreacted fog at the ol ultimately resulting in a heterogenous makeup of fog deposit on concrete surfaces 3 5 compressive strength and durability of concrete replacement materials the development of concrete materials for any purpose must be assessed for their compressive strength and durability required for its engineering application therefore the compressive strength development of the hvfa concrete materials was measured over a year of sealed curing according to astm c76 and astm c655 for class 3 class 4 standard reinforced concrete pipe segments a compressive strength of 4 ksi is required for sewer line construction a series of compressive strength tests at different curing age was performed and results are presented in fig 5 after 90 days of compressive strength test concrete materials containing 0 and 50 fa satisfy the strength requirement for sewer line construction while concrete materials containing 75 fa met the requirement after 180 days fa contributes to compressive strength through relatively slower pozzolanic reactions compared to cement hydration by reducing the volume and size of capillary pores additionally for concrete 75 the amount of ch in the material is very low therefore the conversion of ch to csh is less thus fa replaced samples specially 75 fa replaced concrete gain strength at a slower rate compressive strength gain of concrete 0 concrete 50 and concrete 75 from 90 days to 365 days are 20 23 and 41 respectively a similar trend was observed in previous research studies atiş 2005 cao et al 2000 de la varga et al 2012 kocak and nas 2014 although the initial low compressive strength 90 days of sealed cure of 75 fa replaced concrete does not meet the class 4 standard reinforced concrete pipe segments concrete 75 should not be considered unsuitable pre cast concrete sewer lines are not placed in service immediately after casting as we observed more than 4 ksi compressive strength after 180 days of sealed curing 75 fa replaced concrete can also be used for sewer line construction chemical durability tests on concrete samples were performed to evaluate the effect of micc fig 6 shows that the compressive strength of concrete 0 and concrete 50 samples exhibit high acid resistance up to 35 days of the acid attack which is attributed to the buffering of acid by ch dissolution from concrete samples as the acid attack continues gypsum forms due to high ch dissolution causing a considerable reduction in compressive strength gutberlet et al 2015 huber et al 2017 concrete 75 on the other hand shows high compressive strength reduction over the entire testing period which can be attributed to the lack of acid buffering due to the low ch dissolution from these samples due to the acid attack concrete samples lost weight and the results are shown in fig s12 although initially up to 35 days concrete 0 and concrete 50 samples showed negligible weight loss after 70 days of the acid attack concrete 0 experienced severe mass loss tga analysis and leaching potential test showed that concrete 0 contains a higher ch percentage that may lead to expansion and cracking by gypsum formation gutberlet et al 2015 huber et al 2017 as a result of the crack formation we understand that concrete 0 samples showed a significant reduction in compressive strength as well as substantial weight loss at the later stages of acid exposure due to the loss of aggregates on the other hand 75 fa replaced samples experienced considerable weight loss over the entire test period which can be due to the low ch content and loss of unreacted fa particles from the concrete structure interestingly 50 fa replaced concrete samples did not show a sharp rise in mass loss which can be due to the balance between ch dissolution and buffering of acid 4 conclusion the goal of this research was to demonstrate an alternative strategy to reduce the fog deposit formation and its adhesion to sewer surfaces by replacing 50 and 75 of portland cement with fly ash fa hydration of portland cement results in the formation of calcium hydroxide which is water soluble and the main source of calcium release from concrete replacing cement with fa not only reduces the portland cement content of concrete but also converts calcium hydroxide to calcium silicate hydrate which is water insoluble three concrete materials concrete 0 concrete 50 and concrete 75 were evaluated and it was observed that the incorporation of fa reduced calcium leaching from concrete thereby reduced fog deposit formation and its adhesion on concrete surfaces regardless of the presence of background calcium fa replaced concrete samples formed fog deposits that weakly adhered to the concrete surface additionally ftir spectra of fog deposits formed on different concrete surfaces suggest that a spatial variation of fog deposit exists with harder deposits mostly made of calcium soap forming near the concrete surface and smooth yet tacky soap that predominantly consisted of unreacted fog forming on the outer layer of the fog deposit we conclude that this spatial change in physical properties of fog deposits is due to the ch dissolution from concrete resulting in a gradient of ph and calcium availability between concrete surface and wastewater bulk solution therefore fog deposits closest to the sewer line surface adheres strongly and may provide an anchoring region for further accumulation of fog deposits as well as unreacted fog however future research is required to measure the rheological properties of fog deposits attached to concrete surfaces to assess the effect of binder properties surface ph and calcium availability on the fog deposit s physical characteristics overall our study revealed that hvfa concrete materials could be an alternative solution for future sewer line construction or rehabilitation strategy to reduce the fog deposit formation and its adhesion inside concrete sewer collection systems future research however is also needed to explore the fundamental mechanisms of fog deposit adhesion on material surfaces to explore methods that can alter sewer line surface properties to minimize the

17523,the accumulation of fat oil and grease fog deposits in sewer pipes reduces their conveyance and results in sanitary sewer overflows ssos previous research has shown that concrete used in sewer lines is a significant source for calcium ion which participates in the fog deposit formation mechanism however no research has been conducted to understand the effect of calcium leaching from cement on fog deposits formation and adhesion this study quantifies the reduction in fog deposit formation when fly ash fa a supplementary cementitious material scm is used to replace cement in the production of high volume fly ash hvfa concrete materials results show that after 90 days of leaching test under controlled ph conditions 75 and 86 reduction in calcium release were achieved from 50 and 75 fa replacement respectively after 30 days of fog deposits formation tests on hvfa samples 58 and 81 reduction in fog deposit formation was found for 50 and 75 fa replacement respectively ftir analyses of fog deposits formed on concrete samples without fa replacement exhibited high calcium soap content 48 while fog deposit formed on hvfa concrete materials showed low calcium soap percentage 22 29 furthermore ftir analyses report the first spatial variation found in fog deposits that includes a surface layer of hard fog deposits with high calcium soap absorbance and an outer layer of soft fog deposits consisting of a low calcium absorbance ftir analyses revealed that the fog deposit formation mechanism is affected by the availability of calcium and ph near the concrete surface finally hvfa concrete materials were tested for compressive strength and durability against microbially induced concrete corrosion micc after 180 days of sealed curing hvfa concrete exhibited adequate compressive strength necessary for the sewer line construction and 50 fa replacement revealed satisfactory durability against micc keywords fog ssos calcium leaching hvfa collection system wastewater 1 introduction fat oil and grease fog in wastewater undergoes chemical reactions with other wastewater constituents to form insoluble solid deposits that exhibit adhesive properties and accumulates inside sewer lines these solid fog deposits ultimately reduce the drainage capacity of sewer lines and lead to sanitary sewer overflows ssos along with the rapid urbanization increase in food service establishments fses and growth in population the global per capita fat consumption also proliferated which eventually increased the discharge of fog into the sanitary sewer system del mundo and sutheerawattananonda 2017 in the united states ssos release approximately 3 to 10 billion gallons of untreated wastewater annually 25 of which is due to fog related line blockages usepa 2004 resulting in an estimated fog control cost of 25 billion williams et al 2012 prevention strategies such as increasing the frequency of sewer lines inspection and grease interceptors maintenance are routinely performed yet the effectiveness of these prevention strategies is inadequate gross et al 2017 he et al 2017 therefore it is important to investigate innovative fog deposit prevention strategies to avoid its formation as well as adhesion inside sewer collection system surfaces a significant number of research studies have been conducted to understand the fog deposit formation mechanism sources of chemical constituents involved in fog deposit formation and engineering solutions to overcome the fog deposit related problems he et al 2017 research studies have shown that the fog discharged from fses and domestic kitchen sink hydrolyses through deep frying baking and grilling to produce long chain free fatty acids lcffas which undergo a saponification reaction with calcium ion to form insoluble calcium soap he et al 2013 2011 keener et al 2008 a recent study stated that saponification is not the only process for fog deposits formation inside sewer lines crystallization of fatty acids can also form fog deposits without the presence of metals such as calcium gross et al 2017 however unlike the calcium soap produced in the laboratory gross et al 2017 did not confirm the occurrence of crystallized fog particles in any of their collected field fog deposit samples research has also revealed that the presence of excess fat or calcium affects the physical properties of fog deposits and soap formed with excess fat or oil is a smooth paste like material in contrast to soap formed with excess calcium that is granular and semi solid substance del mundo and sutheerawattananonda 2017 he et al 2013 reported that both saturated and unsaturated lcffas lead to the formation of fog deposits and that unsaturated lcffas produce more viscous fog deposits additionally previous research showed that fog deposits formation and its properties are influenced by factors such as ph temperature sources of calcium and type of lcffas iasmin et al 2014 the sources of lcffas are chemical and microbial hydrolysis of fog while the sources of calcium could be attributed to the water hardness microbial reaction concrete corrosion and other background sources in wastewater iasmin et al 2014 williams et al 2012 iasmin et al 2014 also found that calcium present in wastewater forms smaller but more granulated saponified solids while calcium released from high ph conditions such as concrete corrosion produces significantly larger and more viscous solids potentially adhering more readily to pipe surfaces hence in fog deposition calcium released from the corrosion of cementitious materials may have a more adverse impact than calcium found in background wastewater as a high ph saponification reaction occurs at the cementitious materials surface therefore in addition to the current strategies of limiting fog discharge from the kitchen sink the reduction of calcium ions released into wastewater from concrete corrosion can be an alternative strategy to reduce the fog deposits formation calcium leaching from sewer line construction materials can be reduced through the use of supplementary cementitious materials scms previous research has shown that substitution of portland cement by scms such as fly ash fa decreases calcium leaching from concrete exposed to corrosive media hartwich and vollpracht 2017 müllauer et al 2015 however no laboratory studies have been performed to assess the effect of this reduced calcium leaching on fog deposits formation and its adhesion on the sewer line surface the main objective of this research is to reduce or minimize fog deposits formation and its adhesion by reducing calcium leaching from sewer line concrete structures using fa as a cement replacement for concrete production high volume fly ash hvfa concrete samples were prepared by replacing 50 and 75 of cement by weight with fa and were used for fog deposits formation and adhesion tests the prepared concrete samples were also tested for compressive strength and chemical durability tests to evaluate their suitability as sewer line construction materials to our knowledge this research is the first to evaluate hvfa concrete as a solution to reduce the fog deposit formation and its adhesion inside sewer line surfaces 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of cement paste and concrete samples table s1 provides the mixture proportioning that was used to make paste a mixture of cement fa and water samples by using ordinary portland cement opc type i ii and class f fa three paste mixtures were made with an overall water to cementitious w cm ratio of 0 42 paste 0 was cast without fa replacement and used as a control paste 50 and paste 75 represent pastes with fa replacement of 50 and 75 respectively paste mixtures were cast into a 2 2 12 inch rectangular pvc molds in three layers vibrated for compaction after each layer and sealed cured for 90 days before conducting the calcium leaching test concrete samples concrete 0 concrete 50 and concrete 75 were prepared by following the mixture proportioning provided in table s2 and used for compressive strength measurements fog deposits formation and chemical durability against acid attack tests in all concrete mixtures granite was used as a coarse aggregate and washed natural river sand as a fine aggregate concrete mixtures were cast in a 4 inch dia by 8 inch long cylindrical mold and sealed cured at room temperature followed by compressive strength tests for the fog deposit formation tests concrete mixtures were cast in a 2 2 12 inch rectangular pvc mold and for chemical durability test 2 2 inch cube mold was used 2 2 thermogravimetric analysis tga hydration of opc constituents namely tricalcium silicates with cement chemistry notation of c3s and dicalcium silicates c2s produce calcium hydroxide ch and calcium silicate hydroxide csh mehta and monteiro 2006 ch is a water soluble phase and releases calcium readily in water and corrosive media however the addition of fa causes a pozzolanic reaction that converts ch to the more stable hydration product csh hemalatha and ramaswamy 2017 mehta and monteiro 2006 therefore it is expected that the replacement of cement with fa will reduce the ch content of fa replaced samples thermogravimetric analysis tga was performed on different binders paste 0 paste 50 and paste 75 to determine the change in ch content at different extents of hydration i e age in brief a sample was crushed and 10 mg to 20 mg of the crushed sample was used for the tga test the rate of temperature rise was set to 2 ᵒc per minute and the maximum temperature was 1000 ᵒc 2 3 leaching test after 90 days of sealed curing paste samples were cut to the desired size of 1 1 0 5 inch for the leaching test at ph values of 5 and 7 to simulate the wastewater conditions inside sewer lines 3 l deionized water di was used as a leachate solution to fully immerse paste samples followed by continuous mixing at room temperature for 90 days the ph of the leachate solution tends to increase due to the dissolution of ch from the paste to adjust the ph 0 1 m nitric acid hno3 solution was supplied through a controlled syringe infusion pump 15 ml of leachate solution was collected from each test container three times a week to determine the calcium leaching potential of paste 0 paste 50 and paste 75 by using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes fa is not a pure material and contains toxic heavy metals that potentially can leach from fa replaced samples if used as sanitary sewer line construction materials hence a heavy metal leaching potential test was performed that measured arsenic as cadmium cd chromium cr mercury hg lead pb and selenium se leached from paste samples 2 4 fog deposit formation test for the fog deposit formation test all the concrete coupons of 1 1 3 inch were polished using 400 and 800 sandpaper following the same polishing method to avoid surface irregularities in the experimental setup concrete 0 concrete 50 and concrete 75 specimens were exposed to a synthetic wastewater for 30 days at ph 7 the synthetic wastewater was prepared by mixing 700 ml of di 30 g of oleic acid as lcffa source and 20 g of canola oil these specific concentrations were selected such that the saponification reaction between lcffa and calcium leached from concrete is not limited by the availability of lcffa additionally oleic acid is selected as the lcffa source to address the formation and accumulation of more viscous fog deposits on concrete surfaces oil and oleic acid were initially mixed using a magnetic stir bar for 15 min after properly mixing oil and oleic acid di water was added into the container after mixing the resulting solution overnight one third of the 3 long concrete coupon was submerged into the synthetic wastewater this experiment was designed to observe the effect of calcium leaching from concrete corrosion on fog deposit formation inside sewer lines a similar experimental setup was designed with the addition of calcium chloride 75 mg l ca2 as a background calcium source to evaluate the effect of calcium present in wastewater on fog deposit formation inside sewer lines after 30 days of testing at ph 7 the fog deposit formed on the sample surfaces were scrapped off and weighed to measure the amount of fog deposit formed on each sample surface 2 5 fourier transform infrared ftir analysis of fog deposit fourier transform infrared ftir analysis was performed on all the fog deposit samples to determine the saponified solids content of the fog deposits by identifying the characteristic calcium soap bands ftir analysis was also performed on pure canola oil and oleic acid to observe the peak absorbance at their characteristic bands the soap content of the fog deposit was determined by using eq 1 poulenat et al 2003 infrared absorption spectra of fog deposits were determined with a bruker alpha spectrometer using a diamond attenuated total reflection atr sampling attachment the absorbance spectra were computed from 400 cm 1 to 4000 cm 1 wavelengths and baseline correction was performed using the opus spectroscopy software the absorbance and wavelength data were then processed using a data processing software origin pro 1 s o a p s o a p a b s o r b a n c e 1577 c m 1 1541 c m 1 100 s o a p a b s o

measurements were performed on concrete specimens according to astm c39 to determine the suitability of these concrete materials for sewer line applications end caps were used during testing and the test was performed at a loading rate of 35 psi s three replicates were used for each test and the average of the three measurements are reported the production of sulfuric acid due to the microbially induced concrete corrosion micc causes durability issues inside sewer lines due to the complexities of micc and difficulties in reproducing such process in the laboratory often accelerated sulfuric acid exposure tests are performed to evaluate the damaging effect of micc on concrete structures gutberlet et al 2015 gutiérrez padilla et al 2010 huber et al 2017 although significant differences between micc and sulfuric acid attacks were reported in previous research in this study durability against sulfuric acid attack is only used as a comparative test to evaluate the relative performance of different hvfa concrete materials against micc the chemical durability test was performed following astm c267 but with slight adaptation from previous studies to determine the suitability of concrete 0 concrete 50 and concrete 75 as sewer line construction materials ariffin et al 2013 house 2013 in brief cube samples were initially removed from the casting molds and weighed after 90 days of curing a test media of ph 1 was prepared using sulfuric acid to simulate the microbial acid attack inside sewer lines three different containers were used to submerge different concrete samples by keeping the liquid to solid ratio constant at 4 72 the test media solution was replaced when the solution ph exceeded 1 5 the test was conducted for 120 days after 10 15 35 75 and 120 days of the submerged acid attack three replicates from each container were taken out of the acid solution and washed with a soft bristle brush under tap water to remove loose particles from the sample surface finally these clean samples were observed to identify changes in physical appearance weight and compressive strength the percentage loss or gain in properties weight and compressive strength of the specimens during immersion for each examination period were monitored and reported 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermogravimetric analysis tga tga results are displayed in fig 1 previous research studies that investigated the effect of fa in hvfa materials fa replacement level ranged from 5 to 60 found that with an increasing amount of fa ch content decreased hemalatha et al 2016 shaikh and supit 2015 a similar trend is also observed in fig 1 for paste 0 samples with increasing hydration period from 13 days to 135 days the ch content increased to approximately 25 on the other hand for concrete 50 samples the ch content decreased by approximately 4 from its initial value the highest reduction in ch content is 75 which was achieved by 75 cement replacement in concrete 75 samples reduction in ch content is attributed to two factors i the reduction of overall cement content that ultimately produces less ch as a result of hydration and ii the conversion of ch to csh or its more complex variants such as calcium aluminum silicate hydrates by pozzolanic reaction due to the addition of fa in the mixture in the case of 50 fa replacement level we see a steady level ch throughout the hydration period which is attributed to the balanced production of ch and continuous conversion of ch to csh due to the presence of 50 fa and 50 cement whereas for 75 fa replacement level we observed a steep decline in ch due to the low cement content 25 and the subsequent conversion of some ch to csh the benefit of a pozzolanic reaction is that it produces csh which is a known stable hydration constituent that does not readily release calcium and contributes to the compressive strength of concrete cao et al 2000 this lack of ch content in hvfa paste can be further verified by analyzing the results of the calcium leaching test in the following section 3 2 calcium leaching test the results of the calcium leaching test on paste 0 paste 50 and paste 75 samples are shown in fig 2 and fig s1 a where cumulative calcium concentration of the leachate solution is plotted against the square root of time a trend line of the leaching behavior is used to visualize the calcium ion leaching profile when a binder coupon is fully submerged into di water at ph 5 and 7 all samples followed the same calcium leaching profile because the calcium leaching potential under ph 5 and ph 7 conditions were very similar fig 2 only displays the combined ph leaching profile for the different samples the linearity of the calcium concentration against the square root of time shown in fig 2 indicates that calcium leaching from paste samples are diffusion dominated similar leaching profiles for concrete coupons were obtained in a previous study when the ph varied from 4 to 10 he et al 2013 results clearly show that the cumulative calcium leaching from paste 0 was significantly higher than the paste 50 and paste 75 samples the maximum cumulative calcium leached from the hvfa samples at the end of 90 days was below 5 mg l g of paste sample whereas paste 0 samples leached more than that within the initial 5 days this result is in good agreement with the result found in tga analysis fig s1 b displays the relative percent reduction in calcium ion leaching from hvfa samples when compared to paste 0 results indicate that with 50 and 75 cement replacement calcium leaching is reduced by 74 71 and 86 44 respectively therefore major reduction i e 74 71 in calcium leaching comes from the initial 50 fa replacement whereas an additional 25 replacement of cement reduces calcium leaching by 11 73 which can be attributed to the overall low ch content of paste 75 samples heavy metals from fa can also leach from binders containing fa the measurement of heavy metals leached from paste 50 and paste 75 after 90 days of leaching are provided in table s3 which shows that only cr concentration was above the instrument s detection limit after 90 days of leaching and it did not exceed the pollutant discharge limit provided by usepa clean water act assuming a linear leaching profile for the heavy metals a daily average cr leaching per square inch of the test sample was calculated from the 90 day cumulative data this daily average chromium leaching was found to be 0 0025 mg l for paste 50 and 0 00375 mg l for paste 75 respectively these concentrations are significantly lower than the cr discharge limits shown in table s3 for a typical 40 inch diameter concrete sewer pipe that is running 75 full of wastewater we can approximate the cr leaching to be 0 008 mg l per day per meter therefore we propose that the fa replaced materials developed in this study can effectively reduce calcium leaching potential from sewer lines without excessive leaching of heavy metals that can cause pollution the results found here however are unique to the source of fa and therefore should not be used as a standard measure for any other fa sources we recommend that a heavy metal leaching test be performed before using any type of fa as sewer line construction material to avoid potential occurrence for heavy metal accumulation in wastewater 3 3 fog deposit formation test to identify the effect of calcium availability on fog deposit formation and its adhesion fog deposit formation tests were conducted under two different test conditions in the absence and the presence of background calcium during this test the initial rapid mixing of the oleic acid oil and di water solution created an oil in water type of emulsion when concrete samples were submerged and the mixing rate was decreased the solution became phase separated with an oil layer at the air water interface and a clear solution underneath however when saponification of the lcffas oleic acid started for both test conditions the clear solution turned milky and soap formed on sample surfaces as well as at the air water interface fig s2 fog formation test results are presented in fig 3 where the error bar indicates standard deviation in fig 3 an increase in fa replacement resulted in a decrease in fog deposit formation regardless of the presence of background calcium when compared to concrete 0 samples in the absence of background calcium reduction in fog deposit formation was 58 and 81 for concrete 50 and concrete 75 respectively in the case of the fog deposition test without any background calcium leaching of ch from the concrete specimen was the only source of calcium and the factor that controlled fog deposit formation on sample surfaces previously tga analysis and leaching test results revealed that calcium leaching from the hvfa sample is significantly lower than the sample without any fa addition therefore in the absence of background calcium a decreasing trend in fog deposit formation on fa replaced samples was expected and this decrease is attributed to the reduction in ch content due to fa replacement in the presence of background calcium the reduction in fog deposit formation on concrete 50 and concrete 75 was 55 and 67 respectively when compared to the fog deposit formed on concrete 0 samples even with the presence of background calcium a decreasing trend in fog deposit accumulation on fa replaced samples was found for this test condition however when comparing the two fog deposit test conditions as seen in fig 3 the reduction in fog deposit accumulation on the surface of the concrete 75 sample is not as high 67 vs 81 when background calcium is present this increased accumulation on the surface of the concrete 75 sample may be due to changes in surface characteristics such as surface roughness caused by loss of fa particles from samples surface that allowed for more sites for the attachment of fog deposits however surface properties were not explored in this present research the fog deposit formation tests also revealed changes in the physical appearance of the fog deposit formed on different concrete sample surfaces calcium soap that formed on 0 fa replaced samples were white initially and turned brownish with time whereas soap formed on concrete 50 and concrete 75 samples were gray fig s3 s5 show the difference in the fog depositions color formed on different concrete samples the transition of soap color from white to brown could be a result of fatty acid and oil oxidative rancidity that is initiated by the metal ions like iron available in cement he et al 2013 on the other hand the gray color of soap formed on fa replaced samples can be the result of the carbon present in fa particles released during this test period we also observed that 0 fa replaced sample produced granular solid soap that was difficult to remove from the sample s surfaces as oppose to soft semi solid soap for fa replaced samples that were easy to detach from these surfaces this difference in soap s physical properties could be a result of the calcium content as well as ph that affect the saponification reaction iasmin et al 2014 previous research showed that concrete has a high pore ph 13 5 plusquellec et al 2017 therefore significant ch leaching from concrete 0 samples may cause a high ph and calcium availability at the concrete surface resulting in a granular solid soap formation at the air water interface of the samples this type of granular solid soap structure was found in previous research where saponification reaction occurred at high ph conditions he et al 2013 iasmin et al 2014 conversely the soft and weakly adhered fog deposits formed on fa replaced sample surface for both background calcium conditions may have resulted from the low ch leaching from hvfa concrete which eventually caused low calcium availability and surface ph while these observations were made qualitatively they suggest that the ph and calcium availability at the surface of the sewer line materials not only play a significant role in fog deposit formation they also affect its physical properties and thereby affect the adhesion mechanism finally these results imply that the fog deposit formation potential for the fa replaced samples are always lower than the concrete samples without any fa regardless of the presence of background calcium in the wastewater therefore the conveyance of sewer lines could be enhanced with fa replaced construction materials due to its reduced fog deposit formation and adhesion potential 3 4 ftir analysis of fog deposits the fog deposits formed on different concrete surfaces were analyzed using ftir to observe peaks at different wavelengths according to a previous research study calcium soap exhibits different characteristics ftir wave bands poulenat et al 2003 however other research studies did not report the presence of ca o band at 665 cm 1 as reported by poulenat et al 2003 rather stated that the calcium soap in hydrated form exhibits two strong characteristic asymmetric stretching vibrations at 1577 cm 1 and 1541 cm 1 casadio et al 2019 otero et al 2014 putinier 1970 therefore in this study to determine the percentage calcium soap content of the fog deposit formed on the concrete surface 1577 cm 1 and 1541 cm 1 absorption maxima were considered fig s6 and s7 represent the ftir spectra of fog deposit formed on concrete 0 concrete 50 and concrete 75 samples with and without background calcium test conditions respectively similar ftir spectra were observed for fog deposits collected from sewer systems or produced in labs del mundo and sutheerawattananonda 2017 he et al 2011 from these figures we observe that the ftir spectrum displays the characteristics of calcium soap band at 1468 cm 1 1541 cm 1 1577 cm 1 broad spectrum at 3400 cm 1 and the disappearance of 1740 cm 1 and 1707 cm 1 due to the consumption of ffa and oil during saponification reaction in addition to these characteristics calcium soap bands we observe absorbance spectra near 3000 2800 cm 1 containing four peaks located at 3004 cm 1 c h stretching vibration 2955 cm 1 c h ch3 asymmetric stretching vibration 2922 cm 1 c h ch2 asymmetric stretching vibration and 2851 cm 1 c h ch2 symmetric stretching vibration poulenat et al 2003 these frequencies of the aliphatic chains do not change during the saponification reaction similar ftir spectra of fog deposit formed on different concrete surfaces indicates that the addition of fa in concrete production does not alter the fog deposit formation mechanism moreover apart from the strong asymmetric stretching vibration of calcium soap at 1541 cm 1 and 1577 cm 1 we notice a single peak at 722 cm 1 which indicates that the fog deposit is indeed made of calcium poulenat et al 2003 the characteristic calcium oxygen ca o band near 665 cm 1 was present in the ftir spectra fig s6 and s7 of fog deposits however the intensity of this absorption varied based on the availability of background calcium for the fog deposit formed on samples without background calcium ca o band absorption was lower in comparison to the fog deposit formed on samples with background calcium similarly band absorption near 665 cm 1 also decreased as the fa replacement increased previous studies showed that the intensity of the 665 cm 1 band is positively associated with higher calcium level in fog deposits del mundo and sutheerawattananonda 2017 poulenat et al 2003 the presence of a strong ca o bond intensity near 665 cm 1 for fog deposits formed on the concrete 0 fig s6 with decreasing intensity for fog deposits formed on concrete 50 to concrete 75 samples fig s6 further confirms the effect of calcium availability near the concrete surface on saponification reaction soap formed on the concrete sample surfaces did not exhibit a uniform appearance the soap adhered closest to the concrete surface was firm to the touch while the soap exposed to the wastewater was soft therefore ftir analysis was performed on soap samples separately collected from two different locations one from the concrete surface layer sl and another one from the outer layer ol exposed to the wastewater fig s8 s11 in fig 4 ftir results of concrete 0 show that the characteristics calcium soap absorbance 665 cm 1 1541 cm 1 and 1577 cm 1 at sl was 83 higher than the ol similarly for concrete 50 the characteristic soap absorbance at sl was 68 higher than the ol higher calcium soap absorbance of sl confirms that the hard calcium soap forms where calcium availability and ph are conducive to the formation of harder soaps as described in the literature iasmin et al 2016 table 1 displays the soap content determined from the ftir spectrum fig s6 s7 using eq 1 overall the soap content of the fog deposit on different concrete surfaces decreased from concrete 0 to concrete 75 not surprisingly the soap content increased with the presence of background calcium additionally fog deposits with higher soap content are comparatively rigid soap that adheres firmly to the concrete surface and may aid in further accumulation of unreacted and or partially reacted calcium soap and fog on its surfaces overall from ftir spectra we confirm that the fog deposit formed on concrete surfaces is indeed calcium soap of lcffa however the different ch dissolution from concrete materials resulted in a high to low ph and calcium ion gradient from the concrete surface towards the bulk wastewater solution as a result granular and hard calcium soap formed on sl through saponification reaction at a higher ph and calcium availability whereas the soft soap formed on the ol showing high absorbance at 1740 cm 1 and 1707 cm 1 indicates the accumulation of partially saponified or unreacted fog at a low ph and calcium availability moreover we hypothesize that the hard soap formed on the sl may aid in further adhesion of unreacted fog at the ol ultimately resulting in a heterogenous makeup of fog deposit on concrete surfaces 3 5 compressive strength and durability of concrete replacement materials the development of concrete materials for any purpose must be assessed for their compressive strength and durability required for its engineering application therefore the compressive strength development of the hvfa concrete materials was measured over a year of sealed curing according to astm c76 and astm c655 for class 3 class 4 standard reinforced concrete pipe segments a compressive strength of 4 ksi is required for sewer line construction a series of compressive strength tests at different curing age was performed and results are presented in fig 5 after 90 days of compressive strength test concrete materials containing 0 and 50 fa satisfy the strength requirement for sewer line construction while concrete materials containing 75 fa met the requirement after 180 days fa contributes to compressive strength through relatively slower pozzolanic reactions compared to cement hydration by reducing the volume and size of capillary pores additionally for concrete 75 the amount of ch in the material is very low therefore the conversion of ch to csh is less thus fa replaced samples specially 75 fa replaced concrete gain strength at a slower rate compressive strength gain of concrete 0 concrete 50 and concrete 75 from 90 days to 365 days are 20 23 and 41 respectively a similar trend was observed in previous research studies atiş 2005 cao et al 2000 de la varga et al 2012 kocak and nas 2014 although the initial low compressive strength 90 days of sealed cure of 75 fa replaced concrete does not meet the class 4 standard reinforced concrete pipe segments concrete 75 should not be considered unsuitable pre cast concrete sewer lines are not placed in service immediately after casting as we observed more than 4 ksi compressive strength after 180 days of sealed curing 75 fa replaced concrete can also be used for sewer line construction chemical durability tests on concrete samples were performed to evaluate the effect of micc fig 6 shows that the compressive strength of concrete 0 and concrete 50 samples exhibit high acid resistance up to 35 days of the acid attack which is attributed to the buffering of acid by ch dissolution from concrete samples as the acid attack continues gypsum forms due to high ch dissolution causing a considerable reduction in compressive strength gutberlet et al 2015 huber et al 2017 concrete 75 on the other hand shows high compressive strength reduction over the entire testing period which can be attributed to the lack of acid buffering due to the low ch dissolution from these samples due to the acid attack concrete samples lost weight and the results are shown in fig s12 although initially up to 35 days concrete 0 and concrete 50 samples showed negligible weight loss after 70 days of the acid attack concrete 0 experienced severe mass loss tga analysis and leaching potential test showed that concrete 0 contains a higher ch percentage that may lead to expansion and cracking by gypsum formation gutberlet et al 2015 huber et al 2017 as a result of the crack formation we understand that concrete 0 samples showed a significant reduction in compressive strength as well as substantial weight loss at the later stages of acid exposure due to the loss of aggregates on the other hand 75 fa replaced samples experienced considerable weight loss over the entire test period which can be due to the low ch content and loss of unreacted fa particles from the concrete structure interestingly 50 fa replaced concrete samples did not show a sharp rise in mass loss which can be due to the balance between ch dissolution and buffering of acid 4 conclusion the goal of this research was to demonstrate an alternative strategy to reduce the fog deposit formation and its adhesion to sewer surfaces by replacing 50 and 75 of portland cement with fly ash fa hydration of portland cement results in the formation of calcium hydroxide which is water soluble and the main source of calcium release from concrete replacing cement with fa not only reduces the portland cement content of concrete but also converts calcium hydroxide to calcium silicate hydrate which is water insoluble three concrete materials concrete 0 concrete 50 and concrete 75 were evaluated and it was observed that the incorporation of fa reduced calcium leaching from concrete thereby reduced fog deposit formation and its adhesion on concrete surfaces regardless of the presence of background calcium fa replaced concrete samples formed fog deposits that weakly adhered to the concrete surface additionally ftir spectra of fog deposits formed on different concrete surfaces suggest that a spatial variation of fog deposit exists with harder deposits mostly made of calcium soap forming near the concrete surface and smooth yet tacky soap that predominantly consisted of unreacted fog forming on the outer layer of the fog deposit we conclude that this spatial change in physical properties of fog deposits is due to the ch dissolution from concrete resulting in a gradient of ph and calcium availability between concrete surface and wastewater bulk solution therefore fog deposits closest to the sewer line surface adheres strongly and may provide an anchoring region for further accumulation of fog deposits as well as unreacted fog however future research is required to measure the rheological properties of fog deposits attached to concrete surfaces to assess the effect of binder properties surface ph and calcium availability on the fog deposit s physical characteristics overall our study revealed that hvfa concrete materials could be an alternative solution for future sewer line construction or rehabilitation strategy to reduce the fog deposit formation and its adhesion inside concrete sewer collection systems future research however is also needed to explore the fundamental mechanisms of fog deposit adhesion on material surfaces to explore methods that can alter sewer line surface properties to minimize the accumulation of fog deposits inside all sewer pipelines and improve its conveyance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

17524,the influence of effluent organic matter efom on phosphate removal by adsorption plays an important role in evaluating the applicability of adsorbents currently molecular understanding of efom regarding its impact on adsorption is insufficient due to a lack of appropriate efom fractionation characterization protocols as associated with the specific structure function property of adsorbents in this work a combined method coupling deae xad fractionation with molecular characterization was proposed targeting the versatile structure function characters of nanocomposite to reveal the composition of efom as well as its impact on phosphate removal by nanocomposite during long term adsorption regeneration runs zirconium based polystyrene anion exchanger hzo 201 was selected as a representative nanocomposite featuring with porous networking matrix positively charged surface and multiple adsorptive sites the efom samples from three biologically treated sewage effluent sources were separated into fractions of negatively charged organic acid oa and hydrophobic transphilic hydrophilic neutral base hpo n b tpi n b and hpi n b the combined method enables effective differentiation of the charge aromaticity molecular weight and functionalities of the fractions matching the multiple structural surface characteristics of hzo 201 and favoring the evaluation on the impact of the efom fractions the interference sequence of the efom fractions on phosphate removal followed an order of oa hpo n b tpi n b hpi n b the oa fraction characterized by negatively charged aromatic functionalities and broad molecular weight distribution 1 5 kda and 14 kda was recognized as the key interfering fraction presumably due to its multiple adsorption pathways i e ion exchange π π interactions and pore filling particularly the low molecular weight oa moieties 1 4 kda progressively accumulated onto the nanocomposite via irreversible adsorption causing a continuous phosphate capacity loss by 32 70 over multiple cycles we believe the combined fractionation characterization method may be extended to other complex water systems to identify key influential organic matters in polishing treatment of various pollutants by adsorption graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords efom fractionation diagnosis phosphate nanocomposite 1 introduction phosphorus as both a causative contaminant of eutrophication in wastewater and a finite resource on the earth has received global concerns on its removal and recycling muster et al 2013 sengupta and pandit 2011 municipal

properties for adsorption such as the porous host matrix charged surface and multiple active sites i e amino groups and metal oxide nanoparticles chen et al 2020 dong et al 2017 muhammad et al 2019 the positively charged amino groups covalently binding the host matrix could facilitate pre concentration and permeation of phosphate into the nanocomposites sarkar et al 2010 and the encapsulated metal oxides i e hydrous zirconium lanthanum and ferric oxides inside the host pores specifically adsorb phosphate via an inner sphere complexation blaney et al 2007 wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 chen et al 2015 this type of adsorbents are often of high adsorptive selectivity toward phosphate over co existing competing anions i e so4 2 no3 and cl acelas et al 2015 chen et al 2015 however the influence of co existing effluent organic matter efom from biologically treated sewage effluent btse should not be overlooked as the efom of high heterogeneity is usually ubiquitous in btse quaranta et al 2012 efom could affect phosphate working capacity and regeneration efficiency of nanocomposites through multiple pathways including pore blockage direct site competition electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions kim 2015 ling et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 kim 2015 reported that the negatively charged organic acids in efom suppressed phosphate uptake by miex through site competition over amino groups on the resin beads whereas the hydrophobic neutral bases dominantly occupied the iron oxide core sites through hydrophobic interactions kim 2015 our previous work demonstrated that the small sized gallic acid 170 da decreased phosphate capacity of the zirconium embedded nanocomposites by competing for the adsorptive sites while the relatively large tannic acid 1701 da inhibited phosphate adsorption kinetics via pore blockage lin et al 2017 these influences usually originate from the different fractions of efom and are also closely correlated with their specific molecular characteristics i e charge property hydrophobicity molecular size and functional groups boyer and singer 2006 hence rational fractionation protocols and characterization techniques to analyze efom at molecular level are required for identifying the effect of efom fractions on phosphate removal by nanocomposite materials current fractionation methods mainly focus on the characteristic differences in hydrophobicity of efom fractions using xad 8 and xad 4 resins to classify efom into hydrophobic transphilic and hydrophilic fractions jarusutthirak and amy 2007 yamamura et al 2014 however the distinctions in charge property between the efom fractions often get neglected because of the poor recovery of neutral base moieties by alkaline extraction leenheer 1981 which was thus unable to provide sufficient information about efom for recognizing its effect on phosphate separation each fraction after the xad 8 xad 4 isolation is actually heterogeneously charged mixtures of acids and neutral bases containing both humic and protein like substances as indicated by the indistinctive differentiation in fluorescence properties and molecular weight mw distribution between the fractions hou et al 2016 zheng et al 2014 one previous study suggested a weak base exchanger diethyl aminoethyl deae cellulose could efficiently react with the carboxylic hydroxyl groups of humic molecules and extract the negatively charged acidic solutes from efom referred to as organic acid kim and dempsey 2012 hence the combination of deae cellulose and xad 8 xad 4 resins can potentially distinguish efom substances based on their differences in charge and hydrophobicity leading to a separation of efom into organic acid oa and hydrophobic transphilic hydrophilic neutral base hpo n b tpi n b and hpi n b fractions additionally integrated characterization with high performance size exclusion chromatography hp sec three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy 3d eem and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir could effectively identify efom fractions with respect to their molecule size chemical compositions and functional groups in this study a combinative method of coupling deae xad mediated fractionation with multiple characterization techniques was proposed for investigating individual efom fractions at molecular level and identifying their impact on phosphate removal by nanocomposite material zirconium based anion exchanger hzo 201 characterized by porous polymer matrix positively charged surface and multiple adsorptive sites was chosen as a model nanocomposite adsorbent because this material presents similar structure function properties to many other nanocomposites i e hix miex and mch the efom samples were fractionated according to their characteristic differences in charge hydrophobicity and characterized by hp sec 3d eem and ftir technologies in terms of molecular weight chemical compositions and functional groups herein the criterion i e molecular weight charge hydrophobicity and functionalities for the efom fractionation characterization are based on the specific structure function characters i e porous structure charged surface and multiple functionalities of the nanocomposite for adsorption we believe the proposed combinative method targeting at the impact assessment of efom on adsorption can also apply to other various nanocomposites and adsorbents of similar structural functional properties 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and water samples non ionic resins xad 8 and xad 4 were purchased from

physicochemical properties of hzo 201 are described in fig s1 and table s1 the efom samples denoted as xl cb and jxz were collected from three mwtps jiangsu china which use biological methods of cyclic activated sludge technology cast sequencing batch reactor sbr and anoxic oxic ao processes for sewage treatment respectively the water samples were pre filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes whatman and stored in a fridge at 4 c the physicochemical properties of the three water samples are shown in table s2 2 2 efom fractionating based on charge and hydrophobicity the efom samples were fractionated using deae cellulose and xad 8 xad 4 resins on the basis of a modified method kim and dempsey 2012 the deae and xad resins were activated and cleaned following an approach described by miles et al 1983 and thurman and malcolm 1981 all the packed columns were rinsed with deionized water until the eluent effluents reached neutral ph with dissolved organic carbon doc lower than 0 1 mg l 1 as illustrated in fig s2 500 ml of water sample was filtered with cellulose acetate membranes 0 45 μm and adjusted to ph 7 0 then the water sample was passed through the deae column at 50 ml h 1 the oa fraction was eluted by 200 ml of naoh solution 0 1 m flowing at 30 ml h 1 through the deae cellulose afterward the effluent from the deae column was pumped through the xad 8 and xad 4 columns in series at 50 ml h 1 the hpo n b and tpi n b fractions were separately extracted from the xad 8 and xad 4 resins with acetonitrile solutions 75 acetonitrile 25 milli q water v v at 20 ml h 1 and the excess acetonitrile was removed by vacuum rotary evaporation at 40 c the hpi n b fraction was remained in the effluent the na oa eluate was desalted by passing through a h form cation exchanger column doc and uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 of the influent effluent of each column were measured to determine the proportion of the efom fractions doc was analyzed by a total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu japan uv254 was determined by uv vis spectrometer t6 pgeneral china with a quartz cell 1 cm all the fractionating processes were performed in triplicate 2 3 characterization of efom fractions in aromaticity molecular weight and functionality the aromaticity of the efom fractions was investigated using an indicator namely the specific uv254 absorbance suva which could be defined as the ratio of uv254 to doc as suggested by karanfil et al 2002 a high suva 4 l mg 1 m 1 implies an abundance of aromatic and high mw substances in water while a low suva 4 l mg 1 m 1 indicates a relatively high content of aliphatic and low mw substances the mw distributions of the efom fractions was probed by a hp sec equipped with an online uv detector 2489 waters and a gel permeation column xbridge protein beh sec 125 waters each efom fraction was further separated by the hp sec based on mw and probed at combined wavelengths of 210 nm and 254 nm by the uv detector a mixed solution of phosphate buffer na2hpo4 nah2po4 2 4 mm 1 6 mm and na2so4 25 0 mm was used as the mobile phase flowing at 1 0 ml min 1 sodium polystyrene sulfonates pss fluka of 210 4300 17000 32000 and 77000 da were used as the calibration standards the 3d eem fluorescence spectra of the efom fractions were collected by a fluorescence spectrophotometer f7000 hitachi japan with a 150 w xenon arc lamp as the excitation source the excitation scans were performed within 275 525 nm at 10 nm increments and the emission fluorescence intensity was recorded within 225 425 nm at 5 nm steps with an integration time of 0 1 s the slits of both excitation and emission were set at 5 nm band pass the efom fractions were diluted to 5 mg l 1 with a same dilution ratio to minimize the inner filter effect henderson et al 2009 the eem response of milli q water was subtracted from the fluorescence spectra to reduce the raman scattering effect and extra background noise baker et al 2003 the eem spectra were divided into five regions according to previous studies chen et al 2003 pramanik et al 2014 region i ex em 220 260 nm 280 330 nm and region ii ex em 220 260 nm 330 380 nm represent

like soluble microbial product like smp like and humic acid like ha like substances respectively given the low detection sensitivity of carbohydrate like materials by fluorescence and uv detectors the carbohydrates in the efom fractions were quantitatively measured through a phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 using glucose glu as the standard carbohydrates meanwhile proteins and humic substances were determined by a modified lowry method fr olund et al 1995 using bovine serum albumin bsa and humic acid ha as the standard references respectively the molecular functionalities of the efom fractions were identified by a ft ir spectroscopy thermo scientific nicolet is5 usa equipped with an attenuated total reflectance atr accessory each spectrum was collected by averaging 64 scans at 2 cm 1 resolution within 4000 400 cm 1 the efom fractions for atr ftir analysis were lyophilized and powdered prior to sample loading 2 4 impact assessment of efom fractions on phosphate removal by hzo 201 nanocomposite the efom fractions were separately spiked with sodium sulfate na2so4 solution to reach an identical initial doc concentration and ionic strength to investigate the effect of efom fractions on phosphate removal 0 5 g l 1 hzo 201 beads were added into 250 ml solution containing a preset amount of phosphate 10 0 mg l 1 and each coexisting efom fractions 20 0 mg l 1 followed by stirring at 25 c for 120 h to reach equilibrium the solution ph was maintained at 6 5 0 2 using hcl 0 1 m and naoh 0 1 m aliquot of 1 0 ml was sampled at desired time intervals for phosphate analysis the multicycle adsorption regeneration experiments were conducted with a bench scale approach mergen et al 2008 in brief hzo 201 0 5 g l 1 was vibrated with 100 ml of phosphate 10 0 mg l 1 in the absence or presence of each efom fractions 20 0 mg l 1 for 2 h the adsorption operations were repeated for five times without any regeneration in between to simulate the actual operation of resin in industries the used hzo 201 was regenerated by naoh nacl 5 5 m v solutions for 2 h the regenerated adsorbents were reused for subsequent adsorption regeneration cycles after rinse with deionized water and the spent brine was replaced with fresh regenerant between cycles the removal and desorption rates of phosphate were determined based on mass balance and correlated with cycle numbers the phosphate concentration was measured with a molybdenum blue method tobey et al 2003 the desorbed efom fractions in the eluted solutions were subjected to molecular characterization 3 results and discussion 3 1 fractionation characterization of efom the deae xad mediated fractionation coordinating with subsequent characterization distinguished the charge and hydrophobicity of efom by separating into oa hpo n b tpi n b and hpi fractions and further identified their distinctive characteristics in aromaticity molecular weight and functionalities 3 1 1 doc and aromaticity of efom fractions as presented in fig 1 a the hpi n b was the dominant fraction of efom from three btse sources accounting for 47 71 in doc content followed by the oa of 14 29 whereas the proportions of the hpo n b 7 14 and tpi n b 8 17 were the least the composition was similar to those of domestic wastewaters as reported by imai et al 2002 and shon et al 2006 the oa fractions made a significant contribution to uv254 absorbance 54 75 implying that the oa mainly consisted of uv adsorptive compounds fig 1b shows the suva values of each efom fractions the oa fractions abundant in negatively charged acidic materials exhibited the highest suva the result dramatically differed from the fractionating outcomes of efom by conventional xad based methods which often assigned the highest suva to hydrophobic fractions leenheer 1981 yang et al 2013 the highest suva of the oa fractions suggested that the aromatic moieties of efom chiefly came from the negatively charged organic acids rather than from the hydrophobic fractions karanfil et al 2002 the suva values of the neutral base fractions were all lower than 4 l mg 1 m 1 and followed a sequence of hpo n b tpi n b hpi n b indicating the aliphatic nature of these fractions świetlik et al 2004 3 1 2 molecular weight distribution of efom fractions the rich crosslinked pores of resin based nanocomposite could block large organic molecules but allow small ones travel through via pore surface diffusion zhang et al 2014 therefore mw of efom is regarded as a crucial factor affecting the adsorption behavior of nanocomposite fig 2 shows that the efom fractions in the same category from three different btse sources presented similar mw distributions while the mw distributions of the different fractions varied from one fraction to another as observed in fig 2a the oa appeared a multimodal distribution at 1 5 kda and a sharp peak at 14 kda whereas the other fractions were only distributed in a narrow low mw range 1 3 kda the results manifested that the molecules in the oa fractions were of a wider mw range and more abundant in high mw 14 kda substances than those in the other fractions as suggested by previous finding pramanik et al 2014 the multiple peaks of the oa could be separately recognized as biopolymers humic substances building blocks breakdown products of humic substances low mw acids and neutrals with their mw decreasing in sequence uv210 absorbance is characteristic of amino groups myat et al 2012 as seen in fig 2b the hpi n b fractions showed single peaks at 1 6 kda when measured by a uv210 detector implying that the hpi n b fractions were primarily composed of low mw neutrals presumably containing amino groups 3 1 3 chemical composition and molecular functionality of efom fractions polymeric nanocomposite featuring with multiple surface functionalities i e positively charged amino groups and aromatic phenyl groups tends to adsorb organic molecules via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions yang et al 2015 hence the compositions and functionalities of efom could also influence adsorption performance fig s3 shows three pronounced fluorescence peaks in the eem profiles of the raw efom samples associated with smp fa and ha like substances respectively interestingly the fluorescence peaks of the oa hpo n b tpi n b and hpi n b fractions were separately assigned to the different regions which correspondingly represented fa ha like protein ii like protein i like and smp like materials as observed in fig 3 a and table s3 this result demonstrated that the oa hpo n b tpi n b and hpi n b fractions were mainly comprised of aromatic acid protein ii protein i and smp like substances respectively similar finding was also reported elsewhere that the neutral base uncharged positively charged moieties presented fluorescent characteristics similar to proteins humbert et al 2005 additionally carbohydrate protein and humic acid like materials in the efom fractions were also quantitatively analyzed as depicted in fig 3b carbohydrates were chiefly present in the hpi n b fractions 15 73 19 11 mg glu l 1 in agreement with the low suva 1 00 l mg 1 m 1 of the hpi n b as previously discussed fig 1b protein and humic acid like substances predominantly existed in the tpi n b 5 11 6 06 mg bsa l 1 and oa 1 07 1 29 mg ha l 1 fractions respectively which was consistent with the fluorescence eem fingerprints of the oa and tpi n b fig 3a information about molecular functionalities of the efom fractions was shown by ft ir spectra in fig s4 the strong peaks of c o stretching 1704 cm 1 kanokkantapong et al 2006 pernet coudrier et al 2008 xue et al 2009 c o stretching 1180 1030 cm 1 gur reznik et al 2008 and o h vibration 3390 cm 1 kang et al 2002 were indicative of an abundance of carboxylic groups in the oa fractions the noticeable aromatic c c vibration peaks at 1650 1630 cm 1 kang et al 2002 smidt and meissl 2007 represented the aromatic functionalities of the oa fractions these results demonstrated that aromatic carboxylic acids might be the major components of the oa fractions the evident aliphatic hydrocarbon peaks at 2960 2850 cm 1 and 1460 1420 cm 1 leenheer 1981 zheng et al 2014 xue et al 2009 presented in the hpo n b and tpi n b fractions signified the aliphatic nature of this two fractions which accounted for their low suva as shown in fig 1b the c o stretching peaks of carboxylic groups 1704 cm 1 kang et al 2002 observed in the hpo n b further indicated the aliphatic carboxylic acids in the hpo n b fractions the pronounced amide ii peaks of n h band 1558 cm 1 dignac et al 2000 khan et al 2013 and c n band 1259 cm 1 huo et al 2008 of the hpo n b and tpi n b fractions denoted the abundance of protein like substances which contributed to the proteinaceous fluorescent properties of the hpo n b and tpi n b fig 3a additionally the c o stretching peaks at 1100 cm 1 of the hpi n b implied the presence of carbohydrates in the hpi n b fractions xue et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 above all the combinative fractionation characterization method identified the distinctive characteristics of individual efom fractions in aromaticity mw distribution and molecular functionalities which provided desirable accuracy and reliability of using the combinative method for the impact diagnosis of efom fractions on nanocomposite adsorbents 3 2 verification of proposed mechanistic hypothesis between efom fractions and polymeric nanocomposite 3 2 1 proposed influencing mechanism of efom fractions on polymeric nanocomposite as illustrated in fig s1 the hzo 201 nanocomposite is featured with multiple binding sites or pathways for adsorption including the positively charged amino groups phenyl groups crosslinked nanopores of host polymer and the hydroxyl groups of immobilized hzo nanoparticles with the aid of the combinative fractionation characterization method molecular information about the efom fractions regarding their charge aromaticity molecular weight and functionality corresponds to the multiple structural functional properties of hzo 201 for adsorption which favors the prediction of underlying influencing mechanisms of efom fractions on polymeric nanocomposite the oa fractions abundant in negatively charged carboxylic acids and aromatic moieties are presumably of high binding affinity to the amino and phenyl groups of hzo 201 through an ion exchange and π π interactions or van der waals force respectively tan and kilduff 2007 shuang et al 2012 on the contrary the hpo n b tpi n b and hpi n b fractions primarily consist of uncharged positively charged substances i e carbohydrates and proteins and aliphatic moieties making ion exchange and π π interactions unavailable for their effective adsorption the pore filling likely plays a role in their uptake by hzo 201 due to the low mw 1 3 kda of the three fractions and the plenty of nanopores total pore volume 0 20 cm3 g 1 table s1 in hzo 201 zhang et al 2017 liu et al 2020 likewise the pore filling mechanism could also be expected for capturing some oa molecules of low mw therefore it was deduced that the oa fractions are of higher adsorption potential on hzo 201 than the other fractions because of their multiple adsorption pathways these proposed mechanistic hypotheses were verified through diagnosing the impact of fractionated efom on phosphate removal by hzo 201 nanocomposite 3 2 2 verification on impact of efom fractions on phosphate removal by hzo 201 nanocomposite given that the three raw waters were similar in chemical compositions and molecular functionalities the moderate hydrophobic water of cb was used for our experiments as depicted in fig 4 a the adsorption equilibrium of phosphate reached in 1000 min in the absence of the efom fractions the presence of the hpo n b tpi n b or hpi n b fractions prolonged the contact time 3000 min that was needed for reaching the adsorption equilibrium but posed negligible influence on the adsorptive capacities of phosphate at the equilibrium this result suggested that the hpo n b tpi n b and hpi n b could suppress the phosphate adsorption rates possibly through pore narrowing clogging mergen et al 2008 but would not compete for the adsorptive sites to a notable extent as elucidated in section 3 1 the hpo n b tpi n b or hpi n b fractions were chiefly comprised of uncharged positively charged carbohydrates or proteins and aliphatic moieties thereby exerting no significant site competition or surface interaction towards the amino and phenyl groups of hzo 201 due to weak electrostatic and π π interactions mergen et al 2008 humbert et al 2005 presumably the wide pore size distribution of hzo 201 v micro 0 02 cm3 g 1 v meso macro 0 20 cm3 g 1 table s1 and the low mw 1 3 kda of the three fractions could facilitate their capturing via pore filling zhang et al 2017 liu et al 2020 which tended to narrow block the pores and limit the mass transfer of phosphate by contrast the oa fraction decreased both the equilibrium absorption capacity by 15 and the adsorption rate of phosphate as compared to the single phosphate system this was likely attributable to the abundant negatively charged carboxylic acids and aromatic moieties in the oa fraction which could not only occupy the amino groups of hzo 201 through an ion exchange but interact with the host polymer via π π interactions yang et al 2015 additionally as a result of the broad mw range 1 5 kda and 14 kda the oa molecules were presumably able to diffuse into and narrow block the pores of hzo 201 thereby reducing the adsorption rate and capacity of phosphate these multiple adsorption pathways enhanced the oa sequestration by hzo 201 which accounted for their greater effect on phosphate removal than that of the other fractions as indicated by our previous work lin et al 2017 it can be expected that the surface hydroxyl groups of the embedded hzo nanoparticles of hzo 201 were not significantly affected by the efom fractions and retained their high selectivity and capacity towards phosphate regeneration efficiency plays a crucial role in determining the cost effectiveness of one adsorbent in application kumar et al 2019 fig 4b shows the phosphate removal rates during repeated adsorption regeneration runs in the absence and presence of the individual efom fractions the phosphate removal rates remained stable 39 00 37 53 over 17 cycles in the sole phosphate system indicating a superior reusability of hzo 201 for phosphate sequestration the oa fraction decreased the phosphate removal at the first cycle by 15 64 while the other fractions decreased it merely by 0 5 38 which was in good accordance with the inhibiting effect of each efom fractions on the equilibrium capacity of phosphate as discussed in fig 4a with the increasing of cycle number the phosphate removal rates underwent downward trends of different degrees by 32 70 17 51 12 15 and 5 94 during 17 cycles in the background of the oa hpo n b tpi n b or hpi n b fraction respectively as suggested by ling et al 2014 the varying degrees of the decline of phosphate removal rates represented different fouling levels of hzo 201 resulted from a progressive accumulation of efom fractions on the nanocomposite during its repeated usage as a result the inhibiting effect caused by the accumulation of the efom fractions on the long term performance of phosphate removal following the sequence of oa hpo n b tpi n b hpi n b the oa fraction with some aromatic carboxylic acid molecules unionized when adsorbed through non ionic interactions i e π π interactions could not be effectively regenerated by naoh nacl 5 5 m v solutions which basically functioned via an ion or ligand exchange yang et al 2013 this was likely one of the main causes contributing to the continuous accumulation of the oa molecules onto the hzo 201 nanocomposite thereby exerting the greatest inhibition on phosphate removal in multiple cycles conversely the long term influence from the hpo n b tpi n b and hpi n b fractions were significantly lower probably attributing to the low binding affinities of these fractions toward hzo 201 arising from their uncharged positively charged and aliphatic nature in addition as observed in fig s5 the overall desorption efficiencies of phosphate all remained at 90 were independent of the presence of efom fractions which signified a minimal effect of efom loading on phosphate regeneration 3 2 3 evolution of efom fractions during repeated adsorption regeneration runs the evolutions of efom fractions were monitored throughout the repeated adsorption regeneration runs of the hzo 201 nanocomposite to explore the interfering mechanisms of each fractions on phosphate removal as depicted in fig 5 a the peak intensities of the four efom fractions all became much lower than their initial levels after 5 10 and 15 cycles of adsorption demonstrating that all the fractions were simultaneously captured by hzo 201 during the multicycle adsorption regeneration of phosphate this result accounted for the underlying site competition and pore clogging caused by the efom fractions as discussed in section 3 2 2 the initial oa fraction in the repeated adsorption regeneration experiments displayed multiple peaks within a low mw range 1 4 kda but presented no apparent high mw biopolymer peak 14 kda which was likely missing from the oa desalting processes consequently the adverse impact of oa fractions on phosphate removal as has been identified in section 3 2 2 should be underestimated because of the loss of some high mw moieties in the oa fraction as suggested by the variations of peak intensities fig 5a the remaining amount of the oa in the water phase went higher with increasing the adsorption regeneration cycles from 5 to 15 signifying that fewer oa could be adsorbed by hzo 201 after undergoing more cycles of adsorption regeneration this result represented a progressive accumulation of the oa molecules on hzo 201 during the continuous adsorption regeneration runs ling et al 2014 which corresponded to the rapid decline of phosphate removal in the background of the oa fraction fig 4b by contrast the amount of the remaining hpo n b fraction in the solution first turned higher from 5 to 10 cycles and then reached a plateau level after 10 cycles indicating that there would be no further irreversible adsorption of the hpo n b molecules onto hzo 201 after 10 adsorption regeneration cycles as for the tpi n b and hpi n b fractions their remaining amount in the solution maintained a constant level from 5 to 15 cycles implying a much higher regeneration rate of the tpi n b and hpi n b fractions than that of the oa and hpo n b fractions these findings demonstrated that the irreversible adsorption potential of each efom fraction followed an order of oa hpo n b tpi n b or hpi n b which agreed well with their corresponding influencing tendencies on phosphate removal in the long term adsorption regeneration runs as described in fig 4b the desorbed efom fractions from all the cycles were collected and analyzed with hp sec and 3d eem methods fig 5b as has been verified in fig 5a some oa moieties of relatively low mw 1 4 kda were markedly sequestrated by hzo 201 during the repeated adsorption regeneration of phosphate but the adsorption of high mw oa moieties 14 kda was less pronounced surprisingly the substances desorbed from the oa loaded hzo 201 presented an evident biopolymer peak at 14 kda while peaks within the low mw range 1 4 kda were insignificant as illustrated in fig 5b these results suggested that the high mw oa moieties captured by hzo 201 could be favorably desorbed along with the regeneration of the nanocomposite whereas the low mw oa moieties appeared to be irreversibly adsorbed into the inner pores of hzo 201 lin et al 2017 hence the low mw compounds in the oa fraction were specifically recognized as the key interfering element which inclined to affect the reusability of hzo 201 nanocomposite and its long term performance in phosphate removal additionally the desorbed substances from the oa loaded hzo 201 were further identified to be fulvic acid like or humic acid like materials as indicated by the eem fluorescence fingerprints given the low mw character of the irreversibly adsorbed oa moieties and the specific desorbing pathway by using naoh nacl i e ion ligand exchange it could be expected that the irreversibly adsorbed low mw oa moieties were likely captured by the porous polymer matrix of hzo 201 via a pore filling or π π interactions the desorbed hpo n b tpi n b and hpi n b fractions presented similar mw and eem fluorescence properties to those of the desorbed oa but varied somewhat in quantities on the basis of the above analyses the oa fraction was identified as the key element in efom affecting the adsorption of hzo 201 nanocomposite toward phosphate the plausible influencing mechanisms are schematically summarized in fig 6 4 conclusions this work employed a combinative method of deae xad mediated fractionation and molecular characterization techniques for identifying effluent organic matter efom in real biologically treated sewage effluent and its impact on phosphate removal by nanocomposite material hzo 201 the efom was separated into fractions of organic acid oa hydrophobic transphilic and hydrophilic neutral base hpo n b tpi n b and hpi n b using the combinative method the distinctive characteristics of each efom fractions regarding their charge aromaticity molecular weight and functionalities corresponded to the multiple structure function properties of hzo 201 we made hypothesis on the possible influential mechanism of efom fractions on hzo 201 the hypothesis was later verified by the subsequent adsorption experiments using fractionated efom on hzo 201 the adverse effects i e phosphate capacity loss and adsorbent fouling of efom fractions on phosphate removal were closely correlated with their charge aromaticity and molecular weight following an order of oa hpo n b tpi n b hpi n b the oa fraction featuring with negatively charged aromatic moieties and broad molecular weight distribution 1 5 kda and 14 kda was recognized as the key interfering fraction presumably attributing to its multiple adsorption pathways on hzo 201 i e ion exchange π π interactions and pore filling the relatively low molecular weight oa moieties 1 4 kda inclined to progressively accumulate onto hzo 201 through irreversible adsorption during repeated adsorption regeneration runs leading to a continuous phosphate capacity loss by 32 70 overtime the combinative method used in the study favors the investigation of efom influence on phosphate removal by nanocomposite which may widely apply to the study on the impact of organic matters on adsorption functional materials in complex water systems the irreversible capacity loss caused by oa could also inspire the development of rational oa targeted pretreatment technologies for

17524,the influence of effluent organic matter efom on phosphate removal by adsorption plays an important role in evaluating the applicability of adsorbents currently molecular understanding of efom regarding its impact on adsorption is insufficient due to a lack of appropriate efom fractionation characterization protocols as associated with the specific structure function property of adsorbents in this work a combined method coupling deae xad fractionation with molecular characterization was proposed targeting the versatile structure function characters of nanocomposite to reveal the composition of efom as well as its impact on phosphate removal by nanocomposite during long term adsorption regeneration runs zirconium based polystyrene anion exchanger hzo 201 was selected as a representative nanocomposite featuring with porous networking matrix positively charged surface and multiple adsorptive sites the efom samples from three biologically treated sewage effluent sources were separated into fractions of negatively charged organic acid oa and hydrophobic transphilic hydrophilic neutral base hpo n b tpi n b and hpi n b the combined method enables effective differentiation of the charge aromaticity molecular weight and functionalities of the fractions matching the multiple structural surface characteristics of hzo 201 and favoring the evaluation on the impact of the efom fractions the interference sequence of the efom fractions on phosphate removal followed an order of oa hpo n b tpi n b hpi n b the oa fraction characterized by negatively charged aromatic functionalities and broad molecular weight distribution 1 5 kda and 14 kda was recognized as the key interfering fraction presumably due to its multiple adsorption pathways i e ion exchange π π interactions and pore filling particularly the low molecular weight oa moieties 1 4 kda progressively accumulated onto the nanocomposite via irreversible adsorption causing a continuous phosphate capacity loss by 32 70 over multiple cycles we believe the combined fractionation characterization method may be extended to other complex water systems to identify key influential organic matters in polishing treatment of various pollutants by adsorption graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords efom fractionation diagnosis phosphate nanocomposite 1 introduction phosphorus as both a causative contaminant of eutrophication in wastewater and a finite resource on the earth has received global concerns on its removal and recycling muster et al 2013 sengupta and pandit 2011 municipal wastewater treatment plants mwtp are considered as one of the major sources for anthropogenic phosphorus it is essential to implement means to eliminate phosphorus especially when the regulation of phosphorus discharge becomes increasingly stringent adsorption is a promising technology for polishing removal of phosphorus from wastewater metal based nanomaterials fang et al 2018 vu and wu 2020 wu et al 2017 and porous nanocomposites acelas et al 2015 chen et al 2020 dong et al 2017 have emerged as new classes of adsorbents that exhibit enhanced phosphorus removal efficiency through non specific i e electrostatic attraction and specific i e inner sphere complexation interactions among them porous nanocomposites i e polymeric nanocomposite hybrid ion exchange hix magnetic ion exchange miex and magnetic cationic hydrogel mch are known for their high adsorption capacities and good hydraulic properties i e amenable to separation and reuse making them promising candidates for practical usage in wastewater treatment chen et al 2020 dong et al 2017 muhammad et al 2019 kim 2015 these diverse nanocomposites are made of different materials but similar in their structural surface properties for adsorption such as the porous host matrix charged surface and multiple active sites i e amino groups and metal oxide nanoparticles chen et al 2020 dong et al 2017 muhammad et al 2019 the positively charged amino groups covalently binding the host matrix could facilitate pre concentration and permeation of phosphate into the nanocomposites sarkar et al 2010 and the encapsulated metal oxides i e hydrous zirconium lanthanum and ferric oxides inside the host pores specifically adsorb phosphate via an inner sphere complexation blaney et al 2007 wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 chen et al 2015 this type of adsorbents are often of high adsorptive selectivity toward phosphate over co existing competing anions i e so4 2 no3 and cl acelas et al 2015 chen et al 2015 however the influence of co existing effluent organic matter efom from biologically treated sewage effluent btse should not be overlooked as the efom of high heterogeneity is usually ubiquitous in btse quaranta et al 2012 efom could affect phosphate working capacity and regeneration efficiency of nanocomposites through multiple pathways including pore blockage direct site competition electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions kim 2015 ling et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 kim 2015 reported that the negatively charged organic acids in efom suppressed phosphate uptake by miex through site competition over amino groups on the resin beads whereas the hydrophobic neutral bases dominantly occupied the iron oxide core sites through hydrophobic interactions kim 2015 our previous work demonstrated that the small sized gallic acid 170 da decreased phosphate capacity of the zirconium embedded nanocomposites by competing for the adsorptive sites while the relatively large tannic acid 1701 da inhibited phosphate adsorption kinetics via pore blockage lin et al 2017 these influences usually originate from the different fractions of efom and are also closely correlated with their specific molecular characteristics i e charge property hydrophobicity molecular size and functional groups boyer and singer 2006 hence rational fractionation protocols and characterization techniques to analyze efom at molecular level are required for identifying the effect of efom fractions on phosphate removal by nanocomposite materials current fractionation methods mainly focus on the characteristic differences in hydrophobicity of efom fractions using xad 8 and xad 4 resins to classify efom into hydrophobic transphilic and hydrophilic fractions jarusutthirak and amy 2007 yamamura et al 2014 however the distinctions in charge property between the efom fractions often get neglected because of the poor recovery of neutral base moieties by alkaline extraction leenheer 1981 which was thus unable to provide sufficient information about efom for recognizing its effect on phosphate separation each fraction after the xad 8 xad 4 isolation is actually heterogeneously charged mixtures of acids and neutral bases containing both humic and protein like substances as indicated by the indistinctive differentiation in fluorescence properties and molecular weight mw distribution between the fractions hou et al 2016 zheng et al 2014 one previous study suggested a weak base exchanger diethyl aminoethyl deae cellulose could efficiently react with the carboxylic hydroxyl groups of humic molecules and extract the negatively charged acidic solutes from efom referred to as organic acid kim and dempsey 2012 hence the combination of deae cellulose and xad 8 xad 4 resins can potentially distinguish efom substances based on their differences in charge and hydrophobicity leading to a separation of efom into organic acid oa and hydrophobic transphilic hydrophilic neutral base hpo n b tpi n b and hpi n b fractions additionally integrated characterization with high performance size exclusion chromatography hp sec three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy 3d eem and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir could effectively identify efom fractions with respect to their molecule size chemical compositions and functional groups in this study a combinative method of coupling deae xad mediated fractionation with multiple characterization techniques was proposed for investigating individual efom fractions at molecular level and identifying their impact on phosphate removal by nanocomposite material zirconium based anion exchanger hzo 201 characterized by porous polymer matrix positively charged surface and multiple adsorptive sites was chosen as a model nanocomposite adsorbent because this material presents similar structure function properties to many other nanocomposites i e hix miex and mch the efom samples were fractionated according to their characteristic differences in charge hydrophobicity and characterized by hp sec 3d eem and ftir technologies in terms of molecular weight chemical compositions and functional groups herein the criterion i e molecular weight charge hydrophobicity and functionalities for the efom fractionation characterization are based on the specific structure function characters i e porous structure charged surface and multiple functionalities of the nanocomposite for adsorption we believe the proposed combinative method targeting at the impact assessment of efom on adsorption can also apply to other various nanocomposites and adsorbents of similar structural functional properties 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and water samples non ionic resins xad 8 and xad 4 were purchased from sigma aldrich shanghai china deae cellulose was purchased from whatman shanghai china phosphate stock solution 1 0 g l 1 was prepared by dissolving kh2po4 into milli q water 18 25 mω cm a nanocomposite hzo 201 with hydrous zirconium oxide hzo nanoparticles embedded inside polystyrene anion exchanger d201 was synthesized based on our previous work pan et al 2013 the basic structure and physicochemical properties of hzo 201 are described in fig s1 and table s1 the efom samples denoted as xl cb and jxz were collected from three mwtps jiangsu china which use biological methods of cyclic activated sludge technology cast sequencing batch reactor sbr and anoxic oxic ao processes for sewage treatment respectively the water samples were pre filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes whatman and stored in a fridge at 4 c the physicochemical properties of the three water samples are shown in table s2 2 2 efom fractionating based on charge and hydrophobicity the efom samples were fractionated using deae cellulose and xad 8 xad 4 resins on the basis of a modified method kim and dempsey 2012 the deae and xad resins were activated and cleaned following an approach described by miles et al 1983 and thurman and malcolm 1981 all the packed columns were rinsed with deionized water until the eluent effluents reached neutral ph with dissolved organic carbon doc lower than 0 1 mg l 1 as illustrated in fig s2 500 ml of water sample was filtered with cellulose acetate membranes 0 45 μm and adjusted to ph 7 0 then the water sample was passed through the deae column at 50 ml h 1 the oa fraction was eluted by 200 ml of naoh solution 0 1 m flowing at 30 ml h 1 through the deae cellulose afterward the effluent from the deae column was pumped through the xad 8 and xad 4 columns in series at 50 ml h 1 the hpo n b and tpi n b fractions were separately extracted from the xad 8 and xad 4 resins with acetonitrile solutions 75 acetonitrile 25 milli q water v v at 20 ml h 1 and the excess acetonitrile was removed by vacuum rotary evaporation at 40 c the hpi n b fraction was remained in the effluent the na oa eluate was desalted by passing through a h form cation exchanger column doc and uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 of the influent effluent of each column were measured to determine the proportion of the efom fractions doc was analyzed by a total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu japan uv254 was determined by uv vis spectrometer t6 pgeneral china with a quartz cell 1 cm all the fractionating processes were performed in triplicate 2 3 characterization of efom fractions in aromaticity molecular weight and functionality the aromaticity of the efom fractions was investigated using an indicator namely the specific uv254 absorbance suva which could be defined as the ratio of uv254 to doc as suggested by karanfil et al 2002 a high suva 4 l mg 1 m 1 implies an abundance of aromatic and high mw substances in water while a low suva 4 l mg 1 m 1 indicates a relatively high content of aliphatic and low mw substances the mw distributions of the efom fractions was probed by a hp sec equipped with an online uv detector 2489 waters and a gel permeation column xbridge protein beh sec 125 waters each efom fraction was further separated by the hp sec based on mw and probed at combined wavelengths of 210 nm and 254 nm by the uv detector a mixed solution of phosphate buffer na2hpo4 nah2po4 2 4 mm 1 6 mm and na2so4 25 0 mm was used as the mobile phase flowing at 1 0 ml min 1 sodium polystyrene sulfonates pss fluka of 210 4300 17000 32000 and 77000 da were used as the calibration standards the 3d eem fluorescence spectra of the efom fractions were collected by a fluorescence spectrophotometer f7000 hitachi japan with a 150 w xenon arc lamp as the excitation source the excitation scans were performed within 275 525 nm at 10 nm increments and the emission fluorescence intensity was recorded within 225 425 nm at 5 nm steps with an integration time of 0 1 s the slits of both excitation and emission were set at 5 nm band pass the efom fractions were diluted to 5 mg l 1 with a same dilution ratio to minimize the inner filter effect henderson et al 2009 the eem response of milli q water was subtracted from the fluorescence spectra to reduce the raman scattering effect and extra background noise baker et al 2003 the eem spectra were divided into five regions according to previous studies chen et al 2003 pramanik et al 2014 region i ex em 220 260 nm 280 330 nm and region ii ex em 220 260 nm 330 380 nm represent aromatic proteins i e tyrosine and tryptophan region iii ex em 220 260 nm 380 550 nm region iv ex em 260 400 nm 280 380 nm and region v ex em 260 400 nm 380 550 nm are assigned to fluvic acid like fa like soluble microbial product like smp like and humic acid like ha like substances respectively given the low detection sensitivity of carbohydrate like materials by fluorescence and uv detectors the carbohydrates in the efom fractions were quantitatively measured through a phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 using glucose glu as the standard carbohydrates meanwhile proteins and humic substances were determined by a modified lowry method fr olund et al 1995 using bovine serum albumin bsa and humic acid ha as the standard references respectively the molecular functionalities of the efom fractions were identified by a ft ir spectroscopy thermo scientific nicolet is5 usa equipped with an attenuated total reflectance atr accessory each spectrum was collected by averaging 64 scans at 2 cm 1 resolution within 4000 400 cm 1 the efom fractions for atr ftir analysis were lyophilized and powdered prior to sample loading 2 4 impact assessment of efom fractions on phosphate removal by hzo 201 nanocomposite the efom fractions were separately spiked with sodium sulfate na2so4 solution to reach an identical initial doc concentration and ionic strength to investigate the effect of efom fractions on phosphate removal 0 5 g l 1 hzo 201 beads were added into 250 ml solution containing a preset amount of phosphate 10 0 mg l 1 and each coexisting efom fractions 20 0 mg l 1 followed by stirring at 25 c for 120 h to reach equilibrium the solution ph was maintained at 6 5 0 2 using hcl 0 1 m and naoh 0 1 m aliquot of 1 0 ml was sampled at desired time intervals for phosphate analysis the multicycle adsorption regeneration experiments were conducted with a bench scale approach mergen et al 2008 in brief hzo 201 0 5 g l 1 was vibrated with 100 ml of phosphate 10 0 mg l 1 in the absence or presence of each efom fractions 20 0 mg l 1 for 2 h the adsorption operations were repeated for five times without any regeneration in between to simulate the actual operation of resin in industries the used hzo 201 was regenerated by naoh nacl 5 5 m v solutions for 2 h the regenerated adsorbents were reused for subsequent adsorption regeneration cycles after rinse with deionized water and the spent brine was replaced with fresh regenerant between cycles the removal and desorption rates of phosphate were determined based on mass balance and correlated with cycle numbers the phosphate concentration was measured with a molybdenum blue method tobey et al 2003 the desorbed efom fractions in the eluted solutions were subjected to molecular characterization 3 results and discussion 3 1 fractionation characterization of efom the deae xad mediated fractionation coordinating with subsequent characterization distinguished the charge and hydrophobicity of efom by separating into oa hpo n b tpi n b and hpi fractions and further identified their distinctive characteristics in aromaticity molecular weight and functionalities 3 1 1 doc and aromaticity of efom fractions as presented in fig 1 a the hpi n b was the dominant fraction of efom from three btse sources accounting for 47 71 in doc content followed by the oa of 14 29 whereas the proportions of the hpo n b 7 14 and tpi n b 8 17 were the least the composition was similar to those of domestic wastewaters as reported by imai et al 2002 and shon et al 2006 the oa fractions made a significant contribution to uv254 absorbance 54 75 implying that the oa mainly consisted of uv adsorptive compounds fig 1b shows the suva values of each efom fractions the oa fractions abundant in negatively charged acidic materials exhibited the highest suva the result dramatically differed from the fractionating outcomes of efom by conventional xad based methods which often assigned the highest suva to hydrophobic fractions leenheer 1981 yang et al 2013 the highest suva of the oa fractions suggested that the aromatic moieties of efom chiefly came from the negatively charged organic acids rather than from the hydrophobic fractions karanfil et al 2002 the suva values of the neutral base fractions were all lower than 4 l mg 1 m 1 and followed a sequence of hpo n b tpi n b hpi n b indicating the aliphatic nature of these fractions świetlik et al 2004 3 1 2 molecular weight distribution of efom fractions the rich crosslinked pores of resin based nanocomposite could block large organic molecules but allow small ones travel through via pore surface diffusion zhang et al 2014 therefore mw of efom is regarded as a crucial factor affecting the adsorption behavior of nanocomposite fig 2 shows that the efom fractions in the same category from three different btse sources presented similar mw distributions while the mw distributions of the different fractions varied from one fraction to another as observed in fig 2a the oa appeared a multimodal distribution at 1 5 kda and a sharp peak at 14 kda whereas the other fractions were only distributed in a narrow low mw range 1 3 kda the results manifested that the molecules in the oa fractions were of a wider mw range and more abundant in high mw 14 kda substances than those in the other fractions as suggested by previous finding pramanik et al 2014 the multiple peaks of the oa could be separately recognized as biopolymers humic substances building blocks breakdown products of humic substances low mw acids and neutrals with their mw decreasing in sequence uv210 absorbance is characteristic of amino groups myat et al 2012 as seen in fig 2b the hpi n b fractions showed single peaks at 1 6 kda when measured by a uv210 detector implying that the hpi n b fractions were primarily composed of low mw neutrals presumably containing amino groups 3 1 3 chemical composition and molecular functionality of efom fractions polymeric nanocomposite featuring with multiple surface functionalities i e positively charged amino groups and aromatic phenyl groups tends to adsorb organic molecules via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions yang et al 2015 hence the compositions and functionalities of efom could also influence adsorption performance fig s3 shows three pronounced fluorescence peaks in the eem profiles of the raw efom samples associated with smp fa and ha like substances respectively interestingly the fluorescence peaks of the oa hpo n b tpi n b and hpi n b fractions were separately assigned to the different regions which correspondingly represented fa ha like protein ii like protein i like and smp like materials as observed in fig 3 a and table s3 this result demonstrated that the oa hpo n b tpi n b and hpi n b fractions were mainly comprised of aromatic acid protein ii protein i and smp like substances respectively similar finding was also reported elsewhere that the neutral base uncharged positively charged moieties presented fluorescent characteristics similar to proteins humbert et al 2005 additionally carbohydrate protein and humic acid like materials in the efom fractions were also quantitatively analyzed as depicted in fig 3b carbohydrates were chiefly present in the hpi n b fractions 15 73 19 11 mg glu l 1 in agreement with the low suva 1 00 l mg 1 m 1 of the hpi n b as previously discussed fig 1b protein and humic acid like substances predominantly existed in the tpi n b 5 11 6 06 mg bsa l 1 and oa 1 07 1 29 mg ha l 1 fractions respectively which was consistent with the fluorescence eem fingerprints of the oa and tpi n b fig 3a information about molecular functionalities of the efom fractions was shown by ft ir spectra in fig s4 the strong peaks of c o stretching 1704 cm 1 kanokkantapong et al 2006 pernet coudrier et al 2008 xue et al 2009 c o stretching 1180 1030 cm 1 gur reznik et al 2008 and o h vibration 3390 cm 1 kang et al 2002 were indicative of an abundance of carboxylic groups in the oa fractions the noticeable aromatic c c vibration peaks at 1650 1630 cm 1 kang et al 2002 smidt and meissl 2007 represented the aromatic functionalities of the oa fractions these results demonstrated that aromatic carboxylic acids might be the major components of the oa fractions the evident aliphatic hydrocarbon peaks at 2960 2850 cm 1 and 1460 1420 cm 1 leenheer 1981 zheng et al 2014 xue et al 2009 presented in the hpo n b and tpi n b fractions signified the aliphatic nature of this two fractions which accounted for their low suva as shown in fig 1b the c o stretching peaks of carboxylic groups 1704 cm 1 kang et al 2002 observed in the hpo n b further indicated the aliphatic carboxylic acids in the hpo n b fractions the pronounced amide ii peaks of n h band 1558 cm 1 dignac et al 2000 khan et al 2013 and c n band 1259 cm 1 huo et al 2008 of the hpo n b and tpi n b fractions denoted the abundance of protein like substances which contributed to the proteinaceous fluorescent properties of the hpo n b and tpi n b fig 3a additionally the c o stretching peaks at 1100 cm 1 of the hpi n b implied the presence of carbohydrates in the hpi n b fractions xue et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 above all the combinative fractionation characterization method identified the distinctive characteristics of individual efom fractions in aromaticity mw distribution and molecular functionalities which provided desirable accuracy and reliability of using the combinative method for the impact diagnosis of efom fractions on nanocomposite adsorbents 3 2 verification of proposed mechanistic hypothesis between efom fractions and polymeric nanocomposite 3 2 1 proposed influencing mechanism of efom fractions on polymeric nanocomposite as illustrated in fig s1 the hzo 201 nanocomposite is featured with multiple binding sites or pathways for adsorption including the positively charged amino groups phenyl groups crosslinked nanopores of host polymer and the hydroxyl groups of immobilized hzo nanoparticles with the aid of the combinative fractionation characterization method molecular information about the efom fractions regarding their charge aromaticity molecular weight and functionality corresponds to the multiple structural functional properties of hzo 201 for adsorption which favors the prediction of underlying influencing mechanisms of efom fractions on polymeric nanocomposite the oa fractions abundant in negatively charged carboxylic acids and aromatic moieties are presumably of high binding affinity to the amino and phenyl groups of hzo 201 through an ion exchange and π π interactions or van der waals force respectively tan and kilduff 2007 shuang et al 2012 on the contrary the hpo n b tpi n b and hpi n b fractions primarily consist of uncharged positively charged substances i e carbohydrates and proteins and aliphatic moieties making ion exchange and π π interactions unavailable for their effective adsorption the pore filling likely plays a role in their uptake by hzo 201 due to the low mw 1 3 kda of the three fractions and the plenty of nanopores total pore volume 0 20 cm3 g 1 table s1 in hzo 201 zhang et al 2017 liu et al 2020 likewise the pore filling mechanism could also be expected for capturing some oa molecules of low mw therefore it was deduced that the oa fractions are of higher adsorption potential on hzo 201 than the other fractions because of their multiple adsorption pathways these proposed mechanistic hypotheses were verified through diagnosing the impact of fractionated efom on phosphate removal by hzo 201 nanocomposite 3 2 2 verification on impact of efom fractions on phosphate removal by hzo 201 nanocomposite given that the three raw waters were similar in chemical compositions and molecular functionalities the moderate hydrophobic water of cb was used for our experiments as depicted in fig 4 a the adsorption equilibrium of phosphate reached in 1000 min in the absence of the efom fractions the presence of the hpo n b tpi n b or hpi n b fractions prolonged the contact time 3000 min that was needed for reaching the adsorption equilibrium but posed negligible influence on the adsorptive capacities of phosphate at the equilibrium this result suggested that the hpo n b tpi n b and hpi n b could suppress the phosphate adsorption rates possibly through pore narrowing clogging mergen et al 2008 but would not compete for the adsorptive sites to a notable extent as elucidated in section 3 1 the hpo n b tpi n b or hpi n b fractions were chiefly comprised of uncharged positively charged carbohydrates or proteins and aliphatic moieties thereby exerting no significant site competition or surface interaction towards the amino and phenyl groups of hzo 201 due to weak electrostatic and π π interactions mergen et al 2008 humbert et al 2005 presumably the wide pore size distribution of hzo 201 v micro 0 02 cm3 g 1 v meso macro 0 20 cm3 g 1 table s1 and the low mw 1 3 kda of the three fractions could facilitate their capturing via pore filling zhang et al 2017 liu et al 2020 which tended to narrow block the pores and limit the mass transfer of phosphate by contrast the oa fraction decreased both the equilibrium absorption capacity by 15 and the adsorption rate of phosphate as compared to the single phosphate system this was likely attributable to the abundant negatively charged carboxylic acids and aromatic moieties in the oa fraction which could not only occupy the amino groups of hzo 201 through an ion exchange but interact with the host polymer via π π interactions yang et al 2015 additionally as a result of the broad mw range 1 5 kda and 14 kda the oa molecules were presumably able to diffuse into and narrow block the pores of hzo 201 thereby reducing the adsorption rate and capacity of phosphate these multiple adsorption pathways enhanced the oa sequestration by hzo 201 which accounted for their greater effect on phosphate removal than that of the other fractions as indicated by our previous work lin et al 2017 it can be expected that the surface hydroxyl groups of the embedded hzo nanoparticles of hzo 201 were not significantly affected by the efom fractions and retained their high selectivity and capacity towards phosphate regeneration efficiency plays a crucial role in determining the cost effectiveness of one adsorbent in application kumar et al 2019 fig 4b shows the phosphate removal rates during repeated adsorption regeneration runs in the absence and presence of the individual efom fractions the phosphate removal rates remained stable 39 00 37 53 over 17 cycles in the sole phosphate system indicating a superior reusability of hzo 201 for phosphate sequestration the oa fraction decreased the phosphate removal at the first cycle by 15 64 while the other fractions decreased it merely by 0 5 38 which was in good accordance with the inhibiting effect of each efom fractions on the equilibrium capacity of phosphate as discussed in fig 4a with the increasing of cycle number the phosphate removal rates underwent downward trends of different degrees by 32 70 17 51 12 15 and 5 94 during 17 cycles in the background of the oa hpo n b tpi n b or hpi n b fraction respectively as suggested by ling et al 2014 the varying degrees of the decline of phosphate removal rates represented different fouling levels of hzo 201 resulted from a progressive accumulation of efom fractions on the nanocomposite during its repeated usage as a result the inhibiting effect caused by the accumulation of the efom fractions on the long term performance of phosphate removal following the sequence of oa hpo n b tpi n b hpi n b the oa fraction with some aromatic carboxylic acid molecules unionized when adsorbed through non ionic interactions i e π π interactions could not be effectively regenerated by naoh nacl 5 5 m v solutions which basically functioned via an ion or ligand exchange yang et al 2013 this was likely one of the main causes contributing to the continuous accumulation of the oa molecules onto the hzo 201 nanocomposite thereby exerting the greatest inhibition on phosphate removal in multiple cycles conversely the long term influence from the hpo n b tpi n b and hpi n b fractions were significantly lower probably attributing to the low binding affinities of these fractions toward hzo 201 arising from their uncharged positively charged and aliphatic nature in addition as observed in fig s5 the overall desorption efficiencies of phosphate all remained at 90 were independent of the presence of efom fractions which signified a minimal effect of efom loading on phosphate regeneration 3 2 3 evolution of efom fractions during repeated adsorption regeneration runs the evolutions of efom fractions were monitored throughout the repeated adsorption regeneration runs of the hzo 201 nanocomposite to explore the interfering mechanisms of each fractions on phosphate removal as depicted in fig 5 a the peak intensities of the four efom fractions all became much lower than their initial levels after 5 10 and 15 cycles of adsorption demonstrating that all the fractions were simultaneously captured by hzo 201 during the multicycle adsorption regeneration of phosphate this result accounted for the underlying site competition and pore clogging caused by the efom fractions as discussed in section 3 2 2 the initial oa fraction in the repeated adsorption regeneration experiments displayed multiple peaks within a low mw range 1 4 kda but presented no apparent high mw biopolymer peak 14 kda which was likely missing from the oa desalting processes consequently the adverse impact of oa fractions on phosphate removal as has been identified in section 3 2 2 should be underestimated because of the loss of some high mw moieties in the oa fraction as suggested by the variations of peak intensities fig 5a the remaining amount of the oa in the water phase went higher with increasing the adsorption regeneration cycles from 5 to 15 signifying that fewer oa could be adsorbed by hzo 201 after undergoing more cycles of adsorption regeneration this result represented a progressive accumulation of the oa molecules on hzo 201 during the continuous adsorption regeneration runs ling et al 2014 which corresponded to the rapid decline of phosphate removal in the background of the oa fraction fig 4b by contrast the amount of the remaining hpo n b fraction in the solution first turned higher from 5 to 10 cycles and then reached a plateau level after 10 cycles indicating that there would be no further irreversible adsorption of the hpo n b molecules onto hzo 201 after 10 adsorption regeneration cycles as for the tpi n b and hpi n b fractions their remaining amount in the solution maintained a constant level from 5 to 15 cycles implying a much higher regeneration rate of the tpi n b and hpi n b fractions than that of the oa and hpo n b fractions these findings demonstrated that the irreversible adsorption potential of each efom fraction followed an order of oa hpo n b tpi n b or hpi n b which agreed well with their corresponding influencing tendencies on phosphate removal in the long term adsorption regeneration runs as described in fig 4b the desorbed efom fractions from all the cycles were collected and analyzed with hp sec and 3d eem methods fig 5b as has been verified in fig 5a some oa moieties of relatively low mw 1 4 kda were markedly sequestrated by hzo 201 during the repeated adsorption regeneration of phosphate but the adsorption of high mw oa moieties 14 kda was less pronounced surprisingly the substances desorbed from the oa loaded hzo 201 presented an evident biopolymer peak at 14 kda while peaks within the low mw range 1 4 kda were insignificant as illustrated in fig 5b these results suggested that the high mw oa moieties captured by hzo 201 could be favorably desorbed along with the regeneration of the nanocomposite whereas the low mw oa moieties appeared to be irreversibly adsorbed into the inner pores of hzo 201 lin et al 2017 hence the low mw compounds in the oa fraction were specifically recognized as the key interfering element which inclined to affect the reusability of hzo 201 nanocomposite and its long term performance in phosphate removal additionally the desorbed substances from the oa loaded hzo 201 were further identified to be fulvic acid like or humic acid like materials as indicated by the eem fluorescence fingerprints given the low mw character of the irreversibly adsorbed oa moieties and the specific desorbing pathway by using naoh nacl i e ion ligand exchange it could be expected that the irreversibly adsorbed low mw oa moieties were likely captured by the porous polymer matrix of hzo 201 via a pore filling or π π interactions the desorbed hpo n b tpi n b and hpi n b fractions presented similar mw and eem fluorescence properties to those of the desorbed oa but varied somewhat in quantities on the basis of the above analyses the oa fraction was identified as the key element in efom affecting the adsorption of hzo 201 nanocomposite toward phosphate the plausible influencing mechanisms are schematically summarized in fig 6 4 conclusions this work employed a combinative method of deae xad mediated fractionation and molecular characterization techniques for identifying effluent organic matter efom in real biologically treated sewage effluent and its impact on phosphate removal by nanocomposite material hzo 201 the efom was separated into fractions of organic acid oa hydrophobic transphilic and hydrophilic neutral base hpo n b tpi n b and hpi n b using the combinative method the distinctive characteristics of each efom fractions regarding their charge aromaticity molecular weight and functionalities corresponded to the multiple structure function properties of hzo 201 we made hypothesis on the possible influential mechanism of efom fractions on hzo 201 the hypothesis was later verified by the subsequent adsorption experiments using fractionated efom on hzo 201 the adverse effects i e phosphate capacity loss and adsorbent fouling of efom fractions on phosphate removal were closely correlated with their charge aromaticity and molecular weight following an order of oa hpo n b tpi n b hpi n b the oa fraction featuring with negatively charged aromatic moieties and broad molecular weight distribution 1 5 kda and 14 kda was recognized as the key interfering fraction presumably attributing to its multiple adsorption pathways on hzo 201 i e ion exchange π π interactions and pore filling the relatively low molecular weight oa moieties 1 4 kda inclined to progressively accumulate onto hzo 201 through irreversible adsorption during repeated adsorption regeneration runs leading to a continuous phosphate capacity loss by 32 70 overtime the combinative method used in the study favors the investigation of efom influence on phosphate removal by nanocomposite which may widely apply to the study on the impact of organic matters on adsorption functional materials in complex water systems the irreversible capacity loss caused by oa could also inspire the development of rational oa targeted pretreatment technologies for
