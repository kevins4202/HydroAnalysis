9490,plastic film mulches have the potential to be used in papaya production mainly aiming to reduce water application in semi arid regions however there is a lack of technical information and the need to introduce mulching practices in papaya orchards the objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of plastic film mulch and irrigation depths on soil water availability swa stomatal conductance leaf temperature and agronomic traits of papaya trees the study was carried out during 2018 and 2019 in jaíba city located northern minas gerais state in the brazilian semi arid region the experiment was a split plot design with soil cover conditions assigned to the plots bare soil and mulched soil and water replenishment levels to subplots 25 50 75 100 and 125 of crop evapotranspiration etc plants were drip irrigated with water replenishments based on climate data soil moisture was measured along time and agronomic and physiological characteristics of papaya trees as well water tensions were higher in treatments with lower water replenishments results showed that the increase in irrigation depth favors leaf area growth rate stomatal conductance yield and water footprint of papaya the use of mulch together with the increase in water replenishment levels contributes for maintenance of the soil water content between the upper limit of swa and 75 swa the use black plastic mulching with drip irrigation in medium textured soil saves up to 152 l of water per kg of fruit and increase productivity up to 34 by replenishing the crop evapotranspiration every irrigation event the use of black plastic as ground cover is technically feasible for keeping soil water availability above 75 by irrigation supply of at least 75 of etc on sand clay loam soil keywords carica papaya l evapotranspiration irrigation depths soil cover 1 introduction irrigated agriculture is the largest and most dynamic consumer of fresh water in the world ana 2017 2020 the reduction of water footprint or the amount of water in liters necessary to produce one kilogram of grain fruit and fiber hoekstra 2017 has been showing as the best goal for mitigating the consequences of drought in irrigated agriculture irrigation management strategies to minimize soil water losses should be known and introduced in irrigated areas moreover these strategies should promote the reduction of water consumption of crops without negatively affecting the quantity and quality of harvested products this is particularly important for fruit trees as they demand large amounts of water coelho et al 2011 evaporation is the most pronounced loss of soil water in irrigated agriculture accounting for 25 50 of a crop s evapotranspiration liu et al 2002 soil water evaporation depends on the air vapor pressure deficit physical attributes of the soil and the unshaded area by canopies several technologies promote the reduction of soil water loss through evaporation among these polyethylene film plastic mulching has been identified as a promising alternative due to the significant improvement in water and fertilizer use efficiency steinmetz et al 2016 he et al 2018 chen al et al 2020 oliveira et al 2020 furthermore mulching practices lead to an increase in leaf area fan et al 2017 qin et al 2016 and productivity of agricultural crops el samnoudi et al 2019 hou et al 2019 in addition to favoring the maintenance of soil moisture black polyethylene film mulching prevent the growth of most of weeds thus reducing the competition between the crop and weeds for water and nutrients abouziena et al 2008 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 rodrigues et al 2021 the studies about the type and color of the polyethylene film show that the clear and black plastic are the ones with greatest potential for warming the soil kasirajan e ngouajio 2012 and should provide more the benefits due to the warming they show also that black plastic mulch is more effective in controlling weed than the ones with other colors johnston and fenimore 2005 plastic mulching have generally been using for vegetables in the case of fruit trees the practice has been more common in strawberry and pineapple however as mulching has as one of its main functions the reduction in soil water evaporation using this technique may be more beneficial to fruit trees with greater spacing between rows and plants due to the greater evaporation area compared to more densely spaced vegetable crops among fruit trees papaya is a major crop in tropical and subtropical regions campostrini et al 2010 as a herbaceous semi woody plant with high hydraulic conductivity the papaya tree responds significantly well to soil moisture reaching different rates of stomatal conductance and water use efficiency santos et al 2021b studies with papaya under drip irrigation in mulched soil have been doing with more concern to the effect of different types of mulch on the growth and yield of the crop pandey et al 2005 sakariya et al 2018 on weed control patil et al 2013 the effect of the use of plastic mulch with fertigation in papaya has also been studying prajapati et al 2017 many studies have been carrying concerning irrigation on mulched soil with other crops in several places amayreh et al 2005 yaghi and arslan 2013 with different soil and climate conditions however there is no technical information about the use of plastic mulch in irrigated papaya under semiarid conditions specifically quantifying the changes of water needs due to the plastic mulch the use of this technique is not common for fruits like papaya in brazil but the climate uncertainties is influencing farmers to search for alternatives to reduce crop water use therefore it is necessary to give answers for irrigation management of papaya cultivated under semiarid conditions of brazil with the use of plastic mulching the use of mulches requires technical scientific knowledge due to possible changes in soil water plant relationship of papaya this is because mulching interacts with irrigation water levels plant growth stomatal aperture yields water use efficiency and water footprint given the uncertainties arising from climate change ipcc 2014 the lack of technical information santos et al 2021b and the need to introduce mulching practices in papaya orchards field research is necessary thus the objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of irrigation depths and black polyethylene film mulching on swa growth stomatal conductance leaf temperature yields water footprint and crop water productivity of papaya trees in sandy clay loam soil 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental area the experiment was carried out from 2018 to 2019 in the experimental field of the agricultural research company of minas gerais epamig in the municipality of jaíba state of minas gerais mg located in the semi arid region of northern minas gerais brazil 15 08 s 43 57 w and 551 m above sea level the climate of the experimental site is classified as mid latitude steppe and desert climate bsh according to the köppen geiger classification arruda et al 2013 the average annual precipitation is 850 mm the average maximum and minimum annual temperature is 31 3 c and 21 0 c respectively the soil of the experimental area is classified as sandy clay loam embrapa 2013 whose physical and water retention characteristics are shown in table 1 before planting soil samples were collected at 0 25 m from the plant row and at depths of 0 15 m and 0 30 m for soil fertility analysis table 2 fig 1 papaya seedlings carica papaya l tainung1 from formosa group were produced in a nursery at embrapa cassava and fruit and later transported to the experimental area the seedlings were planted at a spacing of 3 0 m x 1 7 m fig 2 arranged in single rows with every seven plants in the row corresponding to an experimental unit according to the chemical analysis of the soil soil acidity was corrected by applying gypsum 500 kg ha 1 and dolomitic limestone 1500 kg ha 1 through fertigation 170 kg ha 1 of phosphorus was applied at planting in addition 290 kg ha 1 of nitrogen and 120 kg ha 1 of potassium were fertigated throughout the crop cycle on a weekly basis as recommended by sanches et al 1999 weeds between rows and within the rows on the bare soil condition were manually removed during the period of the experiment pests and diseases were controlled chemically by spraying plants with insecticides from the chemical group avermectina and kumulus and fungicides from the chemical group score as recommended by the manufacturers 2 2 experimental design and cropping practices the treatments involved covering the ground with black polyethylene film mulching plastic mulching with a minimum durability of 18 months plastic mulching was installed only on the zone where at least 80 of the roots are concentrated in lateral distance that is the effective lateral distance of the plant root system which is 0 60 m coelho and simões 2015 each subplot was composed of two rows containing seven plants each with five usable plants and the other two considered as borders the experimental design was randomized blocks in a 2 5 split plot arrangement mulched soil and bare soil were assigned to plots and water replenishment levels 25 50 75 100 and 125 of crop evapotranspiration etc to subplot with four replications 2 3 irrigation plants were drip irrigated for each plant row two lateral lines connected to main lines were installed fig 2 four self compensating drippers were used per plant two for each side of the plant with a flow of 4 l h 1 the lateral line was positioned at a distance of 0 25 m from the planting row the treatments were defined using control valves at the beginning of the main line irrigations were performed daily around 9 am with the motor pump set being activated by a control head daily irrigation depth was estimated based on etc table 3 which was obtained from the reference evapotranspiration eto table 3 calculated by modified penman monteith allen et al 1998 corrected by crop coefficients recommended by posse et al 2008 and the location factor according to keller and bliesner 1990 eto was calculated based on data provided by the automatic weather station of the national institute of meteorology inmet code omm 86720 located in the municipality of jaíba mg the weather station is located 1 5 km away from the experimental area table 4 shows the total gross irrigation depths applied at different water replenishment fractions based on evapotranspiration of papaya trees during the growing period 2 4 measuring soil moisture soil moisture was monitored throughout the experimental period using time domain reflectometry tdr probes and electrical resistance blocks these sensors were installed between the plant and the dripper 0 15 m from the latter at a depth of 0 25 m considering the effective rooting depth between 0 40 m and 0 50 m coelho and simões 2015 in the production phase an automatic data collection system was installed using tdr equipment and eight reading multiplexers sensors were installed at four soil profiles delimited by a distance of 1 0 m from the plant and a depth of 0 60 m with 16 probes distributed per profile fig 3 totaling 64 probes in the experimental area the probes were distributed to form a 0 25 m x 0 15 m grid fig 3 the profiles for moisture evaluation corresponded to the water replenishment treatments of 75 and 100 of etc with and without plastic mulching these two irrigation levels were selected due to the limitations of equipment and our hypothesis that these levels would be the better ones for crop yields without losses tdr probes were built with three 0 10 m long stainless steel rods coelho et al 2005 and with an axial 3 5 m long cable the calibration of the probes was performed using undisturbed soil samples collected from the experimental area resulting in the following eq 1 1 θ 6 10 5 ka 3 0 0028 ka 2 0 0463 ka 0 1313 where θ is the soil moisture on a volumetric basis cm3cm 3 and ka is the apparent dielectric constant of the soil at each position of the probe grid in the profile soil moisture data were collected as a function of time starting before an irrigation event these data were converted into water storage in the profile through numerical integration by the trapezium method eq 2 using moisture readings at the four depths at each distance from the plant 2 s ti r 0 z θ z dz where sti r represents the water storage in mm over time ti and the distance r from the plant mm θ z is the soil moisture cm3 cm 3 at depth z corresponding to the distance r from the plant z is the desired profile depth cm the averages of sti values at the distances resulted in the storage stg of the profile 0 z at each of the four treatments two consecutive irrigation cycles were evaluated during the papaya production period the average storage over the period right after the irrigation until the beginning of the next irrigation was computed for the depths of 0 30 m and 0 45 m of the soil profile as they are representative of the effective rooting depth coelho et al 2005 santos et al 2021a using soil moisture values in each treatment the swa was calculated according to eq 3 santos et al 2021a 3 swa θact

biometric measurements leaf area was determined from the length of the central lobes of all leaves of the plant according to the methodology proposed by alves and santos 2002 at during the period from 90 to 120 days after planting when papaya was in the growth and initial flowering phase we determined the leaf area growth rate only with the data collected in this phase based upon the growth rate of the cultivar tainung n 1 under semiarid conditions as showed by coelho et al 2011 in addition on fully expanded leaves 7th and 8th leaves counted from the apex and grown in full sun measurements of stomatal conductance gs and leaf temperature tl were performed using a porometer sc 1 decagon devises and an infrared thermometer lefeng industrial thermometer the readings were taken between 12 00 pm and 1 00 pm an interval considered to have the highest daily temperature at the experimental site at the production phase the fruits were harvested weekly by slightly twisting the fruits when they still had less than 15 of the peal surface yellow that is at stage i of maturation morais et al 2007 at harvest time the fruits were weighed and identified in their respective treatments the values obtained from the weighing were transformed into productivity and at the end of the production cycle crop water productivity eq 4 fernández et al 2020 and water footprint eq 5 were estimated for papaya tree according to santos et al 2021b 4 wpc y etc where wpc crop water productivity kg fruit m 3 y yield kg fruit ha 1 etc crop evapotranspiration m3 ha 1 5 wf va y where wf water footprint l

a confidence level of 5 and considering five water replenishment levels and soil cover condition bare soil and mulched soil soil water storage values acquired through the automatic data collection system with tdr were interpreted by t test with a confidence level of 5 probability 3 results 3 1 rainfall and air temperature during the experimental period the total accumulated rainfall was 770 mm fig 4 the highest monthly precipitation values were recorded in november and december 2018 with a total of 174 and 152 mm respectively conversely the highest monthly values of maximum air temperatures were recorded in the months of october 2018 and november 2019 while the lowest values were recorded in june and july 2019 fig 4 3 2 soil moisture soil water status represented by the water potential measured by electrical resistance sensors at all treatments was evaluated from april to october months in which irrigation was continuous the values of soil water tension before irrigation events were higher for the treatment with 25 water replenishment of crop evapotranspiration etc in both soil cover conditions with and without mulch with greater scattering of data under mulching practice at this water replenishment level on bare soil soil tensions varied less 86 115 kpa over time than mulched soil 46 90 kpa for irrigation regimes under the cultivation conditions without mulch with a replenishment of 50 etc or greater the moisture tensions were close to or above 20 kpa fig 5b in the cultivation conditions with mulch and water replenishment above 50 of the available water the soil water tensions before the irrigations were lower than 20 kpa fig 5a the influence of treatments on irrigation water management considering the available soil water before the irrigation event is shown in table 5 it appears that in at least one of the two evaluated periods september 2018 and march 2019 there was a difference between the percentages of available soil water under the cultivation conditions with and without mulch for the 25 etc 50 etc and 75 etc irrigation depth table 5 the percentage values of available soil water before irrigation in the cultivation condition with the use of mulch were higher than the ones under cultivation with bare soil for all water regimes these differences were larger for irrigation depths less than 100 etc mainly during the fruit growth and production phases march 2019 when they varied from 15 9 to 37 4 the means of swa below 83 3 without mulch and 91 8 with much before irrigation with more than 100 and 125 etc should be due porosity of the medium textured soil table 1 fig 5 shows the evaluation of water management in papaya at two levels of water replenishment since the last irrigation 75 etc and 100 etc with the soil covered and uncovered in this figure soil moisture was transformed into available water as a function of time elapsed between two consecutive irrigation cycles representative of the drying soil the averages of the percentage of available water before the irrigations in the treatments 75 etc and 100 etc without and with mulch was evaluated in two irrigation cycles with mean hourly measured moisture data fig 5 the replenishment of 75 etc was not enough for the soil in the root zone to reach the moisture level at field capacity 100 of the available water in the soil after an irrigation in the bare soil condition in this condition of soil water replenishment and un mulched cultivation the available soil water reduced to 20 until the start of the next irrigation while the reduction reached 40 of the available soil water under 100 etc replenishment in the mulched condition the water replenishment of 75 etc corresponded to an increase in available soil water below 100 after irrigation fig 5a while the replenishment of 100 etc raised the available water content to 100 going over the field capacity fig 5b the averages of swa before the irrigations in the treatments 75 etc and 100 etc with mulch ranged from 70 to 85 figs 5c 5d with moisture reductions smaller than 30 the applied irrigation depths resulted in a positive linear effect on the water available in the soil for treatments without mulch fig 6a furthermore the average increase rate in swa for this condition bare soil was 0 0158 per mm of water applied in mulched soil the irrigation depths had a quadratic effect on the available soil water fig 6b the average percent of variation the swa for water depths above 1771 mm was negative means of water storage up to soil depths between 0 30 m and 0 45 m layer with the highest concentration of roots coelho et al 2005 santos et al 2021a between two irrigation events of the irrigation levels 75 and 100 with and without mulching were compared they revealed a significant difference p 0 05 when comparing the following 75 etc without mulch versus 100 etc with mulch 75 etc without mulch versus 100 etc without mulch and 75 etc without mulch versus 75 etc with mulch mulched treatments means were 4 6 5 8 and 4 6 higher respectively table 6 in the 0 0 0 45 m layer as for the 0 0 0 30 m depth based on table 6 no significant difference was observed only between 75 etc without mulch versus 100 etc with mulch 3 3 plant biometric variables there was an effect of irrigation depth x mulching interaction on biometric variables of papaya trees the irrigation depths had a positive linear effect on growth rate of leaf area of mulched papaya as for the cultivation condition without mulch there was no significant effect p 0 05 on the relationship between the applied irrigation depth and leaf area growth rate lagr fig 7 in studying the effect of mulching within irrigation depths the depths of 590 mm 25 etc and 2362 mm 100 etc resulted in a significant difference in lagr of 0 04 m2 d 1 and a non significant difference of 0 04 m2 d 1 between the condition with and without mulch respectively table 7 on the other hand the growth rate in plant height showed an effect of mulch within the irrigation depth only for 2952 mm 125 etc with a superiority of 0 67 m2 d 1 for mulched papaya tree table 7 3 4 stomatal conductance and leaf temperature the linear regression models relating irrigation depths to stomatal conductance of papaya leaves were significant p 0 05 both for treatments subjected to mulching and without it fig 8a the average values of stomatal conductance of mulched plants ranged from 790 to 1050 mmol m 2 s 1 with a rate of change of 0 1032 mmol m2 s 1 per mm of water as for treatments without mulch the mean values of stomatal conductance ranged from 156 to 813 mmol m 2 s 1 with an increasing rate of change of 0 3095 mmol m2 s 1 per mm water leaf temperature as a function of irrigation depths fitted to quadratic models for treatments with or without mulching fig 8b regardless of the use of mulch the highest leaf temperatures were recorded in irrigation depths of 25 etc according to regression equations the irrigation depths that minimized the papaya leaf temperature were 1900 and 2338 mm for treatments with and without mulch respectively resulting in values of 36 1 and 32 6 ºc 3 5 yield and water use efficiency there was an effect p 0 05 of irrigation depth on fruit productivity of mulched papaya trees for plants without black polyethylene film mulch there was no effect of irrigation depths p 0 05 the average yield values as a function of irrigation depth ranged from 50 to 110 t ha 1 for plants cultivated with mulching while in bare soil cultivation the average papaya yields ranged from 52 to 75 t ha 1 fig 9 the behavior of estimated yield as a function of irrigation depths followed linear models with a yield increase rate of 21 645 kg ha 1 per mm of applied water on mulched soil against a lower rate of increase 0 0068 kg ha 1 per mm of applied water on bare soil condition fig 9 the linear regression models of yield and water footprint of papaya fruits as a function of stomatal conductance gs were significant p 0 05 for cultivation condition with and without mulch fig 10 the models had positive rates of yield and water footprint of papaya per unit of increase in stomatal conductance and the difference between the rates of increase in yield under mulched and bare soil conditions was greater than differences in water footprint fig 10 regression models of water footprint as a function of irrigation depths were significant p 0 05 for both treatments with and without mulch fig 11 the average values of water footprint as a function of irrigation depths in mulched plants ranged from 110 to 277 l for each kilogram of fruit produced while for plants cultivated without mulch water footprint ranged from 109 to 429 l for each kilogram of fruit produced fig 11 the models were a second degree polynomial for the mulched condition and linear for the bare soil condition the quadratic models of crop water productivity as a function of irrigation depths were significant p 0 05 for cultivation condition with and without mulch fig 12 the reduction rates of water productivity were higher in plants cultivated without mulch mainly in depths equal to or less than 1771 mm 75 etc fig 12 in both mulched soil conditions and bare soil condition applying 500 mm maximized crop water productivity on the other hand depths of 2362 mm and 2952 mm reduced crop water productivity with r2 values of 0 96 and 0 98 respectively fig 13 4 discussion 4 1 water availability in the soil papaya carica papaya l is a major fruit crop in tropical and subtropical regions campostrini et al 2010 with commercial orchards located mainly between latitudes 23 n and 23 s under these soil and climate conditions growth flowering and maturation stages of papaya fruits occur simultaneously from the third or fourth month after planting thus because of the intense vegetative and productive development adequate supply of water through irrigation play a key role especially when associated with technologies promoting the maintenance of soil moisture such as mulching in the present study based on fig 5 both with or without mulch the treatment with water replenishment of 25 etc had the highest water tension values in the soil this shows that the application of the lowest irrigation depth under these conditions were not sufficient to maintain the soil with a satisfactory water condition for papaya trees the tensions under this water replenishment without mulch were above 80 kpa minimum observed whereas with mulch the tension was close to the highest observed value conversely as the irrigation depths increased the soil water tension decreased regardless of the use or not of mulch thus indicating an increase in soil moisture in mulched conditions under water replenishment above 50 of the crop water demand fig 5b the plants were favored throughout the irrigation cycles by moistures corresponding to tensions close to or below 20 kpa considered adequate for growth and production of papaya aiyelaagbe et al 1986 in irrigation regimes with water replenishments of 100 and 125 etc mulching practice had no significant effect on the percentages of swa before irrigation events table 5 this indicates that the replenishment of 100 etc is sufficient to maintain the percentage of available soil water to at least 78 7 in the bare soil condition and to at least 84 5 in the mulched soil condition the levels of swa between 100 after irrigations and above 75 before irrigations are within the allowed water depletion for crop irrigation scheduling bernardo et al 2019 for yield maximization the replenishments of 75 and 100 etc were sufficient for the soil in the rooting zone to reach moisture content above the field capacity 100 of the available water in the soil after an irrigation event in mulched papaya trees in this soil condition the available water content reduced to values close to 73 at the beginning of the next irrigation figs 5c and 5d in mulched treatments mean swa was greater or equal to 71 6 for water irrigation regime of a replenishment of 25 etc table 5 furthermore swa did not differ among treatments with and without mulching for 100 etc or 125 etc replenishment levels table 5 in these two irrigation regimes with mulch the applied irrigation depths were sufficient to maintain the available soil water at levels close to or above 80 even before irrigations table 5 with values equal to or greater than the allowed depletion for irrigation scheduling 70 for papaya trees santos et al 2021b throughout the irrigation cycle fig 5 this result suggests that the irrigation depths should not exceed 75 of etc for daily irrigation scheduling for mulched papaya grown on medium textured soil with the retention data close to the soil of the experiment because the water available in the rooting zone does not decrease more than 20 after an irrigation event in contrast the irrigation regimes of 75 and 100 25 etc resulted in higher swa levels before and after irrigation in soil with mulch swa went from 75 before irrigation to around 100 right after irrigation i e with moisture levels above the upper limit of swa fig 5 it was different in bare soil condition mainly due to the reductions in available soil water between the end of an irrigation and the beginning of the next irrigation reaching values of 60 for the irrigation water depths of 75 and 100 etc in these irrigation managements on bare soil the moisture conditions are insufficient to ensure crop productivity at high levels santos et al 2021b soil water storage up to 0 30 m and 0 45 m deep was determined in plants irrigated with 75 etc and 100 etc with and without mulch during an irrigation cycle table 6 even without statistical analysis it is possible to differentiate the amount of water stored between the two layers the lower mean storage values in this layer 0 0 0 30 m under treatments without mulch is due to the smaller volume of soil pores for storage and dynamics of water within the 0 30 0 40 m layer table 6 this fact occurred mainly during the first six or seven hours after irrigation when infiltration and water redistribution represent this water dynamic hillel 1980 or and coelho 1996 water evaporation also contributes to the lowest averages of water storage in bare soil as it is subject to higher water potential gradients between the soil and the atmosphere especially more superficial soil layers xiao et al 2011 the average storage for the mulched soil under application of 100 etc was only superior to that without mulching and under application of 75 etc which in turn had a lower average compared to the other treatments in the 75 etc replenishment level with mulching the amount of stored water did not differ from that stored in the soil under the 100 etc replenishment level with and without mulching table 6 these results indicate that mulching contributes to a more stable water storage in the 0 0 45 m soil layer for the 75 and 100 etc replenishment which justifies the behavior of the available water with the increase in water replenishment level fig 6b in the 0 0 0 30 m layer the differences between mean stored water in the soil for 75 etc with mulch x 100 etc with mulch 75 etc with mulch x 100 etc without mulch and 100 etc with mulch x 100 etc without mulch are explained by water uptake in this layer this is particularly true for the 100 etc replenishment level with mulch which promoted the best water conditions for root absorption figs 6a and 6b the results presented in table 6 emphasize that mulching leads to increased soil water storage under drip irrigation since the means did not differ for mulched soil even under the lowest irrigation level which did not occur for the treatment without mulch under the lowest irrigation level this average increase in storage is due to the unevaporated fraction of water available in the soil during the entire cycle between irrigations 4 2 plant growth variables lagr increased in a linear fashion as irrigation depths increased for the two soil cover conditions with and without mulch but with higher lagr values for the mulched condition fig 7 the rate of change of lagr with increasing irrigation depth was slightly higher for soil with mulch at a water replenishment level of 75 of etc although lagrs fitted to a linear function are higher for mulched soil regardless of the irrigation depth the evaluation of the significant effect of mulch table 7 showed the highest lagr with use of mulch for the 25 etc 590 mm and 100 etc 2362 mm water replenishment levels the results table 7 and fig 7 of lagr indicate that using black polyethylene film mulch favors plant growth due to the maintenance of a greater water storage in the soil keeping it close to the upper limit of water availability for papaya santos et al 2021b thus increasing water and nutrient uptake by plants these higher lagr for plastic mulched plants are in agreement with the results obtained by sakaryia et al 2018 who compared the use of plastic silver black and black with the non use for the papaya cultivars madhubindu and taiwan 4 3 stomatal conductance and leaf temperature stomata play a critical role in regulating water loss by plants and are required to be responsive to changes related to the soil plant atmosphere system collins et al 2010 as an herbaceous plant with high hydraulic conductivity papaya significantly responds to stomatal opening and closing depending on the applied irrigation depths or the amount of water available in the soil in the present study even at the lowest water replenishment level 25 of etc the stomatal conductance of the leaves of mulched papaya trees was higher 790 mmol m 2 s 1 than that of plants without mulch 156 mmol m 2 s 1 under the same fraction of water replenishment but without mulch fig 8 a these results confirm the responsiveness of the crop to changes in the soil water plant system since the air vapor pressure deficit vpd was the same at the time of all measurements in the condition of lower water availability 40 70 in the loam soil the papaya plant cannot transpire to meet the air vpd demand requiring stomata to close partially fig 8 a leaf temperature behaved inversely to stomatal conductance with higher temperature for lower swa effect of which is more pronounced in bare soil this result was expected because stomatal closure is associated with less heat quenching on the leaf blade due to transpiration therefore the reduction in transpiration increased leaf temperature zia khan et al 2015 taiz and zeiger 2004 4 4 yield and water use efficiency papaya yield responded linearly to the application of water to both mulched and bare soils fig 9 this linear behavior should be influenced by the physical attributes of the sandy clay loam soil like its porosity table 1 and its infiltration capacity which gives it an average saturated hydraulic conductivity close to 4 3 mm h 1 sartori genovez 2011 this implies the presence of percolation confirmed by the storage differences between the 0 0 45 m and 0 0 30 m layers table 6 the linear function does not define a maximum in the range of water depth levels and may indicate that more irrigation water is necessary in order to productivity reach the maximum melo et al 2020 also obtained similar production function in uncovered sandy loam soil and semiarid conditions the rate of increase in yield with the applied depth 21 645 kg ha 1 per mm was higher for the water replenishment in mulched soil than that for bare soil 0 0068 kg ha 1 per mm the differences between papaya yields for the two soil conditions are greater for water replenishment above 75 etc fig 9 these results are due to the better water status of the mulched soil with percentages of swa above or close to 80 before the irrigations compared to values between 70 and 80 in the bare soil the highest yields for plants cultivated with mulching occurred for 2362 mm 100 etc and 2952 mm 125 etc depths with an increase in yield of 25 09 and 35 17 respectively mulched soil irrigated with 75 and 105 of etc also maintained greater soil water storage in the 0 0 0 30 m layer table 6 where the concentration of roots is more accentuated coelho et al 2005 the greater water storage associated with the highest percentages of available water fig 6b in this layer 0 0 0 30 m may have contributed to the absorption of water macro and micronutrients li et al 2007 these water storage and high swa also maintain relative leaf water content pérez pérez et al 2018 within a range where photosynthetic capacity and quantum yield were not negatively affected campostrini et al 2018 this fact therefore may have contributed to the maintenance of photoassimilates production to support papaya growth and yield it is worth noting that in general as gs increased fruit yield also increased fig 10 a 10b especially for the mulched soil condition which based on the variation of the applied depths in 1 ha there was an increase of 215 14 kg of fruit for each 1 mmol m 2 s 1 of gs during the papaya cultivation cycle fig 10a as for the condition without mulch for every 1 mmol m 2 s 1 of gs there was an increase in productivity of only 23 12 kg of fruits fig 10a this greater production gain by plants cultivated with mulch is directly related to the maintenance of available soil water even before irrigation at levels above 70 fig 6 in these treatments provided by the prevention of soil water losses by evaporation conversely the reduction of stomatal opening in treatments without mulch fig 8a causes a lower availability of co2 in the intercellular spaces reducing assimilation in the rubisco carboxylation sites brodribb et al 2017 which justifies the lower yields of treatments without mulch when compared to treatments without it water footprint is an important variable associated with the consumption of water by a crop in a certain place and at a given time nouri et al 2019 the difference between the linear and quadratic models of papaya water footprint as a function of the applied depth for the two soil cover conditions fig 11 indicates that under bare soil condition the increase in the volume of water necessary production is constant with the increasing of irrigation depth even above the 75 etc replacement these increases in water footprint values are smaller for the same replenishment level tending to zero for the same increases in irrigation depth under mulched condition thus from the replenishment of 75 etc in the mulched condition no matter how much additional water one applies there is no increase in the water footprint of the papaya tree in contrast in the condition without mulch the increase in the applied depth resulted in an increase in water footprint of papaya trees fig 11 thus it is evident how much ground cover with mulching in the cultivation of papaya can maximize the water use efficiency of applied irrigation depths since the use of mulching reduces the water footprint of the papaya tree the increase in the irrigation depth leads to an increase in yield at a cost of a greater amount of water needed under the bare soil condition fig 11 for example 145 liters per kg of fruit produced for 2362 mm total depth 100 etc and 205 liters per kg of fruit produced for 2952 mm 125 etc these increases in water volumes are unnecessary when using mulch which also promoted a productivity gain of 40 67 kg ha 1 between the 100 etc and 125 etc replenishment depth fig 11 these results show that it is necessary activities for conservation water in the root zone mainly under medium and coarse texture soils and high evapotranspiration the use of black polyethylene film mulch as ground cover is one technically feasible alternative for maintenance of high swa which made possible to increase 34 in fruit productivity with replenishment of 100 etc as amount of irrigation water in a medium textured soil in general both the agronomic water use efficiencies and water productivity were reduced as the irrigation depth increased mean agronomic water use efficiency and water productivity were very close concerning the rates of reduction when irrigation increased to a water replenishment of 75 etc for greater water depths replenishment of 100 and 125 the rate of reduction of efficiencies with the increase in water depths also reduced however the lower averages of water productivity and water use efficiencies in papaya occurred in general in treatments subjected to bare soil this study showed that the use of black plastic mulch in semi arid conditions influences significantly the irrigation management of papaya when comparing it with irrigated papaya cultivation with no plastic mulch as ground cover the effect of the plastic mulch enhancing yields water footprint and water irrigation productivity in a sandy clay loam soil figs 9 11 and 12 by maintaining adequate swa fig 6 even before irrigation is a differential the sandy clay loam soil have infiltration velocity larger than 40 mm h 1 igbadun et al 2016 otoni filho 2003 that favors soil water percolation the swa within the root zone was larger under black plastic mulch than under bare soil during the irrigation cycles fig 5 even before the irrigations this may be an indication that black plastic mulch contributes for smaller percolation in addition the smaller response of yield to irrigation water levels above 100 etc by the un mulched plants indicates their roots could not uptake under these water levels possibly because of not only the soil evaporation but also because of water percolation as well 5 conclusions the methodology applied in this study allowed to analyze the effects of irrigation depths and the use of black plastic mulch on the swa and on the physiological and agronomic characteristics of papaya trees grown in semi arid regions irrigation water regimes replenishment levels influenced the soil water status regarding water storage and the variation of available water between two irrigation events which in turn influenced plant growth variables gas exchange associated with stomatal conductance yield and water use efficiency the use of mulch is technically feasible for keeping soil water availability above 75 with water replenishment equal to or greater than 75 of etc on sand clay loam soil the use black plastic mulching with drip irrigation in sandy clay loam soil saves up to 152 l of water per kg of fruit and increase productivity up to 34 by replenishing the crop

9490,plastic film mulches have the potential to be used in papaya production mainly aiming to reduce water application in semi arid regions however there is a lack of technical information and the need to introduce mulching practices in papaya orchards the objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of plastic film mulch and irrigation depths on soil water availability swa stomatal conductance leaf temperature and agronomic traits of papaya trees the study was carried out during 2018 and 2019 in jaíba city located northern minas gerais state in the brazilian semi arid region the experiment was a split plot design with soil cover conditions assigned to the plots bare soil and mulched soil and water replenishment levels to subplots 25 50 75 100 and 125 of crop evapotranspiration etc plants were drip irrigated with water replenishments based on climate data soil moisture was measured along time and agronomic and physiological characteristics of papaya trees as well water tensions were higher in treatments with lower water replenishments results showed that the increase in irrigation depth favors leaf area growth rate stomatal conductance yield and water footprint of papaya the use of mulch together with the increase in water replenishment levels contributes for maintenance of the soil water content between the upper limit of swa and 75 swa the use black plastic mulching with drip irrigation in medium textured soil saves up to 152 l of water per kg of fruit and increase productivity up to 34 by replenishing the crop evapotranspiration every

keywords carica papaya l evapotranspiration irrigation depths soil cover 1 introduction irrigated agriculture is the largest and most dynamic consumer of fresh water in the world ana 2017 2020 the reduction of water footprint or the amount of water in liters necessary to produce one kilogram of grain fruit and fiber hoekstra 2017 has been showing as the best goal for mitigating the consequences of drought in irrigated agriculture irrigation management strategies to minimize soil water losses should be known and introduced in irrigated areas moreover these strategies should promote the reduction of water consumption of crops without negatively affecting the quantity and quality of harvested products this is particularly important for fruit trees as they demand large amounts of water coelho et al 2011 evaporation is the most pronounced loss of soil water in irrigated agriculture accounting for 25 50 of a crop s evapotranspiration liu et al 2002 soil water evaporation depends on the air vapor pressure deficit physical attributes of the soil and the unshaded area by canopies several technologies promote the reduction of soil water loss through evaporation among these polyethylene film plastic mulching has been identified as a promising alternative due to the significant improvement in water and fertilizer use efficiency steinmetz et al 2016 he et al 2018 chen al et al 2020 oliveira et al 2020 furthermore mulching practices lead to an increase in leaf area fan et al 2017 qin et al 2016 and productivity of agricultural crops el samnoudi et al 2019 hou et al 2019 in addition to favoring the maintenance of soil moisture black polyethylene film mulching prevent the growth of most of weeds thus reducing the competition between the crop and weeds for water and nutrients abouziena et al 2008 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 rodrigues et al 2021 the studies about the type and color of the polyethylene film show that the clear and black plastic are the ones with greatest potential for warming the soil kasirajan e ngouajio 2012 and should provide more the benefits due to the warming they show also that black plastic mulch is more effective in controlling weed than the ones with other colors johnston and fenimore 2005 plastic mulching have generally been using for vegetables in the case of fruit trees the practice has been more common in strawberry and pineapple however as mulching has as one of its main functions the reduction in soil water evaporation using this technique may be more beneficial to fruit trees with greater spacing between rows and plants due to the greater evaporation area compared to more densely spaced vegetable crops among fruit trees papaya is a major crop in tropical and subtropical regions campostrini et al 2010 as a herbaceous semi woody plant with high hydraulic conductivity the papaya tree responds significantly well to soil moisture reaching different rates of stomatal conductance and water use efficiency santos et al 2021b studies with papaya under drip irrigation in mulched soil have been doing with more concern to the effect of different types of mulch on the growth and yield of the crop pandey et al 2005 sakariya et al 2018 on weed control patil et al 2013 the effect of the use of plastic mulch with fertigation in papaya has also been studying prajapati et al 2017 many studies have been carrying concerning irrigation on mulched soil with other crops in several places amayreh et al 2005 yaghi and arslan 2013 with different soil and climate conditions however there is no technical information about the use of plastic mulch in irrigated papaya under semiarid conditions specifically quantifying the changes of water needs due to the plastic mulch the use of this technique is not common for fruits like papaya in brazil but the climate uncertainties is influencing farmers to search for alternatives to reduce crop water use therefore it is necessary to give answers for irrigation management of papaya cultivated under semiarid conditions of brazil with the use of plastic mulching the use of mulches requires technical scientific knowledge due to possible changes in soil water plant relationship of papaya this is because mulching interacts with irrigation water levels plant growth stomatal aperture yields water use efficiency and water footprint given the uncertainties arising from climate change ipcc 2014 the lack of technical information santos et al 2021b and the need to introduce mulching practices in papaya orchards field research is necessary thus the objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of irrigation depths and black polyethylene film mulching on swa growth stomatal conductance leaf temperature yields water footprint and crop water productivity of papaya trees in sandy clay loam soil 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental area the experiment was carried out from 2018 to 2019 in the experimental field of the agricultural research company of minas gerais epamig in the municipality of jaíba state of minas gerais mg located in the semi arid region of northern minas gerais brazil 15 08 s 43 57 w and 551 m above sea level the climate of the experimental site is classified as mid latitude steppe and desert climate bsh according to the köppen geiger classification arruda et al 2013 the average annual precipitation is 850 mm the average maximum and minimum annual temperature is 31 3 c and 21 0 c respectively the soil of the experimental area is classified as sandy clay loam embrapa 2013 whose physical and water retention characteristics are shown in table 1 before planting soil samples were collected at 0 25 m from the plant row and at depths of 0 15 m and 0 30 m for soil fertility analysis table 2 fig 1 papaya seedlings carica papaya l tainung1 from formosa group were produced in a nursery at embrapa cassava and fruit and later transported to the experimental area the seedlings were planted at a spacing of 3 0 m x 1 7 m fig 2 arranged in single rows with every seven plants in the row corresponding to an experimental unit according to the chemical analysis of the soil soil acidity was corrected by applying gypsum 500 kg ha 1 and dolomitic limestone 1500 kg ha 1 through fertigation 170 kg ha 1 of phosphorus was applied at planting in addition 290 kg ha 1 of nitrogen and 120 kg ha 1 of potassium were fertigated throughout the crop cycle on a weekly basis as recommended by sanches et al 1999 weeds between rows and within the rows on the bare soil condition were manually removed during the period of the experiment pests and diseases were controlled chemically by spraying plants with insecticides from the chemical group avermectina and kumulus and fungicides from the chemical group score as recommended by the manufacturers 2 2 experimental design and cropping practices the treatments involved covering the ground with black polyethylene film mulching plastic mulching with a minimum durability of 18 months plastic mulching was installed only on the zone where at least 80 of the roots are concentrated in lateral distance that is the effective lateral distance of the plant root system which is 0 60 m coelho and simões 2015 each subplot was composed of two rows containing seven plants each with five usable plants and the other two considered as borders the experimental design was randomized blocks in a 2 5 split plot arrangement mulched soil and bare soil were assigned to plots and water replenishment levels 25 50 75 100 and 125 of crop evapotranspiration etc to subplot with four replications 2 3 irrigation plants were drip irrigated for each plant row two lateral lines connected to main lines were installed fig 2 four self compensating drippers were used per plant two for each side of the plant with a flow of 4 l h 1 the lateral line was positioned at a distance of 0 25 m from the planting row the treatments were defined using control valves at the beginning of the main line irrigations were performed daily around 9 am with the motor pump set being activated by a control head daily irrigation depth was estimated based on etc table 3 which was obtained from the reference evapotranspiration eto table 3 calculated by modified penman monteith allen et al 1998 corrected by crop coefficients recommended by posse et al 2008 and the location factor according to keller and bliesner 1990 eto was calculated based on data provided by the automatic weather station of the national institute of meteorology inmet code omm 86720 located in the municipality of jaíba mg the weather station is located 1 5 km away from the experimental area table 4 shows the total gross irrigation depths applied at different water replenishment fractions based on evapotranspiration of papaya trees during the growing period 2 4 measuring soil moisture soil moisture was monitored throughout the experimental period using time domain reflectometry tdr probes and electrical resistance blocks these sensors were installed between the plant and the dripper 0 15 m from the latter at a depth of 0 25 m considering the effective rooting depth between 0 40 m and 0 50 m coelho and simões 2015 in the production phase an automatic data collection system was installed using tdr equipment and eight reading multiplexers sensors were installed at four soil profiles delimited by a distance of 1 0 m from the plant and a depth of 0 60 m with 16 probes distributed per profile fig 3 totaling 64 probes in the experimental area the probes were distributed to form a 0 25 m x 0 15 m grid fig 3 the profiles for moisture evaluation corresponded to the water replenishment treatments of 75 and 100 of etc with and without plastic mulching these two irrigation levels were selected due to the limitations of equipment and our hypothesis that these levels would be the better ones for crop yields without losses tdr probes were built with three 0 10 m long stainless steel rods coelho et al 2005 and with an axial 3 5 m long cable the calibration of the probes was performed using undisturbed soil samples collected from the experimental area resulting in the following eq 1 1 θ 6 10 5 ka 3 0 0028 ka 2 0 0463 ka 0 1313 where θ is the soil moisture on a volumetric basis cm3cm 3 and ka is the apparent dielectric constant of the soil at each position of the probe grid in the profile soil moisture data were collected as a function of time starting before an irrigation event these data were converted into water storage in the profile through numerical integration by the trapezium method eq 2 using moisture readings at the four depths at each distance from the plant 2 s ti r 0 z θ z dz where sti r represents the water storage in mm over time ti and the distance r from the plant mm θ z is the soil moisture cm3 cm 3 at depth z corresponding to the distance r from the plant z is the desired profile depth cm the averages of sti values at the distances resulted in the storage stg of the profile 0 z at each of the four treatments two consecutive irrigation cycles were evaluated during the papaya production period the average storage over the period right after the irrigation until the beginning of the next irrigation was computed for the depths of 0 30 m and 0 45 m of the soil profile as they are representative of the effective rooting depth coelho et al 2005 santos et al 2021a using soil moisture values in each treatment the swa was calculated according to eq 3 santos et al 2021a 3 swa θact

biometric measurements leaf area was determined from the length of the central lobes of all leaves of the plant according to the methodology proposed by alves and santos 2002 at during the period from 90 to 120 days after planting when papaya was in the growth and initial flowering phase we determined the leaf area growth rate only with the data collected in this phase based upon the growth rate of the cultivar tainung n 1 under semiarid conditions as showed by coelho et al 2011 in addition on fully expanded leaves 7th and 8th leaves counted from the apex and grown in full sun measurements of stomatal conductance gs and leaf temperature tl were performed using a porometer sc 1 decagon devises and an infrared thermometer lefeng industrial thermometer the readings were taken between 12 00 pm and 1 00 pm an interval considered to have the highest daily temperature at the experimental site at the production phase the fruits were harvested weekly by slightly twisting the fruits when they still had less than 15 of the peal surface yellow that is at stage i of maturation morais et al 2007 at harvest time the fruits were weighed and identified in their respective treatments the values obtained from the weighing were transformed into productivity and at the end of the production cycle crop water productivity eq 4 fernández et al 2020 and water footprint eq 5 were estimated for papaya tree according to santos et al 2021b 4 wpc y etc where wpc crop water productivity kg fruit m 3 y yield kg fruit ha 1 etc crop evapotranspiration m3 ha 1 5 wf va y where wf water footprint l

a confidence level of 5 and considering five water replenishment levels and soil cover condition bare soil and mulched soil soil water storage values acquired through the automatic data collection system with tdr were interpreted by t test with a confidence level of 5 probability 3 results 3 1 rainfall and air temperature during the experimental period the total accumulated rainfall was 770 mm fig 4 the highest monthly precipitation values were recorded in november and december 2018 with a total of 174 and 152 mm respectively conversely the highest monthly values of maximum air temperatures were recorded in the months of october 2018 and november 2019 while the lowest values were recorded in june and july 2019 fig 4 3 2 soil moisture soil water status represented by the water potential measured by electrical resistance sensors at all treatments was evaluated from april to october months in which irrigation was continuous the values of soil water tension before irrigation events were higher for the treatment with 25 water replenishment of crop evapotranspiration etc in both soil cover conditions with and without mulch with greater scattering of data under mulching practice at this water replenishment level on bare soil soil tensions varied less 86 115 kpa over time than mulched soil 46 90 kpa for irrigation regimes under the cultivation conditions without mulch with a replenishment of 50 etc or greater the moisture tensions were close to or above 20 kpa fig 5b in the cultivation conditions with mulch and water replenishment above 50 of the available water the soil water tensions before the irrigations were lower than 20 kpa fig 5a the influence of treatments on irrigation water management considering the available soil water before the irrigation event is shown in table 5 it appears that in at least one of the two evaluated periods september 2018 and march 2019 there was a difference between the percentages of available soil water under the cultivation conditions with and without mulch for the 25 etc 50 etc and 75 etc irrigation depth table 5 the percentage values of available soil water before irrigation in the cultivation condition with the use of mulch were higher than the ones under cultivation with bare soil for all water regimes these differences were larger for irrigation depths less than 100 etc mainly during the fruit growth and production phases march 2019 when they varied from 15 9 to 37 4 the means of swa below 83 3 without mulch and 91 8 with much before irrigation with more than 100 and 125 etc should be due porosity of the medium textured soil table 1 fig 5 shows the evaluation of water management in papaya at two levels of water replenishment since the last irrigation 75 etc and 100 etc with the soil covered and uncovered in this figure soil moisture was transformed into available water as a function of time elapsed between two consecutive irrigation cycles representative of the drying soil the averages of the percentage of available water before the irrigations in the treatments 75 etc and 100 etc without and with mulch was evaluated in two irrigation cycles with mean hourly measured moisture data fig 5 the replenishment of 75 etc was not enough for the soil in the root zone to reach the moisture level at field capacity 100 of the available water in the soil after an irrigation in the bare soil condition in this condition of soil water replenishment and un mulched cultivation the available soil water reduced to 20 until the start of the next irrigation while the reduction reached 40 of the available soil water under 100 etc replenishment in the mulched condition the water replenishment of 75 etc corresponded to an increase in available soil water below 100 after irrigation fig 5a while the replenishment of 100 etc raised the available water content to 100 going over the field capacity fig 5b the averages of swa before the irrigations in the treatments 75 etc and 100 etc with mulch ranged from 70 to 85 figs 5c 5d with moisture reductions smaller than 30 the applied irrigation depths resulted in a positive linear effect on the water available in the soil for treatments without mulch fig 6a furthermore the average increase rate in swa for this condition bare soil was 0 0158 per mm of water applied in mulched soil the irrigation depths had a quadratic effect on the available soil water fig 6b the average percent of variation the swa for water depths above 1771 mm was negative means of water storage up to soil depths between 0 30 m and 0 45 m layer with the highest concentration of roots coelho et al 2005 santos et al 2021a between two irrigation events of the irrigation levels 75 and 100 with and without mulching were compared they revealed a significant difference p 0 05 when comparing the following 75 etc without mulch versus 100 etc with mulch 75 etc without mulch versus 100 etc without mulch and 75 etc without mulch versus 75 etc with mulch mulched treatments means were 4 6 5 8 and 4 6 higher respectively table 6 in the 0 0 0 45 m layer as for the 0 0 0 30 m depth based on table 6 no significant difference was observed only between 75 etc without mulch versus 100 etc with mulch 3 3 plant biometric variables there was an effect of irrigation depth x mulching interaction on biometric variables of papaya trees the irrigation depths had a positive linear effect on growth rate of leaf area of mulched papaya as for the cultivation condition without mulch there was no significant effect p 0 05 on the relationship between the applied irrigation depth and leaf area growth rate lagr fig 7 in studying the effect of mulching within irrigation depths the depths of 590 mm 25 etc and 2362 mm 100 etc resulted in a significant difference in lagr of 0 04 m2 d 1 and a non significant difference of 0 04 m2 d 1 between the condition with and without mulch respectively table 7 on the other hand the growth rate in plant height showed an effect of mulch within the irrigation depth only for 2952 mm 125 etc with a superiority of 0 67 m2 d 1 for mulched papaya tree table 7 3 4 stomatal conductance and leaf temperature the linear regression models relating irrigation depths to stomatal conductance of papaya leaves were significant p 0 05 both for treatments subjected to mulching and without it fig 8a the average values of stomatal conductance of mulched plants ranged from 790 to 1050 mmol m 2 s 1 with a rate of change of 0 1032 mmol m2 s 1 per mm of water as for treatments without mulch the mean values of stomatal conductance ranged from 156 to 813 mmol m 2 s 1 with an increasing rate of change of 0 3095 mmol m2 s 1 per mm water leaf temperature as a function of irrigation depths fitted to quadratic models for treatments with or without mulching fig 8b regardless of the use of mulch the highest leaf temperatures were recorded in irrigation depths of 25 etc according to regression equations the irrigation depths that minimized the papaya leaf temperature were 1900 and 2338 mm for treatments with and without mulch respectively resulting in values of 36 1 and 32 6 ºc 3 5 yield and water use efficiency there was an effect p 0 05 of irrigation depth on fruit productivity of mulched papaya trees for plants without black polyethylene film mulch there was no effect of irrigation depths p 0 05 the average yield values as a function of irrigation depth ranged from 50 to 110 t ha 1 for plants cultivated with mulching while in bare soil cultivation the average papaya yields ranged from 52 to 75 t ha 1 fig 9 the behavior of estimated yield as a function of irrigation depths followed linear models with a yield increase rate of 21 645 kg ha 1 per mm of applied water on mulched soil against a lower rate of increase 0 0068 kg ha 1 per mm of applied water on bare soil condition fig 9 the linear regression models of yield and water footprint of papaya fruits as a function of stomatal conductance gs were significant p 0 05 for cultivation condition with and without mulch fig 10 the models had positive rates of yield and water footprint of papaya per unit of increase in stomatal conductance and the difference between the rates of increase in yield under mulched and bare soil conditions was greater than differences in water footprint fig 10 regression models of water footprint as a function of irrigation depths were significant p 0 05 for both treatments with and without mulch fig 11 the average values of water footprint as a function of irrigation depths in mulched plants ranged from 110 to 277 l for each kilogram of fruit produced while for plants cultivated without mulch water footprint ranged from 109 to 429 l for each kilogram of fruit produced fig 11 the models were a second degree polynomial for the mulched condition and linear for the bare soil condition the quadratic models of crop water productivity as a function of irrigation depths were significant p 0 05 for cultivation condition with and without mulch fig 12 the reduction rates of water productivity were higher in plants cultivated without mulch mainly in depths equal to or less than 1771 mm 75 etc fig 12 in both mulched soil conditions and bare soil condition applying 500 mm maximized crop water productivity on the other hand depths of 2362 mm and 2952 mm reduced crop water productivity with r2 values of 0 96 and 0 98 respectively fig 13 4 discussion 4 1 water availability in the soil papaya carica papaya l is a major fruit crop in tropical and subtropical regions campostrini et al 2010 with commercial orchards located mainly between latitudes 23 n and 23 s under these soil and climate conditions growth flowering and maturation stages of papaya fruits occur simultaneously from the third or fourth month after planting thus because of the intense vegetative and productive development adequate supply of water through irrigation play a key role especially when associated with technologies promoting the maintenance of soil moisture such as mulching in the present study based on fig 5 both with or without mulch the treatment with water replenishment of 25 etc had the highest water tension values in the soil this shows that the application of the lowest irrigation depth under these conditions were not sufficient to maintain the soil with a satisfactory water condition for papaya trees the tensions under this water replenishment without mulch were above 80 kpa minimum observed whereas with mulch the tension was close to the highest observed value conversely as the irrigation depths increased the soil water tension decreased regardless of the use or not of mulch thus indicating an increase in soil moisture in mulched conditions under water replenishment above 50 of the crop water demand fig 5b the plants were favored throughout the irrigation cycles by moistures corresponding to tensions close to or below 20 kpa considered adequate for growth and production of papaya aiyelaagbe et al 1986 in irrigation regimes with water replenishments of 100 and 125 etc mulching practice had no significant effect on the percentages of swa before irrigation events table 5 this indicates that the replenishment of 100 etc is sufficient to maintain the percentage of available soil water to at least 78 7 in the bare soil condition and to at least 84 5 in the mulched soil condition the levels of swa between 100 after irrigations and above 75 before irrigations are within the allowed water depletion for crop irrigation scheduling bernardo et al 2019 for yield maximization the replenishments of 75 and 100 etc were sufficient for the soil in the rooting zone to reach moisture content above the field capacity 100 of the available water in the soil after an irrigation event in mulched papaya trees in this soil condition the available water content reduced to values close to 73 at the beginning of the next irrigation figs 5c and 5d in mulched treatments mean swa was greater or equal to 71 6 for water irrigation regime of a replenishment of 25 etc table 5 furthermore swa did not differ among treatments with and without mulching for 100 etc or 125 etc replenishment levels table 5 in these two irrigation regimes with mulch the applied irrigation depths were sufficient to maintain the available soil water at levels close to or above 80 even before irrigations table 5 with values equal to or greater than the allowed depletion for irrigation scheduling 70 for papaya trees santos et al 2021b throughout the irrigation cycle fig 5 this result suggests that the irrigation depths should not exceed 75 of etc for daily irrigation scheduling for mulched papaya grown on medium textured soil with the retention data close to the soil of the experiment because the water available in the rooting zone does not decrease more than 20 after an irrigation event in contrast the irrigation regimes of 75 and 100 25 etc resulted in higher swa levels before and after irrigation in soil with mulch swa went from 75 before irrigation to around 100 right after irrigation i e with moisture levels above the upper limit of swa fig 5 it was different in bare soil condition mainly due to the reductions in available soil water between the end of an irrigation and the beginning of the next irrigation reaching values of 60 for the irrigation water depths of 75 and 100 etc in these irrigation managements on bare soil the moisture conditions are insufficient to ensure crop productivity at high levels santos et al 2021b soil water storage up to 0 30 m and 0 45 m deep was determined in plants irrigated with 75 etc and 100 etc with and without mulch during an irrigation cycle table 6 even without statistical analysis it is possible to differentiate the amount of water stored between the two layers the lower mean storage values in this layer 0 0 0 30 m under treatments without mulch is due to the smaller volume of soil pores for storage and dynamics of water within the 0 30 0 40 m layer table 6 this fact occurred mainly during the first six or seven hours after irrigation when infiltration and water redistribution represent this water dynamic hillel 1980 or and coelho 1996 water evaporation also contributes to the lowest averages of water storage in bare soil as it is subject to higher water potential gradients between the soil and the atmosphere especially more superficial soil layers xiao et al 2011 the average storage for the mulched soil under application of 100 etc was only superior to that without mulching and under application of 75 etc which in turn had a lower average compared to the other treatments in the 75 etc replenishment level with mulching the amount of stored water did not differ from that stored in the soil under the 100 etc replenishment level with and without mulching table 6 these results indicate that mulching contributes to a more stable water storage in the 0 0 45 m soil layer for the 75 and 100 etc replenishment which justifies the behavior of the available water with the increase in water replenishment level fig 6b in the 0 0 0 30 m layer the differences between mean stored water in the soil for 75 etc with mulch x 100 etc with mulch 75 etc with mulch x 100 etc without mulch and 100 etc with mulch x 100 etc without mulch are explained by water uptake in this layer this is particularly true for the 100 etc replenishment level with mulch which promoted the best water conditions for root absorption figs 6a and 6b the results presented in table 6 emphasize that mulching leads to increased soil water storage under drip irrigation since the means did not differ for mulched soil even under the lowest irrigation level which did not occur for the treatment without mulch under the lowest irrigation level this average increase in storage is due to the unevaporated fraction of water available in the soil during the entire cycle between irrigations 4 2 plant growth variables lagr increased in a linear fashion as irrigation depths increased for the two soil cover conditions with and without mulch but with higher lagr values for the mulched condition fig 7 the rate of change of lagr with increasing irrigation depth was slightly higher for soil with mulch at a water replenishment level of 75 of etc although lagrs fitted to a linear function are higher for mulched soil regardless of the irrigation depth the evaluation of the significant effect of mulch table 7 showed the highest lagr with use of mulch for the 25 etc 590 mm and 100 etc 2362 mm water replenishment levels the results table 7 and fig 7 of lagr indicate that using black polyethylene film mulch favors plant growth due to the maintenance of a greater water storage in the soil keeping it close to the upper limit of water availability for papaya santos et al 2021b thus increasing water and nutrient uptake by plants these higher lagr for plastic mulched plants are in agreement with the results obtained by sakaryia et al 2018 who compared the use of plastic silver black and black with the non use for the papaya cultivars madhubindu and taiwan 4 3 stomatal conductance and leaf temperature stomata play a critical role in regulating water loss by plants and are required to be responsive to changes related to the soil plant atmosphere system collins et al 2010 as an herbaceous plant with high hydraulic conductivity papaya significantly responds to stomatal opening and closing depending on the applied irrigation depths or the amount of water available in the soil in the present study even at the lowest water replenishment level 25 of etc the stomatal conductance of the leaves of mulched papaya trees was higher 790 mmol m 2 s 1 than that of plants without mulch 156 mmol m 2 s 1 under the same fraction of water replenishment but without mulch fig 8 a these results confirm the responsiveness of the crop to changes in the soil water plant system since the air vapor pressure deficit vpd was the same at the time of all measurements in the condition of lower water availability 40 70 in the loam soil the papaya plant cannot transpire to meet the air vpd demand requiring stomata to close partially fig 8 a leaf temperature behaved inversely to stomatal conductance with higher temperature for lower swa effect of which is more pronounced in bare soil this result was expected because stomatal closure is associated with less heat quenching on the leaf blade due to transpiration therefore the reduction in transpiration increased leaf temperature zia khan et al 2015 taiz and zeiger 2004 4 4 yield and water use efficiency papaya yield responded linearly to the application of water to both mulched and bare soils fig 9 this linear behavior should be influenced by the physical attributes of the sandy clay loam soil like its porosity table 1 and its infiltration capacity which gives it an average saturated hydraulic conductivity close to 4 3 mm h 1 sartori genovez 2011 this implies the presence of percolation confirmed by the storage differences between the 0 0 45 m and 0 0 30 m layers table 6 the linear function does not define a maximum in the range of water depth levels and may indicate that more irrigation water is necessary in order to productivity reach the maximum melo et al 2020 also obtained similar production function in uncovered sandy loam soil and semiarid conditions the rate of increase in yield with the applied depth 21 645 kg ha 1 per mm was higher for the water replenishment in mulched soil than that for bare soil 0 0068 kg ha 1 per mm the differences between papaya yields for the two soil conditions are greater for water replenishment above 75 etc fig 9 these results are due to the better water status of the mulched soil with percentages of swa above or close to 80 before the irrigations compared to values between 70 and 80 in the bare soil the highest yields for plants cultivated with mulching occurred for 2362 mm 100 etc and 2952 mm 125 etc depths with an increase in yield of 25 09 and 35 17 respectively mulched soil irrigated with 75 and 105 of etc also maintained greater soil water storage in the 0 0 0 30 m layer table 6 where the concentration of roots is more accentuated coelho et al 2005 the greater water storage associated with the highest percentages of available water fig 6b in this layer 0 0 0 30 m may have contributed to the absorption of water macro and micronutrients li et al 2007 these water storage and high swa also maintain relative leaf water content pérez pérez et al 2018 within a range where photosynthetic capacity and quantum yield were not negatively affected campostrini et al 2018 this fact therefore may have contributed to the maintenance of photoassimilates production to support papaya growth and yield it is worth noting that in general as gs increased fruit yield also increased fig 10 a 10b especially for the mulched soil condition which based on the variation of the applied depths in 1 ha there was an increase of 215 14 kg of fruit for each 1 mmol m 2 s 1 of gs during the papaya cultivation cycle fig 10a as for the condition without mulch for every 1 mmol m 2 s 1 of gs there was an increase in productivity of only 23 12 kg of fruits fig 10a this greater production gain by plants cultivated with mulch is directly related to the maintenance of available soil water even before irrigation at levels above 70 fig 6 in these treatments provided by the prevention of soil water losses by evaporation conversely the reduction of stomatal opening in treatments without mulch fig 8a causes a lower availability of co2 in the intercellular spaces reducing assimilation in the rubisco carboxylation sites brodribb et al 2017 which justifies the lower yields of treatments without mulch when compared to treatments without it water footprint is an important variable associated with the consumption of water by a crop in a certain place and at a given time nouri et al 2019 the difference between the linear and quadratic models of papaya water footprint as a function of the applied depth for the two soil cover conditions fig 11 indicates that under bare soil condition the increase in the volume of water necessary production is constant with the increasing of irrigation depth even above the 75 etc replacement these increases in water footprint values are smaller for the same replenishment level tending to zero for the same increases in irrigation depth under mulched condition thus from the replenishment of 75 etc in the mulched condition no matter how much additional water one applies there is no increase in the water footprint of the papaya tree in contrast in the condition without mulch the increase in the applied depth resulted in an increase in water footprint of papaya trees fig 11 thus it is evident how much ground cover with mulching in the cultivation of papaya can maximize the water use efficiency of applied irrigation depths since the use of mulching reduces the water footprint of the papaya tree the increase in the irrigation depth leads to an increase in yield at a cost of a greater amount of water needed under the bare soil condition fig 11 for example 145 liters per kg of fruit produced for 2362 mm total depth 100 etc and 205 liters per kg of fruit produced for 2952 mm 125 etc these increases in water volumes are unnecessary when using mulch which also promoted a productivity gain of 40 67 kg ha 1 between the 100 etc and 125 etc replenishment depth fig 11 these results show that it is necessary activities for conservation water in the root zone mainly under medium and coarse texture soils and high evapotranspiration the use of black polyethylene film mulch as ground cover is one technically feasible alternative for maintenance of high swa which made possible to increase 34 in fruit productivity with replenishment of 100 etc as amount of irrigation water in a medium textured soil in general both the agronomic water use efficiencies and water productivity were reduced as the irrigation depth increased mean agronomic water use efficiency and water productivity were very close concerning the rates of reduction when irrigation increased to a water replenishment of 75 etc for greater water depths replenishment of 100 and 125 the rate of reduction of efficiencies with the increase in water depths also reduced however the lower averages of water productivity and water use efficiencies in papaya occurred in general in treatments subjected to bare soil this study showed that the use of black plastic mulch in semi arid conditions influences significantly the irrigation management of papaya when comparing it with irrigated papaya cultivation with no plastic mulch as ground cover the effect of the plastic mulch enhancing yields water footprint and water irrigation productivity in a sandy clay loam soil figs 9 11 and 12 by maintaining adequate swa fig 6 even before irrigation is a differential the sandy clay loam soil have infiltration velocity larger than 40 mm h 1 igbadun et al 2016 otoni filho 2003 that favors soil water percolation the swa within the root zone was larger under black plastic mulch than under bare soil during the irrigation cycles fig 5 even before the irrigations this may be an indication that black plastic mulch contributes for smaller percolation in addition the smaller response of yield to irrigation water levels above 100 etc by the un mulched plants indicates their roots could not uptake under these water levels possibly because of not only the soil evaporation but also because of water percolation as well 5 conclusions the methodology applied in this study allowed to analyze the effects of irrigation depths and the use of black plastic mulch on the swa and on the physiological and agronomic characteristics of papaya trees grown in semi arid regions irrigation water regimes replenishment levels influenced the soil water status regarding water storage and the variation of available water between two irrigation events which in turn influenced plant growth variables gas exchange associated with stomatal conductance yield and water use efficiency the use of mulch is technically feasible for keeping soil water availability above 75 with water replenishment equal to or greater than 75 of etc on sand clay loam soil the use black plastic mulching with drip irrigation in sandy clay loam soil saves up to 152 l of water per kg of fruit and increase productivity up to 34 by replenishing the crop

9491,the irrational utilization of water resources restricts the sustainable development of tree crop intercropping in the loess region drip fertigation was applied for two years in an intercropping system to save water resources and improve water use efficiency wue and crop yield the spatial distribution of soil water plant roots and water use pattern were investigated in a drip fertigated intercropping system a two factor randomized block design was adopted four irrigation levels 60 w1 70 w2 80 w3 and 90 w4 of field capacity fc together with three nitrogen fertilization treatments 59 40 f1 92 00 f2 and 124 32 kg ha 1 f3 were set up with a blank control ck which was rain fed with base fertilizer applied before sowing the soil water content swc distribution had a u shape in the horizontal direction and the vertical water competition area moved downward as the intercropping year increased the soybean root length density rld increased as the distance from the tree row increased but apple showed the reverse trend the overlap between apple and soybean roots generally decreased as the distance from the tree row increased but the vertical overlap of roots extended from 0 40 cm 2018 to 0 60 cm 2019 the interspecific competition increased with the increase in intercropping years resulting in a downward shift of the competition area water consumption in 2018 and 2019 increased as the irrigation level rose the swc rld soybean yield and wue of w3f2 were the highest among the treatments excessive irrigation can lead to vigorous vegetative growth but reduced yields the negative effects of intense interspecific competition were relieved under drip fertigation the results suggested that drip irrigation at 80 fc combined with 92 kg ha 1 n fertilization can improve the yield and wue of the apple soybean system on the loess plateau keywords agroforestry drip fertigation soil water content root distribution 1 introduction agroforestry is a traditional planting pattern widely used on the loess plateau yun et al 2012 gao et al 2013 2016 land space conflicts and soil erosion can be solved through agroforestry which also brings increased economic benefits lal 1989 banda et al 1994 the main agroforestry system on the loess plateau is tree crop intercropping sun et al 2018b xu et al 2019 however the uneven annual precipitation in the region means that water supplies may not meet crop growth demand during critical growth periods in addition the low fertility of the topsoil on the loess plateau may not guarantee the nutrient requirements for the different plants involved in the intercropping system the heterogeneous nature of the water and nutrient supplies is also a result of interspecific interactions among intercropping species the rain fed model commonly used by local farmers cannot meet the water and fertilizer requirements of intercropping systems therefore the local intercropping fields require additional water and fertilizer supplements recently many studies gao et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 have investigated water and fertilizer supply in intercropping systems on the loess plateau the results showed that water and fertilizer supplement significantly boosted grain yield and increased the economic benefits however the water and fertilizer replenishment methods were relatively extensive and were dominated by flood irrigation which can cause surface runoff environmental pollution through fertilizer leaching waste water resources lead to inefficient water and fertilizer use and potentially intensify underground interspecific competition drury et al 1996 bergeron et al 2011 therefore more efficient irrigation methods need to be introduced into the intercropping system drip fertigation is an efficient water and fertilizer integration supply technology that can effectively reduce water evaporation and the ineffective consumption of water and fertilizer by transporting them directly to the crop roots hou et al 2010 yahgi et al 2013 perdoná et al 2015 badr and abuarab 2013 in addition the amount of water and fertilizer applied by drip fertigation can be matched to the amount required by the plant to maximize water and fertilizer use efficiency which reduces fertilizer leaching and water wastage gardenas et al 2005 lu et al 2021 therefore the optimal application of water and fertilizer under drip fertigation may be different from that under flood irrigation in intercropping systems previous studies on water and fertilizer regulation under drip irrigation mostly focused on monoculture crops fanish et al 2011 chen et al 2020 yan et al 2021 however drip fertigation in a tree based intercropping system has rarely studied the water infiltration characteristics under drip fertigation may mean that after applying drip fertigation to the intercropping system the interspecific interactions among trees and crops may change the root distribution and alter the water consumption patterns of the system li et al 2017 therefore it is essential to formulate new irrigation and fertilization regimes compared with flood irrigation drip fertigation changes the water and fertilizer input patterns which simultaneously change the distribution of soil water and nutrients a previous study found that drip irrigation applied to a tomato corn intercropping system could significantly change the spatial distributions of soil water and root growth the redistribution of water and fertilizer will certainly affect the root distribution which is important because the morphology distribution of tree and crop roots determines the competitive ability of individuals in the intercropping system to obtain underground resources george et al 1996 and is also perceived to be the primary factor determining the degree of underground competition between species sun et al 2018a many studies have investigated the root distribution when an intercropping system is used west and griffith 1992 found in a wheat and poplar intercropping system that irrigation could promote root growth and wu et al 2017 showed that the application of nitrogen fertilizer can increase the root length density of maize in an intercropping system zhang et al 2013 found that interspecific competition reduces root length density rld however the distribution characteristics of soil water and roots in a drip fertigation tree based intercropping system are still unclear water directly affects root growth and root distribution affects water use patterns and interspecific relationships in intercropping systems therefore when attempting to create an optimal irrigation and fertilization regime it is essential to analyze the interspecific relationships based on soil water and tree crop roots so as to understand the water use patterns in an intercropping system under drip fertigation in our study we applied drip fertigation to an apple soybean intercropping system in a two year field trial to investigate 1 the soil water content swc and the rld spatial distributions for apple trees and soybean under different drip irrigation and fertilizer regimes and 2 the effects their distribution characteristics have on the crop yield and water use patterns 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study area was located in ji county shanxi province china 36 01 n 110 45 e which is a typical gully area on

experimental design the experiment was carried out between april and october in the 2018 and 2019 seasons the apple soybean intercropping system was selected as the research object within the apple quality demonstration park in zhongduo township ji county shanxi province china the apple trees short branched red fuji were planted in 2014 and fruit setting had not begun the row spacing of the trees was 4 m 5 m and with an east west orientation and the average height of the trees is 3 7 m with a diameter at breast height of 6 5 cm the soybean jindou 35 was sown on the 19th of april in 2018 and the 20th of april in 2019 the soybean planting rows were 1 m away from the trees and the spacing was 0 3 m 0 5 m fig 2 a two factor randomized block design was adopted a total of four irrigation levels and three fertilization levels were applied there was also a blank control ck treatment which was rain fed with base fertilizer applied only before sowing each treatment was repeated three times which made a total of 39 test plots the four irrigation upper limits achieved after irrigation were set according to the average monthly water consumption of the plants drip irrigation was carried out during the key growth periods for soybeans the average water content in the 0 60 cm soil layer of the four irrigation treatments was 60 w1 70 w2 80 w3 and 90 w4 of field capacity fc the amount of irrigation in each growth period is shown in table 1 the designed flow rate of the drip irrigation head was 1 38 l h 1 the distance between drip heads was 300 mm and the distance between drip belt was 50 cm the pipe provided water directly through a pump a pressure gauge was installed at the front of the pipe to monitor the water pressure in the pipe and the pressure was controlled to 0 1 mpa by adjusting the gate valves of each branch pipe phosphate fertilizer and potassium fertilizer were applied as base fertilizer in accordance with local experience before sowing p2o5 168 8 kg ha 1 k2o 168 8 kg ha 1 the amount of fertilizer applied was determined by comprehensively considering the fertilizer needs of apples and soybeans the three nitrogen fertilizer application levels were set according to the fertilizer requirements of the two crops and local experience the total fertilizer application amounts during the growth period were 59 40 f1 92 00 f2 and 124 32 kg ha 1 f3 fertilizer application was carried out for three times over the growth period from seedling stage to branch stage pod setting stage and grain filling stage and drip fertilization was applied along with the irrigation water field experiment photographs are shown in fig 3 2 3 sampling and measurement methods 2 3 1 soil water measurements the soil water content in the 0 60 cm layer divided into six 10 cm layers in the field was monitored using time domain reflectometry probes trime pico iph imko ettlingen germany every 7 days monitoring points were set at 0 5 1 0 1 75 and 2 5 m away from the tree rows fig 2 additional measurements were carried out after irrigation and rainfall and the drying method was adopted for correction 2 3 2 calculation of the irrigation amount the formula for calculating irrigation amount is as follows dou et al 2022 1 m 10γh θ w θ 0 where m is irrigation water amount mm γ is soil bulk density of the target soil layer h is depth of the target soil layer θ w is the target gravimetric water content of the soil and θ 0 is the measured gravimetric water content of the soil before irrigation 2 3 3 root measurements apple tree and soybean roots were sampled using a root auger 10 cm diameter at the filling stage the sampling points were the same as those for swc but were divided into 20 cm layers fig 2 live roots were carefully selected and repeatedly washed in clear water using a 2 mm screen the soil attached to the root surface was washed and the appearance characteristics of soybean and apple roots were carefully distinguished the winrhizo root scanning system ver 2003b reagent instruments inc quebec canada was used to analyze the root length density and other indexes 2 3 4 underground interspecific competition intensity index uicii the intensity of competition for water and nutrients between the apple and soybean roots was quantified by calculating the degree of overlap between the niches occupied by the two species levins 1968 the formula for uicii 0 uicii 1 is as follows pianka 1973 2 uicii i 1 n p ai p si i 1 n p ai 2 i 1 n p si 2 where n is the number of soil layers and p ai and p si are the proportions of apple and soybean fine roots respectively in the i th soil layer in relation to all the layers 0 60 cm 2 3 5 growth characteristics the height of soybean at filling was measured using a tape and the leaf area index was obtained by measuring the leaf area over a unit area of land 2 3 6 water consumption water consumption et by soybean during each growth period in the intercropping system was calculated using the water balance principle as follows zheng et al 2021 3 et 1 2 i p u r f where et1 2 is the et mm in each growth period i is the irrigation amount mm p is the effective precipitation mm during the soybean growth period u is the amount of groundwater recharge mm r is surface runoff f is the amount of deep water leakage mm and δw is the change in soil water storage at the beginning and end of each stage in this test the drip irrigation condition was unsaturated infiltration the terrain was flat and there was no surface runoff when the groundwater depth is below 2 5 m the groundwater recharge is 0 drip irrigation does not consider the amount of deep leakage which means that deep leakage is 0 therefore the surface runoff r the groundwater recharge u and the deep seepage f can be ignored 2 3 7 yield and water use yield kg ha 1 of soybean was determined as the grain yield gy in each plot at the maturing stage water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 in the intercropping system was the ratio of the yield in the soybean planting area to water consumption 4 wue gy et where gy kg ha 1 is the grain yield of soybean and et is the water consumption mm of the intercropping system irrigation water use efficiency iwue kg m 3 was the ratio of the gy to the amount of irrigation per unit area of intercropped soybean and was calculated as follows 5 iwue gy i where gy is the grain yield of soybean kg ha 1 and i is the irrigation amount m3 ha 1 2 4 data analysis an analysis of variance was conducted using spss ver 20 0 spss corp chicago il usa a least significant difference test

spatial distribution of soil water between 2018 and 2019 mean swc initially deceased and then increased as distance from the tree row increased fig 4 horizontally swc had a u shape that peaked at 2 5 m from the tree row and was lowest at 1 m from the tree row fig 4 this suggested that the competition area between apple and soybean may occur at 0 5 1 75 m from the tree row and that 1 m from the tree row is the strongest competitive area for water among all treatments the maximum values generally occurred in w4f2 in 2018 and w3f2 in 2019 and the two minimum values occurred in ck fig 4 the maxima for swc were 17 60 in 2018 and 13 56 in 2019 while the minima were 13 49 in 2018 and 10 87 in 2019 between 2018 and 2019 at the same irrigation level the swcs initially increased and then decreased as the fertilization level rose the swcs reached their maximum under the f2 treatment at the same fertilization level the swcs increased as the irrigation level rose the maximum swcs occurred in the w4 group between 2018 and 2019 the swcs under drip water and fertilizer regulation were 1 7 18 2 higher than those of ck the mean swcs in the 20 40 cm soil layer in 2019 changed dramatically compared to those in 2018 fig 5 this suggested that the vertical water competition area moved downward from 20 cm to 40 cm as the number of intercropping years increased there was also a smooth trend after 40 cm which was more obvious in 2019 than in 2018 fig 5 this implies that the competition for water in intercropping systems in the vertical direction weakened after 40 cm among all the influence factors the distance to the tree line had a significant effect on mean swc p 0 05 in 2018 but no significant effect in 2019 fig 4 meanwhile the irrigation amount had a significant effect on mean swc p 0 05 in the intercropping system during 2018 and a very significant effect p 0 01 in 2019 fig 4 the fertilization and irrigation fertilization interaction had very significant effects on mean swc p 0 01 in both two years fig 4 the results showed that the swc distribution was significantly influenced by drip water and fertilizer application 3 2 spatial distribution of apple and soybean rld the rld distributions for soybean and apple are shown in figs 6 7 in 2018 and 2019 soybean rld was greater than that of apple for each treatment except ck in both years furthermore the total apple rld under the w3f2 treatment was highest and ck was lowest in both two years compared to ck the total apple rld of the other treatments increased by 69 25 658 18 horizontally the apple rld decreased as the distance from the tree row increased but soybean showed the opposite trend figs 6 7 the apple and soybean roots overlapped between 0 5 m and 1 75 m from the tree row and the overlapped distance increased as the irrigation level increased vertically the apple and soybean rlds decreased as the soil depth increased and the roots of the two species overlapped in the 0 40 cm soil zone in 2018 and the 0 60 cm zone in 2019 figs 6 7 under the same fertilization treatment the total rlds for apple and soybean roots both increased with the increase in irrigation level meanwhile the rlds in the w3 treatment increased by 2 76 125 97 compared to the other irrigation groups under the same irrigation treatment the apple and soybean rlds both increased at first and then decreased with the increase in fertilization level and the rlds in the f2 treatment increased by 16 20 20 19 compared to the other fertilization treatments among all the treatments the ratio of apple roots at 2 5 m distance from the tree row to the whole 0 5 2 5 m distance from the tree row varied from 0 to 10 in 2018 and from 0 to 8 in 2019 and the ratio of soybean roots at 0 5 m from the tree row to the whole distance of 0 5 2 5 m from the tree row varied from 7 to 16 in 2018 and from 8 to 19 in 2019 this phenomenon implies that the horizontal extension distance for apple roots decreased yearly but the soybean roots showed an increasing trend in the horizontal direction in contrast the vertical proportion of apple roots in all soil layers increased year by year with a proportion of 8 32 in 2018 and 10 40 in 2019 however the vertical proportion of soybean roots in all soil layers decreased yearly with a proportion of 68 92 in 2018 and 60 89 in 2019 this indicated that apple roots showed a downward trend with the increase in intercropping years and the main distribution zone for apple roots changed from 0 40 cm in 2018 to 0 60 cm in 2019 but the vertical extension for soybean roots decreased yearly 3 3 soybean yield and water use soybean yield was highest in w3f2 2093 53 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 2857 69 kg ha 1 in 2019 and lowest in ck in 2018 and 2019 and the variation generally increased at first but then decreased at a given irrigation or fertilization level fig 8a the soybean yield in w3f2 was 82 36 and 97 66 higher than ck in 2018 and in 2019 respectively fig 8a the soybean yields in all treatments increased by 25 85 77 13 in 2019 compared to the yields in 2018 water consumption was highest in w4f2 510 45 mm and lowest in ck 392 34 mm in 2018 but was highest in w4f1 514 21 mm and lowest in ck 323 34 mm in 2019 fig 8b the variation generally increased with the increase in irrigation level this trend coincided with the maximum value for root rld indicating that water consumption increased with the increase in root rld since w3f2 had the highest soybean yield the variation trend for wue was similar to that of soybean yield the w3f2 treatment had the highest wue among all the treatments in 2018 4 48 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 2019 7 36 kg ha 1 mm 1 and significantly increased by 8 00 70 00 and 8 12 64 57 compared to the other treatments in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 8c in 2018 the minimum value for wue was recorded in w1f1 2 64 kg ha 1 mm 1 whereas it was lowest in ck in 2019 4 47 kg ha 1 mm 1 unlike the values for wue the maximum iwue values were recorded in w1f2 in 2018 26 1 kg m 3 and 2019 5 66 kg m 3 and this was probably due to the low irrigation levels which increased by 24 28 1486 06 and 4 69 269 58 compared to the other treatments respectively fig 8d 3 4 relationships between soybean and apple rld and soybean yield or wue in the intercropping system significant positive linear correlations were found between soybean yield and the mean rlds for apple and soybean in 2018 and 2019 fig 9 the soybean yield generally increased with the increase in total rld of the two species for soybeans each 1 cm cm 3 increase in rld led to a yield increase of 1310 6 kg ha 1 in 2018 and an increase of 2056 43 kg ha 1 in 2019 each 1 cm cm 3 increase in apple rld increased the soybean yield by 3113 83 kg ha 1 in 2018 and by 3773 9 kg ha 1 in 2019 this result indicated that more biomass was allocated to aboveground production in 2019 significantly positive linear correlations were also found between the wue of the intercropping system and apple and soybean rld fig 10 the wue of the intercropping system generally increased with total soybean and apple rld for soybeans each 1 cm cm 3 increase in rld increased wue by 2 97 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2018 and by 5 71 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2019 whereas each 1 cm cm 3 increase in apple rld increased wue by 6 58 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2018 and 8 18 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2019 this result indicated that the water absorption efficiency of roots was higher in 2019 than in 2018 as a result water consumption in all treatments in 2019 was slightly lower than in 2018 but the yields increased by 25 85 97 23 3 5 underground interspecific competition intensity index the underground competition between apple and soybean mainly occurred around 0 5 1 75 m from the tree overall the minimum values for uicii occurred 2 5 m away from the tree line and the uicii tended to decrease with the increase in distance from the tree line table 2 which showed that competition was weakest at this point these results coincided with the root distribution because the apple rld decreased as the distance from the tree row increased but the soybean showed the reverse trend compared to ck water and fertilizer coupling under drip irrigation intensified underground competition in the intercropping system under the w1 and ck treatments the uicii was 0 at 2 5 m from the tree line in both years which meant that competition was weakest at this point the mean uicii value generally increased at first but then decreased with increasing fertilization level it also increased with irrigation amount and peaked at the w3 level of irrigation but then slightly decreased table 2 which was in line with the trends for yield and water content indicating that an adequate water supply leads to vigorous root system growth in intercropping systems which will subsequently increase yield additionally irrigation amount had a very significant effect p 0 01 on uicii at 2 5 m from the tree in 2018 and at all four distances in 2019 but fertilization level had no significant effect in either year table 2 this also indicates that the replenishment of irrigation may intensify competition between the two species although yield still increased 4 discussion 4 1 spatial distribution of swc and rld the swc is closely matched with root growth and the distribution of swc could affect root distribution in addition the root morphology could also be affected by available water and nutrients lynch 2013 xia et al 2013 zheng et al 2021 in 2018 2019 under the same irrigation treatment apple and soybean swcs and rlds initially increased and then decreased as the fertilization level increased and reached a maximum in the f2 treatment figs 4 7 this is consistent with a previous study where an appropriate increase in nitrogen fertilizer alleviated water stress and reduced the negative growth effect caused by water deficiency lu et al 2021 we also noticed that excessive irrigation w4 and fertilizer f3 application may inhibit root growth one possible reason could be that poor soil aeration due to excessive irrigation may inhibit root growth another reason could be that irrigation and fertilization have a certain synergistic effect an appropriate nitrogen application may improve the physical and chemical properties of soil improve soil aeration and facilitate the transfer and transportation of nitrogen dissolved in soil water thus speeding up nitrogen fixation and mineralization gan et al 2000 however when the nitrogen application rate and irrigation rate do not match excessive fertilization will improve soil water potential which means that crops may suffer from water stress and their growth rate decreases in addition when swc is too high part of the nitrate nitrogen in the soil will be lost due to leaching resulting in insufficient nitrogen supply to crops among all the treatments w3f2 achieved the highest swc and the highest rld in 2019 which suggested that considerable moisture and appropriate nutrition replenishment conditions can promote root growth however this result was inconsistent with zhou et al 2019 who found soil water content increased with the increase in irrigation amount the main reason may be that drip irrigation improves wue to a greater extent than flood irrigation under the same water supply conditions crops can absorb more water when using drip irrigation but less water when using flood irrigation this may lead to overgrowth of the plant an increase in the mass of its aboveground material and a subsequent reduction in yield horizontally swc initially decreased and then increased as the distance from tree line increased the swcs at 0 5 m from the tree were higher than those at 1 0 m from the tree line fig 4 this phenomenon may due to the fact that the area closer to the tree was completely covered by apple tree crowns which shielded some of the radiation from the sun and thus reduced soil water evaporation and increased the swc zheng et al 2021 the overlapped roots may lead to water and nutrient competition which may explain why the lowest swcs occurred at 1 m from the tree the results suggest that the main competition zone between apple and soybean may around 0 5 1 75 m from the tree line fig 4 in contrast previous studies zheng et al 2021 sun et al 2018b found that the below ground competition between soybean and apple mainly occurred 0 5 1 0 m from the tree row however the horizontal competition area in our study extended to 1 75 m from the tree the reason may be that drip fertigation may change the interspecific relationships and intensify interspecific competition in the intercropping system by altering interspecific water use patterns compared to flood irrigation the vertical water competition area moved downward from 20 cm to 40 cm as the intercropping year increased fig 5 the reason for this may be that the main root distribution of young apple trees gradually moved downward as the number of intercropping years increased resulting in a downward shift of the competition area niche overlap between two species in intercropping systems may lead to interspecific competition sun et al 2018a xu et al 2019 in this study the soybean rld increased as the distance from the tree row increased but apple showed the reverse trend thus the overlap of apple and soybean roots decreased as the distance from tree row increased figs 6 7 which indicated that apple roots could suppress the fine roots of soybean this suppression is a response to intense underground interspecific competition sun et al 2018b we also observed that the vertical variation in swcs was larger in the 0 40 cm layer than in the other soil layers fig 5 which may be due to the fact that the apple and soybean roots were mostly distributed above 40 cm in depth it also led to a decrease in water use from the soil surface to deeper layers whereas the swc after 40 cm tended to be stable this is also due to the diffusion of water into the atmosphere via soil capillaries the apple roots showed a downward trend as the number of intercropping years increased but the horizontal extension decreased year by year in contrast the extension of the soybean root system in a horizontal direction increased each year this result was consistent with a previous study which found that trees in an intercropping system tended to grow downward using soil water and nutrients from deeper soil layers wang et al 2014 this is also a manifestation of the niche separation process 4 2 soybean yield water use and interspecies competition the ability of fine roots to absorb water and nutrients is closely related to the aboveground and underground performance of intercropping systems and is therefore crucial to crop production and wue pavel et al 1998 furthermore a developed root system is always accompanied by vigorous growth of the aboveground part which leads to high yields li et al 2006 we simulated the relationships between rld and soybean yield and wue in the intercropping system under drip fertigation the results indicated that for both apple and soybean rld had significant positive linear correlations with soybean yield fig 9 the reason for these results may be that a wide spread root system can occupy a relatively large soil volume which is conducive to the utilization of crop water and helps meet the needs of crop growth gao et al 2010 in addition the root absorption capacity was stronger in 2019 than in 2018 which led to higher soybean yields the reason for this may be that more biomass was allocated to aboveground production in 2019 than in 2018 furthermore as the intercropping years increased the number of apple and soybean fine roots increased and the fine roots became more competitive these results suggested that the w3 level of irrigation can simultaneously meet the growth of apple and soybean and achieve the highest soybean yields similar results were found between rld and wue fig 10 which means that increasing the number fine roots leads to increases in water and nutrients absorption which is conducive to dry matter accumulation and improves wue wang and smith 2004 therefore under drip fertigation the w3 level of irrigation was the optimal irrigation amount in the apple soybean intercropping system water consumption in 2018 and 2019 increased with the increase in irrigation level previous studies yavuz et al 2015 al shareef et al 2018 abdelkhalik et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 reported that higher irrigation water levels produced higher crop yields and lower irrigation levels produced higher iwues whereas in this study the highest irrigation level did not produce the maximum recorded yield but the highest water consumption and the lowest level of irrigation led to the highest iwue the reason for this phenomenon may be that under drip fertigation wue in the intercropping system improved which suggests that the amount of irrigation cannot be the basis for measuring the water consumption of a multi species system in summary water consumption is an important criterion when attempting to improve wue and the economic benefits of an intercropping system under drip fertigation root spatial distribution is crucial for interspecific interactions bardgett et al 2014 duan et al 2017 the uicii increased with the increase in irrigation amount and peaked at the w3 level of irrigation table 2 the interspecific interactions between apple and soybean became more intense at high irrigation levels however the high yield was a result of the interspecific interactions zhou et al 2019 found that interspecific interactions decreased maize yields in an alley cropping system but under drip fertigation the decrease in crop yield caused by interspecific competition was mitigated which shows that drip fertigation is an effective way to alleviate any negative interspecific effects in summary 80 fc irrigation combined with 92 kg ha 1 fertilization can improve the yield and wue of the apple soybean drip fertigation system on the loess plateau of western shanxi province 5 conclusion the results from the drip fertigation regimes applied to an intercropping system illustrated that drip fertigation can significantly enhance the swcs rlds and crop yields of the intercropping system soil water capacity had a u shape in a horizontal direction and the vertical water competition area moved downward as the intercropping year increased the apple and soybean root distributions showed that the main competitive zone between the two species was about 0 5 1 75 m away from the apple tree the vertical direction of the apple roots extended downward and the interspecific competition intensified as the intercropping years increased however drip fertigation can mitigate the negative effects of the intense interspecific competition and produce yearly increases in yield under drip fertigation excessive irrigation amounts can lead the overgrowth of plants and an increase in the mass of its aboveground material which reduces yield the soybean yield and wue of the w3f2 treatment were the highest among all the treatments and water consumption is an important criterion when evaluating wue and yield accordingly our results suggest that a combination of 80 fc maximum irrigation with 92 kg ha 1 fertilization will lead to the greatest improvements in yield and wue in apple soybean under drip fertigation systems on the loess plateau and will alleviate interspecific competition declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9491,the irrational utilization of water resources restricts the sustainable development of tree crop intercropping in the loess region drip fertigation was applied for two years in an intercropping system to save water resources and improve water use efficiency wue and crop yield the spatial distribution of soil water plant roots and water use pattern were investigated in a drip fertigated intercropping system a two factor randomized block design was adopted four irrigation levels 60 w1 70 w2 80 w3 and 90 w4 of field capacity fc together with three nitrogen fertilization treatments 59 40 f1 92 00 f2 and 124 32 kg ha 1 f3 were set up with a blank control ck which was rain fed with base fertilizer applied before sowing the soil water content swc distribution had a u shape in the horizontal direction and the vertical water competition area moved downward as the intercropping year increased the soybean root length density rld increased as the distance from the tree row increased but apple showed the reverse trend the overlap between apple and soybean roots generally decreased as the distance from the tree row increased but the vertical overlap of roots extended from 0 40 cm 2018 to 0 60 cm 2019 the interspecific competition increased with the increase in intercropping years resulting in a downward shift of the competition area water consumption in 2018 and 2019 increased as the irrigation level rose the swc rld soybean yield and wue of w3f2 were the highest among the treatments excessive irrigation can lead to vigorous vegetative growth but reduced yields the negative effects of intense interspecific competition were relieved under drip fertigation the results suggested that drip irrigation at 80 fc combined with 92 kg ha 1 n fertilization can improve the yield and wue of the apple soybean system on the loess plateau keywords agroforestry drip fertigation soil water content root distribution 1 introduction agroforestry is a traditional planting pattern widely used on the loess plateau yun et al 2012 gao et al 2013 2016 land space conflicts and soil erosion can be solved through agroforestry which also brings increased economic benefits lal 1989 banda et al 1994 the main agroforestry system on the loess plateau is tree crop intercropping sun et al 2018b xu et al 2019 however the uneven annual precipitation in the region means that water supplies may not meet crop growth demand during critical growth periods in addition the low fertility of the topsoil on the loess plateau may not guarantee the nutrient requirements for the different plants involved in the intercropping system the heterogeneous nature of the water and nutrient supplies is also a result of interspecific interactions among intercropping species the rain fed model commonly used by local farmers cannot meet the water and fertilizer requirements of intercropping systems therefore the local intercropping fields require additional water and fertilizer supplements recently many studies gao et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 have investigated water and fertilizer supply in intercropping systems on the loess plateau the results showed that water and fertilizer supplement significantly boosted grain yield and increased the economic benefits however the water and fertilizer replenishment methods were relatively extensive and were dominated by flood irrigation which can cause surface runoff environmental pollution through fertilizer leaching waste water resources lead to inefficient water and fertilizer use and potentially intensify underground interspecific competition drury et al 1996 bergeron et al 2011 therefore more efficient irrigation methods need to be introduced into the intercropping system drip fertigation is an efficient water and fertilizer integration supply technology that can effectively reduce water evaporation and the ineffective consumption of water and fertilizer by transporting them directly to the crop roots hou et al 2010 yahgi et al 2013 perdoná et al 2015 badr and abuarab 2013 in addition the amount of water and fertilizer applied by drip fertigation can be matched to the amount required by the plant to maximize water and fertilizer use efficiency which reduces fertilizer leaching and water wastage gardenas et al 2005 lu et al 2021 therefore the optimal application of water and fertilizer under drip fertigation may be different from that under flood irrigation in intercropping systems previous studies on water and fertilizer regulation under drip irrigation mostly focused on monoculture crops fanish et al 2011 chen et al 2020 yan et al 2021 however drip fertigation in a tree based intercropping system has rarely studied the water infiltration characteristics under drip fertigation may mean that after applying drip fertigation to the intercropping system the interspecific interactions among trees and crops may change the root distribution and alter the water consumption patterns of the system li et al 2017 therefore it is essential to formulate new irrigation and fertilization regimes compared with flood irrigation drip fertigation changes the water and fertilizer input patterns which simultaneously change the distribution of soil water and nutrients a previous study found that drip irrigation applied to a tomato corn intercropping system could significantly change the spatial distributions of soil water and root growth the redistribution of water and fertilizer will certainly affect the root distribution which is important because the morphology distribution of tree and crop roots determines the competitive ability of individuals in the intercropping system to obtain underground resources george et al 1996 and is also perceived to be the primary factor determining the degree of underground competition between species sun et al 2018a many studies have investigated the root distribution when an intercropping system is used west and griffith 1992 found in a wheat and poplar intercropping system that irrigation could promote root growth and wu et al 2017 showed that the application of nitrogen fertilizer can increase the root length density of maize in an intercropping system zhang et al 2013 found that interspecific competition reduces root length density rld however the distribution characteristics of soil water and roots in a drip fertigation tree based intercropping system are still unclear water directly affects root growth and root distribution affects water use patterns and interspecific relationships in intercropping systems therefore when attempting to create an optimal irrigation and fertilization regime it is essential to analyze the interspecific relationships based on soil water and tree crop roots so as to understand the water use patterns in an intercropping system under drip fertigation in our study we applied drip fertigation to an apple soybean intercropping system in a two year field trial to investigate 1 the soil water content swc and the rld spatial distributions for apple trees and soybean under different drip irrigation and fertilizer regimes and 2 the effects their distribution characteristics have on the crop yield and water use patterns 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study area was located in ji county shanxi province china 36 01 n 110 45 e which is a typical gully area on

experimental design the experiment was carried out between april and october in the 2018 and 2019 seasons the apple soybean intercropping system was selected as the research object within the apple quality demonstration park in zhongduo township ji county shanxi province china the apple trees short branched red fuji were planted in 2014 and fruit setting had not begun the row spacing of the trees was 4 m 5 m and with an east west orientation and the average height of the trees is 3 7 m with a diameter at breast height of 6 5 cm the soybean jindou 35 was sown on the 19th of april in 2018 and the 20th of april in 2019 the soybean planting rows were 1 m away from the trees and the spacing was 0 3 m 0 5 m fig 2 a two factor randomized block design was adopted a total of four irrigation levels and three fertilization levels were applied there was also a blank control ck treatment which was rain fed with base fertilizer applied only before sowing each treatment was repeated three times which made a total of 39 test plots the four irrigation upper limits achieved after irrigation were set according to the average monthly water consumption of the plants drip irrigation was carried out during the key growth periods for soybeans the average water content in the 0 60 cm soil layer of the four irrigation treatments was 60 w1 70 w2 80 w3 and 90 w4 of field capacity fc the amount of irrigation in each growth period is shown in table 1 the designed flow rate of the drip irrigation head was 1 38 l h 1 the distance between drip heads was 300 mm and the distance between drip belt was 50 cm the pipe provided water directly through a pump a pressure gauge was installed at the front of the pipe to monitor the water pressure in the pipe and the pressure was controlled to 0 1 mpa by adjusting the gate valves of each branch pipe phosphate fertilizer and potassium fertilizer were applied as base fertilizer in accordance with local experience before sowing p2o5 168 8 kg ha 1 k2o 168 8 kg ha 1 the amount of fertilizer applied was determined by comprehensively considering the fertilizer needs of apples and soybeans the three nitrogen fertilizer application levels were set according to the fertilizer requirements of the two crops and local experience the total fertilizer application amounts during the growth period were 59 40 f1 92 00 f2 and 124 32 kg ha 1 f3 fertilizer application was carried out for three times over the growth period from seedling stage to branch stage pod setting stage and grain filling stage and drip fertilization was applied along with the irrigation water field experiment photographs are shown in fig 3 2 3 sampling and measurement methods 2 3 1 soil water measurements the soil water content in the 0 60 cm layer divided into six 10 cm layers in the field was monitored using time domain reflectometry probes trime pico iph imko ettlingen germany every 7 days monitoring points were set at 0 5 1 0 1 75 and 2 5 m away from the tree rows fig 2 additional measurements were carried out after irrigation and rainfall and the drying method was adopted for correction 2 3 2 calculation of the irrigation amount the formula for calculating irrigation amount is as follows dou et al 2022 1 m 10γh θ w θ 0 where m is irrigation water amount mm γ is soil bulk density of the target soil layer h is depth of the target soil layer θ w is the target gravimetric water content of the soil and θ 0 is the measured gravimetric water content of the soil before irrigation 2 3 3 root measurements apple tree and soybean roots were sampled using a root auger 10 cm diameter at the filling stage the sampling points were the same as those for swc but were divided into 20 cm layers fig 2 live roots were carefully selected and repeatedly washed in clear water using a 2 mm screen the soil attached to the root surface was washed and the appearance characteristics of soybean and apple roots were carefully distinguished the winrhizo root scanning system ver 2003b reagent instruments inc quebec canada was used to analyze the root length density and other indexes 2 3 4 underground interspecific competition intensity index uicii the intensity of competition for water and nutrients between the apple and soybean roots was quantified by calculating the degree of overlap between the niches occupied by the two species levins 1968 the formula for uicii 0 uicii 1 is as follows pianka 1973 2 uicii i 1 n p ai p si i 1 n p ai 2 i 1 n p si 2 where n is the number of soil layers and p ai and p si are the proportions of apple and soybean fine roots respectively in the i th soil layer in relation to all the layers 0 60 cm 2 3 5 growth characteristics the height of soybean at filling was measured using a tape and the leaf area index was obtained by measuring the leaf area over a unit area of land 2 3 6 water consumption water consumption et by soybean during each growth period in the intercropping system was calculated using the water balance principle as follows zheng et al 2021 3 et 1 2 i p u r f where et1 2 is the et mm in each growth period i is the irrigation amount mm p is the effective precipitation mm during the soybean growth period u is the amount of groundwater recharge mm r is surface runoff f is the amount of deep water leakage mm and δw is the change in soil water storage at the beginning and end of each stage in this test the drip irrigation condition was unsaturated infiltration the terrain was flat and there was no surface runoff when the groundwater depth is below 2 5 m the groundwater recharge is 0 drip irrigation does not consider the amount of deep leakage which means that deep leakage is 0 therefore the surface runoff r the groundwater recharge u and the deep seepage f can be ignored 2 3 7 yield and water use yield kg ha 1 of soybean was determined as the grain yield gy in each plot at the maturing stage water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 in the intercropping system was the ratio of the yield in the soybean planting area to water consumption 4 wue gy et where gy kg ha 1 is the grain yield of soybean and et is the water consumption mm of the intercropping system irrigation water use efficiency iwue kg m 3 was the ratio of the gy to the amount of irrigation per unit area of intercropped soybean and was calculated as follows 5 iwue gy i where gy is the grain yield of soybean kg ha 1 and i is the irrigation amount m3 ha 1 2 4 data analysis an analysis of variance was conducted using spss ver 20 0 spss corp chicago il usa a least significant difference test

spatial distribution of soil water between 2018 and 2019 mean swc initially deceased and then increased as distance from the tree row increased fig 4 horizontally swc had a u shape that peaked at 2 5 m from the tree row and was lowest at 1 m from the tree row fig 4 this suggested that the competition area between apple and soybean may occur at 0 5 1 75 m from the tree row and that 1 m from the tree row is the strongest competitive area for water among all treatments the maximum values generally occurred in w4f2 in 2018 and w3f2 in 2019 and the two minimum values occurred in ck fig 4 the maxima for swc were 17 60 in 2018 and 13 56 in 2019 while the minima were 13 49 in 2018 and 10 87 in 2019 between 2018 and 2019 at the same irrigation level the swcs initially increased and then decreased as the fertilization level rose the swcs reached their maximum under the f2 treatment at the same fertilization level the swcs increased as the irrigation level rose the maximum swcs occurred in the w4 group between 2018 and 2019 the swcs under drip water and fertilizer regulation were 1 7 18 2 higher than those of ck the mean swcs in the 20 40 cm soil layer in 2019 changed dramatically compared to those in 2018 fig 5 this suggested that the vertical water competition area moved downward from 20 cm to 40 cm as the number of intercropping years increased there was also a smooth trend after 40 cm which was more obvious in 2019 than in 2018 fig 5 this implies that the competition for water in intercropping systems in the vertical direction weakened after 40 cm among all the influence factors the distance to the tree line had a significant effect on mean swc p 0 05 in 2018 but no significant effect in 2019 fig 4 meanwhile the irrigation amount had a significant effect on mean swc p 0 05 in the intercropping system during 2018 and a very significant effect p 0 01 in 2019 fig 4 the fertilization and irrigation fertilization interaction had very significant effects on mean swc p 0 01 in both two years fig 4 the results showed that the swc distribution was significantly influenced by drip water and fertilizer application 3 2 spatial distribution of apple and soybean rld the rld distributions for soybean and apple are shown in figs 6 7 in 2018 and 2019 soybean rld was greater than that of apple for each treatment except ck in both years furthermore the total apple rld under the w3f2 treatment was highest and ck was lowest in both two years compared to ck the total apple rld of the other treatments increased by 69 25 658 18 horizontally the apple rld decreased as the distance from the tree row increased but soybean showed the opposite trend figs 6 7 the apple and soybean roots overlapped between 0 5 m and 1 75 m from the tree row and the overlapped distance increased as the irrigation level increased vertically the apple and soybean rlds decreased as the soil depth increased and the roots of the two species overlapped in the 0 40 cm soil zone in 2018 and the 0 60 cm zone in 2019 figs 6 7 under the same fertilization treatment the total rlds for apple and soybean roots both increased with the increase in irrigation level meanwhile the rlds in the w3 treatment increased by 2 76 125 97 compared to the other irrigation groups under the same irrigation treatment the apple and soybean rlds both increased at first and then decreased with the increase in fertilization level and the rlds in the f2 treatment increased by 16 20 20 19 compared to the other fertilization treatments among all the treatments the ratio of apple roots at 2 5 m distance from the tree row to the whole 0 5 2 5 m distance from the tree row varied from 0 to 10 in 2018 and from 0 to 8 in 2019 and the ratio of soybean roots at 0 5 m from the tree row to the whole distance of 0 5 2 5 m from the tree row varied from 7 to 16 in 2018 and from 8 to 19 in 2019 this phenomenon implies that the horizontal extension distance for apple roots decreased yearly but the soybean roots showed an increasing trend in the horizontal direction in contrast the vertical proportion of apple roots in all soil layers increased year by year with a proportion of 8 32 in 2018 and 10 40 in 2019 however the vertical proportion of soybean roots in all soil layers decreased yearly with a proportion of 68 92 in 2018 and 60 89 in 2019 this indicated that apple roots showed a downward trend with the increase in intercropping years and the main distribution zone for apple roots changed from 0 40 cm in 2018 to 0 60 cm in 2019 but the vertical extension for soybean roots decreased yearly 3 3 soybean yield and water use soybean yield was highest in w3f2 2093 53 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 2857 69 kg ha 1 in 2019 and lowest in ck in 2018 and 2019 and the variation generally increased at first but then decreased at a given irrigation or fertilization level fig 8a the soybean yield in w3f2 was 82 36 and 97 66 higher than ck in 2018 and in 2019 respectively fig 8a the soybean yields in all treatments increased by 25 85 77 13 in 2019 compared to the yields in 2018 water consumption was highest in w4f2 510 45 mm and lowest in ck 392 34 mm in 2018 but was highest in w4f1 514 21 mm and lowest in ck 323 34 mm in 2019 fig 8b the variation generally increased with the increase in irrigation level this trend coincided with the maximum value for root rld indicating that water consumption increased with the increase in root rld since w3f2 had the highest soybean yield the variation trend for wue was similar to that of soybean yield the w3f2 treatment had the highest wue among all the treatments in 2018 4 48 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 2019 7 36 kg ha 1 mm 1 and significantly increased by 8 00 70 00 and 8 12 64 57 compared to the other treatments in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 8c in 2018 the minimum value for wue was recorded in w1f1 2 64 kg ha 1 mm 1 whereas it was lowest in ck in 2019 4 47 kg ha 1 mm 1 unlike the values for wue the maximum iwue values were recorded in w1f2 in 2018 26 1 kg m 3 and 2019 5 66 kg m 3 and this was probably due to the low irrigation levels which increased by 24 28 1486 06 and 4 69 269 58 compared to the other treatments respectively fig 8d 3 4 relationships between soybean and apple rld and soybean yield or wue in the intercropping system significant positive linear correlations were found between soybean yield and the mean rlds for apple and soybean in 2018 and 2019 fig 9 the soybean yield generally increased with the increase in total rld of the two species for soybeans each 1 cm cm 3 increase in rld led to a yield increase of 1310 6 kg ha 1 in 2018 and an increase of 2056 43 kg ha 1 in 2019 each 1 cm cm 3 increase in apple rld increased the soybean yield by 3113 83 kg ha 1 in 2018 and by 3773 9 kg ha 1 in 2019 this result indicated that more biomass was allocated to aboveground production in 2019 significantly positive linear correlations were also found between the wue of the intercropping system and apple and soybean rld fig 10 the wue of the intercropping system generally increased with total soybean and apple rld for soybeans each 1 cm cm 3 increase in rld increased wue by 2 97 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2018 and by 5 71 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2019 whereas each 1 cm cm 3 increase in apple rld increased wue by 6 58 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2018 and 8 18 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2019 this result indicated that the water absorption efficiency of roots was higher in 2019 than in 2018 as a result water consumption in all treatments in 2019 was slightly lower than in 2018 but the yields increased by 25 85 97 23 3 5 underground interspecific competition intensity index the underground competition between apple and soybean mainly occurred around 0 5 1 75 m from the tree overall the minimum values for uicii occurred 2 5 m away from the tree line and the uicii tended to decrease with the increase in distance from the tree line table 2 which showed that competition was weakest at this point these results coincided with the root distribution because the apple rld decreased as the distance from the tree row increased but the soybean showed the reverse trend compared to ck water and fertilizer coupling under drip irrigation intensified underground competition in the intercropping system under the w1 and ck treatments the uicii was 0 at 2 5 m from the tree line in both years which meant that competition was weakest at this point the mean uicii value generally increased at first but then decreased with increasing fertilization level it also increased with irrigation amount and peaked at the w3 level of irrigation but then slightly decreased table 2 which was in line with the trends for yield and water content indicating that an adequate water supply leads to vigorous root system growth in intercropping systems which will subsequently increase yield additionally irrigation amount had a very significant effect p 0 01 on uicii at 2 5 m from the tree in 2018 and at all four distances in 2019 but fertilization level had no significant effect in either year table 2 this also indicates that the replenishment of irrigation may intensify competition between the two species although yield still increased 4 discussion 4 1 spatial distribution of swc and rld the swc is closely matched with root growth and the distribution of swc could affect root distribution in addition the root morphology could also be affected by available water and nutrients lynch 2013 xia et al 2013 zheng et al 2021 in 2018 2019 under the same irrigation treatment apple and soybean swcs and rlds initially increased and then decreased as the fertilization level increased and reached a maximum in the f2 treatment figs 4 7 this is consistent with a previous study where an appropriate increase in nitrogen fertilizer alleviated water stress and reduced the negative growth effect caused by water deficiency lu et al 2021 we also noticed that excessive irrigation w4 and fertilizer f3 application may inhibit root growth one possible reason could be that poor soil aeration due to excessive irrigation may inhibit root growth another reason could be that irrigation and fertilization have a certain synergistic effect an appropriate nitrogen application may improve the physical and chemical properties of soil improve soil aeration and facilitate the transfer and transportation of nitrogen dissolved in soil water thus speeding up nitrogen fixation and mineralization gan et al 2000 however when the nitrogen application rate and irrigation rate do not match excessive fertilization will improve soil water potential which means that crops may suffer from water stress and their growth rate decreases in addition when swc is too high part of the nitrate nitrogen in the soil will be lost due to leaching resulting in insufficient nitrogen supply to crops among all the treatments w3f2 achieved the highest swc and the highest rld in 2019 which suggested that considerable moisture and appropriate nutrition replenishment conditions can promote root growth however this result was inconsistent with zhou et al 2019 who found soil water content increased with the increase in irrigation amount the main reason may be that drip irrigation improves wue to a greater extent than flood irrigation under the same water supply conditions crops can absorb more water when using drip irrigation but less water when using flood irrigation this may lead to overgrowth of the plant an increase in the mass of its aboveground material and a subsequent reduction in yield horizontally swc initially decreased and then increased as the distance from tree line increased the swcs at 0 5 m from the tree were higher than those at 1 0 m from the tree line fig 4 this phenomenon may due to the fact that the area closer to the tree was completely covered by apple tree crowns which shielded some of the radiation from the sun and thus reduced soil water evaporation and increased the swc zheng et al 2021 the overlapped roots may lead to water and nutrient competition which may explain why the lowest swcs occurred at 1 m from the tree the results suggest that the main competition zone between apple and soybean may around 0 5 1 75 m from the tree line fig 4 in contrast previous studies zheng et al 2021 sun et al 2018b found that the below ground competition between soybean and apple mainly occurred 0 5 1 0 m from the tree row however the horizontal competition area in our study extended to 1 75 m from the tree the reason may be that drip fertigation may change the interspecific relationships and intensify interspecific competition in the intercropping system by altering interspecific water use patterns compared to flood irrigation the vertical water competition area moved downward from 20 cm to 40 cm as the intercropping year increased fig 5 the reason for this may be that the main root distribution of young apple trees gradually moved downward as the number of intercropping years increased resulting in a downward shift of the competition area niche overlap between two species in intercropping systems may lead to interspecific competition sun et al 2018a xu et al 2019 in this study the soybean rld increased as the distance from the tree row increased but apple showed the reverse trend thus the overlap of apple and soybean roots decreased as the distance from tree row increased figs 6 7 which indicated that apple roots could suppress the fine roots of soybean this suppression is a response to intense underground interspecific competition sun et al 2018b we also observed that the vertical variation in swcs was larger in the 0 40 cm layer than in the other soil layers fig 5 which may be due to the fact that the apple and soybean roots were mostly distributed above 40 cm in depth it also led to a decrease in water use from the soil surface to deeper layers whereas the swc after 40 cm tended to be stable this is also due to the diffusion of water into the atmosphere via soil capillaries the apple roots showed a downward trend as the number of intercropping years increased but the horizontal extension decreased year by year in contrast the extension of the soybean root system in a horizontal direction increased each year this result was consistent with a previous study which found that trees in an intercropping system tended to grow downward using soil water and nutrients from deeper soil layers wang et al 2014 this is also a manifestation of the niche separation process 4 2 soybean yield water use and interspecies competition the ability of fine roots to absorb water and nutrients is closely related to the aboveground and underground performance of intercropping systems and is therefore crucial to crop production and wue pavel et al 1998 furthermore a developed root system is always accompanied by vigorous growth of the aboveground part which leads to high yields li et al 2006 we simulated the relationships between rld and soybean yield and wue in the intercropping system under drip fertigation the results indicated that for both apple and soybean rld had significant positive linear correlations with soybean yield fig 9 the reason for these results may be that a wide spread root system can occupy a relatively large soil volume which is conducive to the utilization of crop water and helps meet the needs of crop growth gao et al 2010 in addition the root absorption capacity was stronger in 2019 than in 2018 which led to higher soybean yields the reason for this may be that more biomass was allocated to aboveground production in 2019 than in 2018 furthermore as the intercropping years increased the number of apple and soybean fine roots increased and the fine roots became more competitive these results suggested that the w3 level of irrigation can simultaneously meet the growth of apple and soybean and achieve the highest soybean yields similar results were found between rld and wue fig 10 which means that increasing the number fine roots leads to increases in water and nutrients absorption which is conducive to dry matter accumulation and improves wue wang and smith 2004 therefore under drip fertigation the w3 level of irrigation was the optimal irrigation amount in the apple soybean intercropping system water consumption in 2018 and 2019 increased with the increase in irrigation level previous studies yavuz et al 2015 al shareef et al 2018 abdelkhalik et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 reported that higher irrigation water levels produced higher crop yields and lower irrigation levels produced higher iwues whereas in this study the highest irrigation level did not produce the maximum recorded yield but the highest water consumption and the lowest level of irrigation led to the highest iwue the reason for this phenomenon may be that under drip fertigation wue in the intercropping system improved which suggests that the amount of irrigation cannot be the basis for measuring the water consumption of a multi species system in summary water consumption is an important criterion when attempting to improve wue and the economic benefits of an intercropping system under drip fertigation root spatial distribution is crucial for interspecific interactions bardgett et al 2014 duan et al 2017 the uicii increased with the increase in irrigation amount and peaked at the w3 level of irrigation table 2 the interspecific interactions between apple and soybean became more intense at high irrigation levels however the high yield was a result of the interspecific interactions zhou et al 2019 found that interspecific interactions decreased maize yields in an alley cropping system but under drip fertigation the decrease in crop yield caused by interspecific competition was mitigated which shows that drip fertigation is an effective way to alleviate any negative interspecific effects in summary 80 fc irrigation combined with 92 kg ha 1 fertilization can improve the yield and wue of the apple soybean drip fertigation system on the loess plateau of western shanxi province 5 conclusion the results from the drip fertigation regimes applied to an intercropping system illustrated that drip fertigation can significantly enhance the swcs rlds and crop yields of the intercropping system soil water capacity had a u shape in a horizontal direction and the vertical water competition area moved downward as the intercropping year increased the apple and soybean root distributions showed that the main competitive zone between the two species was about 0 5 1 75 m away from the apple tree the vertical direction of the apple roots extended downward and the interspecific competition intensified as the intercropping years increased however drip fertigation can mitigate the negative effects of the intense interspecific competition and produce yearly increases in yield under drip fertigation excessive irrigation amounts can lead the overgrowth of plants and an increase in the mass of its aboveground material which reduces yield the soybean yield and wue of the w3f2 treatment were the highest among all the treatments and water consumption is an important criterion when evaluating wue and yield accordingly our results suggest that a combination of 80 fc maximum irrigation with 92 kg ha 1 fertilization will lead to the greatest improvements in yield and wue in apple soybean under drip fertigation systems on the loess plateau and will alleviate interspecific competition declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9492,producing more food for a growing population requires sustainable crop intensification and diversification particularly in high potential areas such as the seasonal floodplain wetlands of sub saharan africa ssa with emerging water shortages and concerns for conserving these multi functional wetlands a further expansion of the cropland area must be avoided as it would entail increased use of blue water for irrigation and infringe on valuable protected areas we advocate an efficient use of the prevailing green water on the existing cropland areas where small scale farmers grow a single crop of rainfed lowland rice during the wet season however soil moisture at the onset of the rains pre rice niche and residual soil moisture after rice harvest post rice niche may suffice to cultivate short cycled crops we developed a methodological approach to analyze the potential for green water cultivation in the pre and post rice niches in the kilombero valley floodplain in tanzania as a representative case for seasonal floodplain wetlands in ssa the three step approach used open access remote sensing datasets to i extract cropland areas ii analyze soil moisture conditions using evaporative stress indices to identify the pre and post rice niches and iii quantify the green water availability in the identified niches through actual evapotranspiration aet we identified distinct patterns of green water being available both before and after the rice growing period based on the analyses of evaporative stress indices the pre rice niche tends to be longer 70 days with average aet of 20 40 mm 10 day but also more variable inter annual variability 30 than the post rice niche 65 days with average aet of 10 30 mm 10 day inter annual variability 15 these findings show the large potential for cultivating short cycled crops beyond the rice growing period such as green manure vegetables maize and forage legumes by shifting a portion of the nonproductive aet flows i e soil evaporation to productive flows in form of crop transpiration a cropland area of 1452 to 1637 km2 53 60 of the total cropland area identified of 2730 km2 could be cultivated using available green water in the dry season which shows the significance of such change for food security livelihoods and resilience of the agricultural community in kilombero a wider application of the developed

conversion of wetlands to sites of production potentially leads to their ultimate destruction beuel et al 2016 a trend that is likely to be exacerbated by climate change mitchell 2013 this paper focuses on seasonal wetlands located within relatively large floodplains with seasonal soil submergence by riverbank overflowing and to a lesser extent by lateral runoff from adjacent slopes sakané et al 2011 such floodplain wetlands cover an estimated area of 692 631 km2 and are thus an enormous and largely untapped resource for future food production rebelo et al 2010 in these wetlands farmers typically grow one single crop of rainfed lowland rice during the wet rainy season grisp 2013 before and after the wet season farming activities are limited by water availability and variability and cropland areas are often left to fallow for the rest of the year balasubramanian et al 2007 whenever affordable farmers strive to adopt irrigation by using blue water resources water in rivers lakes and aquifers thus ensuring a year round water supply for continuous crop cultivation however irrigation is often restricted by physical and economic realities in ssa e g long distances between fields and rivers rockström and falkenmark 2015 high initial investments costs inocencio et al 2007 and the lack of access to appropriate irrigation technologies and improved agricultural inputs as well as to reliable markets and research support nakawuka et al 2018 contributing to the typical failure of large irrigation projects to deliver promised benefits higginbottom et al 2021 nevertheless there are numerous other opportunities to maintain the soil moisture at productive levels by increasing i water storage e g through rainwater harvesting technologies biazin et al 2012 and ii irrigation technologies such as motor pumps communal river diversion and small reservoirs xie et al 2014 precipitation is the source of freshwater which can take two forms blue water or green water falkenmark and rockström 2006 herein green water refers to the plant available water stored in the root zone as a result of natural processes without human intervention i e precipitation natural drainage and floodwater karimi et al 2013 while blue water solutions are primarily needed for urban industrial and energy developments and require large investments better management of the more decentralized highly adaptable and low capital demanding green water solutions can immensely contribute to improving rainfed agricultural systems and thereby food security in ssa keys and falkenmark 2018 however little is known about green water availability and variability and hence its potential for diversifying and intensifying the existing crop portfolio in floodplain wetlands in ssa this research analyzes opportunities for sustainably intensifying and diversifying crop production systems in the kilombero valley floodplain in tanzania hereafter referred to as kilombero which is representative for many other seasonal floodplain wetlands in ssa rebelo et al 2010 the conversion of floodplain wetlands into cropland reportedly altered the water balance components on the sub basin scale näschen et al 2018 and increased the frequency durations severity and intensity of drought events in kilombero wambura and dietrich 2020 with water availability and variability widely limiting crop production in kilombero farmers may adapt their cropping calendars and establish community based irrigation schemes only about 1 of the total rice area is irrigated höllermann et al 2021 thus cropping strategies should be designed to adapt to the complex dynamic of seasonal water availability we explored the potential of using green water stored in the soil profile for cultivating additional crops before the rice establishment pre rice niche and after the rice harvest post rice niche the former practice exploits early season rainfall events that do not suffice for soil flooding and puddling and the transplanting of rice to grow short cycled green manure and food crops senthilkumar et al 2018 the latter practice is known as flood recession cropping where residual soil moisture is used for growing crops after the harvest of rice when seasonal inundation recedes sidibe et al 2016 the durations and locations of these cropping niches depend to a large extent on the onset intensity and duration of the early season rains pre rice niche and the amount and duration of available residual soil moisture post rice niche to our knowledge no studies are available assessing this green water availability and its variability in seasonal floodplain wetlands in ssa thus we investigated the spatial temporal availability and variability of green water beyond the wet season in view of designing and targeting crop diversification and intensification strategies with a special focus on the potential cropping niches before and after wetland rice cultivation numerous relative and absolute indicators for the availability of green water exist schyns et al 2015 in absolute terms green water availability is defined as the available soil moisture for vapor flows and is quantified by means of the actual evapotranspiration aet rockström et al 2009 while in relative terms green water availability is expressed by soil moisture conditions at a given location relative to a normal average condition schyns et al 2015 in this paper aet refers to the total vapor flux to the atmosphere as evaporation from interception transpiration and soil evaporation in situ point based measurements of aet and soil moisture are scarce across ssa and where available cannot fully explain the spatial variation over larger areas or the temporal variation between seasons and years in contrast to the highly data demanding hydrological models zhao et al 2013 satellite based observations commonly referred to as remote sensing gridded products provide derived information on aet and soil moisture at various spatial and temporal scales however the currently operationalized soil moisture products with long temporal coverage have rather coarse spatial resolutions of 25 50 km peng et al 2021 limiting their applicability to smaller scales of cropland areas such as smallholder rice farms moreover the performance quality of different aet products varies by regions weerasinghe et al 2020 thus there is a need for alternative approaches for estimating soil moisture conditions and green water availability at high spatial and temporal resolutions our overarching goal was to develop a remote sensing approach to analyze patterns of green water availability and to identify the potential for dry season cultivation in seasonal floodplain wetlands using kilombero as a case study our methodological approach includes three objectives i delineation of cropland areas ii analyzing the dynamics of intra annual soil moisture conditions across extracted cropland areas for a long time series and thereby identifying the pre and post rice niches and iii quantifying and mapping aet in cropland areas with particular focus on the two so far unexploited cropping niches this approach serves as a starting point towards exploring possible strategies for dry season cultivation in floodplain wetlands in and beyond kilombero based on extensive spatial and temporal coverage provided by relevant remote sensing datasets the outputs of these objectives can advance our understanding of the prospects of realizing the agricultural potential improving the livelihoods of farming communities and ultimately for achieving multiple sustainable development goals in seasonal floodplain wetlands of ssa 2 materials and methods 2 1 kilombero wetland the kilombero basin is located in south central tanzania covering about 40 000 km2 and contributing 62 of the annual runoff of the rufiji river basin wilson et al 2017 fig 1a the basin has a tropical climate with distinct dry june october short november january and long march may rainy seasons koutsouris et al 2016 the monthly average temperatures precipitation and solar radiation reflecting the seasonality in the basin are presented in fig 1b covering an area of approx 8000 km2 kilombero floodplain is the largest lowland seasonal floodplain wetland in east africa wilson et al 2017 the unique ecological features and biodiversity have led to designating it as a ramsar site in 2002 mombo et al 2011 the ecosystem services supported by kilombero floodplain and in particular the provisioning services koko et al 2020 are vital to the livelihoods of local communities rebelo et al 2010 rainfed lowland rice cultivation dominates the local activities during the rainy season gebrekidan et al 2020 making kilombero one of the largest rice growing areas in east africa that supplies 9 of tanzania s national rice production kato 2007 as a result of the intensifying human interventions driven by population growth and the growing market demand and price incentives for agricultural products an increasing trend of converting natural vegetative land covers into rice cropland was observed in kilombero primarily to increase rice crop production and thus improving livelihoods kirimi et al 2018 msofe et al 2019 munishi and jewitt 2019 thonfeld et al 2020a 2020b such land cover change represents a threat to the biodiversity seki et al 2018 and biophysical system of kilombero muro et al 2018 and can alter the inflow of several tributaries and the maintenance of environmental flow wilson et al 2017 which are essential to sustain the ecosystem and the human livelihoods that are dependent on these ecosystems leemhuis et al 2017 yet there is an enormous and largely untapped potential to increase rice production by closing the yield gaps on existing croplands in kilombero without expanding the cropped area kwesiga et al 2020a 2 2 methodological approach we investigated the potential of exploiting available green water resources to support dry season crop cultivation fig 2 the proposed remote sensing based approach comprises three steps i evaluating multiple land cover datasets and identifying a reliable dataset to delineate the extent of croplands in kilombero ii estimating soil moisture stress and its variability by using the ratio of actual aet to potential evapotranspiration pet iii quantifying the green water availability by means of aet the first step served as a basis for subsequent analyses because of the commonly known disparities among land cover datasets in detecting the cropland extent pérez hoyos et al 2017 the second step assumes that aet under actual soil moisture conditions can reach an upper limit of pet the latter represents the atmospheric evaporative demand when the soil water supply is unlimited xiang et al 2020 this step is aimed at detecting the inter and intra annual soil moisture stress for long time series in view of identifying the spatial and temporal boundaries of potential pre and post rice cropping niches in addition calculating the inter annual variability of soil moisture stress permitted for understanding the risks and opportunities associated with different locations and periods during the identified niches in the third step we quantified green water for short timesteps 10 day within the identified niches as well as for the full length of both niches the time periods and data mentioned in fig 2 were those used in the present study 2 3 gridded datasets to achieve the study objectives in such a data scarce region we used open access gridded datasets and gis techniques which are seen to be useful to monitor and manage wetlands effectively mackay et al 2009 rebelo et al 2009 herein we used multiple datasets to delineate the cropland extent and explore the spatial temporal patterns of soil moisture stress and aet table 1 these products were selected specifically because of their substantial temporal and spatial coverages their free accessibility through public domain sources and their missions still operating to date allowing for the operationalization and use of these products in future research the required datasets were downloaded and processed in the arcgis environment esri 2019 2 4 land cover analysis disparities have been reported and disagreements exist between different land cover datasets across africa tsendbazar et al 2015 xu et al 2019 especially when identifying cropland extents fritz et al 2010 nabil et al 2020 therefore we compared four land cover datasets 1 the european space agency climate change initiative with 300 m spatial resolution esa cci esa 2017 2 the terra and aqua combined modis land cover dataset version 006 500 m mcd12q1 friedl and sulla menashe 2019 3 the fao portal to monitor water productivity through open access of remotely sensed derived data with a spatial resolution of 250 m waporv2 1 fao 2018 and 4 the copernicus global land service land cover cgls lc buchhorn et al 2020 with a 100 m spatial resolution detailed information regarding the land cover classes of each product and their descriptions can be found in their cited references relevant classes were selected from each product to delineate the cropland extent class numbers 10 and 20 from esa cci 12 and 14 from mcd12q1 41 and 42 from wapor and 40 from cgls lc after extracting the cropland classes from the four selected datasets across the rice cultivation area of kilombero we compared them with cropland layers extracted from another two land cover products with higher spatial resolutions namely the global food security analysis support data product gfsad xiong et al 2017b and the esa cci s2 prototype product developed by the esa cci land cover team table 1 gfsad 30 m and esa cci s2 20 m offer global and african cropland extents for the years 2015 and 2016 respectively and have shown fair accuracies of approximately 93 and 65 respectively in identifying cropland extents across africa lesiv et al 2017 yadav and congalton 2018 the land cover comparison followed two steps 1 the visual assessment here we cross compared the cropland extent from the four evaluated products and against the corresponding cropland extents from gfsad and esa cci s2 and 2 comparing the absolute area of detected cropland here we estimated the cropland area from the short listed datasets from step 1 and compared them with the cropland area estimated from gfsad and esa cci s2 based on these steps one land cover product was selected and used in the subsequent analyses of soil moisture and aet 2 5 soil moisture conditions the hydrology of seasonal floodplain wetlands is complex and determined by multiple factors including the distance to the river groundwater levels soil properties atmospheric demands river overbank flow direct precipitation groundwater discharge and lateral flow from surrounding mountains burghof et al 2018 gabiri et al 2018 thus we studied the spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture stress resulting from different hydrological processes without investigating its underlying factors and sources multiple agricultural drought indicators are available comparing the actual aet to the potential pet evapotranspiration as a proxy to estimate soil moisture conditions schyns et al 2015 among those we selected the evaporative stress index esi as it identifies areas with soil moisture stress based on the land surface dryness without requiring many meteorological inputs anderson et al 2007 in fact esi is similar to other existing drought indicators schyns et al 2015 namely the crop water stress index jackson et al 1981 the water stress ratio narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 and the evaporative drought index yao et al 2010 esi is calculated as 1 esi 1 aet pet esi values vary between 0 and 1 and according to yao et al 2010 they can be grouped as wet esi 0 2 normal 0 2 esi 0 4 moderate 0 4 esi 0 6 severe 0 6 esi 0 8 and extreme dry soil moisture or drought esi 0 8 in the present study esi values of 0 7 were considered as the threshold for severe drought indicating a level of water deficit hampering crop growth the reason for shifting this threshold from 0 6 to 0 7 is that esi classification is based on its relationship with the 0 10 cm soil moisture yao et al 2010 while crop roots can reach deeper soil profiles until 50 cm depth and therefore extracting more water for transpiration savenije 2004 and hence having higher esi values to understand the soil moisture conditions in the relative sense the relative evaporative stress res index following esi is proposed res is calculated as follows 2 res cv 1 aet pet i 100 where 1 aet pet is calculated for a long term time series and can be calculated at various time steps i and cv is the coefficient of variation calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean value res represents the degree of variation or stability in esi time series in the higher the res high variability the less stable is the time series and vice versa the index can be applied at various spatial and temporal scales we used res to detect the risks and opportunities associated with dry season cultivation a res value of 20 for example means that the esi may deviate 20 from the long term average esi value implying a high stability in the esi time series in a specific location or pixel similarly a 50 res value indicate that esi value may disperse by half of the long term average esi value suggesting a highly unstable situation therefore we decided to calculate res following four classes res 20 20 res 30 30 res 40 and res 40 with our focus on the pre and post rice cropping niches esi and res had to be calculated at the highest possible spatial and intra annual temporal scales thus we used the evapotranspiration remote sensing products of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis mod16a2gf v006 the mod16a2gf product compromises information on aet and pet based on the penman monteith logic monteith 1965 at 500 m spatial resolution and at 8 day timesteps aet and pet were calculated over each cropland pixel and for each 8 day period throughout the year 46 8 day periods year for the entire available period of the products 2000 2019 we produced maps and time series of esi and res for each 8 day period 2000 2019 2 6 green water availability as crop water requirements refer to the amount of water needed to meet the plants water losses brouwer and heibloem 1986 aet appears to be a suitable indicator to assess green water or soil moisture availability since measured values of aet only occur when where there is water aet can serve as a minimum threshold to soil water available for crop use the inter annual aet was analyzed with particular focus on the identified pre and post rice cropping periods with soil moisture conditions sufficient for growing crops among several aet products available we used two products with high spatial and temporal resolutions namely wapor 250 m 10 day and ssebop 1000 m 10 day developed based on the concepts of etlook bastiaanssen et al 2012 pelgrum et al 2010 and operational simplified surface energy balance senay et al 2013 respectively both products were evaluated in several regions and climatic zones across africa showing high performance estimating aet e g over the hyper arid agricultural areas of egypt ayyad et al 2019 the volta river basin dembélé et al 2020 the nile river basin mcnamara et al 2021 and at continental scale blatchford et al 2020 weerasinghe et al 2020 we resampled the ssebop product to the spatial resolution of wapor 250 m using bilinear interpolation and created an ensemble mean of their aet values for each pixel for the entire common period of the two products 2009 2020 the reason for creating this ensemble mean was because despite their general good performance wapor and ssebop were reported to over and under estimate aet respectively mcnamara et al 2021 weerasinghe et al 2020 furthermore creating this ensemble mean of such well performing products with different constructing concepts can propagate potential uncertainties in the results and make them more realistic zhang et al 2016 actual evapotranspiration estimates of the ensemble mean product were tested by correlating them to values of an independent vegetation index the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the latter has a strong correlation with aet and is commonly used to assess aet product performance we used the ndvi product from modis mod13q1 v006 with 250 m resolution and 16 day timestep didan 2015 ndvi values below 0 1 correspond to non vegetated surfaces gandhi et al 2015 and were therefore masked out both the ndvi and aet ensemble mean products were compared on monthly basis 2009 2020 and a linear regression using r2 was applied to examine the correlation between the two datasets in our analysis we used the ensemble product to estimate and map aet for each 10 day period from 2009 to 2020 to understand and quantify the soil water availability across time and space over kilombero aet was calculated with intervals of 10 mm 10 day to simplify the visualization and interpretation of aet values for instance aet of 30 40 mm 10 day can easily be interpreted to approximately 3 4 mm day furthermore for the identified pre and post rice niches we calculated the aggregated aet for the entire duration of both niches to quantify the total water availability of these niches 3 results 3 1 land cover the land cover analysis revealed considerable disparities between products in capturing the extent of the cropland fig 3 compared to gfsad and esa cci s2 the wapor and cgls lc products showed consistent agreement on the extent and spatial distribution of cropland fig 3a d on the other hand esa cci partially miss captured the extent of the cropland area fig 3e while nearly no cropland was identified in the selected layers from mcd12q1 fig 3f marked in green which classified cropland as savanna or grassland thus mcd12q1 and esa cci were considered unsuitable to delineate cropland areas in kilombero which are nearly exclusively lowland rice cropland areas were also assessed for 2015 and 2016 yielding comparable results for wapor 2730 km2 cgls lc 2320 km2 gfsad 2515 km2 and esa cci s2 2725 km2 the cropland area estimated by wapor was nearly identical to that of esa cci s2 and compared well with that of gfsad thus we considered wapor to be the most reliable product for delineating rainfed rice cropland areas in kilombero 3 2 soil moisture conditions distinct temporal patterns of dry and wet seasons in kilombero result in a strong seasonality of soil moisture availability for crops as determined by the evaporative stress index esi fig 4 esi values of 0 2 indicate soil submergence while values 0 7 indicate a level of water deficit hampering crop growth fig 5 wettest soil moisture conditions were detected during the main rainy season between late february and mid may also representing the lowland rice growing period figs 4 and 5 on the other hand moderate soil moisture conditions that are potentially suitable for crop growth were observed during the pre rice cropping niche between early january and mid march as well as in the post rice cropping niche between mid may and late july crop cultivation without supplemental irrigation seems unfeasible between early august to mid december as indicated by severe soil dryness esi 0 7 in consequence potential niches for dry season crop cultivation occur 1 between mid december and late february approximately 70 days of soil moisture availability representing the cropping niche before the transplanting of wetland rice in early march and 2 between late may and late july approximately 65 days of soil moisture availability representing the cropping niche after the harvest of wetland rice in may besides these temporal patterns the stress index also highlights distinct spatial patterns by the end of the post rice niche from 20th to 27th of july we detected a total area of 1452 km2 with esi of 0 7 representing 53 of the total cropland area in kilombero similarly an area of 1637 km2 60 of cropland area with esi of 0 7 was detected at the beginning of the pre rice niche from 19th to 26th of july the southern and eastern croplands showed generally drier soil conditions i e higher esi than the northwestern croplands also the northwestern fringe areas seemed to have less soil moisture stress than all other areas the above highlighted pre rice and post rice cropping niches are possibly longer and with more reliable soil moisture availability in the north western cropland area as well as along the south eastern fringe of the floodplain the analysis of the relative stress index res provided further insights on the risks and opportunities of cultivating the pre and post rice niches figs 5 and 6 the rainy season march may exhibited res values between 9 and 20 in addition to the lowest esi long term mean values the res values indicated high inter annual variability 30 over the period from late december to mid february implying the high risks associated with cultivating during this period while res showed high stability 3 res 15 between june to mid december this represents the dry period and hence a stability of low soil moisture or drought with esi values 0 7 while pre rice cultivation is associated with high variability and consequently with a high risk of drought induced crop failure for farmers post rice cultivation recession cropping with or without supplemental irrigation appears promising for dry season cultivation with moderate soil moisture availability and little risk of drought related crop failure 9 res 15 3 3 green water availability the daily average 2009 2020 aet calculated from the ensemble product over the entire cropland area of kilombero floodplain was 2 63 mm day corresponding to approximately 960 mm year these aet values were compared to the ndvi by a linear regression at multi annual monthly basis fig 7 both variables correlated linearly and positively with r2 of 0 58 p 0 05 indicating a relatively good performance of our ensemble aet product the mean ensemble aet spatial and temporal distributions for each 10 day period are presented in figs 7 and 8 it is expected that aet values of the period march to may would be higher than the rest of the year with a noticeable decline in june that is the harvesting month this observed aet variability could be attributed to vegetation growth patterns as explained by the estimated ndvi during the rice growing season the roots enable higher aet rates through moisture access of deeper soil profile layers while in very sparse vegetation or bare soil conditions those deeper soil layers are disconnected from the evaporation fluxes and aet only occurs from the topsoil layer fig 7 the aet spatial distribution revealed no substantial variability over kilombero cropland for each 10 day period with dominating aet values of 10 40 mm 10 day throughout fig 8 the rainy season march may showed the highest aet mostly about 30 40 mm 10 day of the year over kilombero from mid december until late february aet had values between 20 and 40 mm 10 day over almost all kilombero cropland the post rice niche period in june and july showed that some cropland areas dry out faster with relatively lower aet range 10 30 mm 10 day the dry period from early august to early december was also confirmed to have the lowest aet 20 mm 10 day the aggregated aet of the pre and post rice niches are shown in fig 9a and b interestingly the pre rice niche 70 days showed higher aggregated aet value ranging from 50 to 350 mm fig 9a lower aggregated aet range 50 250 mm were estimated during the post rice niche of 60 days fig 9b the north western fringes areas exhibited the highest aggregated aet values particularly during the pre rice niche 4 discussion 4 1 suitability of using land cover and actual evapotranspiration datasets as demonstrated in the land cover analysis chapter 3 1 significant disparities were found among the different land cover products the errors can be as large as to miss capturing or even not capturing at all a specific land cover class using land cover products without evaluation can lead to drawing irrelevant and misleading conclusions regarding the study area and land cover class in question thus we emphasize the importance of evaluating a few land cover products for each individual case study and subsequently choosing one it is recommended to conduct cross comparisons between selected products and or to compare them against independent reference datasets as previously done at the country e g ayyad and khalifa 2021 continental e g fritz et al 2010 or global scales e g pérez hoyos et al 2017 evaluating land cover products is especially important when researching african croplands where multiple factors influence prevailing spatial discrepancies such as elevation dispersion cloud cover or size of fields nabil et al 2020 the cropland in kilombero is dominated by rainfed lowland rice which is often difficult to differentiate from wet savanna grassland and mcd12q1 and esa cci were unable to make this distinction in addition to the spatial consistency observed between wapor and gfsad and esa cci s2 chapter 3 1 the cropland area identified by wapor in 2015 2730 km2 also compared well with previously reported areas of kilombero cropland of about 2760 km2 in 2009 munishi and jewitt 2019 3000 km2 in 2014 thonfeld et al 2020a and 3253 679 km2 in 2014 thonfeld et al 2020b differences between these estimates and wapor are attributed to a portion of the cropland falling within the seasonally inundated area close to the river this temporarily submerged area of about 1100 km2 thonfeld et al 2020a consists actually of a savanna grassland grazed by ruminants during the dry season at the same time aet products should be used carefully in this study not only did our ensemble aet product correlate well with ndvi chapter 3 3 but also the calculated average aet value of 2 63 mm day 960 mm year compared very well with aet values reported in relevant studies for example the average aet value in the cropland areas from the ensemble product was 2 63 mm day 960 mm year weerasinghe et al 2020 estimated an aet value of 750 1000 mm year 2 05 2 74 mm day following the water balance closure in the rufiji basin näschen et al 2018 simulated hydrological fluxes in the kilombero basin and reported a similar aet range of 750 950 mm year 2 05 2 60 mm day in the sub basins covering the area of kilombero cropland similarly gabiri et al 2018 calculated the soil water fluxes in kilombero and reported an average annual aet value of 970 mm year 2 65 mm day in contrast senkondo et al 2019 estimated the daily average aet values over different land cover types using an ensemble mean derived from three aet models they found that the average daily aet over kilombero cropland was 3 5 mm day and that ssebop underestimated the aet values the difference between our estimates and theirs may be attributed to two factors i they used the esa cci land cover product which we earlier demonstrated its inaccuracy in capturing the extent of cropland in kilombero chapter 3 1 and ii their ensemble mean is constructed based on the surface energy balance concept solely while our ensemble blends the ssebop and etlook concepts chapter 2 6 4 2 soil moisture conditions and green water availability attention should be paid to the esi original classification chapter 2 5 yao et al 2010 highlighted the need to explore the application of the original classification in different ecosystems while the original classification considers esi of 0 6 to represent severe drought conditions in this study we used 0 7 as a threshold above which crop growth may be hampered esi values of 0 2 represent wet conditions according to the original classification in the case of kilombero the wettest esi conditions were found to be in the range of 0 2 0 4 figs 4 and 5 a range that represents normal drought conditions not negatively affecting crop performance based on the original esi classification thus we suggest that esi classification should be adapted to the specific case study similarly while we categorized res values into four classes res 20 20 res 30 30 res 40 and res 40 chapter 2 5 future studies may opt to categorize res differently according to the local conditions of the case study in question the spatial and temporal distributions of esi and aet showed agreements with findings of previous relevant studies in the region for instance the spatial distribution of our esi and aet ensemble product was consistent with findings of burghof et al 2018 and gabiri et al 2018 indicating the wetter conditions higher aet values and lower esi during most of the year in the northern and western fringes than all other areas in kilombero floodplain fig 4 and fig 8 gabiri et al 2018 attributed the wetter conditions at the fringes zones to the soil water storage and the low depth to groundwater level throughout the year in the remaining areas and due to the land cover changes in the basin a decrease in low flows and an increase in high flows affected the hydrological regime of the kilombero river i e inundation height and duration during the rainy season and surface groundwater interaction during the dry season and thus altering the soil water availability in the floodplain leemhuis et al 2017 the analyses of aet suggest that more green water is available in the pre rice niche than the post rice niche chapter 3 3 nevertheless the latter niche was found to be more stable over time low res which offers substantial opportunities for developing green water cultivation during this niche through recession cropping and with or without supplemental irrigation at the same time the pre rice niches showed higher variability in water availability and evaporative atmospheric demands higher res and thus cultivating during this period entails risk of drought or crop failure to the farmer chapter 3 2 here it seems reasonable to establish supplemental irrigation practices in the pre rice niches to cope with dry spells using existing irrigation canals alavaisha et al 2021 and rivers stemming from adjacent mountains wilson et al 2017 in some areas of kilombero our findings assessed and demonstrated green water availability before and after the wet season in kilombero the analyses of the absolute and relative green water availability provided useful insights as to when where and how reliable is green water availability beyond the wet season in view of maximizing the potential of agricultural production on existing cropland and with minimal impact on natural processes this can be done by shifting a portion of the nonproductive green water flows i e soil evaporation to productive vapor flows in form of crop transpiration rockström 2003 thus other water fluxes i e runoff and seepage shall not be significantly affected shifting aet fluxes to productive vapor flows will not only preserve natural processes and halt cropland expansion but will also contribute to improve the livelihoods food security and resilience of smallholder farming communities two important points should be considered when planning to shift the aet fluxes to productive crop transpiration first the estimated aet herein is the sum of soil evaporation plant transpiration and evaporation of intercepted rainwater transpiration the productive plants water consumption ranges from 66 to 92 of the total aet estimated over cropland globally miralles et al 2011 wang erlandsson et al 2014 wei et al 2017 this is especially important when designing cultivation strategies in the pre rice niche where interception of early season rainfall events will occur and thus not all the estimated aet in this niche will be available for the plants second it should be noted that in the pre and post rice niches with very sparse vegetation the estimated aet values only represent green water fluxes that occur primarily from the 2 5 cm topsoil layer anderson et al 2007 however more green water is likely to be available at deeper layers of the soil profile and thus the cropping niches could potentially be even longer for instance while we estimated a post rice niche of 65 days kangalawe and liwenga 2005 conducted participatory assessments and reported that the post rice soil moisture period in some areas in kilombero may last for three to six months on the other hand they further highlighted that some areas dry out shortly after the rains have ceased depending on the soil texture and the water holding capacity therefore differences in green water availability fig 8 can also be attributed to soil hydraulic properties e g soil texture organic matter saturated and residual water content water holding capacity and hydrologic soil group 4 3 prospect of sustainable intensification and diversification from an agronomic perspective several cropping options can well fit within the pre and post rice niches one the one hand rice double cropping may be possible in some areas where the availability of green water extends longer into the post rice niche moreover extended water availability may permit to growing long duration rice cultivars which are frequently economically and socially preferred changalima et al 2020 diversification options on the other hand may include a broad set of possibilities for instance some farmers in kilombero produce maize vegetables cassava cowpeas and pigeon peas gebrekidan et al 2020 höllermann et al 2021 and these crops can fit well within the detected niches also short cycled green manure crops can produce biofertilizer in the pre rice niche while deep rooted forage legumes such as stylosanthes can extract water from deeper soil layers thus extending the length of the post rice niche for producing forage for cattle feeding kwesiga et al 2020b moreover perishable vegetable crops particularly leafy vegetables can be grown for as long as water is available verhoeven and setter 2010 important considerations entail also the inter annual changes in soil moisture conditions across the cropland in the floodplain in the pre rice niche after a prolonged dry season the soil condition gradually changes from hard and dry to soft and wet triggered by the onset of rainfall events conversely the soil gradually moves from the wet and soft conditions back to the hard and dry conditions during the post rice niche after the seasonal inundation recedes towards the dry season these changes in the soil moisture conditions will partly govern the selection of pre and post rice crops for example the shift from hard dry to soft wet conditions in the pre rice niche may offer an opportunity to cultivate e g tuber crops such as cassava sweet potatoes and carrots which cannot be cultivated in the post rice niche because of the hard dry soil conditions by the harvest time however tuber crops in the pre rice niche will not be able to tolerate submergence conditions thus to avoid crop submergence and to increase the rooting depth building ridges for crop cultivation may be required in both niches implying hard physical labor or the use of machinery which can be economically challenging for low input farmers with limited resource endowment the changes in the soil aeration and physical status entail not only niche specific hydrologic dynamics but may also entail different dynamics in soil nitrogen availability with compact dry soils limiting root nutrient uptake in the later post rice niche and nitrate accumulation and subsequent leaching and denitrification losses limiting crop nitrogen availability during the pre rice niche yameogo et al 2021 although farmers follow specific planting dates for rainfed rice cultivation in kilombero they adjust their cropping calendars and the planting dates according to i the water level as it rises in the floodplain and ii the observed weather patterns e g direction of cloud formation and sound of thunder which may vary across the floodplain höllermann et al 2021 rice is usually planted between late february and early march but the planting date can vary across kilombero by a few days and between years by a few weeks depending on the onset of the rainy season kwesiga et al 2019 thus the planting time of the rainfed rice can shorten or prolong both the pre and post rice niches and thereby influence the choice of diversification crops in both niches and across the floodplain another critical determinant to crop selection is the proximity and availability of markets in the region perishable crops with a short storage life such as tubers crops e g carrots or other leafy vegetables e g cabbages need to be delivered to the market as soon as they have been harvested restricting this option to peri urban areas such as ifakara town in kilombero fig 1 coarse grains such as rice maize or sorghum have longer storage lives and may be thus preferred in remote or rural areas 4 4 broader implications of green water cultivation for africa and beyond green water contributes about 87 of the global cropland water consumption liu and yang 2010 and substantial opportunities exist towards building more productive agricultural rainfed systems relying on green water which can ultimately reduce the pressure on blue water resources wani et al 2009 in africa over 90 of cropland is rainfed xiong et al 2017a and depends on green water liu and yang 2010 that is much more available than blue water schuol et al 2008 yet only 5 of public agricultural water investments support rainfed agriculture in africa abrams 2018 our analyses of green water availability can guide investments in floodplain wetlands of ssa the detected patterns of water availability are crucial to inform farmers decision makers as well as international and national donors investors areas as to where and when investments will likely yield higher returns this is not only important for improving rainfed cultivation practices through improved field management techniques e g rainwater harvesting technologies biazin et al 2012 or native soil n management asante et al 2017 but also for considering irrigation investments where green water availability solely does not permit for crop cultivation here investing in supplemental irrigation will contribute to increasing the overall agricultural production and resilience to dry spells rockström et al 2010 as mentioned earlier wetlands and especially the seasonal floodplain wetlands contribute significantly to livelihood and food security in ssa rebelo et al 2010 therefore creating more sustainable intensification and diversification options in floodplain environments such as efficiently exploiting available green water availability can significantly contribute to improving food security and livelihoods by realizing the agricultural potential while halting the cropland expansion an expansion that is not needed to meet both today s and future biomass demands mauser et al 2015 although applied to rather local scales of floodplain environments implementing and upscaling such green water management strategies can play a pivotal role towards a much needed shift in the african water management falkenmark 2018 on a broader scale these strategies can ultimately contribute to keeping agriculture within the safe operating space of the planet boundaries rockström et al 2017 while realizing multiple sgds simultaneously 4 5 limitations and future research remote sensing datasets with extensive spatial and temporal coverage provide large opportunities for a wide range of agricultural studies jindo et al 2021 however challenges may prevail due to entailed uncertainties of using such datasets karimi and bastiaanssen 2015 validation of these datasets is thus imperative yet challenging and sometimes is unfeasible due to the scarcity of ground data and the mismatches between gridded and ground datasets for instance to validate remotely sensed aet estimates they can be compared against in situ measurements from eddy covariance towers lysimeter systems or by the water balance closure allen et al 2011 such measurements were not obtainable in kilombero creating an ensemble mean of reported aet products with good performance and already documented uncertainties can thus provide a reasonable alternative further despite uncertainties associated with the mod16a2gf products for aet and pet running et al 2019 our calculations relied on their relative rather than absolute values for calculating esi and res to identify the pre and post rice niches chapter 2 5 nonetheless future research should validate the spatial and temporal boundaries and the quantified aet of the identified niches although the chosen products in this study were carefully selected evaluated and demonstrated good performance we recommend using locally produced calibrated datasets whenever possible when applying the proposed methodological approach in future research the scale of the study should also be considered when choosing specific remote sensing products this study looked at the full extent of cropland areas and thus the selected products were considered to have sufficient spatial resolution 100 500 m when looking at smaller scales e g field or plot level aet and cropland maps of higher resolutions 10 30 m can be derived from satellite images with higher resolutions e g landsat and sentinel there is also a critical need for operational and temporally dynamic land cover products to better understand the intra annual changes in cropland areas of seasonal floodplain wetlands although it was beyond the scope of this study an agronomic analysis that classifies crop functional traits and determines their fit within specific cropping niches is needed to target and extrapolate sustainable crop intensification and diversification strategies future research can further refine our results by investigating soil properties through field studies to assess soil suitability and to understand why some cropland areas dry out faster in the post rice niche in the light of reported findings herein further field experiments combined with stakeholder analysis and aspiration mapping e g höllermann et al 2021 are needed to identify and spatially target future site and system specific land use strategies for sustainable diversification and intensification of seasonal floodplain wetlands to ensure the transferability of the findings of this research the approach proposed in this study needs to be tested and validated in other seasonal floodplain wetlands in ssa thus it is imperative to detect and analyze seasonal floodplain wetlands in ssa with similarities to kilombero to which the suggested approach could be extrapolated and niche specific targeting of crop diversification be applied 5 conclusions using kilombero as a case study we could show that seasonal floodplain environments exhibit substantial potential for future sustainable crop intensification and diversification in sub saharan africa farmers cultivating floodplains use submergence water to grow rice during the wet season before and after the wet season farming activities are limited mainly due to water un availability and variability we proposed a methodological approach that relies on open access remote sensing datasets and permits to identify where when and how much green water is likely to be available beyond the rice cropping season land cover products showed huge disparities in extracting cropland areas with wapor being the best performing product to delineate areas under rainfed rice production in kilombero furthermore creating an ensemble mean of reportedly well performing actual evapotranspiration aet products seems to be a viable option for data scarce regions such as kilombero herein the ensemble mean product of wapor and ssebop demonstrated good quality for estimating aet in kilombero green water is available both before and after the rice cropping season the analyses of the ensemble mean aet product suggests that more green water is available in the pre rice than the post rice niches and that distinct spatial patters of water availability are apparent both the evaporative stress index and the newly proposed relative evaporative stress index appear to be suitable indicators to analyze and map soil moisture conditions in these so far unexploited cropping niches sustainable cultivation practices using green water in seasonal floodplain wetlands provide tremendous opportunities to intensify agricultural production and consequently improving farmer livelihoods not only in kilombero but also in other seasonal floodplains of sub saharan africa and beyond declaration of competing interest the authors

9492,producing more food for a growing population requires sustainable crop intensification and diversification particularly in high potential areas such as the seasonal floodplain wetlands of sub saharan africa ssa with emerging water shortages and concerns for conserving these multi functional wetlands a further expansion of the cropland area must be avoided as it would entail increased use of blue water for irrigation and infringe on valuable protected areas we advocate an efficient use of the prevailing green water on the existing cropland areas where small scale farmers grow a single crop of rainfed lowland rice during the wet season however soil moisture at the onset of the rains pre rice niche and residual soil moisture after rice harvest post rice niche may suffice to cultivate short cycled crops we developed a methodological approach to analyze the potential for green water cultivation in the pre and post rice niches in the kilombero valley floodplain in tanzania as a representative case for seasonal floodplain wetlands in ssa the three step approach used open access remote sensing datasets to i extract cropland areas ii analyze soil moisture conditions using evaporative stress indices to identify the pre and post rice niches and iii quantify the green water availability in the identified niches through actual evapotranspiration aet we identified distinct patterns of green water being available both before and after the rice growing period based on the analyses of evaporative stress indices the pre rice niche tends to be longer 70 days with average aet of 20 40 mm 10 day but also more variable inter annual variability 30 than the post rice niche 65 days with average aet of 10 30 mm 10 day inter annual variability 15 these findings show the large potential for cultivating short cycled crops beyond the rice growing period such as green manure vegetables maize and forage legumes by shifting a portion of the nonproductive aet flows i e soil evaporation to productive flows in form of crop transpiration a cropland area of 1452 to 1637 km2 53 60 of the total cropland area identified of 2730 km2 could be cultivated using available green water in the dry season which shows the significance of such change for food security livelihoods and resilience of the agricultural community in kilombero a wider application of the developed approach in this study can help identifying opportunities and guiding interventions and investments towards establishing sustainable intensification and diversification practices in floodplain

conversion of wetlands to sites of production potentially leads to their ultimate destruction beuel et al 2016 a trend that is likely to be exacerbated by climate change mitchell 2013 this paper focuses on seasonal wetlands located within relatively large floodplains with seasonal soil submergence by riverbank overflowing and to a lesser extent by lateral runoff from adjacent slopes sakané et al 2011 such floodplain wetlands cover an estimated area of 692 631 km2 and are thus an enormous and largely untapped resource for future food production rebelo et al 2010 in these wetlands farmers typically grow one single crop of rainfed lowland rice during the wet rainy season grisp 2013 before and after the wet season farming activities are limited by water availability and variability and cropland areas are often left to fallow for the rest of the year balasubramanian et al 2007 whenever affordable farmers strive to adopt irrigation by using blue water resources water in rivers lakes

and rivers rockström and falkenmark 2015 high initial investments costs inocencio et al 2007 and the lack of access to appropriate irrigation technologies and improved agricultural inputs as well as to reliable markets and research support nakawuka et al 2018 contributing to the typical failure of large irrigation projects to deliver promised benefits higginbottom et al 2021 nevertheless there

technologies such as motor pumps communal river diversion and small reservoirs xie et al 2014 precipitation is the source of freshwater which can take two forms blue water or green water falkenmark and rockström 2006 herein green water refers to the plant available water stored in the root zone as a result of natural processes without human intervention i e precipitation natural drainage and floodwater karimi et al 2013 while blue water solutions are primarily needed for urban industrial and energy developments and require large investments better management of the more decentralized highly adaptable and low capital demanding green water solutions can immensely contribute to improving rainfed agricultural systems and thereby food security in ssa keys and falkenmark 2018 however little is known about green water availability and variability and hence its potential for diversifying and intensifying the existing crop portfolio in floodplain wetlands in ssa this research analyzes opportunities for sustainably intensifying and diversifying crop production systems in the kilombero valley floodplain in tanzania hereafter referred to as kilombero which is representative for many other seasonal floodplain wetlands in ssa rebelo et al 2010 the conversion of floodplain wetlands into cropland reportedly altered the water balance components on the sub basin scale näschen et al 2018 and increased the frequency durations severity and intensity of drought events in kilombero wambura and dietrich 2020 with water availability and variability widely limiting crop production in kilombero farmers may adapt their cropping calendars and establish community based irrigation schemes only about 1 of the total rice area is irrigated höllermann et al 2021 thus cropping strategies should be designed to adapt to the complex dynamic of seasonal water availability we explored the potential of using green water stored in the soil profile for cultivating additional crops before the rice establishment pre rice niche and after the rice harvest post rice niche the former practice exploits early season rainfall events that do not suffice for soil flooding and puddling and the transplanting of rice to grow short cycled green manure and food crops senthilkumar et al 2018 the latter practice is known as flood recession cropping where residual soil moisture is used for growing crops after the harvest of rice when seasonal inundation recedes sidibe et al 2016 the durations and locations of these cropping niches depend to a large extent on the onset intensity and duration of the early season rains pre rice niche and the amount and duration of available residual soil moisture post rice niche to our knowledge no studies are available assessing this green water availability and its variability in seasonal floodplain wetlands in ssa thus we investigated the spatial temporal availability and variability of green water beyond the wet season in view of designing and targeting crop diversification and intensification strategies with a special focus on the potential cropping niches before and after wetland rice cultivation numerous relative and absolute indicators for the availability of green water exist schyns et al 2015 in absolute terms green water availability is defined as the available soil moisture for vapor flows and is quantified by means of the actual evapotranspiration aet rockström et al 2009 while in relative terms green water availability is expressed by soil moisture conditions at a given location relative to a normal average condition schyns et al 2015 in this paper aet refers to the total vapor flux to the atmosphere as evaporation from interception transpiration and soil evaporation in situ point based measurements of aet and soil moisture are scarce across ssa and where available cannot fully explain the spatial variation over larger areas or the temporal variation between seasons and years in contrast to the highly data demanding hydrological models zhao et al 2013 satellite based observations commonly referred to as remote sensing gridded products provide derived information on aet and soil moisture at various spatial and temporal scales however the currently operationalized soil moisture products with long temporal coverage have rather coarse spatial resolutions of 25 50 km peng et al 2021 limiting their applicability to smaller scales of cropland areas such as smallholder rice farms moreover the performance quality of different aet products varies by regions weerasinghe et al 2020 thus there is a need for alternative approaches for estimating soil moisture conditions and green water availability at high spatial and temporal resolutions our overarching goal was to develop a remote sensing approach to analyze patterns of green water availability and to identify the potential for dry season cultivation in seasonal floodplain wetlands using kilombero as a case study our methodological approach includes three objectives i delineation of cropland areas ii analyzing the dynamics of intra annual soil moisture conditions across extracted cropland areas for a long time series and thereby identifying the pre and post rice niches and iii quantifying and mapping aet in cropland areas with particular focus on the two so far unexploited cropping niches this approach serves as a starting point towards exploring possible strategies for dry season cultivation in floodplain wetlands in and beyond kilombero based on extensive spatial and temporal coverage provided by relevant remote sensing datasets the outputs of these objectives can advance our understanding of the prospects of realizing the agricultural potential improving the livelihoods of farming communities and ultimately for achieving multiple sustainable development goals in seasonal floodplain wetlands of ssa 2 materials and methods 2 1 kilombero wetland the kilombero basin is located in south central tanzania covering about 40 000 km2 and contributing 62 of the annual runoff of the rufiji river basin wilson et al 2017 fig 1a the basin has a tropical climate with distinct dry june october short november january and long march may rainy seasons koutsouris et al 2016 the monthly average temperatures precipitation and solar radiation reflecting the seasonality in the basin are presented in fig 1b covering an area of approx 8000 km2 kilombero floodplain is the largest lowland seasonal floodplain wetland in east africa wilson et al 2017 the unique ecological features and biodiversity have led to designating it as a ramsar site in 2002 mombo et al 2011 the ecosystem services supported by kilombero floodplain and in particular the provisioning services koko et al 2020 are vital to the livelihoods of local communities rebelo et al 2010 rainfed lowland rice cultivation dominates the local activities during the rainy season gebrekidan et al 2020 making kilombero one of the largest rice growing areas in east africa that supplies 9 of tanzania s national rice production kato 2007 as a result of the intensifying human interventions driven by population growth and the growing market demand and price incentives for agricultural products an increasing trend of converting natural vegetative land covers into rice cropland was observed in kilombero primarily to increase rice crop production and thus improving livelihoods kirimi et al 2018 msofe et al 2019 munishi and jewitt 2019 thonfeld et al 2020a 2020b such land cover change represents a threat to the biodiversity seki et al 2018 and biophysical system of kilombero muro et al 2018 and can alter the inflow of several tributaries and the maintenance of environmental flow wilson et al 2017 which are essential to sustain the ecosystem and the human livelihoods that are dependent on these ecosystems leemhuis et al 2017 yet there is an enormous and largely untapped potential to increase rice production by closing the yield gaps on existing croplands in kilombero without expanding the cropped area kwesiga et al 2020a 2 2 methodological approach we investigated the potential of exploiting available green water resources to support dry season crop cultivation fig 2 the proposed remote sensing based approach comprises three steps i evaluating multiple land cover datasets and identifying a reliable dataset to delineate the extent of croplands in kilombero ii estimating soil moisture stress and its variability by using the ratio of actual aet to potential evapotranspiration pet iii quantifying the green water availability by means of aet the first step served as a basis for subsequent analyses because of the commonly known disparities among land cover datasets in detecting the cropland extent pérez hoyos et al 2017 the second step assumes that aet under actual soil moisture conditions can reach an upper limit of pet the latter represents the atmospheric evaporative demand when the soil water supply is unlimited xiang et al 2020 this step is aimed at detecting the inter and intra annual soil moisture stress for long time series in view of identifying the spatial and temporal boundaries of potential pre and post rice cropping niches in addition calculating the inter annual variability of soil moisture stress permitted for understanding the risks and opportunities associated with different locations and periods during the identified niches in the third step we quantified green water for short timesteps 10 day within the identified niches as well as for the full length of both niches the time periods and data mentioned in fig 2 were those used in the present study 2 3 gridded datasets to achieve the study objectives in such a data scarce region we used open access gridded datasets and gis techniques which are seen to be useful to monitor and manage wetlands effectively mackay et al 2009 rebelo et al 2009 herein we used multiple datasets to delineate the cropland extent and explore the spatial temporal patterns of soil moisture stress and aet table 1 these products were selected specifically because of their substantial temporal and spatial coverages their free accessibility through public domain sources and their missions still operating to date allowing for the operationalization and use of these products in future research the required datasets were downloaded and processed in the arcgis environment esri 2019 2 4 land cover analysis disparities have been reported and disagreements exist between different land cover datasets across africa tsendbazar et al 2015 xu et al 2019 especially when identifying cropland extents fritz et al 2010 nabil et al 2020 therefore we compared four land cover datasets 1 the european space agency climate change initiative with 300 m spatial resolution esa cci esa 2017 2 the terra and aqua combined modis land cover dataset version 006 500 m mcd12q1 friedl and sulla menashe 2019 3 the fao portal to monitor water productivity through open access of remotely sensed derived data with a spatial resolution of 250 m waporv2 1 fao 2018 and 4 the copernicus global land service land cover cgls lc buchhorn et al 2020 with a 100 m spatial resolution detailed information regarding the land cover classes of each product and their descriptions can be found in their cited references relevant classes were selected from each product to delineate the cropland extent class numbers 10 and 20 from esa cci 12 and 14 from mcd12q1 41 and 42 from wapor and 40 from cgls lc after extracting the cropland classes from the four selected datasets across the rice cultivation area of kilombero we compared them with cropland layers extracted from another two land cover products with higher spatial resolutions namely the global food security analysis support data product gfsad xiong et al 2017b and the esa cci s2 prototype product developed by the esa cci land cover team table 1 gfsad 30 m and esa cci s2 20 m offer global and african cropland extents for the years 2015 and 2016 respectively and have shown fair accuracies of approximately 93 and 65 respectively in identifying cropland extents across africa lesiv et al 2017 yadav and congalton 2018 the land cover comparison followed two steps 1 the visual assessment here we cross compared the cropland extent from the four evaluated products and against the corresponding cropland extents from gfsad and esa cci s2 and 2 comparing the absolute area of detected cropland here we estimated the cropland area from the short listed datasets from step 1 and compared them with the cropland area estimated from gfsad and esa cci s2 based on these steps one land cover product was selected and used in the subsequent analyses of soil moisture and aet 2 5 soil moisture conditions the hydrology of seasonal floodplain wetlands is complex and determined by multiple factors including the distance to the river groundwater levels soil properties atmospheric demands river overbank flow direct precipitation groundwater discharge and lateral flow from surrounding mountains burghof et al 2018 gabiri et al 2018 thus we studied the spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture stress resulting from different hydrological processes without investigating its underlying factors and sources multiple agricultural drought indicators are available comparing the actual aet to the potential pet evapotranspiration as a proxy to estimate soil moisture conditions schyns et al 2015 among those we selected the evaporative stress index esi as it identifies areas with soil moisture stress based on the land surface dryness without requiring many meteorological inputs anderson et al 2007 in fact esi is similar to other existing drought indicators schyns et al 2015 namely the crop water stress index jackson et al 1981 the water stress ratio narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 and the evaporative drought index yao et al 2010 esi is calculated as 1 esi 1 aet pet esi values vary between 0 and 1 and according to yao et al 2010 they can be grouped as wet esi 0 2 normal 0 2 esi 0 4 moderate 0 4 esi 0 6 severe 0 6 esi 0 8 and extreme dry soil moisture or drought esi 0 8 in the present study esi values of 0 7 were considered as the threshold for severe drought indicating a level of water deficit hampering crop growth the reason for shifting this threshold from 0 6 to 0 7 is that esi classification is based on its relationship with the 0 10 cm soil moisture yao et al 2010 while crop roots can reach deeper soil profiles until 50 cm depth and therefore extracting more water for transpiration savenije 2004 and hence having higher esi values to understand the soil moisture conditions in the relative sense the relative evaporative stress res index following esi is proposed res is calculated as follows 2 res cv 1 aet pet i 100 where 1 aet pet is calculated for a long term time series and can be calculated at various time steps i and cv is the coefficient of variation calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean value res represents the degree of variation or stability in esi time series in the higher the res high variability the less stable is the time series and vice versa the index can be applied at various spatial and temporal scales we used res to detect the risks and opportunities associated with dry season cultivation a res value of 20 for example means that the esi may deviate 20 from the long term average esi value implying a high stability in the esi time series in a specific location or pixel similarly a 50 res value indicate that esi value may disperse by half of the long term average esi value suggesting a highly unstable situation therefore we decided to calculate res following four classes res 20 20 res 30 30 res 40 and res 40 with our focus on the pre and post rice cropping niches esi and res had to be calculated at the highest possible spatial and intra annual temporal scales thus we used the evapotranspiration remote sensing products of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis mod16a2gf v006 the mod16a2gf product compromises information on aet and pet based on the penman monteith logic monteith 1965 at 500 m spatial resolution and at 8 day timesteps aet and pet were calculated over each cropland pixel and for each 8 day period throughout the year 46 8 day periods year for the entire available period of the products 2000 2019 we produced maps and time series of esi and res for each 8 day period 2000 2019 2 6 green water availability as crop water requirements refer to the amount of water needed to meet the plants water losses brouwer and heibloem 1986 aet appears to be a suitable indicator to assess green water or soil moisture availability since measured values of aet only occur when where there is water aet can serve as a minimum threshold to soil water available for crop use the inter annual aet was analyzed with particular focus on the identified pre and post rice cropping periods with soil moisture conditions sufficient for growing crops among several aet products available we used two products with high spatial and temporal resolutions namely wapor 250 m 10 day and ssebop 1000 m 10 day developed based on the concepts of etlook bastiaanssen et al 2012 pelgrum et al 2010 and operational simplified surface energy balance senay et al 2013 respectively both products were evaluated in several regions and climatic zones across africa showing high performance estimating aet e g over the hyper arid agricultural areas of egypt ayyad et al 2019 the volta river basin dembélé et al 2020 the nile river basin mcnamara et al 2021 and at continental scale blatchford et al 2020 weerasinghe et al 2020 we resampled the ssebop product to the spatial resolution of wapor 250 m using bilinear interpolation and created an ensemble mean of their aet values for each pixel for the entire common period of the two products 2009 2020 the reason for creating this ensemble mean was because despite their general good performance wapor and ssebop were reported to over and under estimate aet respectively mcnamara et al 2021 weerasinghe et al 2020 furthermore creating this ensemble mean of such well performing products with different constructing concepts can propagate potential uncertainties in the results and make them more realistic zhang et al 2016 actual evapotranspiration estimates of the ensemble mean product were tested by correlating them to values of an independent vegetation index the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the latter has a strong correlation with aet and is commonly used to assess aet product performance we used the ndvi product from modis mod13q1 v006 with 250 m resolution and 16 day timestep didan 2015 ndvi values below 0 1 correspond to non vegetated surfaces gandhi et al 2015 and were therefore masked out both the ndvi and aet ensemble mean products were compared on monthly basis 2009 2020 and a linear regression using r2 was applied to examine the correlation between the two datasets in our analysis we used the ensemble product to estimate and map aet for each 10 day period from 2009 to 2020 to understand and quantify the soil water availability across time and space over kilombero aet was calculated with intervals of 10 mm 10 day to simplify the visualization and interpretation of aet values for instance aet of 30 40 mm 10 day can easily be interpreted to approximately 3 4 mm day furthermore for the identified pre and post rice niches we calculated the aggregated aet for the entire duration of both niches to quantify the total water availability of these niches 3 results 3 1 land cover the land cover analysis revealed considerable disparities between products in capturing the extent of the cropland fig 3 compared to gfsad and esa cci s2 the wapor and cgls lc products showed consistent agreement on the extent and spatial distribution of cropland fig 3a d on the other hand esa cci partially miss captured the extent of the cropland area fig 3e while nearly no cropland was identified in the selected layers from mcd12q1 fig 3f marked in green which classified cropland as savanna or grassland thus mcd12q1 and esa cci were considered unsuitable to delineate cropland areas in kilombero which are nearly exclusively lowland rice cropland areas were also assessed for 2015 and 2016 yielding comparable results for wapor 2730 km2 cgls lc 2320 km2 gfsad 2515 km2 and esa cci s2 2725 km2 the cropland area estimated by wapor was nearly identical to that of esa cci s2 and compared well with that of gfsad thus we considered wapor to be the most reliable product for delineating rainfed rice cropland areas in kilombero 3 2 soil moisture conditions distinct temporal patterns of dry and wet seasons in kilombero result in a strong seasonality of soil moisture availability for crops as determined by the evaporative stress index esi fig 4 esi values of 0 2 indicate soil submergence while values 0 7 indicate a level of water deficit hampering crop growth fig 5 wettest soil moisture conditions were detected during the main rainy season between late february and mid may also representing the lowland rice growing period figs 4 and 5 on the other hand moderate soil moisture conditions that are potentially suitable for crop growth were observed during the pre rice cropping niche between early january and mid march as well as in the post rice cropping niche between mid may and late july crop cultivation without supplemental irrigation seems unfeasible between early august to mid december as indicated by severe soil dryness esi 0 7 in consequence potential niches for dry season crop cultivation occur 1 between mid december and late february approximately 70 days of soil moisture availability representing the cropping niche before the transplanting of wetland rice in early march and 2 between late may and late july approximately 65 days of soil moisture availability representing the cropping niche after the harvest of wetland rice in may besides these temporal patterns the stress index also highlights distinct spatial patterns by the end of the post rice niche from 20th to 27th of july we detected a total area of 1452 km2 with esi of 0 7 representing 53 of the total cropland area in kilombero similarly an area of 1637 km2 60 of cropland area with esi of 0 7 was detected at the beginning of the pre rice niche from 19th to 26th of july the southern and eastern croplands showed generally drier soil conditions i e higher esi than the northwestern croplands also the northwestern fringe areas seemed to have less soil moisture stress than all other areas the above highlighted pre rice and post rice cropping niches are possibly longer and with more reliable soil moisture availability in the north western cropland area as well as along the south eastern fringe of the floodplain the analysis of the relative stress index res provided further insights on the risks and opportunities of cultivating the pre and post rice niches figs 5 and 6 the rainy season march may exhibited res values between 9 and 20 in addition to the lowest esi long term mean values the res values indicated high inter annual variability 30 over the period from late december to mid february implying the high risks associated with cultivating during this period while res showed high stability 3 res 15 between june to mid december this represents the dry period and hence a stability of low soil moisture or drought with esi values 0 7 while pre rice cultivation is associated with high variability and consequently with a high risk of drought induced crop failure for farmers post rice cultivation recession cropping with or without supplemental irrigation appears promising for dry season cultivation with moderate soil moisture availability and little risk of drought related crop failure 9 res 15 3 3 green water availability the daily average 2009 2020 aet calculated from the ensemble product over the entire cropland area of kilombero floodplain was 2 63 mm day corresponding to approximately 960 mm year these aet values were compared to the ndvi by a linear regression at multi annual monthly basis fig 7 both variables correlated linearly and positively with r2 of 0 58 p 0 05 indicating a relatively good performance of our ensemble aet product the mean ensemble aet spatial and temporal distributions for each 10 day period are presented in figs 7 and 8 it is expected that aet values of the period march to may would be higher than the rest of the year with a noticeable decline in june that is the harvesting month this observed aet variability could be attributed to vegetation growth patterns as explained by the estimated ndvi during the rice growing season the roots enable higher aet rates through moisture access of deeper soil profile layers while in very sparse vegetation or bare soil conditions those deeper soil layers are disconnected from the evaporation fluxes and aet only occurs from the topsoil layer fig 7 the aet spatial distribution revealed no substantial variability over kilombero cropland for each 10 day period with dominating aet values of 10 40 mm 10 day throughout fig 8 the rainy season march may showed the highest aet mostly about 30 40 mm 10 day of the year over kilombero from mid december until late february aet had values between 20 and 40 mm 10 day over almost all kilombero cropland the post rice niche period in june and july showed that some cropland areas dry out faster with relatively lower aet range 10 30 mm 10 day the dry period from early august to early december was also confirmed to have the lowest aet 20 mm 10 day the aggregated aet of the pre and post rice niches are shown in fig 9a and b interestingly the pre rice niche 70 days showed higher aggregated aet value ranging from 50 to 350 mm fig 9a lower aggregated aet range 50 250 mm were estimated during the post rice niche of 60 days fig 9b the north western fringes areas exhibited the highest aggregated aet values particularly during the pre rice niche 4 discussion 4 1 suitability of using land cover and actual evapotranspiration datasets as demonstrated in the land cover analysis chapter 3 1 significant disparities were found among the different land cover products the errors can be as large as to miss capturing or even not capturing at all a specific land cover class using land cover products without evaluation can lead to drawing irrelevant and misleading conclusions regarding the study area and land cover class in question thus we emphasize the importance of evaluating a few land cover products for each individual case study and subsequently choosing one it is recommended to conduct cross comparisons between selected products and or to compare them against independent reference datasets as previously done at the country e g ayyad and khalifa 2021 continental e g fritz et al 2010 or global scales e g pérez hoyos et al 2017 evaluating land cover products is especially important when researching african croplands where multiple factors influence prevailing spatial discrepancies such as elevation dispersion cloud cover or size of fields nabil et al 2020 the cropland in kilombero is dominated by rainfed lowland rice which is often difficult to differentiate from wet savanna grassland and mcd12q1 and esa cci were unable to make this distinction in addition to the spatial consistency observed between wapor and gfsad and esa cci s2 chapter 3 1 the cropland area identified by wapor in 2015 2730 km2 also compared well with previously reported areas of kilombero cropland of about 2760 km2 in 2009 munishi and jewitt 2019 3000 km2 in 2014 thonfeld et al 2020a and 3253 679 km2 in 2014 thonfeld et al 2020b differences between these estimates and wapor are attributed to a portion of the cropland falling within the seasonally inundated area close to the river this temporarily submerged area of about 1100 km2 thonfeld et al 2020a consists actually of a savanna grassland grazed by ruminants during the dry season at the same time aet products should be used carefully in this study not only did our ensemble aet product correlate well with ndvi chapter 3 3 but also the calculated average aet value of 2 63 mm day 960 mm year compared very well with aet values reported in relevant studies for example the average aet value in the cropland areas from the ensemble product was 2 63 mm day 960 mm year weerasinghe et al 2020 estimated an aet value of 750 1000 mm year 2 05 2 74 mm day following the water balance closure in the rufiji basin näschen et al 2018 simulated hydrological fluxes in the kilombero basin and reported a similar aet range of 750 950 mm year 2 05 2 60 mm day in the sub basins covering the area of kilombero cropland similarly gabiri et al 2018 calculated the soil water fluxes in kilombero and reported an average annual aet value of 970 mm year 2 65 mm day in contrast senkondo et al 2019 estimated the daily average aet values over different land cover types using an ensemble mean derived from three aet models they found that the average daily aet over kilombero cropland was 3 5 mm day and that ssebop underestimated the aet values the difference between our estimates and theirs may be attributed to two factors i they used the esa cci land cover product which we earlier demonstrated its inaccuracy in capturing the extent of cropland in kilombero chapter 3 1 and ii their ensemble mean is constructed based on the surface energy balance concept solely while our ensemble blends the ssebop and etlook concepts chapter 2 6 4 2 soil moisture conditions and green water availability attention should be paid to the esi original classification chapter 2 5 yao et al 2010 highlighted the need to explore the application of the original classification in different ecosystems while the original classification considers esi of 0 6 to represent severe drought conditions in this study we used 0 7 as a threshold above which crop growth may be hampered esi values of 0 2 represent wet conditions according to the original classification in the case of kilombero the wettest esi conditions were found to be in the range of 0 2 0 4 figs 4 and 5 a range that represents normal drought conditions not negatively affecting crop performance based on the original esi classification thus we suggest that esi classification should be adapted to the specific case study similarly while we categorized res values into four classes res 20 20 res 30 30 res 40 and res 40 chapter 2 5 future studies may opt to categorize res differently according to the local conditions of the case study in question the spatial and temporal distributions of esi and aet showed agreements with findings of previous relevant studies in the region for instance the spatial distribution of our esi and aet ensemble product was consistent with findings of burghof et al 2018 and gabiri et al 2018 indicating the wetter conditions higher aet values and lower esi during most of the year in the northern and western fringes than all other areas in kilombero floodplain fig 4 and fig 8 gabiri et al 2018 attributed the wetter conditions at the fringes zones to the soil water storage and the low depth to groundwater level throughout the year in the remaining areas and due to the land cover changes in the basin a decrease in low flows and an increase in high flows affected the hydrological regime of the kilombero river i e inundation height and duration during the rainy season and surface groundwater interaction during the dry season and thus altering the soil water availability in the floodplain leemhuis et al 2017 the analyses of aet suggest that more green water is available in the pre rice niche than the post rice niche chapter 3 3 nevertheless the latter niche was found to be more stable over time low res which offers substantial opportunities for developing green water cultivation during this niche through recession cropping and with or without supplemental irrigation at the same time the pre rice niches showed higher variability in water availability and evaporative atmospheric demands higher res and thus cultivating during this period entails risk of drought or crop failure to the farmer chapter 3 2 here it seems reasonable to establish supplemental irrigation practices in the pre rice niches to cope with dry spells using existing irrigation canals alavaisha et al 2021 and rivers stemming from adjacent mountains wilson et al 2017 in some areas of kilombero our findings assessed and demonstrated green water availability before and after the wet season in kilombero the analyses of the absolute and relative green water availability provided useful insights as to when where and how reliable is green water availability beyond the wet season in view of maximizing the potential of agricultural production on existing cropland and with minimal impact on natural processes this can be done by shifting a portion of the nonproductive green water flows i e soil evaporation to productive vapor flows in form of crop transpiration rockström 2003 thus other water fluxes i e runoff and seepage shall not be significantly affected shifting aet fluxes to productive vapor flows will not only preserve natural processes and halt cropland expansion but will also contribute to improve the livelihoods food security and resilience of smallholder farming communities two important points should be considered when planning to shift the aet fluxes to productive crop transpiration first the estimated aet herein is the sum of soil evaporation plant transpiration and evaporation of intercepted rainwater transpiration the productive plants water consumption ranges from 66 to 92 of the total aet estimated over cropland globally miralles et al 2011 wang erlandsson et al 2014 wei et al 2017 this is especially important when designing cultivation strategies in the pre rice niche where interception of early season rainfall events will occur and thus not all the estimated aet in this niche will be available for the plants second it should be noted that in the pre and post rice niches with very sparse vegetation the estimated aet values only represent green water fluxes that occur primarily from the 2 5 cm topsoil layer anderson et al 2007 however more green water is likely to be available at deeper layers of the soil profile and thus the cropping niches could potentially be even longer for instance while we estimated a post rice niche of 65 days kangalawe and liwenga 2005 conducted participatory assessments and reported that the post rice soil moisture period in some areas in kilombero may last for three to six months on the other hand they further highlighted that some areas dry out shortly after the rains have ceased depending on the soil texture and the water holding capacity therefore differences in green water availability fig 8 can also be attributed to soil hydraulic properties e g soil texture organic matter saturated and residual water content water holding capacity and hydrologic soil group 4 3 prospect of sustainable intensification and diversification from an agronomic perspective several cropping options can well fit within the pre and post rice niches one the one hand rice double cropping may be possible in some areas where the availability of green water extends longer into the post rice niche moreover extended water availability may permit to growing long duration rice cultivars which are frequently economically and socially preferred changalima et al 2020 diversification options on the other hand may include a broad set of possibilities for instance some farmers in kilombero produce maize vegetables cassava cowpeas and pigeon peas gebrekidan et al 2020 höllermann et al 2021 and these crops can fit well within the detected niches also short cycled green manure crops can produce biofertilizer in the pre rice niche while deep rooted forage legumes such as stylosanthes can extract water from deeper soil layers thus extending the length of the post rice niche for producing forage for cattle feeding kwesiga et al 2020b moreover perishable vegetable crops particularly leafy vegetables can be grown for as long as water is available verhoeven and setter 2010 important considerations entail also the inter annual changes in soil moisture conditions across the cropland in the floodplain in the pre rice niche after a prolonged dry season the soil condition gradually changes from hard and dry to soft and wet triggered by the onset of rainfall events conversely the soil gradually moves from the wet and soft conditions back to the hard and dry conditions during the post rice niche after the seasonal inundation recedes towards the dry season these changes in the soil moisture conditions will partly govern the selection of pre and post rice crops for example the shift from hard dry to soft wet conditions in the pre rice niche may offer an opportunity to cultivate e g tuber crops such as cassava sweet potatoes and carrots which cannot be cultivated in the post rice niche because of the hard dry soil conditions by the harvest time however tuber crops in the pre rice niche will not be able to tolerate submergence conditions thus to avoid crop submergence and to increase the rooting depth building ridges for crop cultivation may be required in both niches implying hard physical labor or the use of machinery which can be economically challenging for low input farmers with limited resource endowment the changes in the soil aeration and physical status entail not only niche specific hydrologic dynamics but may also entail different dynamics in soil nitrogen availability with compact dry soils limiting root nutrient uptake in the later post rice niche and nitrate accumulation and subsequent leaching and denitrification losses limiting crop nitrogen availability during the pre rice niche yameogo et al 2021 although farmers follow specific planting dates for rainfed rice cultivation in kilombero they adjust their cropping calendars and the planting dates according to i the water level as it rises in the floodplain and ii the observed weather patterns e g direction of cloud formation and sound of thunder which may vary across the floodplain höllermann et al 2021 rice is usually planted between late february and early march but the planting date can vary across kilombero by a few days and between years by a few weeks depending on the onset of the rainy season kwesiga et al 2019 thus the planting time of the rainfed rice can shorten or prolong both the pre and post rice niches and thereby influence the choice of diversification crops in both niches and across the floodplain another critical determinant to crop selection is the proximity and availability of markets in the region perishable crops with a short storage life such as tubers crops e g carrots or other leafy vegetables e g cabbages need to be delivered to the market as soon as they have been harvested restricting this option to peri urban areas such as ifakara town in kilombero fig 1 coarse grains such as rice maize or sorghum have longer storage lives and may be thus preferred in remote or rural areas 4 4 broader implications of green water cultivation for africa and beyond green water contributes about 87 of the global cropland water consumption liu and yang 2010 and substantial opportunities exist towards building more productive agricultural rainfed systems relying on green water which can ultimately reduce the pressure on blue water resources wani et al 2009 in africa over 90 of cropland is rainfed xiong et al 2017a and depends on green water liu and yang 2010 that is much more available than blue water schuol et al 2008 yet only 5 of public agricultural water investments support rainfed agriculture in africa abrams 2018 our analyses of green water availability can guide investments in floodplain wetlands of ssa the detected patterns of water availability are crucial to inform farmers decision makers as well as international and national donors investors areas as to where and when investments will likely yield higher returns this is not only important for improving rainfed cultivation practices through improved field management techniques e g rainwater harvesting technologies biazin et al 2012 or native soil n management asante et al 2017 but also for considering irrigation investments where green water availability solely does not permit for crop cultivation here investing in supplemental irrigation will contribute to increasing the overall agricultural production and resilience to dry spells rockström et al 2010 as mentioned earlier wetlands and especially the seasonal floodplain wetlands contribute significantly to livelihood and food security in ssa rebelo et al 2010 therefore creating more sustainable intensification and diversification options in floodplain environments such as efficiently exploiting available green water availability can significantly contribute to improving food security and livelihoods by realizing the agricultural potential while halting the cropland expansion an expansion that is not needed to meet both today s and future biomass demands mauser et al 2015 although applied to rather local scales of floodplain environments implementing and upscaling such green water management strategies can play a pivotal role towards a much needed shift in the african water management falkenmark 2018 on a broader scale these strategies can ultimately contribute to keeping agriculture within the safe operating space of the planet boundaries rockström et al 2017 while realizing multiple sgds simultaneously 4 5 limitations and future research remote sensing datasets with extensive spatial and temporal coverage provide large opportunities for a wide range of agricultural studies jindo et al 2021 however challenges may prevail due to entailed uncertainties of using such datasets karimi and bastiaanssen 2015 validation of these datasets is thus imperative yet challenging and sometimes is unfeasible due to the scarcity of ground data and the mismatches between gridded and ground datasets for instance to validate remotely sensed aet estimates they can be compared against in situ measurements from eddy covariance towers lysimeter systems or by the water balance closure allen et al 2011 such measurements were not obtainable in kilombero creating an ensemble mean of reported aet products with good performance and already documented uncertainties can thus provide a reasonable alternative further despite uncertainties associated with the mod16a2gf products for aet and pet running et al 2019 our calculations relied on their relative rather than absolute values for calculating esi and res to identify the pre and post rice niches chapter 2 5 nonetheless future research should validate the spatial and temporal boundaries and the quantified aet of the identified niches although the chosen products in this study were carefully selected evaluated and demonstrated good performance we recommend using locally produced calibrated datasets whenever possible when applying the proposed methodological approach in future research the scale of the study should also be considered when choosing specific remote sensing products this study looked at the full extent of cropland areas and thus the selected products were considered to have sufficient spatial resolution 100 500 m when looking at smaller scales e g field or plot level aet and cropland maps of higher resolutions 10 30 m can be derived from satellite images with higher resolutions e g landsat and sentinel there is also a critical need for operational and temporally dynamic land cover products to better understand the intra annual changes in cropland areas of seasonal floodplain wetlands although it was beyond the scope of this study an agronomic analysis that classifies crop functional traits and determines their fit within specific cropping niches is needed to target and extrapolate sustainable crop intensification and diversification strategies future research can further refine our results by investigating soil properties through field studies to assess soil suitability and to understand why some cropland areas dry out faster in the post rice niche in the light of reported findings herein further field experiments combined with stakeholder analysis and aspiration mapping e g höllermann et al 2021 are needed to identify and spatially target future site and system specific land use strategies for sustainable diversification and intensification of seasonal floodplain wetlands to ensure the transferability of the findings of this research the approach proposed in this study needs to be tested and validated in other seasonal floodplain wetlands in ssa thus it is imperative to detect and analyze seasonal floodplain wetlands in ssa with similarities to kilombero to which the suggested approach could be extrapolated and niche specific targeting of crop diversification be applied 5 conclusions using kilombero as a case study we could show that seasonal floodplain environments exhibit substantial potential for future sustainable crop intensification and diversification in sub saharan africa farmers cultivating floodplains use submergence water to grow rice during the wet season before and after the wet season farming activities are limited mainly due to water un availability and variability we proposed a methodological approach that relies on open access remote sensing datasets and permits to identify where when and how much green water is likely to be available beyond the rice cropping season land cover products showed huge disparities in extracting cropland areas with wapor being the best performing product to delineate areas under rainfed rice production in kilombero furthermore creating an ensemble mean of reportedly well performing actual evapotranspiration aet products seems to be a viable option for data scarce regions such as kilombero herein the ensemble mean product of wapor and ssebop demonstrated good quality for estimating aet in kilombero green water is available both before and after the rice cropping season the analyses of the ensemble mean aet product suggests that more green water is available in the pre rice than the post rice niches and that distinct spatial patters of water availability are apparent both the evaporative stress index and the newly proposed relative evaporative stress index appear to be suitable indicators to analyze and map soil moisture conditions in these so far unexploited cropping niches sustainable cultivation practices using green water in seasonal floodplain wetlands provide tremendous opportunities to intensify agricultural production and consequently improving farmer livelihoods not only in kilombero but also in other seasonal floodplains of sub saharan africa and beyond declaration of competing interest the authors

9493,border irrigation is one of the most ancient but at the same time still widely applied irrigation methods across the world due to the intrinsic characteristics of the method the water volumes involved are often difficult to measure and this implies a large uncertainty in the estimation of water use efficiency in this study we analyze the results of an extensive monitoring campaign which was carried out over the agricultural season 2021 and was aimed at detecting the actual performance of border irrigation in different experimental fields located in the padana plain i e the largest irrigated plain in the eu in particular three maize fields characterized by different soil textures irrigation scheduling and rainfall conditions were considered the number of irrigation events their duration and the water amounts applied were examined and compared with the actual crop water requirements assessed by using the aquacrop os agro hydrological model the performance of border irrigation evaluated through a water use efficiency indicator was assessed for the monitored agricultural season as well as simulated over the last 28 years 1993 2020 to detect potential effects of different weather conditions the main results show that the flow rate applied during each irrigation event ranges from 11 to 18 l s 1 per unit width m of the irrigated strip whereas the irrigation event duration varies between 80 and 130 min ha 1 and substantially reflects the irrigation flow rate and the plot slope the latter being variable between 2 and 7 the water use efficiency is highly dependent on the irrigation management namely the flowrate and the scheduling of the irrigation events with a minimum value of 16 and a maximum of 56 the same range of efficiency was obtained for the last 28 years mainly as a consequence of the application of a rigid irrigation scheduling determined by the rotation period these findings provide useful information for improving the management of border irrigation in practice and more specifically to understand what margin of improvement can be obtained in terms of water use efficiency both under current conditions and in view of future increasing freshwater scarcity keywords border irrigation irrigation efficiency water use efficiency irrigation model aquacrop maize 1 introduction the demand for freshwater resources is on the rise and this trend is likely to continue with population growth and the increasing demand for food and cereals koech and langat 2018 there is also increased awareness about the need to provide enough water to sustain other ecological and environmental services thenkabail et al 2011 there appears to be growing consensus that irrigated agriculture in general is up against a future with less water scardigno 2020 this calls for a higher efficiency in the use of freshwater resources for irrigation a concept that is technically called water use efficiency wue stanhill 1986 although the wue strongly depends on crop soil and meteorological conditions a wide variability among irrigation methods is also expected sprinkler and drip irrigation systems seem to have gained a more prominent position in agriculture 4 0 in comparison to surface irrigation techniques since they are considered high efficiency irrigation methods and thus they are supported by public incentives rose et al 2021 as a result in many european countries along the mediterranean a radical shift is taking place in most agricultural areas from traditional surface irrigation methods to pressurized ones berbel et al 2019 however the effects of this shift which mainly entails a change in terms of infrastructure are not necessarily all positive as important repercussions were observed in many case studies such as an increase of energy costs baccour et al 2021 for example following the shift irrigation agriculture has become a major customer of electricity companies in spain with consumption increasing nineteen fold from 1950 to 2007 the consumption per hectare increased by a factor of 2 7 over the same period currently irrigation agriculture is the second largest electricity consumer in spain after adif the company that manages high speed rail consuming 2 37 of the electricity produced in spain it follows that the sustainability of irrigation agriculture in this context has a new hindering factor in its high energy consumption in light of these concerns new soft path strategies aimed at improving traditional irrigation techniques and increasing their water use efficiency are emerging through bottom up initiatives in the form of information and pilot project actions with the purpose to assess the potential of innovative surface irrigation management strategies fostering the collective sharing of the modernization objectives masseroni et al 2017 among the different types of surface irrigation border irrigation is the most common method for the irrigation of row crops in the world and it is particularly common in australia koech and langat 2018 northern china liu et al 2020 and southern europe masseroni et al 2021 borders are irrigated by diverting a stream of water from the channel to the upper end of the border the water flows down the slope and when the desired amount of water has been delivered to the border the stream is turned off this may occur before the water has reached the end of the border there are no specific rules for this decision which is typically made based on the farmer s experience if the flow is stopped too soon there may not be enough water in the border to complete the irrigation at the far end if it is left running for too long then water may run off the end of the border and or generate excessive percolation as a result the wue will mainly reflect the farmer s behavior during each irrigation event which will also be strongly connected with the availability of water the field topography and size the soil characteristics and whether conditions berthold et al 2021 therefore experimental campaigns that involve both the monitoring of irrigation volumes and the assessment of crop water requirements on real world case studies are needed to understand the margin for improvement that could be obtained by adopting new more efficient border irrigation management strategies in this work we examine the results obtained over the 2021 agrarian season on three experimental fields cultivated with maize located in the padana plain the largest irrigated plain in northern italy and in europe from an extensive monitoring campaign of border irrigation events looking at their frequency duration and water amounts in comparison with the actual crop water requirements simulated through agro hydrological modelling specifically the effect of different soil characteristics irrigation scheduling and weather conditions was discussed the analysis was then also extended to the last 28 irrigation seasons 1993 2020 to assess the water use efficiency over a longer period of time 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of the experimental sites the irrigation performances at three maize fields located in two different areas of the padana plain were monitored during the agricultural season 2021 the first two fields fields a and b which are approximately 1 5 ha in size each are located 2 km away from each other in the area south of lake garda within the same 130 ha irrigation district the ponte trento irrigation district masseroni et al 2021 instead the third field field c approx 8 ha is located in the south east of the city of milan a couple of kilometers away from the lambro river and about 150 km from the other two both experimental sites are characterized by a humid subtropical climate according to the köppen geiger classification system kottek et al 2006 specifically they show a transitional climate between the mediterranean climate dominated by anticyclonic patterns and the central european climate dominated by the oceanic influence of westerly circulations confalonieri et al 2009 the seasonality of the most relevant agro meteorological variables is presented for both sites in fig 1a d specifically rainfall global radiation air temperature and humidity wind speed and reference crop evapotranspiration eto calculated based on the fao penman monteith equation described by allen et al 1998 over 1993 2020 these data were derived from daily meteorological data obtained from two agro meteorological stations managed by the regional protection agency arpa that are located 25 km far from fields a and b and 15 km far from field c respectively during the agricultural season april october the average temperature at the experimental sites is about 20 c with maximum values reaching 33 c in july the air humidity is high throughout the year which implies the presence of foggy months during winter and hot and muggy months over summer the wind speed is high in spring march and april relatively higher in field a and b but below 2 5 m s 1 on average the pattern of global radiation is similar across the sites with the intensity peaking in summer on average about 250 w m 2 in june for field a and b and 300 w m 2 in july for field c eto follows the pattern of global radiation in both sites with a maximum in july of about 150 mm and a seasonal cumulative value of about 770 mm yearly rainfall distribution shows two relative maxima in spring and autumn and two relative minima in winter and summer whereas the average values of total rainfall during the agricultural season april october over the years 1993 2020 are 289 mm for fields a and b and 479 mm for field c but with a pronounced year to year variability in year 2021 for example values of 294 mm for fields a and b and 330 mm for field c were observed within the ponte trento district irrigation water is diverted through the virgilio canal the main canal deriving up to 24 m3 s 1 from the mincio river and delivered to the fields including field a and b through a dense and ramified network of concrete irrigation canals in contrast the irrigation water supplied to field c is diverted directly from the lambro river and delivered to the field through a series of open air vegetated ditches at both experimental sites water is distributed on rotation based on a rigid schedule defined by the local irrigation agency which provides for an interval of 7 days for fields a and b and 15 days for field c in both cases the irrigation method used is border strip irrigation although with two different configurations within fields a and b the water flows onto the field through a series of steel gates which are opened manually in sequence to supply water to each strip starting from the main supply canal located at the upper end of the field fig 2a in field c the water is pumped from the head ditch onto the field since the water surface in the ditch is about 2 m below the ground level during irrigation a centrifugal pump is connected to a tractor as shown in fig 2b and it is moved to the head of each strip sequentially until the field is fully irrigated although this configuration requires energy for water pumping it is largely practiced across the padana plain due to its greater versatility compared to the former one especially in large plots where a large flowrate is required to irrigate evenly the whole length of the plot in both configurations once the water is released onto the field it is gravity driven following the longitudinal slope of the field for fields a and b the slope was accurately measured at the end of the 2021 season through a photogrammetric flight performed by means of a dji mavic 2 pro drone featuring a hasselblad l1d 20c camera and its 20mpx 1 cmos sensor for field c instead the slope was derived from a digital terrain model dtm 1 1 m ground resolution of a lidar flight performed in 2015by the regional authority over a vast area comprising the experimental field on average the longitudinal slope is around 6 5 for fields a and b and about 2 for field c the dtm of the three experimental fields is shown in fig 3a c and additional information about the photogrammetric flight on field a and b is reported in appendix 1 all fields at both sites were sowed with maize but the crop growing stages were different in fields a and c the crop was sowed at the end of march whereas in field b the crop was sowed in mid june after the harvesting of the lolium cover crop in field a the crop was harvested in mid august whereas in field b in the middle of october in both cases it was chopped for ensiling in field c the crop was harvested at the end of september and used for grain with regards to soil properties five soil samples were collected at 0 5 10 15 30 35 50 55 and 70 75 cm of depth at the center of each experimental field roughly where soil moisture probes were installed see par 2 2 with the aim to evaluate soil texture and indirectly soil hydrological proprieties the latter through the use of pedo transfer functions implemented within the agro hydrological model used for estimating crop water requirements see par 2 3 the soil of fields a and b resulted to have properties which are typical of morainic terrains their texture was predominantly sandy sandy loam with a skeleton higher than 30 the soil of field c was completely different from the first two and it was typical of alluvial plains i e characterized by a silty clay clay loam soil texture no vertical pattern in soil layers were found in the fields which can thus be considered homogeneous along the vertical profile the water table depth is about 5 m from the ground surface for fields a and b which makes it possible to neglect potential crop water uptakes from the capillary fringe for field c during the irrigation season the water table depth is 2 m from the ground level on average and the crop water uptake from the capillary fringe was thus considered in the crop water requirement modeling additional information about the three monitored fields is summarized in table 1 2 2 instrumentation and monitoring activity two weather stations equipped with a rain gauge a radiometer an anemometer and thermo hygrometer were installed nearby the experimental fields at the beginning of the 2021 agrarian season in order to monitor agro meteorological variables the first one is a rubicon weather station rubicon water au which was installed very close to the point where the water for irrigating the ponte trento district is diverted from the virgilio canal i e about 600 m from field a and 1 5 km from field b the second one is a atmos41 weather station meter group usa equipped with the same sensors of the rubicon station that was installed about 200 m from field c in addition five soil moisture probes were installed at the experimental fields for evaluating soil water status during the whole irrigation season specifically in field a a drill drop sentek technology au was installed in the middle of the central strip it was plugged into the soil down to a depth of about 70 cm this probe uses a capacitance frequency domain reflectometry technology and is equipped with pre normalized moisture sensors every 10 cm of depth with inbuilt default calibration equations in field b instead four teros 12 volumetric soil water content probes meter group usa were installed in a trench along a vertical profile the sensor body being vertical and needles horizontal at a depth of 10 30 50 and 70 cm these sensors are also based on a capacitance technology and provided with inbuilt default calibration equations both types of probes were connected to their own datalogger and data were downloaded in situ every two weeks to avoid data overflow in the internal memory in field c three drill drop sentek technology au were installed at about 30 80 and 130 m to the head of the field to accurately monitor soil moisture along the longitudinal direction which is about twice the length of fields a and b all probes were plugged into the soil down to 70 cm of depth and data were sent to a dedicated cloud through a gsm transmission in all cases data were collected with an hourly time resolution and were aggregated to a daily scale to be used for modeling see par 2 3 the water volume applied during each irrigation event was calculated as the product of two elements water flow rate and irrigation event duration for fields a and b the flow rate was calculated within the main supply canal located in the upper end of the fields i e where the flow can reasonably be considered to be in a steady uniform condition and well determined by the chezy formula ven te chow 1959 1 q k s a r 2 3 i where q is the flow rate a is the fluid section area r is the hydraulic radius i is the canal slope and ks is the gauckler strickler roughness parameter the canal at the top of fields a and b has a trapezoidal shape the geometry of the cross section was evaluated with a graduated rod whose precision is 1 mm while the canals slope was measured using a portable global positioning system gps grs 1 topcon japan vertical accuracy of 2 5 mm by positioning it at 10 points on the bottom of the canals along their overall length obtaining values of approx 0 5 and 1 0 for field a and field b respectively in order to reduce the measurement error we took five measurements at each point and considered their average for determining the vertical position the water level in the canal during each irrigation event was measured manually with a graduated rod whose precision is 1 mm the roughness parameter was calibrated comparing the flow rate measured by a manual portable magnetic inductive flow meter flow sensor nautilus c 2000 ott usa with that estimated by the chezy formula under flowrate stationary conditions at the beginning of the irrigation season i e when the canals were filled with water in particular the flow rate in the canal was estimated by using the so called conventional current meter methodology wmo 2010 described in detail in peruzzi et al 2021 and in appendix 2 the results of the calibration led to obtain a roughness parameter of about 75 m1 3 s 1 for the canal serving field a and 71 m1 3 s 1 for the canal serving field b in field c instead the flow rate was derived by combining the pump characteristics with its rotational speed during irrigation the centrifugal pump used for irrigation was the atm35 model veneroni italy equipped with a 350 mm diameter discharge pipe the flow rate is related to the pump rotational speed by the following linear relationship 2 q 1 q 2 n 1 n 2 where n1 is the nominal rotational speed of 540 rpm q1 is the corresponding flow rate equal to 450 l s 1 according to the theoretical operating curve considering a pump head of 2 m n2 is the actual rotational speed and q2 is the corresponding flow rate during each irrigation event n2 was maintained constant and ranged between 390 and about 480 rpm in the different events the watering time of each strip of all experimental fields was measured using a chronometer during every irrigation event 2 3 estimation of crop water requirements the crop water requirements of the experimental fields were estimated by using aquacrop os model version 6 0 foster et al 2017 steduto et al 2012 this model simulates the soil water balance as well as crop growth processes as a function of crop soil weather and irrigation management input data with a daily time step it separately computes actual transpiration ta and soil evaporation es the daily actual crop water requirement etc act is obtained as the sum of ta and es which are respectively computed as follows 3 t a k s c c k c tr e t 0 and 4 e s k r 1 c c k ex e t 0 where et0 is the reference evapotranspiration kc tr is the maximum standard crop transpiration coefficient non dimensional or maximum basal crop coefficient when the canopy cover cc is equal to 100 cc is the actual green crop canopy cover ks 0 1 is the water stress coefficient ke x is the soil evaporation coefficient for fully wet and non shaded soil surface non dimensional and kr 0 1 is the evaporation reduction coefficient raes et al 2012 thus the computation of both et components is mainly tied to the simulated crop canopy cover cc despite being very different from the fao56 approach allen et al 1998 which is typically based on the combination of crop coefficients kc and phenological stages this method has the advantage that simulated model outputs can be related directly to easily accessible data from visual field observations and remote sensing according to raes et al 2012 the model estimates the cc evolution in time within three distinct phases i the first phase begins at the crop emergence and ends when half of the maximum cc ccx is attained ii the second phase follows the previous one until ccx is reached and iii the third phase begins when senescence starts and ends with the harvest an exponential function of time is used in the 1st and 2nd phases beginning with the canopy cover when 90 emergence has occurred cco and using a growth rate defined by the canopy growth coefficient cgc the third and last phase refers to the decline of green canopy cover and its shape is defined by the canopy decline coefficient cdc therefore to parameterize the cc curves it is necessary to use the four mentioned parameters cco ccx cgc and cdc the soil volume extends from the soil surface to the lower limit of the root zone the soil volume is subdivided into two macro layers the top one evaporative layer represents the upper few centimeters of the soil while the bottom one transpirative layer represents the root zone and has a time varying depth based on the development of the crop roots the representation of hydrological processes is one dimensional the bottom layer can be divided into five different horizons of variable depth each with its own physical characteristics the characteristics are the water retention in the fine soil fraction at saturation θsat field capacity θfc and at permanent wilting point θpwp and the hydraulic conductivity of the soil at saturation ksat indicative values are provided by aquacrop for various soil texture classes or they can be derived from soil texture by using pedo transfer functions saxton and rawls 2006 which are already implemented in the model the soil description is completed by specifying the depth of the groundwater table and its variation in time the upward flow from the shallow groundwater table to the top soil is estimated by considering the soil type and its hydraulic characteristics through an exponential empirical equation which ties capillarity raise to the depth of the water table below the soil surface a schematic of the calculation scheme of the aquacrop model is shown in fig 4 lastly a new approach for describing watering in border conditions was implemented in the model which adopts fixed irrigation depths and irrigation rotations in the simulations 2 3 1 model parametrization and calibration the aquacrop model uses a large number of parameters that represent crop and soil characteristics default parameters are already included in the model for different types of crops and soils but for an accurate simulation they should be adjusted using field or remote sensed observations in particular canopy cover parameters cco ccx cgc and cdc were calibrated using the leaf area index lai derived from sentinel 2 images 10 10 m of resolution through the biophysical 10 mop tool of the copernicus snap software specifically the cc was obtained from lai information by applying the hsiao et al 2009 formula eq 5 5 cc 1 005 1 e 0 6 lai 1 2 specifically the lai information derived from the sentinel map was firstly averaged over the field and then converted into cc by using eq 5 fig 5a c shows the canopy cover curve in comparison with satellite observations for each experimental field the goodness of fit was evaluated by using the determination coefficient r2 as proposed by paredes et al 2015 this resulted higher than 0 8 for fields a and c whereas it was about 0 6 for field b potentially as a consequence of a low quality of the satellite images in that area for 2021 once obtained the canopy cover parameters cc0 ccx cgc cdc the soil hydrological properties θsat θfc θpwp and ksat were also adjusted by fitting the aquacrop simulated soil moisture patterns with those observed through the soil moisture probes to this end the rooted soil stratum was divided into two layers an upper one 10 cm deep where evaporative processes mostly occur and a lower one of variable depth according to root growth where root water uptake for plant transpiration mostly takes place the water content of the first layer was assumed equal to the value measured by the most superficial sensor while that of the lower layer was computed as the average of the values measured by the sensors falling inside the layer itself roots were assumed to be able to explore a maximum of 1 m at full plant growth the calibration results not shown led to a good fit between simulated and observed soil water content especially during the peaks following rain or irrigation events the goodness of fit was evaluated in this work through the root mean square error rmse which resulted to be very small in all experimental fields and in both layers specifically below 0 1 m3 m 3 in the evaporative layer and below 0 04 m3 m 3 in the transpirative one calibrated crop and soil model parameters are reported in table 2 2 4 irrigation performance indicator the irrigation performance was evaluated through the water use efficiency wue indicator which was calculated as proposed by bouman et al 2005 and fernández et al 2020 6 wue 100 et c act i r where i is the amount of water supplied through irrigation and r is rainfall the wue computed using eq 6 represents the share of water effectively used by the crop out of the total supplied water it strongly depends on the irrigation management since with border irrigation even more than with other methods it largely influences the uniformity and adequacy of the water distribution onto the field first the wue was calculated for the 2021 agrarian season then its variability was analyzed over the last 28 years to investigate the effect of different seasonal weather conditions on border irrigation performances in this second analysis crop growth parameters and irrigation management criteria were assumed to be the same as for 2021 specifically irrigation events were triggered when the following two conditions were true i water supply was available according to the rotation period ii the soil water content in the transpirative layer was lower than a fixed threshold the threshold value was derived for each of the three experimental fields from the analysis of the monitored irrigation events during the agricultural season 2021 3 results 3 1 irrigation volume and depth the number of irrigation events their duration and the supplied water amounts reported in terms of flow rate per unit of width and of water depth are presented in table 3 during the 2021 agrarian season the farmers performed 10 irrigation interventions in field a 11 in field b and 3 in field c the flow rate was about 18 l s 1 m 1 in fields a and c and 11 l s 1 m 1 in field b the irrigation events duration was about 80 min ha 1 in field a 120 min ha 1 in field b and 130 min ha 1 in field c whereas irrigation depth resulted about 150 mm in field a 240 mm in field b and 260 mm in field c with regards to the frequency of irrigation events in fields a and b the first irrigation was carried out immediately after sowing and interrupted for about two months in field a and one month in field b due to the occurrence of significant precipitations 146 mm in field a and 67 mm in field b see also fig 6 after that irrigations were performed roughly once per week making full use of the scheduled availability on average the antecedent soil moisture condition before each irrigation event was 0 15 m3 m 3 in the field a and 0 17 m3 m 3 in the field b with a low standard deviation approx 0 02 m3 m 3 in both fields in contrast in field c irrigation was not necessary after sowing since the soil remained wet enough until mid june thanks to the rain events alone 167 mm and to a higher soil water retention capacity instead irrigations were carried out once the crop was fully developed specifically in between mid june and mid august the antecedent soil moisture condition before the three irrigation interventions performed in the field c is on average 0 29 m3 m 3 with a standard deviation of 0 01 m3 m 3 no trend in irrigation water amounts were observed throughout the irrigation season across all experimental fields except for the first irrigation in field a that was about 20 mm higher than the mean value over the season this was the farmer s personal choice his idea being to balance the higher infiltration capacity of the soil expected just after the sowing works 3 2 soil water balance the effect of incoming fluxes irrigation and rainfall on the daily soil water content swc in the root zone is presented in fig 6a c the swc was compared with both the total available water taw and the critical soil moisture content cmc and analyzed over 2021 agrarian season at the three experimental fields generally irrigations at all sites were applied before the cmc was depleted except for field c where the crop seems to have suffered overall 5 days of slight water stress between mid july and mid august on average the threshold below which irrigation was triggered resulted to be approx 85 of taw in fields a and b and 65 in field c i e when the deficit to field capacity is only approximately 25 mm in field a 18 mm in b and 80 mm in field c the large difference between these values for fields a and b and field c is due both to soil characteristics taw are respectively 110 120 and 230 mm and to the extremely risk averse attitude of farmers a and b who irrigate when the soil water content is still much larger than cmc a considerable portion of the water supplied for irrigation in fields a and b is lost through percolation the loss of water from the soil through this process happened more rapidly than that achieved by root uptake as shown by the change of slope of the swc depletion curve when it is found above or below the taw level percolation following irrigation events was approx 1046 mm for field a 2107 mm for field b and 138 mm for field c over the entire season in all experimental fields percolation occurred at each irrigation intervention and when daily rainfall exceeded about 25 mm in fields a and b and 30 mm in field c 3 3 water use efficiency the seasonal water balance fluxes in terms of cumulated amounts of irrigation water rainfall and crop evapotranspiration are reported in table 4 the values refer to the period from seeding to harvest for all experimental fields since the periods are different the total amounts of rainfall r and crop evapotranspiration etc act also differ across the fields during the 2021 agrarian season crop evapotranspiration ranged from about 440 mm field b to 560 mm field c whereas rainfall was only able to satisfy a portion of the potential crop evapotranspiration etc ranging between 30 and 50 the remaining part was supplied through irrigation that ranged from about 670 mm field c to 2700 mm field b the values of water use efficiency ranged between a minimum value in field b 16 and a maximum in field c 56 the results of the wue simulations over the last 28 years 1993 2020 are presented in fig 7a c it can be noticed that despite a wide range of rainfall conditions across the years the wue remains consistent with that found for 2021 at each experimental field with an average of 10 interventions in field a and b and 3 in the field c this behavior is inherently linked with the rigid distribution that does not allow for irrigations outside of the fixed rotation planned by the irrigation agency but it also depends very significantly from the different farmers attitudes towards the risk of crop water stress moreover no significant water stress conditions occurred over the season in each year highlighting that the current irrigation management tends to be cautious nevertheless a significant correlation was found throughout the years between rainfall and irrigation amounts i e 0 43 in field a 0 60 in field b and 0 37 in field c clearly the correlation is low when the frequency of potential irrigations is low i e less flexibility in irrigation however it shows that farmers as much as possible try to avoid irrigation when they consider rainfall amounts to be suitable to satisfy crop water requirements 4 discussion from the analysis of collected data the flow rate per unit of width was on average 16 l s 1 m 1 about twice as higher than that suggested for high performance closed end border irrigations in sandy soils and three times higher than that for silty clay soils liu et al 2020 however the experimental evidence demonstrated that these flowrates were necessary to grant the propagation of the overland flow till the end of the strips in a reasonable time the range of variation of the irrigation depths between 150 and 250 mm appears quite high compared to the values generally reported in literature typically between 100 and 150 mm see e g bjorneberg 2013 nevertheless they reflect the irrigation management in an average year 2021 where the standard water supply was fully delivered by the irrigation agency with regard to the wue it was 30 16 and 56 respectively for the field a b and c the values observed for fields a and b are quite far from what reported in brouwer et al 1989 i e values around 60 however this result is once again connected to the higher drainage capacity of soils in fields a and b but also to rigidity of the water delivery with fixed rotation period which clearly drives farmers to irrigate more frequently than needed to avoid any risk of crop water stress particularly when the available soil water capacity is smaller this is more evident for field a fig 6a where in july only once the irrigation was not applied on the regular weekly rotation despite that total rainfall depth amounted to 50 of potential crop evapotranspiration 83 and 168 mm respectively concerning the effects of field layout and irrigation management on the performance of border irrigation table 5 summarizes the main variables describing layout and management grouped in three macro category geometrical kinematics and management the experimental evidence suggests that they contribute equally to the pattern of wue in the three case studies the differences in soil characteristics between the first two fields sandy sandy loam and field c silty clay clay loam explain the differences between the two fixed rotation planned by the irrigation agency i e 7 days for the field a and b and 15 day for the field c more in detail the readily available soil water raw content which can be recognized by the difference between taw and cmc curves in fig 6 is on average 55 mm for fields a 70 mm for the field b whereas it is about 130 mm for field c if the mid and late crop growing stages are considered i e when crop roots are fully developed this drives farmers a and b to irrigate their fields more frequently than farmer c since the soil water storage capacity in the first two fields is lower than in the third nevertheless comparing the frequency of irrigation interventions between fields a and b i e under the same irrigation rotation the observations show that in the field b the farmer triggers irrigation when the water depletion in the root zone calculated as the difference between taw and irrigation threshold is on average 18 mm 85 of taw i e 50 less than the field a 25 mm 77 of taw in the field c instead water depletion in the root zone is 80 mm i e 65 of taw this huge difference in irrigation management is one of the reasons determining the large difference of wue values with a maximum of 56 in field c a minimum as low as 16 in field b and an intermediate value of 30 in field a a further variable that most likely affects the difference between wue of the field a and b is the mean overland flow velocity during irrigation intervention calculated by the ratio between the field length and the time elapsed from the start of the irrigation to the instant when the water front reached the end of the strip equal to the irrigation duration velocity values resulted of 420 m h 1 in field a to 170 m h 1 in the field b in spite that the field slopes are very similar approx 6 5 these values are consistent with the flow rate per unit field width during the irrigation interventions which was on average 18 l s 1 m 1 for the field a and 11 l s 1 m 1 for the field b moreover the mean flow velocity was found to be correlated with field layout and in particular with the strip width despite the strips have about the same area approx 0 36 ha the field b is characterized by a strip width about two times larger than field a considering that the nominal flowrate is about the same in the field a and b the larger width of b reduces the advancement velocity of the overland flow front with the consequence of requiring longer irrigation durations per unit surface in fact irrigation events duration of the field b 120 min ha 1 resulted about 50 more than field a 80 min ha 1 to allow the water to reach the end of the strip during each irrigation intervention 5 conclusions in this work three experimental fields cultivated with maize and characterized by different types of soil irrigation scheduling and weather conditions were subject to an extensive monitoring campaign with the purpose to understand the current level of water use efficiency of the border irrigation practice in northern italy observed values revealed that irrigation durations and amounts exceed those that can be found in the albeit quite scarce literature on border irrigation practice our analysis corroborates the evidence that water use efficiency is strongly related to the water management strategy adopted by farmers during irrigation events and in particular it reflects the variations in soil water threshold below which irrigation was triggered moreover the observations suggest a well calibrated field layout with respect to the available flowrate could significantly increase border irrigation efficiency these results can be considered very significant in view of the implementation of new water management strategies aimed at improving the efficiency of border irrigation our analysis confirms that there is a large potential for improving performance levels of border irrigation with potential positive repercussions in terms of water savings as well as environmental and economic sustainability the next goal will be to investigate the water amounts that could be saved for each irrigation event without jeopardizing a uniform distribution of water on the field during irrigation interventions this study may help farmers prepare for any changes in water availability as a consequence of political decisions and or altered climate patterns a key challenge will be to translate these findings into operational guidelines and best practices allowing to keep alive the tradition of border irrigation but increasing its efficiency declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported

the end of the 2021 agrarian season through a photogrammetric flight performed by means of a dji mavic 2 pro drone mounting onboard an hasselblad l1d 20c camera and its 20mpx 1 cmos sensor the acquired images were processed with the photogrammetric software agisoft metashape version 1 7 0 referring to field a survey a total of 366 images acquired at about 36 5 m a g l and a ground sample distance gsd of 0 8 cm were processed and georeferenced on the basis of 11 well distributed ground control points gcps previously surveyed by gnss techniques with a leica gs14 receiver in nrtk mode and with spatial accuracy at centimeter level the obtained model resulted with accuracies of 1 0 cm and 2 5 cm in the planimetric and altimetric components respectively when compared with 4 control points cps surveyed as the gcps but not considered in the bundle block adjustment for accuracy estimation purposes a derived digital terrain model dtm at 3 17 cm ground resolution was then used for precise slope determination concerning field b 197 images were taken at about 44 m a g l and gsd of 1 3 cm on the field 10 gcps and 5 cps were surveyed similarly as previously described leading to a photogrammetric model with accuracies of 1 1 cm and 4 1 cm in planimetry and altimetry respectively in this case the field slope determination was based on a derived dtm with 3 77 cm ground resolution appendix 2 the flow rate in the irrigation consortium channel was estimated by using the so called conventional current meter methodology wmo 2010 more in details the velocities were measured in seven vertical transects for each representative cross section by placing the current meter in three selected positions along the vertical direction i e starting from the bottom equals to 20 40 and 80 of the local water height y z once acquired the current meter velocity data the value of the flow rate q was estimated by means of the mid section method in the i th vertical transect the mean velocity ui was computed as u i u 20 i u 40 i u 80 i 3 where u20i u40i and u80i are the velocity measured at the three aforementioned elevations the velocity ui was then assumed to be equal to the mean velocity in a polygon area that extends from halfway the distance between the adjacent transects on the lateral direction and from the bottom to the free surface on the vertical direction in this way the flow rate was given by q i 1 n u i i where n is the total number of verticals and δi is the area of the i th polygon 
9493,border irrigation is one of the most ancient but at the same time still widely applied irrigation methods across the world due to the intrinsic characteristics of the method the water volumes involved are often difficult to measure and this implies a large uncertainty in the estimation of water use efficiency in this study we analyze the results of an extensive monitoring campaign which was carried out over the agricultural season 2021 and was aimed at detecting the actual performance of border irrigation in different experimental fields located in the padana plain i e the largest irrigated plain in the eu in particular three maize fields characterized by different soil textures irrigation scheduling and rainfall conditions were considered the number of irrigation events their duration and the water amounts applied were examined and compared with the actual crop water requirements assessed by using the aquacrop os agro hydrological model the performance of border irrigation evaluated through a water use efficiency indicator was assessed for the monitored agricultural season as well as simulated over the last 28 years 1993 2020 to detect potential effects of different weather conditions the main results show that the flow rate applied during each irrigation event ranges from 11 to 18 l s 1 per unit width m of the irrigated strip whereas the irrigation event duration varies between 80 and 130 min ha 1 and substantially reflects the irrigation flow rate and the plot slope the latter being variable between 2 and 7 the water use efficiency is highly dependent on the irrigation management namely the flowrate and the scheduling of the irrigation events with a minimum value of 16 and a maximum of 56 the same range of efficiency was obtained for the last 28 years mainly as a consequence of the application of a rigid irrigation scheduling determined by the rotation period these findings provide useful information for improving the management of border irrigation in practice and more specifically to understand what margin of improvement can be obtained in terms of water use efficiency both under current conditions and in view of future increasing freshwater scarcity keywords border irrigation irrigation efficiency water use efficiency irrigation model aquacrop maize 1 introduction the demand for freshwater resources is on the rise and this trend is likely to continue with population growth and the increasing demand for food and cereals koech and langat 2018 there is also increased awareness about the need to provide enough water to sustain other ecological and environmental services thenkabail et al 2011 there appears to be growing consensus that irrigated agriculture in general is up against a future with less water scardigno 2020 this calls for a higher efficiency in the use of freshwater resources for irrigation a concept that is technically called water use efficiency wue stanhill 1986 although the wue strongly depends on crop soil and meteorological conditions a wide variability among irrigation methods is also expected sprinkler and drip irrigation systems seem to have gained a more prominent position in agriculture 4 0 in comparison to surface irrigation techniques since they are considered high efficiency irrigation methods and thus they are supported by public incentives rose et al 2021 as a result in many european countries along the mediterranean a radical shift is taking place in most agricultural areas from traditional surface irrigation methods to pressurized ones berbel et al 2019 however the effects of this shift which mainly entails a change in terms of infrastructure are not necessarily all positive as important repercussions were observed in many case studies such as an increase of energy costs baccour et al 2021 for example following the shift irrigation agriculture has become a major customer of electricity companies in spain with consumption increasing nineteen fold from 1950 to 2007 the consumption per hectare increased by a factor of 2 7 over the same period currently irrigation agriculture is the second largest electricity consumer in spain after adif the company that manages high speed rail consuming 2 37 of the electricity produced in spain it follows that the sustainability of irrigation agriculture in this context has a new hindering factor in its high energy consumption in light of these concerns new soft path strategies aimed at improving traditional irrigation techniques and increasing their water use efficiency are emerging through bottom up initiatives in the form of information and pilot project actions with the purpose to assess the potential of innovative surface irrigation management strategies fostering the collective sharing of the modernization objectives masseroni et al 2017 among the different types of surface irrigation border irrigation is the most common method for the irrigation of row crops in the world and it is particularly common in australia koech and langat 2018 northern china liu et al 2020 and southern europe masseroni et al 2021 borders are irrigated by diverting a stream of water from the channel to the upper end of the border the water flows down the slope and when the desired amount of water has been delivered to the border the stream is turned off this may occur before the water has reached the end of the border there are no specific rules for this decision which is typically made based on the farmer s experience if the flow is stopped too soon there may not be enough water in the border to complete the irrigation at the far end if it is left running for too long then water may run off the end of the border and or generate excessive percolation as a result the wue will mainly reflect the farmer s behavior during each irrigation event which will also be strongly connected with the availability of water the field topography and size the soil characteristics and whether conditions berthold et al 2021 therefore experimental campaigns that involve both the monitoring of irrigation volumes and the assessment of crop water requirements on real world case studies are needed to understand the margin for improvement that could be obtained by adopting new more efficient border irrigation management strategies in this work we examine the results obtained over the 2021 agrarian season on three experimental fields cultivated with maize located in the padana plain the largest irrigated plain in northern italy and in europe from an extensive monitoring campaign of border irrigation events looking at their frequency duration and water amounts in comparison with the actual crop water requirements simulated through agro hydrological modelling specifically the effect of different soil characteristics irrigation scheduling and weather conditions was discussed the analysis was then also extended to the last 28 irrigation seasons 1993 2020 to assess the water use efficiency over a longer period of time 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of the experimental sites the irrigation performances at three maize fields located in two different areas of the padana plain were monitored during the agricultural season 2021 the first two fields fields a and b which are approximately 1 5 ha in size each are located 2 km away from each other in the area south of lake garda within the same 130 ha irrigation district the ponte trento irrigation district masseroni et al 2021 instead the third field field c approx 8 ha is located in the south east of the city of milan a couple of kilometers away from the lambro river and about 150 km from the other two both experimental sites are characterized by a humid subtropical climate according to the köppen geiger classification system kottek et al 2006 specifically they show a transitional climate between the mediterranean climate dominated by anticyclonic patterns and the central european climate dominated by the oceanic influence of westerly circulations confalonieri et al 2009 the seasonality of the most relevant agro meteorological variables is presented for both sites in fig 1a d specifically rainfall global radiation air temperature and humidity wind speed and reference crop evapotranspiration eto calculated based on the fao penman monteith equation described by allen et al 1998 over 1993 2020 these data were derived from daily meteorological data obtained from two agro meteorological stations managed by the regional protection agency arpa that are located 25 km far from fields a and b and 15 km far from field c respectively during the agricultural season april october the average temperature at the experimental sites is about 20 c with maximum values reaching 33 c in july the air humidity is high throughout the year which implies the presence of foggy months during winter and hot and muggy months over summer the wind speed is high in spring march and april relatively higher in field a and b but below 2 5 m s 1 on average the pattern of global radiation is similar across the sites with the intensity peaking in summer on average about 250 w m 2 in june for field a and b and 300 w m 2 in july for field c eto follows the pattern of global radiation in both sites with a maximum in july of about 150 mm and a seasonal cumulative value of about 770 mm yearly rainfall distribution shows two relative maxima in spring and autumn and two relative minima in winter and summer whereas the average values of total rainfall during the agricultural season april october over the years 1993 2020 are 289 mm for fields a and b and 479 mm for field c but with a pronounced year to year variability in year 2021 for example values of 294 mm for fields a and b and 330 mm for field c were observed within the ponte trento district irrigation water is diverted through the virgilio canal the main canal deriving up to 24 m3 s 1 from the mincio river and delivered to the fields including field a and b through a dense and ramified network of concrete irrigation canals in contrast the irrigation water supplied to field c is diverted directly from the lambro river and delivered to the field through a series of open air vegetated ditches at both experimental sites water is distributed on rotation based on a rigid schedule defined by the local irrigation agency which provides for an interval of 7 days for fields a and b and 15 days for field c in both cases the irrigation method used is border strip irrigation although with two different configurations within fields a and b the water flows onto the field through a series of steel gates which are opened manually in sequence to supply water to each strip starting from the main supply canal located at the upper end of the field fig 2a in field c the water is pumped from the head ditch onto the field since the water surface in the ditch is about 2 m below the ground level during irrigation a centrifugal pump is connected to a tractor as shown in fig 2b and it is moved to the head of each strip sequentially until the field is fully irrigated although this configuration requires energy for water pumping it is largely practiced across the padana plain due to its greater versatility compared to the former one especially in large plots where a large flowrate is required to irrigate evenly the whole length of the plot in both configurations once the water is released onto the field it is gravity driven following the longitudinal slope of the field for fields a and b the slope was accurately measured at the end of the 2021 season through a photogrammetric flight performed by means of a dji mavic 2 pro drone featuring a hasselblad l1d 20c camera and its 20mpx 1 cmos sensor for field c instead the slope was derived from a digital terrain model dtm 1 1 m ground resolution of a lidar flight performed in 2015by the regional authority over a vast area comprising the experimental field on average the longitudinal slope is around 6 5 for fields a and b and about 2 for field c the dtm of the three experimental fields is shown in fig 3a c and additional information about the photogrammetric flight on field a and b is reported in appendix 1 all fields at both sites were sowed with maize but the crop growing stages were different in fields a and c the crop was sowed at the end of march whereas in field b the crop was sowed in mid june after the harvesting of the lolium cover crop in field a the crop was harvested in mid august whereas in field b in the middle of october in both cases it was chopped for ensiling in field c the crop was harvested at the end of september and used for grain with regards to soil properties five soil samples were collected at 0 5 10 15 30 35 50 55 and 70 75 cm of depth at the center of each experimental field roughly where soil moisture probes were installed see par 2 2 with the aim to evaluate soil texture and indirectly soil hydrological proprieties the latter through the use of pedo transfer functions implemented within the agro hydrological model used for estimating crop water requirements see par 2 3 the soil of fields a and b resulted to have properties which are typical of morainic terrains their texture was predominantly sandy sandy loam with a skeleton higher than 30 the soil of field c was completely different from the first two and it was typical of alluvial plains i e characterized by a silty clay clay loam soil texture no vertical pattern in soil layers were found in the fields which can thus be considered homogeneous along the vertical profile the water table depth is about 5 m from the ground surface for fields a and b which makes it possible to neglect potential crop water uptakes from the capillary fringe for field c during the irrigation season the water table depth is 2 m from the ground level on average and the crop water uptake from the capillary fringe was thus considered in the crop water requirement modeling additional information about the three monitored fields is summarized in table 1 2 2 instrumentation and monitoring activity two weather stations equipped with a rain gauge a radiometer an anemometer and thermo hygrometer were installed nearby the experimental fields at the beginning of the 2021 agrarian season in order to monitor agro meteorological variables the first one is a rubicon weather station rubicon water au which was installed very close to the point where the water for irrigating the ponte trento district is diverted from the virgilio canal i e about 600 m from field a and 1 5 km from field b the second one is a atmos41 weather station meter group usa equipped with the same sensors of the rubicon station that was installed about 200 m from field c in addition five soil moisture probes were installed at the experimental fields for evaluating soil water status during the whole irrigation season specifically in field a a drill drop sentek technology au was installed in the middle of the central strip it was plugged into the soil down to a depth of about 70 cm this probe uses a capacitance frequency domain reflectometry technology and is equipped with pre normalized moisture sensors every 10 cm of depth with inbuilt default calibration equations in field b instead four teros 12 volumetric soil water content probes meter group usa were installed in a trench along a vertical profile the sensor body being vertical and needles horizontal at a depth of 10 30 50 and 70 cm these sensors are also based on a capacitance technology and provided with inbuilt default calibration equations both types of probes were connected to their own datalogger and data were downloaded in situ every two weeks to avoid data overflow in the internal memory in field c three drill drop sentek technology au were installed at about 30 80 and 130 m to the head of the field to accurately monitor soil moisture along the longitudinal direction which is about twice the length of fields a and b all probes were plugged into the soil down to 70 cm of depth and data were sent to a dedicated cloud through a gsm transmission in all cases data were collected with an hourly time resolution and were aggregated to a daily scale to be used for modeling see par 2 3 the water volume applied during each irrigation event was calculated as the product of two elements water flow rate and irrigation event duration for fields a and b the flow rate was calculated within the main supply canal located in the upper end of the fields i e where the flow can reasonably be considered to be in a steady uniform condition and well determined by the chezy formula ven te chow 1959 1 q k s a r 2 3 i where q is the flow rate a is the fluid section area r is the hydraulic radius i is the canal slope and ks is the gauckler strickler roughness parameter the canal at the top of fields a and b has a trapezoidal shape the geometry of the cross section was evaluated with a graduated rod whose precision is 1 mm while the canals slope was measured using a portable global positioning system gps grs 1 topcon japan vertical accuracy of 2 5 mm by positioning it at 10 points on the bottom of the canals along their overall length obtaining values of approx 0 5 and 1 0 for field a and field b respectively in order to reduce the measurement error we took five measurements at each point and considered their average for determining the vertical position the water level in the canal during each irrigation event was measured manually with a graduated rod whose precision is 1 mm the roughness parameter was calibrated comparing the flow rate measured by a manual portable magnetic inductive flow meter flow sensor nautilus c 2000 ott usa with that estimated by the chezy formula under flowrate stationary conditions at the beginning of the irrigation season i e when the canals were filled with water in particular the flow rate in the canal was estimated by using the so called conventional current meter methodology wmo 2010 described in detail in peruzzi et al 2021 and in appendix 2 the results of the calibration led to obtain a roughness parameter of about 75 m1 3 s 1 for the canal serving field a and 71 m1 3 s 1 for the canal serving field b in field c instead the flow rate was derived by combining the pump characteristics with its rotational speed during irrigation the centrifugal pump used for irrigation was the atm35 model veneroni italy equipped with a 350 mm diameter discharge pipe the flow rate is related to the pump rotational speed by the following linear relationship 2 q 1 q 2 n 1 n 2 where n1 is the nominal rotational speed of 540 rpm q1 is the corresponding flow rate equal to 450 l s 1 according to the theoretical operating curve considering a pump head of 2 m n2 is the actual rotational speed and q2 is the corresponding flow rate during each irrigation event n2 was maintained constant and ranged between 390 and about 480 rpm in the different events the watering time of each strip of all experimental fields was measured using a chronometer during every irrigation event 2 3 estimation of crop water requirements the crop water requirements of the experimental fields were estimated by using aquacrop os model version 6 0 foster et al 2017 steduto et al 2012 this model simulates the soil water balance as well as crop growth processes as a function of crop soil weather and irrigation management input data with a daily time step it separately computes actual transpiration ta and soil evaporation es the daily actual crop water requirement etc act is obtained as the sum of ta and es which are respectively computed as follows 3 t a k s c c k c tr e t 0 and 4 e s k r 1 c c k ex e t 0 where et0 is the reference evapotranspiration kc tr is the maximum standard crop transpiration coefficient non dimensional or maximum basal crop coefficient when the canopy cover cc is equal to 100 cc is the actual green crop canopy cover ks 0 1 is the water stress coefficient ke x is the soil evaporation coefficient for fully wet and non shaded soil surface non dimensional and kr 0 1 is the evaporation reduction coefficient raes et al 2012 thus the computation of both et components is mainly tied to the simulated crop canopy cover cc despite being very different from the fao56 approach allen et al 1998 which is typically based on the combination of crop coefficients kc and phenological stages this method has the advantage that simulated model outputs can be related directly to easily accessible data from visual field observations and remote sensing according to raes et al 2012 the model estimates the cc evolution in time within three distinct phases i the first phase begins at the crop emergence and ends when half of the maximum cc ccx is attained ii the second phase follows the previous one until ccx is reached and iii the third phase begins when senescence starts and ends with the harvest an exponential function of time is used in the 1st and 2nd phases beginning with the canopy cover when 90 emergence has occurred cco and using a growth rate defined by the canopy growth coefficient cgc the third and last phase refers to the decline of green canopy cover and its shape is defined by the canopy decline coefficient cdc therefore to parameterize the cc curves it is necessary to use the four mentioned parameters cco ccx cgc and cdc the soil volume extends from the soil surface to the lower limit of the root zone the soil volume is subdivided into two macro layers the top one evaporative layer represents the upper few centimeters of the soil while the bottom one transpirative layer represents the root zone and has a time varying depth based on the development of the crop roots the representation of hydrological processes is one dimensional the bottom layer can be divided into five different horizons of variable depth each with its own physical characteristics the characteristics are the water retention in the fine soil fraction at saturation θsat field capacity θfc and at permanent wilting point θpwp and the hydraulic conductivity of the soil at saturation ksat indicative values are provided by aquacrop for various soil texture classes or they can be derived from soil texture by using pedo transfer functions saxton and rawls 2006 which are already implemented in the model the soil description is completed by specifying the depth of the groundwater table and its variation in time the upward flow from the shallow groundwater table to the top soil is estimated by considering the soil type and its hydraulic characteristics through an exponential empirical equation which ties capillarity raise to the depth of the water table below the soil surface a schematic of the calculation scheme of the aquacrop model is shown in fig 4 lastly a new approach for describing watering in border conditions was implemented in the model which adopts fixed irrigation depths and irrigation rotations in the simulations 2 3 1 model parametrization and calibration the aquacrop model uses a large number of parameters that represent crop and soil characteristics default parameters are already included in the model for different types of crops and soils but for an accurate simulation they should be adjusted using field or remote sensed observations in particular canopy cover parameters cco ccx cgc and cdc were calibrated using the leaf area index lai derived from sentinel 2 images 10 10 m of resolution through the biophysical 10 mop tool of the copernicus snap software specifically the cc was obtained from lai information by applying the hsiao et al 2009 formula eq 5 5 cc 1 005 1 e 0 6 lai 1 2 specifically the lai information derived from the sentinel map was firstly averaged over the field and then converted into cc by using eq 5 fig 5a c shows the canopy cover curve in comparison with satellite observations for each experimental field the goodness of fit was evaluated by using the determination coefficient r2 as proposed by paredes et al 2015 this resulted higher than 0 8 for fields a and c whereas it was about 0 6 for field b potentially as a consequence of a low quality of the satellite images in that area for 2021 once obtained the canopy cover parameters cc0 ccx cgc cdc the soil hydrological properties θsat θfc θpwp and ksat were also adjusted by fitting the aquacrop simulated soil moisture patterns with those observed through the soil moisture probes to this end the rooted soil stratum was divided into two layers an upper one 10 cm deep where evaporative processes mostly occur and a lower one of variable depth according to root growth where root water uptake for plant transpiration mostly takes place the water content of the first layer was assumed equal to the value measured by the most superficial sensor while that of the lower layer was computed as the average of the values measured by the sensors falling inside the layer itself roots were assumed to be able to explore a maximum of 1 m at full plant growth the calibration results not shown led to a good fit between simulated and observed soil water content especially during the peaks following rain or irrigation events the goodness of fit was evaluated in this work through the root mean square error rmse which resulted to be very small in all experimental fields and in both layers specifically below 0 1 m3 m 3 in the evaporative layer and below 0 04 m3 m 3 in the transpirative one calibrated crop and soil model parameters are reported in table 2 2 4 irrigation performance indicator the irrigation performance was evaluated through the water use efficiency wue indicator which was calculated as proposed by bouman et al 2005 and fernández et al 2020 6 wue 100 et c act i r where i is the amount of water supplied through irrigation and r is rainfall the wue computed using eq 6 represents the share of water effectively used by the crop out of the total supplied water it strongly depends on the irrigation management since with border irrigation even more than with other methods it largely influences the uniformity and adequacy of the water distribution onto the field first the wue was calculated for the 2021 agrarian season then its variability was analyzed over the last 28 years to investigate the effect of different seasonal weather conditions on border irrigation performances in this second analysis crop growth parameters and irrigation management criteria were assumed to be the same as for 2021 specifically irrigation events were triggered when the following two conditions were true i water supply was available according to the rotation period ii the soil water content in the transpirative layer was lower than a fixed threshold the threshold value was derived for each of the three experimental fields from the analysis of the monitored irrigation events during the agricultural season 2021 3 results 3 1 irrigation volume and depth the number of irrigation events their duration and the supplied water amounts reported in terms of flow rate per unit of width and of water depth are presented in table 3 during the 2021 agrarian season the farmers performed 10 irrigation interventions in field a 11 in field b and 3 in field c the flow rate was about 18 l s 1 m 1 in fields a and c and 11 l s 1 m 1 in field b the irrigation events duration was about 80 min ha 1 in field a 120 min ha 1 in field b and 130 min ha 1 in field c whereas irrigation depth resulted about 150 mm in field a 240 mm in field b and 260 mm in field c with regards to the frequency of irrigation events in fields a and b the first irrigation was carried out immediately after sowing and interrupted for about two months in field a and one month in field b due to the occurrence of significant precipitations 146 mm in field a and 67 mm in field b see also fig 6 after that irrigations were performed roughly once per week making full use of the scheduled availability on average the antecedent soil moisture condition before each irrigation event was 0 15 m3 m 3 in the field a and 0 17 m3 m 3 in the field b with a low standard deviation approx 0 02 m3 m 3 in both fields in contrast in field c irrigation was not necessary after sowing since the soil remained wet enough until mid june thanks to the rain events alone 167 mm and to a higher soil water retention capacity instead irrigations were carried out once the crop was fully developed specifically in between mid june and mid august the antecedent soil moisture condition before the three irrigation interventions performed in the field c is on average 0 29 m3 m 3 with a standard deviation of 0 01 m3 m 3 no trend in irrigation water amounts were observed throughout the irrigation season across all experimental fields except for the first irrigation in field a that was about 20 mm higher than the mean value over the season this was the farmer s personal choice his idea being to balance the higher infiltration capacity of the soil expected just after the sowing works 3 2 soil water balance the effect of incoming fluxes irrigation and rainfall on the daily soil water content swc in the root zone is presented in fig 6a c the swc was compared with both the total available water taw and the critical soil moisture content cmc and analyzed over 2021 agrarian season at the three experimental fields generally irrigations at all sites were applied before the cmc was depleted except for field c where the crop seems to have suffered overall 5 days of slight water stress between mid july and mid august on average the threshold below which irrigation was triggered resulted to be approx 85 of taw in fields a and b and 65 in field c i e when the deficit to field capacity is only approximately 25 mm in field a 18 mm in b and 80 mm in field c the large difference between these values for fields a and b and field c is due both to soil characteristics taw are respectively 110 120 and 230 mm and to the extremely risk averse attitude of farmers a and b who irrigate when the soil water content is still much larger than cmc a considerable portion of the water supplied for irrigation in fields a and b is lost through percolation the loss of water from the soil through this process happened more rapidly than that achieved by root uptake as shown by the change of slope of the swc depletion curve when it is found above or below the taw level percolation following irrigation events was approx 1046 mm for field a 2107 mm for field b and 138 mm for field c over the entire season in all experimental fields percolation occurred at each irrigation intervention and when daily rainfall exceeded about 25 mm in fields a and b and 30 mm in field c 3 3 water use efficiency the seasonal water balance fluxes in terms of cumulated amounts of irrigation water rainfall and crop evapotranspiration are reported in table 4 the values refer to the period from seeding to harvest for all experimental fields since the periods are different the total amounts of rainfall r and crop evapotranspiration etc act also differ across the fields during the 2021 agrarian season crop evapotranspiration ranged from about 440 mm field b to 560 mm field c whereas rainfall was only able to satisfy a portion of the potential crop evapotranspiration etc ranging between 30 and 50 the remaining part was supplied through irrigation that ranged from about 670 mm field c to 2700 mm field b the values of water use efficiency ranged between a minimum value in field b 16 and a maximum in field c 56 the results of the wue simulations over the last 28 years 1993 2020 are presented in fig 7a c it can be noticed that despite a wide range of rainfall conditions across the years the wue remains consistent with that found for 2021 at each experimental field with an average of 10 interventions in field a and b and 3 in the field c this behavior is inherently linked with the rigid distribution that does not allow for irrigations outside of the fixed rotation planned by the irrigation agency but it also depends very significantly from the different farmers attitudes towards the risk of crop water stress moreover no significant water stress conditions occurred over the season in each year highlighting that the current irrigation management tends to be cautious nevertheless a significant correlation was found throughout the years between rainfall and irrigation amounts i e 0 43 in field a 0 60 in field b and 0 37 in field c clearly the correlation is low when the frequency of potential irrigations is low i e less flexibility in irrigation however it shows that farmers as much as possible try to avoid irrigation when they consider rainfall amounts to be suitable to satisfy crop water requirements 4 discussion from the analysis of collected data the flow rate per unit of width was on average 16 l s 1 m 1 about twice as higher than that suggested for high performance closed end border irrigations in sandy soils and three times higher than that for silty clay soils liu et al 2020 however the experimental evidence demonstrated that these flowrates were necessary to grant the propagation of the overland flow till the end of the strips in a reasonable time the range of variation of the irrigation depths between 150 and 250 mm appears quite high compared to the values generally reported in literature typically between 100 and 150 mm see e g bjorneberg 2013 nevertheless they reflect the irrigation management in an average year 2021 where the standard water supply was fully delivered by the irrigation agency with regard to the wue it was 30 16 and 56 respectively for the field a b and c the values observed for fields a and b are quite far from what reported in brouwer et al 1989 i e values around 60 however this result is once again connected to the higher drainage capacity of soils in fields a and b but also to rigidity of the water delivery with fixed rotation period which clearly drives farmers to irrigate more frequently than needed to avoid any risk of crop water stress particularly when the available soil water capacity is smaller this is more evident for field a fig 6a where in july only once the irrigation was not applied on the regular weekly rotation despite that total rainfall depth amounted to 50 of potential crop evapotranspiration 83 and 168 mm respectively concerning the effects of field layout and irrigation management on the performance of border irrigation table 5 summarizes the main variables describing layout and management grouped in three macro category geometrical kinematics and management the experimental evidence suggests that they contribute equally to the pattern of wue in the three case studies the differences in soil characteristics between the first two fields sandy sandy loam and field c silty clay clay loam explain the differences between the two fixed rotation planned by the irrigation agency i e 7 days for the field a and b and 15 day for the field c more in detail the readily available soil water raw content which can be recognized by the difference between taw and cmc curves in fig 6 is on average 55 mm for fields a 70 mm for the field b whereas it is about 130 mm for field c if the mid and late crop growing stages are considered i e when crop roots are fully developed this drives farmers a and b to irrigate their fields more frequently than farmer c since the soil water storage capacity in the first two fields is lower than in the third nevertheless comparing the frequency of irrigation interventions between fields a and b i e under the same irrigation rotation the observations show that in the field b the farmer triggers irrigation when the water depletion in the root zone calculated as the difference between taw and irrigation threshold is on average 18 mm 85 of taw i e 50 less than the field a 25 mm 77 of taw in the field c instead water depletion in the root zone is 80 mm i e 65 of taw this huge difference in irrigation management is one of the reasons determining the large difference of wue values with a maximum of 56 in field c a minimum as low as 16 in field b and an intermediate value of 30 in field a a further variable that most likely affects the difference between wue of the field a and b is the mean overland flow velocity during irrigation intervention calculated by the ratio between the field length and the time elapsed from the start of the irrigation to the instant when the water front reached the end of the strip equal to the irrigation duration velocity values resulted of 420 m h 1 in field a to 170 m h 1 in the field b in spite that the field slopes are very similar approx 6 5 these values are consistent with the flow rate per unit field width during the irrigation interventions which was on average 18 l s 1 m 1 for the field a and 11 l s 1 m 1 for the field b moreover the mean flow velocity was found to be correlated with field layout and in particular with the strip width despite the strips have about the same area approx 0 36 ha the field b is characterized by a strip width about two times larger than field a considering that the nominal flowrate is about the same in the field a and b the larger width of b reduces the advancement velocity of the overland flow front with the consequence of requiring longer irrigation durations per unit surface in fact irrigation events duration of the field b 120 min ha 1 resulted about 50 more than field a 80 min ha 1 to allow the water to reach the end of the strip during each irrigation intervention 5 conclusions in this work three experimental fields cultivated with maize and characterized by different types of soil irrigation scheduling and weather conditions were subject to an extensive monitoring campaign with the purpose to understand the current level of water use efficiency of the border irrigation practice in northern italy observed values revealed that irrigation durations and amounts exceed those that can be found in the albeit quite scarce literature on border irrigation practice our analysis corroborates the evidence that water use efficiency is strongly related to the water management strategy adopted by farmers during irrigation events and in particular it reflects the variations in soil water threshold below which irrigation was triggered moreover the observations suggest a well calibrated field layout with respect to the available flowrate could significantly increase border irrigation efficiency these results can be considered very significant in view of the implementation of new water management strategies aimed at improving the efficiency of border irrigation our analysis confirms that there is a large potential for improving performance levels of border irrigation with potential positive repercussions in terms of water savings as well as environmental and economic sustainability the next goal will be to investigate the water amounts that could be saved for each irrigation event without jeopardizing a uniform distribution of water on the field during irrigation interventions this study may help farmers prepare for any changes in water availability as a consequence of political decisions and or altered climate patterns a key challenge will be to translate these findings into operational guidelines and best practices allowing to keep alive the tradition of border irrigation but increasing its

the end of the 2021 agrarian season through a photogrammetric flight performed by means of a dji mavic 2 pro drone mounting onboard an hasselblad l1d 20c camera and its 20mpx 1 cmos sensor the acquired images were processed with the photogrammetric software agisoft metashape version 1 7 0 referring to field a survey a total of 366 images acquired at about 36 5 m a g l and a ground sample distance gsd of 0 8 cm were processed and georeferenced on the basis of 11 well distributed ground control points gcps previously surveyed by gnss techniques with a leica gs14 receiver in nrtk mode and with spatial accuracy at centimeter level the obtained model resulted with accuracies of 1 0 cm and 2 5 cm in the planimetric and altimetric components respectively when compared with 4 control points cps surveyed as the gcps but not considered in the bundle block adjustment for accuracy estimation purposes a derived digital terrain model dtm at 3 17 cm ground resolution was then used for precise slope determination concerning field b 197 images were taken at about 44 m a g l and gsd of 1 3 cm on the field 10 gcps and 5 cps were surveyed similarly as previously described leading to a photogrammetric model with accuracies of 1 1 cm and 4 1 cm in planimetry and altimetry respectively in this case the field slope determination was based on a derived dtm with 3 77 cm ground resolution appendix 2 the flow rate in the irrigation consortium channel was estimated by using the so called conventional current meter methodology wmo 2010 more in details the velocities were measured in seven vertical transects for each representative cross section by placing the current meter in three selected positions along the vertical direction i e starting from the bottom equals to 20 40 and 80 of the local water height y z once acquired the current meter velocity data the value of the flow rate q was estimated by means of the mid section method in the i th vertical transect the mean velocity ui was computed as u i u 20 i u 40 i u 80 i 3 where u20i u40i and u80i are the velocity measured at the three aforementioned elevations the velocity ui was then assumed to be equal to the mean velocity in a polygon area that extends from halfway the distance between the adjacent transects on the lateral direction and from the bottom to the free surface on the vertical direction in this way the flow rate was given by q i 1 n u i i where n is the total number of verticals and δi is the area of the i th polygon 
9494,lack of water resources low irrigation efficiency and inappropriate irrigation decisions severely restrict agricultural production in arid and semi arid regions therefore rapid and accurate decision making regarding crop irrigation in real time is necessary this study optimized irrigation scheduling by using information on different meteorological years and obtained the average soil water content 0 60 cm before each irrigation the corresponding irrigation time and the water available for irrigation the relative development speed of winter wheat and the amount of water available for irrigation were considered and a dynamic irrigation water limit model was constructed winter wheat field experiments over 3 years 2016 2019 were followed by an evaluation of the regional applicability of the decision support system for the agrotechnology transfer model a long short term memory network effectively predicted air temperature and solar radiation the r 2 and root mean square error values were 0 802 0 964 and 12 53 23 9 respectively public weather forecasts can be used to accurately predict rainfall with 87 3 and 57 accuracy rates for forecasts of no rain and rain respectively compared with traditional irrigation the use of this dynamic irrigation lower limit for irrigation forecasting can increase yield and attendant net benefits when two and three irrigation treatments were applied during the winter wheat growth period the 3 year average yield increased by 10 3 and 4 4 respectively and the net benefit increased by 19 1 and 7 4 respectively the proposed method avoids relying on only field experiments to determine the irrigation lower limit and allows for the effective implementation of optimized irrigation schedules and the dynamic correction of irrigation plans in arid and semi arid areas keywords dynamic irrigation lower limit dssat model long short term memory network winter wheat irrigation decision 1 introduction with population growth worldwide and limited water resources the agricultural industry faces major challenges in feeding the world s population hanjra and qureshi 2010 wheeler and von braun 2013 by 2050 the global population is expected to reach 9 6 billion and food demand is expected to double godfray et al 2010 tilman et al 2011 only 17 of farmland globally is irrigated molden et al 2010 fao 2008 global food security is threatened by the small area of irrigable agricultural land the large volume of water consumed in irrigation and low water efficiency winter wheat is the main crop in linfen shanxi china its irrigation supply is limited and precipitation during the growing season october to june is only 152 mm winter wheat in this area requires approximately 450 mm of water therefore it is necessary to increase crop yield and water productivity by using an effective irrigation system that requires less water than other irrigation systems lopez et al 2017 researchers have determined the optimal irrigation time and volume through field experiments and used optimisation theory to determine the optimal irrigation schedule for crops in a climatic year zhang et al 2001 singh et al 2008 behera and panda 2009 furthermore with developments in computer science crop growth models and optimisation algorithms can be combined to determine optimal irrigation schedules under different water supply conditions white et al 2002 antle et al 2017 jones et al 2017 behera and panda 2009 used field experiments and the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat model to optimise irrigation and fertiliser management for winter wheat he et al 2013 used the dssat model to optimise the irrigation schedule for spring wheat and jing et al 2021 used the dssat model to evaluate the effect of water management on canadian spring wheat yield because of the unpredictability of climatic year types an irrigation schedule obtained from historical weather years is only applicable for formulating a water use plan at the beginning of the irrigation season araya et al 2015 he et al 2011 an effective approach for dynamically modifying an irrigation water plan during the crop growth season is to determine a reasonable lower limit for irrigation when the water supply is sufficient irrigation requirements are forecasted according to a suitable irrigation lower limit that can allow timely and appropriate irrigation provide an optimal crop yield and avoid excessive water supply shen et al 2010 however irrigation forecasts based on lower limits for water conservation sun et al 1998 can achieve high water productivity the real time modification of an irrigation plan based on economical irrigation at the lower limit can maximize irrigation net benefits per unit area sriramany and murty 1996 bai et al 2006 brown et al 2010 nevertheless lower limits for suitable water saving and economical irrigation approaches are only applicable when the water supply is adequate if the water supply is constrained and lower limits are used for irrigation forecasts irrigation water may be excessively used in the early stages of crop growth leading to drought in the later stages and reduced yields however if a limited water supply for irrigation is considered the irrigation lower limit can be appropriately adjusted to ensure the availability of water for a longer period of time thus resulting in higher yields and greater net benefits zou et al 2021 in this study a dynamic model of irrigation lower limits that accounts for the relative development speed of crops and the amount of water available for irrigation was constructed to enable real time irrigation decision making in different crop seasons the main objectives of the study were to 1 construct a dynamic model of irrigation lower limits based on irrigation schedule optimization 2 use long short term memory networks lstms and public weather forecast information to predict temperature solar radiation and rainfall in order to predict soil water content and 3 investigate the feasibility of combining a dynamic irrigation lower limit dill with an lstm and weather forecast information for predicting irrigation schedule the proposed dill model represents an effective method for the real time modification of irrigation forecasting and planning during periods of water scarcity 2 materials and methods 2 1 field data field experiments related to winter wheat were conducted in dongan village guangshengsi town hongdong county shanxi province 111 46 e 36 17 n 529 m from 2016 to 2019 the soil type in this area is loam the winter wheat variety liangxing 66 conventionally used in the study area was planted through machine tillage and strip sowing the seeding depth was 5 cm and the seeding

same amounts of phosphate and potassium fertilizers 120 and 60 kg ha 1 respectively were used in each treatment the planting and harvesting dates of the winter wheat were 9 october 2016 and 10 june 2017 20 october 2017 and 4 june 2018 and 15 october 2018 and 4 june 2019 respectively the meteorological data for the research field over the aforementioned 3 years mean air temperature tmean relative humidity rh vapour pressure deficit vpd and photosynthetically active radiation par are presented in fig 1 in the experiments the winter wheat s phenology aboveground biomass yield leaf area index and soil water content data were recorded for the calibration and validation of ceres wheat model parameters the winter wheat s phenological period was recorded according to the classification approach of zadoks et al 1974 the aboveground biomass and leaf area index were measured every 10 days when the wheat was harvested plants per unit area 1 1 m2 was used to determine the yield and the final yield was estimated from the field density because all fields grew uniformly the soil water content was measured every 10 days by using the drying method measurement depth of 1 m each layer was 20 cm and 5 layers were measured 2 2 ceres wheat model the ceres wheat model is used to simulate the growth and development of wheat in the agricultural support decision system jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2010 the ceres wheat model uses days as the time step and can simulate basic physiological and ecological processes such as plant growth and development photosynthesis respiration dry matter distribution and yield formation the model calculates how long winter wheat grows until harvest on the basis of the average daily temperature the calculation of potential carbohydrates depends on the par absorbed by the plant canopy the cumulative distribution of dry matter is calculated based on current growth stage and stress factors such as water nutrient and temperature stress jones 1986 ritchie 1998 the soil water content simulation module used was developed by ritchie 1985 under the principle of water balance the module uses a one dimensional bucket turning method to calculate the daily changes in soil water content caused by rainfall and irrigation infiltration vertical drainage unsaturated flow soil water evaporation and root water uptake soil data field management data and meteorological data are necessary inputs to run the ceres wheat model soil data include the physical and chemical properties of soil table 2 such as soil particle composition and soil water characteristic parameters the composition of soil particles was measured using a laser particle size analyser the soil types were classified according to american standards soil bulk density was measured using the ring knife method and soil water characteristic parameters were measured using the centrifuge method field management data included the genotype parameters of winter wheat varieties planting information initial water and nutrient conditions irrigation data and fertilization data the genetic parameters of winter wheat varieties table 3 are related to the ecotypes and species of such varieties and jointly control the growth and development characteristics of crops the genetic parameters of winter wheat varieties were calibrated using the generalized likelihood uncertainty

the united nations food and agriculture organization 2 3 irrigation schedule optimization 2 3 1 optimization model the maximum net benefit per unit area was used for the objective function the decision variables were the date of irrigation calculated according to the number of days after sowing and the constraints were the irrigation dates because crop water requirements and yield calculations are complex irrigation schedule optimization in this study was a nonlinear programming problem and its mathematical model is presented in eqs 2 and 3 objective function maximum net

solution for an optimized irrigation schedule the pearson frequency curve was used for dividing different meteorological years by using the precipitation data for the growth period of winter wheat in the study area from 1961 to 2020 the cumulative probability p of different precipitation years was calculated using eq 4 the larger the p value was the lower the precipitation in the corresponding year was 4 p m n 1 100 where p is the precipitation guarantee rate m is the serial number of the year after sorting and n is the number of precipitation data years an integer coding genetic algorithm was used to determine the irrigation schedule shen et al 2021 for different climatic years the irrigation amount per time was assumed to be 75 mm and the irrigation times were zero to five genetic algorithm optimization can be used to determine the optimal irrigation time for winter wheat under different water supply conditions in different climatic years before the net benefit of irrigation begins to decrease the economic irrigation schedule for different climatic years is based on irrigation times irrigation amount and irrigation time corresponding to the greatest net benefits 2 4 determination of the dill the traditional lower limit of irrigation was obtained under a fixed experimental schedule however the traditional lower limit of irrigation is no longer valid because of climate change the dill was obtained through statistical analysis based on irrigation schedule optimization the dill when combined with weather forecast data can help realize dynamic decision making related to irrigation schedules according to the results of irrigation schedule optimization in different climatic years the average soil water content 0 60 cm before one to three irrigation treatments was used as the lower limit of irrigation therefore 30 sets of data on soil water content and corresponding irrigation times and irrigation water availability were obtained the relationship between the dill relative development speed rds and available irrigation water was established and the parameters in the following equations were determined through regression analysis 5 θ l a 0 a 1 r

1 irrigation forecasting process starting from 30 days after winter wheat was sown with 10 days as the foreseeable period the daily soil water content values obtained from forecasts were compared with the dill when the forecasted value of soil water content was less than or close to the dill an irrigation level was forecasted otherwise no forecast was made fig 2 in the forecasting process the forecasted soil water content value was based on predicted meteorological data maximum temperature minimum temperature solar radiation and precipitation as the input meteorological data in the dssat model the daily forecast value of soil water content was obtained by running the dssat model the temperature and solar radiation data were predicted using lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 and precipitation was predicted using weather forecast information maximum minimum and average temperatures were predicted the predicted maximum temperature minimum temperature and solar radiation were used to run the dssat model to predict soil water content the predicted average temperature was used to calculate the dill the steps were as follows a the daily temperature and solar radiation measurements from 22 december 1961 31 december 2009 were used as the training set and the daily temperature and solar radiation measurements from 22 december 22 2014 31 december 2020 were used as the model validation set the temperature forecast included the previous day and the next day the solar radiation forecast involved using the average value of the previous 7 days to predict the average value of the next 7 days b the initial learning rate of the lstm model was set to 0 005 the forgetting rate of the model node was 0 2 the model training batch size was 1 the iterative method for updating the model weight parameters was based on the adaptive moment estimation algorithm the number of hidden layers in the model was 1 including 100 hidden units the output layer was 1 and the maximum number of iterations of the model was 250 public weather forecast data and statistical methods were used to predict precipitation for the study area during the period of 1 january 2011 30 december 2020 we downloaded the daily precipitation forecast data and measured precipitation data for the next 10 days from china weather network http www weather com cn and china meteorological network http data cma cn respectively for agricultural irrigation short term precipitation forecasts 7 10 days can satisfy the requirements of farmers seeking to manage agricultural production based on precipitation statistics for different rainfall levels were obtained according to the classification method of the china meteorological administration table 4 the rainfall levels presented in table 4 were subjected to statistical methods to calculate the accuracy α of different forecasted levels of rainfall in the subsequent 10 days in the huoquan area of linfen the accuracy rate of rainfall forecasts was calculated according to eq 7 7 α r m 100 where m is the number of times a forecast of rain was made and r is the actual number of times rainfall occurred within the indicated area 2 5 2 analysis of the net benefit of increased yield to reduce the effect of random changes in meteorological factors such as rainfall the irrigation time was forecasted for the second and third instances of winter wheat irrigation from 2016 to 2019 the irrigation amount was 75 mm and the type and quantity of fertilizers were consistent with those in field experiments after the irrigation time was determined the ceres wheat model was used to calculate the corresponding yields and net benefits simultaneously the optimal irrigation time yield and net benefits of winter wheat under average conditions were calculated on the basis of the meteorological data from 2005 to 2014 and these calculations were used as the yields and net benefits of traditional irrigation without irrigation forecasting finally the increase in yield from using the dill for irrigation forecasting was determined 2 6 evaluation of model accuracy the coefficient of determination r 2 mean absolute error me and relative root mean square error rrmse were used to evaluate the applicability of the dssat model and the predictive accuracy of the lstm model see eqs 8 10 8 r 2 i 1 n o i o i s i s i 2 i 1 n o i o i 2 i 1 n s i s i 2 9 r r m s e i 1 n s i o i 2 n o i 100 10 m e 1 n i 1 n s i o i where o i and s i represent the observed value and the simulated value respectively o i and s i are the averages of the observed value and the simulated value respectively me is the mean error and n is the number of samples a lower rrmse indicates a better fit between the simulated and observed values rrmse values of 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 indicate excellent good medium and poor fit respectively 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of the dssat model the genetic parameters table 5 were used to determine the yield phenological period leaf area index and average soil water content 0 60 cm for the treatment condition without water and nutrient stress t2 to calibrate and validate the dssat model parameters data for 2016 2017 were used for model calibration and 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 data were used for model validation as table 6 indicates the simulated flowering date maturity date and yield exhibited a good match with the observed values and the rrmse was 10 fig 3 presents the simulation results for the 3 year winter wheat leaf area index fig 3a c and soil water content at a depth of 0 60 cm fig 3d f under sufficient water supply conditions the me and rrmse of the simulated and observed leaf area index were 0 23 0 29 m2 m 2 and 10 35 12 13 respectively and the me and rrmse of the simulated and observed soil water content values were 0 025 0 029 cm3 cm 3 and 10 76 11 65 respectively these results demonstrated that the calibrated and validated ceres wheat model can accurately simulate crop growth and soil water changes 3 2 optimization of winter wheat irrigation scheduling with reference to the precipitation during the growth periods of winter wheat in the study area from 1961 to 2020 frequency analysis was used to determine the different climatic years corresponding to winter wheat growth subsequently the integer coding genetic algorithm was used to determine the irrigation schedules and net benefits in different climatic years table 7 as well as the relationship between winter wheat net benefits and irrigation water supply fig 4 table 7 and fig 4 demonstrate that in different climatic years when the irrigation water supply was 150 mm the net benefits increased considerably when the number of irrigation treatments exceeded two the net benefits no longer increased for the climate of linfen two or three irrigation treatments during the growth period of winter wheat is economical and reasonable and this approach is consistent with local irrigation practices 3 3 dill values for winter wheat according to the results obtained from optimizing irrigation schedules over 5 meteorological years the average soil water content 0 60 cm before one to three irrigation treatments was used as the irrigation lower limit subsequently the parameters in eq 5 could be obtained by alternately using the planning solving and multiple regression analysis tools in excel 2016 software the determination coefficient of the dill calculated using the dssat and dill models was 0 696 and the significance index was α 5 92 10 7 which is much lower than 0 01 reaching the level of significance fig 5 thus eq 11 could be used to predict the dynamic irrigation limit during the growth period of winter wheat and its applicable range was the number of irrigation treatments from a minimum of one treatment to the number of irrigation treatments to achieve the maximum net benefit 11 θ l 0 267 0 145 r d s 0 311 0 011 i 0 288 3 10 7 i 1 373 r d s 5 699 3 4 meteorological data

predicted using temperature was 0 92 and the rrmse was between 12 53 and 23 9 the predicted r 2 and rrmse for solar radiation were 0 802 and 17 56 respectively the forecasting accuracy of solar radiation was lower than that of temperature because temperature was stable with time whereas solar radiation was random which decreased the forecast accuracy overall the lstm model could effectively predict temperature and solar radiation and could provide reliable data for future meteorology based irrigation forecasting 3 4 2 rainfall forecast in this study the 2011 2020 public weather forecast data for the huoquan area of linfen were considered and the accuracy rate was calculated according to the rainfall levels in table 4 according to actual snowfall in the area snowfall exceeding a quantity categorized as light snow was regarded as light rain and the accuracy of rainfall forecasts in huoquan from 2011 to 2020 was determined on the basis of actual rainfall as table 8 demonstrates the accuracy levels of forecasts of no rain and rain were 87 3 and 57 respectively the accuracy levels of forecasts of no rain and light rain were 87 3 and 59 9 respectively the accuracy rates of forecasts of moderate rain and heavy rain were relatively low both 30 although the accuracy rate of rainstorm forecasts was relatively high the sample size was small and further validation is required therefore for the huoquan area of linfen the probability of the actual occurrence of moderate or stronger rain was relatively low and the actual occurrence of no rain and light rain was more frequent with a high forecast accuracy because rainless days are more frequent during the growth period of winter wheat 10 day rainfall mapping fig 7 was used for the growth period of winter wheat october to june the observed and predicted values of rainfall over 3 years were comparable therefore public weather forecast information can be used to predict rainfall during the growth period of winter wheat in huoquan linfen and when temperature solar radiation and rainfall forecast data are input into the dssat model the daily forecast value of soil water content can be obtained when the forecast soil water content is compared with the lower limit of dynamic irrigation the irrigation forecast for the corresponding year can be obtained 3 5 net benefit analysis of winter wheat irrigation forecasting as a preliminary study of the application of the dill with 10 days as the foreseeable period irrigation time forecasting fig 8 and yield net benefit calculation were performed for the two and three time water supply conditions of linfen winter wheat additionally to verify the forecast results on the basis of the 2005 2014 meteorological data the number of irrigation treatments and the attendant yield net benefits for winter wheat under average conditions were optimized and used as the yield and net benefits of traditional irrigation without irrigation forecasting table 9 table 9 demonstrates that due to the randomness of changes in meteorological factors the yield and net benefit increases in the calculated 3 years differed but the irrigation forecasts under limited water supply conditions increased winter wheat yield under two and three irrigation treatments during the winter wheat growth period the 3 year average yield increased by 10 3 and 4 4 respectively and the net benefit increased by 19 1 and 7 4 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 optimization of irrigation schedule the dill model constructed in this study was obtained through statistical methods and irrigation schedule optimisation reasonable optimization of irrigation scheduling was essential for establishing the dill model for irrigation schedule optimization field experiments statistical methods and optimization algorithms combined with crop models ghahraman and sepaskhah 2004 shang and mao 2006 thorp et al 2017 gu et al 2017 were employed in this study which had the goal of maximizing the net benefit of winter wheat the dssat model combined with a genetic algorithm established a winter wheat irrigation schedule and achieved favourable optimization results the number of irrigation treatments had a substantial effect on the net benefit of winter wheat as the number of irrigation treatments periods increases the net benefits first increase and then decrease lu et al 2021 the dssat model and genetic algorithm captured this trend well shen et al 2021 also used the dssat model and genetic algorithm to determine a winter wheat irrigation schedule in wugong town shaanxi china bai and gao 2021 optimized the drip irrigation nitrogen fertilizer system for maize in jilin province based on the dssat model and a genetic algorithm and achieved satisfactory optimization results therefore the use of the dssat model combined with a genetic algorithm is an effective method for crop irrigation schedule optimization 4 2 dill model this study analyzed the relationship of the irrigation lower limit and rds with the amount of water available for irrigation under a constrained water supply scenario the rds and the amount of water available were considered in modelling because the rds is closely related to the growth and development of crops in the absence of rainfall and irrigation the soil water content decreases with an increase in rds second only to precipitation irrigation is the most direct external cause of changes in soil water content therefore rds and the amount of water available for irrigation are highly relevant parameters and can be used to effectively establish a model for determining the lower limit of irrigation the authors of this paper previously established wang et al 2016 shen and wang 2019 a model of the relationship of the limit of irrigation water and the relative growth time of winter wheat with the amount of water available including rainfall and irrigation based on winter wheat field experiments and achieved reliable forecasting however the growth and development of crops are based on the principle of accumulated temperature the dill model established in this study which accounts for the rds has more physical meaning current irrigation management practices mainly involve calculating soil water balance to obtain soil water content the main approach is to determine evapotranspiration et through various methods usda 2017 the dill model proposed in this study is superior to the aforementioned approaches furthermore the combination of the dill model and vpd can be considered for effective crop irrigation management zhang et al 2021 4 3 winter wheat irrigation forecasting winter wheat irrigation forecasting involves accurately forecasting soil water content which requires the accurate forecasting of meteorological data in this study temperature radiation and precipitation forecast data were input into the dssat model and a soil water content calculation module was employed to obtain daily soil water content forecasts temperature and radiation were predicted using an lstm model and reliable prediction results were achieved for both the findings of related studies qing and niu 2018 park et al 2019 jeon and kim 2020 accord with ours precipitation was predicted using public weather forecast information statistics indicated that the accuracy of forecasting no rain and light rain in the linfen area was high although the accuracy of forecasting moderate or heavier rain was lower the number of samples for precipitation occurrence was small and thus these data had little influence on the final precipitation forecast accuracy short medium and long term forecasts are generally provided for precipitation and forecasting methods generally include linear and nonlinear forecast modelling he et al 2014 hossain et al 2019 this study used public weather forecast information to predict precipitation for a 10 day period and this approach is useful for agricultural managers dealing with precipitation events if the forecast period is too short managers cannot take timely countermeasures and if the forecast period is too long adapting to dynamic changes in precipitation is difficult although precipitation predictions based on weather forecast information were satisfactory more reliable prediction results may be achieved if nonlinear prediction technology is employed when a nonlinear model is used model adaptability and parameter stability must be weighed and the length of the training period should be determined reasonably and according to specific problems 4 4 net benefit analysis of yield increases using the dill model by using the dill model this study forecasted irrigation levels for winter wheat in the linfen area on the basis of two or three treatments and achieved a notable increase in yield and net benefits the forecasting results suggest that the yield and net benefits of three irrigation treatments are greater than those of two treatments thus for the linfen area two irrigation treatments during the growing period cannot meet the water requirements of winter wheat but three treatments can for two irrigation treatments the amount of water available was relatively low and the use of the dill for irrigation forecasting could achieve a marked increase in yield and net benefits as the amount of irrigation water increases both traditional irrigation and irrigation based on the dill model can provide crops with sufficient water which reduces the predictive effect of the dill model therefore the dill model proposed in this paper can be effectively applied in decision making regarding whether to apply two or three irrigation treatments in the linfen area with consideration for climatic temporal and spatial differences the dill model can be validated in areas with similar soil and climatic conditions to maximise yields and net benefits 5 conclusion the dill model constructed in this study provides a reliable method for optimizing irrigation schedules under limited water supply conditions and for making real time irrigation decisions the dill model when integrated with an lstm model and public weather forecast information for irrigation forecasting achieved substantial increases in yield and net benefits the 3 year average yield of winter wheat during the growth period under two and three irrigation treatments increased by 10 3 and 4 4 respectively and the average net benefit increased by 19 1 and 7 4 respectively in the future a soil water storage parameter should be added to the dill model or the leaf area index should replace the rds these changes may further improve the prediction accuracy of the dill model declaration of competing interest the authors

9494,lack of water resources low irrigation efficiency and inappropriate irrigation decisions severely restrict agricultural production in arid and semi arid regions therefore rapid and accurate decision making regarding crop irrigation in real time is necessary this study optimized irrigation scheduling by using information on different meteorological years and obtained the average soil water content 0 60 cm before each irrigation the corresponding irrigation time and the water available for irrigation the relative development speed of winter wheat and the amount of water available for irrigation were considered and a dynamic irrigation water limit model was constructed winter wheat field experiments over 3 years 2016 2019 were followed by an evaluation of the regional applicability of the decision support system for the agrotechnology transfer model a long short term memory network effectively predicted air temperature and solar radiation the r 2 and root mean square error values were 0 802 0 964 and 12 53 23 9 respectively public weather forecasts can be used to accurately predict rainfall with 87 3 and 57 accuracy rates for forecasts of no rain and rain respectively compared with traditional irrigation the use of this dynamic irrigation lower limit for irrigation forecasting can increase yield and attendant net benefits when two and three irrigation treatments were applied during the winter wheat growth period the 3 year average yield increased by 10 3 and 4 4 respectively and the net benefit increased by 19 1 and 7 4 respectively the proposed method avoids relying on only field experiments to determine the irrigation lower limit and allows for the effective implementation of optimized irrigation schedules and the dynamic correction of irrigation plans in arid and semi arid areas keywords dynamic irrigation lower limit dssat model long short term memory network winter wheat irrigation decision 1 introduction with population growth worldwide and limited water resources the agricultural industry faces major challenges in feeding the world s population hanjra and qureshi 2010 wheeler and von braun 2013 by 2050 the global population is expected to reach 9 6 billion and food demand is expected to double godfray et al 2010 tilman et al 2011 only 17 of farmland globally is irrigated molden et al 2010 fao 2008 global food security is threatened by the small area of irrigable agricultural land the large volume of water consumed in irrigation and low water efficiency winter wheat is the main crop in linfen shanxi china its irrigation supply is limited and precipitation during the growing season october to june is only 152 mm winter wheat in this area requires approximately 450 mm of water therefore it is necessary to increase crop yield and water productivity by using an effective irrigation system that requires less water than other irrigation systems lopez et al 2017 researchers have determined the optimal irrigation time and volume through field experiments and used optimisation theory to determine the optimal irrigation schedule for crops in a climatic year zhang et al 2001 singh et al 2008 behera and panda 2009 furthermore with developments in computer science crop growth models and optimisation algorithms can be combined to determine optimal irrigation schedules under different water supply conditions white et al 2002 antle et al 2017 jones et al 2017 behera and panda 2009 used field experiments and the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat model to optimise irrigation and fertiliser management for winter wheat he et al 2013 used the dssat model to optimise the irrigation schedule for spring wheat and jing et al 2021 used the dssat model to evaluate the effect of water management on canadian spring wheat yield because of the unpredictability of climatic year types an irrigation schedule obtained from historical weather years is only applicable for formulating a water use plan at the beginning of the irrigation season araya et al 2015 he et al 2011 an effective approach for dynamically modifying an irrigation water plan during the crop growth season is to determine a reasonable lower limit for irrigation when the water supply is sufficient irrigation requirements are forecasted according to a suitable irrigation lower limit that can allow timely and appropriate irrigation provide an optimal crop yield and avoid excessive water supply shen et al 2010 however irrigation forecasts based on lower limits for water conservation sun et al 1998 can achieve high water productivity the real time modification of an irrigation plan based on economical irrigation at the lower limit can maximize irrigation net benefits per unit area sriramany and murty 1996 bai et al 2006 brown et al 2010 nevertheless lower limits for suitable water saving and economical irrigation approaches are only applicable when the water supply is adequate if the water supply is constrained and lower limits are used for irrigation forecasts irrigation water may be excessively used in the early stages of crop growth leading to drought in the later stages and reduced yields however if a limited water supply for irrigation is considered the irrigation lower limit can be appropriately adjusted to ensure the availability of water for a longer period of time thus resulting in higher yields and greater net benefits zou et al 2021 in this study a dynamic model of irrigation lower limits that accounts for the relative development speed of crops and the amount of water available for irrigation was constructed to enable real time irrigation decision making in different crop seasons the main objectives of the study were to 1 construct a dynamic model of irrigation lower limits based on irrigation schedule optimization 2 use long short term memory networks lstms and public weather forecast information to predict temperature solar radiation and rainfall in order to predict soil water content and 3 investigate the feasibility of combining a dynamic irrigation lower limit dill with an lstm and weather forecast information for predicting irrigation schedule the proposed dill model represents an effective method for the real time modification of irrigation forecasting and planning during periods of water scarcity 2 materials and methods 2 1 field data field experiments related to winter wheat were conducted in dongan village guangshengsi town hongdong county shanxi province 111 46 e 36 17 n 529 m from 2016 to 2019 the soil type in this area is loam the winter wheat variety liangxing 66 conventionally used in the study area was planted through machine tillage and strip sowing the seeding depth was 5 cm and the seeding

soil water content data were recorded for the calibration and validation of ceres wheat model parameters the winter wheat s phenological period was recorded according to the classification approach of zadoks et al 1974 the aboveground biomass and leaf area index were measured every 10 days when the wheat was harvested plants per unit area 1 1 m2 was used to determine the yield and the final yield was estimated from the field density because all fields grew uniformly the soil water content was measured every 10 days by using the drying method measurement depth of 1 m each layer was 20 cm and 5 layers were measured 2 2 ceres wheat model the ceres wheat model is used to simulate the growth and development of wheat in the agricultural support decision system jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2010 the ceres wheat model uses days as the time step and can simulate basic physiological and ecological processes such as plant growth and development photosynthesis respiration dry matter distribution and yield formation the model calculates how long winter wheat grows until harvest on the basis of the average daily temperature the calculation of potential carbohydrates depends on the par absorbed by the plant canopy the cumulative distribution of dry matter is calculated based on current growth stage and stress factors such as water nutrient and temperature stress jones 1986 ritchie 1998 the soil water content simulation module used was developed by ritchie 1985 under the principle of water balance the module uses a one dimensional bucket turning method to calculate the daily changes in soil water content caused by rainfall and irrigation infiltration vertical drainage unsaturated flow soil water evaporation and root water uptake soil data field management data and meteorological data are necessary inputs to run the ceres wheat model soil data include the physical and chemical properties of soil table 2 such as soil particle composition and soil water characteristic parameters the composition of soil particles was measured using a laser particle size analyser the soil types were classified according to american standards soil bulk density was measured using the ring knife method and soil water characteristic parameters were measured using the centrifuge method field management data included the genotype parameters of winter wheat varieties planting information initial water and nutrient conditions irrigation data and fertilization data the genetic parameters of winter wheat varieties table 3 are related to the ecotypes and species of such varieties and jointly control the growth and development characteristics of crops the genetic parameters of winter wheat varieties were calibrated using the generalized likelihood uncertainty

the united nations food and agriculture organization 2 3 irrigation schedule optimization 2 3 1 optimization model the maximum net benefit per unit area was used for the objective function the decision variables were the date of irrigation calculated according to the number of days after sowing and the constraints were the irrigation dates because crop water requirements and yield calculations are complex irrigation schedule optimization in this study was a nonlinear programming problem and its mathematical model is presented in eqs 2 and 3 objective function maximum net

solution for an optimized irrigation schedule the pearson frequency curve was used for dividing different meteorological years by using the precipitation data for the growth period of winter wheat in the study area from 1961 to 2020 the cumulative probability p of different precipitation years was calculated using eq 4 the larger the p value was the lower the precipitation in the corresponding year was 4 p m n 1 100 where p is the precipitation guarantee rate m is the serial number of the year after sorting and n is the number of precipitation data years an integer coding genetic algorithm was used to determine the irrigation schedule shen et al 2021 for different climatic years the irrigation amount per time was assumed to be 75 mm and the irrigation times were zero to five genetic algorithm optimization can be used to determine the optimal irrigation time for winter wheat under different water supply conditions in different climatic years before the net benefit of irrigation begins to decrease the economic irrigation schedule for different climatic years is based on irrigation times irrigation amount and irrigation time corresponding to the greatest net benefits 2 4 determination of the dill the traditional lower limit of irrigation was obtained under a fixed experimental schedule however the traditional lower limit of irrigation is no longer valid because of climate change the dill was obtained through statistical analysis based on irrigation schedule optimization the dill when combined with weather forecast data can help realize dynamic decision making related to irrigation schedules according to the results of irrigation schedule optimization in different climatic years the average soil water content 0 60 cm before one to three irrigation treatments was used as the lower limit of irrigation therefore 30 sets of data on soil water content and corresponding irrigation times and irrigation water availability were obtained the relationship between the dill relative development speed rds and available irrigation water was established and the parameters in the following equations were determined through regression analysis 5 θ l a 0 a 1 r

1 irrigation forecasting process starting from 30 days after winter wheat was sown with 10 days as the foreseeable period the daily soil water content values obtained from forecasts were compared with the dill when the forecasted value of soil water content was less than or close to the dill an irrigation level was forecasted otherwise no forecast was made fig 2 in the forecasting process the forecasted soil water content value was based on predicted meteorological data maximum temperature minimum temperature solar radiation and precipitation as the input meteorological data in the dssat model the daily forecast value of soil water content was obtained by running the dssat model the temperature and solar radiation data were predicted using lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 and precipitation was predicted using weather forecast information maximum minimum and average temperatures were predicted the predicted maximum temperature minimum temperature and solar radiation were used to run the dssat model to predict soil water content the predicted average temperature was used to calculate the dill the steps were as follows a the daily temperature and solar radiation measurements from 22 december 1961 31 december 2009 were used as the training set and the daily temperature and solar radiation measurements from 22 december 22 2014 31 december 2020 were used as the model validation set the temperature forecast included the previous day and the next day the solar radiation forecast involved using the average value of the previous 7 days to predict the average value of the next 7 days b the initial learning rate of the lstm model was set to 0 005 the forgetting rate of the model node was 0 2 the model training batch size was 1 the iterative method for updating the model weight parameters was based on the adaptive moment estimation algorithm the number of hidden layers in the model was 1 including 100 hidden units the output layer was 1 and the maximum number of iterations of the model was 250 public weather forecast data and statistical methods were used to predict precipitation for the study area during the period of 1 january 2011 30 december 2020 we downloaded the daily precipitation forecast data and measured precipitation data for the next 10 days from china weather network http www weather com cn and china meteorological network http data cma cn respectively for agricultural irrigation short term precipitation forecasts 7 10 days can satisfy the requirements of farmers seeking to manage agricultural production based on precipitation statistics for different rainfall levels were obtained according to the classification method of the china meteorological administration table 4 the rainfall levels presented in table 4 were subjected to statistical methods to calculate the accuracy α of different forecasted levels of rainfall in the subsequent 10 days in the huoquan area of linfen the accuracy rate of rainfall forecasts was calculated according to eq 7 7 α r m 100 where m is the number of times a forecast of rain was made and r is the actual number of times rainfall occurred within the indicated area 2 5 2 analysis of the net benefit of increased yield to reduce the effect of random changes in meteorological factors such as rainfall the irrigation time was forecasted for the second and third instances of winter wheat irrigation from 2016 to 2019 the irrigation amount was 75 mm and the type and quantity of fertilizers were consistent with those in field experiments after the irrigation time was determined the ceres wheat model was used to calculate the corresponding yields and net benefits simultaneously the optimal irrigation time yield and net benefits of winter wheat under average conditions were calculated on the basis of the meteorological data from 2005 to 2014 and these calculations were used as the yields and net benefits of traditional irrigation without irrigation forecasting finally the increase in yield from using the dill for irrigation forecasting was determined 2 6 evaluation of model accuracy the coefficient of determination r 2 mean absolute error me and relative root mean square error rrmse were used to evaluate the applicability of the dssat model and the predictive accuracy of the lstm model see eqs 8 10 8 r 2 i 1 n o i o i s i s i 2 i 1 n o i o i 2 i 1 n s i s i 2 9 r r m s e i 1 n s i o i 2 n o i 100 10 m e 1 n i 1 n s i o i where o i and s i represent the observed value and the simulated value respectively o i and s i are the averages of the observed value and the simulated value respectively me is the mean error and n is the number of samples a lower rrmse indicates a better fit between the simulated and observed values rrmse values of 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 indicate excellent good medium and poor fit respectively 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of the dssat model the genetic parameters table 5 were used to determine the yield phenological period leaf area index and average soil water content 0 60 cm for the treatment condition without water and nutrient stress t2 to calibrate and validate the dssat model parameters data for 2016 2017 were used for model calibration and 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 data were used for model validation as table 6 indicates the simulated flowering date maturity date and yield exhibited a good match with the observed values and the rrmse was 10 fig 3 presents the simulation results for the 3 year winter wheat leaf area index fig 3a c and soil water content at a depth of 0 60 cm fig 3d f under sufficient water supply conditions the me and rrmse of the simulated and observed leaf area index were 0 23 0 29 m2 m 2 and 10 35 12 13 respectively and the me and rrmse of the simulated and observed soil water content values were 0 025 0 029 cm3 cm 3 and 10 76 11 65 respectively these results demonstrated that the calibrated and validated ceres wheat model can accurately simulate crop growth and soil water changes 3 2 optimization of winter wheat irrigation scheduling with reference to the precipitation during the growth periods of winter wheat in the study area from 1961 to 2020 frequency analysis was used to determine the different climatic years corresponding to winter wheat growth subsequently the integer coding genetic algorithm was used to determine the irrigation schedules and net benefits in different climatic years table 7 as well as the relationship between winter wheat net benefits and irrigation water supply fig 4 table 7 and fig 4 demonstrate that in different climatic years when the irrigation water supply was 150 mm the net benefits increased considerably when the number of irrigation treatments exceeded two the net benefits no longer increased for the climate of linfen two or three irrigation treatments during the growth period of winter wheat is economical and reasonable and this approach is consistent with local irrigation practices 3 3 dill values for winter wheat according to the results obtained from optimizing irrigation schedules over 5 meteorological years the average soil water content 0 60 cm before one to three irrigation treatments was used as the irrigation lower limit subsequently the parameters in eq 5 could be obtained by alternately using the planning solving and multiple regression analysis tools in excel 2016 software the determination coefficient of the dill calculated using the dssat and dill models was 0 696 and the significance index was α 5 92 10 7 which is much lower than 0 01 reaching the level of significance fig 5 thus eq 11 could be used to predict the dynamic irrigation limit during the growth period of winter wheat and its applicable range was the number of irrigation treatments from a minimum of one treatment to the number of irrigation treatments to achieve the maximum net benefit 11 θ l 0 267 0 145 r d s 0 311 0 011 i 0 288 3 10 7 i 1 373 r d s 5 699 3 4 meteorological data prediction 3 4 1 temperature and solar radiation predictions as fig 6 indicates the predictions of temperature and solar radiation were consistent and generally located near the 1 1 line the r 2 predicted using temperature was 0 92 and the rrmse was between 12 53 and 23 9 the predicted r 2 and rrmse for solar radiation were 0 802 and 17 56 respectively the forecasting accuracy of solar radiation was lower than that of temperature because temperature was stable with time whereas solar radiation was random which decreased the forecast accuracy overall the lstm model could effectively predict temperature and solar radiation and could provide reliable data for future meteorology based irrigation forecasting 3 4 2 rainfall forecast in this study the 2011 2020 public weather forecast data for the huoquan area of linfen were considered and the accuracy rate was calculated according to the rainfall levels in table 4 according to actual snowfall in the area snowfall exceeding a quantity categorized as light snow was regarded as light rain and the accuracy of rainfall forecasts in huoquan from 2011 to 2020 was determined on the basis of actual rainfall as table 8 demonstrates the accuracy levels of forecasts of no rain and rain were 87 3 and 57 respectively the accuracy levels of forecasts of no rain and light rain were 87 3 and 59 9 respectively the accuracy rates of forecasts of moderate rain and heavy rain were relatively low both 30 although the accuracy rate of rainstorm forecasts was relatively high the sample size was small and further validation is required therefore for the huoquan area of linfen the probability of the actual occurrence of moderate or stronger rain was relatively low and the actual occurrence of no rain and light rain was more frequent with a high forecast accuracy because rainless days are more frequent during the growth period of winter wheat 10 day rainfall mapping fig 7 was used for the growth period of winter wheat october to june the observed and predicted values of rainfall over 3 years were comparable therefore public weather forecast information can be used to predict rainfall during the growth period of winter wheat in huoquan linfen and when temperature solar radiation and rainfall forecast data are input into the dssat model the daily forecast value of soil water content can be obtained when the forecast soil water content is compared with the lower limit of dynamic irrigation the irrigation forecast for the corresponding year can be obtained 3 5 net benefit analysis of winter wheat irrigation forecasting as a preliminary study of the application of the dill with 10 days as the foreseeable period irrigation time forecasting fig 8 and yield net benefit calculation were performed for the two and three time water supply conditions of linfen winter wheat additionally to verify the forecast results on the basis of the 2005 2014 meteorological data the number of irrigation treatments and the attendant yield net benefits for winter wheat under average conditions were optimized and used as the yield and net benefits of traditional irrigation without irrigation forecasting table 9 table 9 demonstrates that due to the randomness of changes in meteorological factors the yield and net benefit increases in the calculated 3 years differed but the irrigation forecasts under limited water supply conditions increased winter wheat yield under two and three irrigation treatments during the winter wheat growth period the 3 year average yield increased by 10 3 and 4 4 respectively and the net benefit increased by 19 1 and 7 4 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 optimization of irrigation schedule the dill model constructed in this study was obtained through statistical methods and irrigation schedule optimisation reasonable optimization of irrigation scheduling was essential for establishing the dill model for irrigation schedule optimization field experiments statistical methods and optimization algorithms combined with crop models ghahraman and sepaskhah 2004 shang and mao 2006 thorp et al 2017 gu et al 2017 were employed in this study which had the goal of maximizing the net benefit of winter wheat the dssat model combined with a genetic algorithm established a winter wheat irrigation schedule and achieved favourable optimization results the number of irrigation treatments had a substantial effect on the net benefit of winter wheat as the number of irrigation treatments periods increases the net benefits first increase and then decrease lu et al 2021 the dssat model and genetic algorithm captured this trend well shen et al 2021 also used the dssat model and genetic algorithm to determine a winter wheat irrigation schedule in wugong town shaanxi china bai and gao 2021 optimized the drip irrigation nitrogen fertilizer system for maize in jilin province based on the dssat model and a genetic algorithm and achieved satisfactory optimization results therefore the use of the dssat model combined with a genetic algorithm is an effective method for crop irrigation schedule optimization 4 2 dill model this study analyzed the relationship of the irrigation lower limit and rds with the amount of water available for irrigation under a constrained water supply scenario the rds and the amount of water available were considered in modelling because the rds is closely related to the growth and development of crops in the absence of rainfall and irrigation the soil water content decreases with an increase in rds second only to precipitation irrigation is the most direct external cause of changes in soil water content therefore rds and the amount of water available for irrigation are highly relevant parameters and can be used to effectively establish a model for determining the lower limit of irrigation the authors of this paper previously established wang et al 2016 shen and wang 2019 a model of the relationship of the limit of irrigation water and the relative growth time of winter wheat with the amount of water available including rainfall and irrigation based on winter wheat field experiments and achieved reliable forecasting however the growth and development of crops are based on the principle of accumulated temperature the dill model established in this study which accounts for the rds has more physical meaning current irrigation management practices mainly involve calculating soil water balance to obtain soil water content the main approach is to determine evapotranspiration et through various methods usda 2017 the dill model proposed in this study is superior to the aforementioned approaches furthermore the combination of the dill model and vpd can be considered for effective crop irrigation management zhang et al 2021 4 3 winter wheat irrigation forecasting winter wheat irrigation forecasting involves accurately forecasting soil water content which requires the accurate forecasting of meteorological data in this study temperature radiation and precipitation forecast data were input into the dssat model and a soil water content calculation module was employed to obtain daily soil water content forecasts temperature and radiation were predicted using an lstm model and reliable prediction results were achieved for both the findings of related studies qing and niu 2018 park et al 2019 jeon and kim 2020 accord with ours precipitation was predicted using public weather forecast information statistics indicated that the accuracy of forecasting no rain and light rain in the linfen area was high although the accuracy of forecasting moderate or heavier rain was lower the number of samples for precipitation occurrence was small and thus these data had little influence on the final precipitation forecast accuracy short medium and long term forecasts are generally provided for precipitation and forecasting methods generally include linear and nonlinear forecast modelling he et al 2014 hossain et al 2019 this study used public weather forecast information to predict precipitation for a 10 day period and this approach is useful for agricultural managers dealing with precipitation events if the forecast period is too short managers cannot take timely countermeasures and if the forecast period is too long adapting to dynamic changes in precipitation is difficult although precipitation predictions based on weather forecast information were satisfactory more reliable prediction results may be achieved if nonlinear prediction technology is employed when a nonlinear model is used model adaptability and parameter stability must be weighed and the length of the training period should be determined reasonably and according to specific problems 4 4 net benefit analysis of yield increases using the dill model by using the dill model this study forecasted irrigation levels for winter wheat in the linfen area on the basis of two or three treatments and achieved a notable increase in yield and net benefits the forecasting results suggest that the yield and net benefits of three irrigation treatments are greater than those of two treatments thus for the linfen area two irrigation treatments during the growing period cannot meet the water requirements of winter wheat but three treatments can for two irrigation treatments the amount of water available was relatively low and the use of the dill for irrigation forecasting could achieve a marked increase in yield and net benefits as the amount of irrigation water increases both traditional irrigation and irrigation based on the dill model can provide crops with sufficient water which reduces the predictive effect of the dill model therefore the dill model proposed in this paper can be effectively applied in decision making regarding whether to apply two or three irrigation treatments in the linfen area with consideration for climatic temporal and spatial differences the dill model can be validated in areas with similar soil and climatic conditions to maximise yields and net benefits 5 conclusion the dill model constructed in this study provides a reliable method for optimizing irrigation schedules under limited water supply conditions and for making real time irrigation decisions the dill model when integrated with an lstm model and public weather forecast information for irrigation forecasting achieved substantial increases in yield and net benefits the 3 year average yield of winter wheat during the growth period under two and three irrigation treatments increased by 10 3 and 4 4 respectively and the average net benefit increased by 19 1 and 7 4 respectively in the future a soil water storage parameter should be added to the dill model or the leaf area index should replace the rds these changes may further improve the prediction accuracy of the dill model declaration of competing interest the authors
