785,contact angle measurements for gas liquid rock systems are important for modeling multi phase flow and transport in the subsurface these data are needed in applications such as the extraction of oil and gas resources geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide contaminant fate and transport and aquifer recharge through the vadose zone contact angles are frequently measured with the sessile drop method previous research has largely ignored the dynamic behavior of sessile droplets on geologic materials this study investigates the dynamic behavior of sessile water droplets on prepared rock surfaces in the presence of air droplet diameter and advancing contact angle were determined at 0 5 s intervals for 90 s on flat polished disks of burlington limestone crossville sandstone mancos shale sierra white granite vermilion bay granite and westerly granite using a krüss dsa 30 drop shape analyzer the droplet diameter and advancing contact angle data sets were nonlinearly regressed against time using two different two parameter models the median coefficients of determination for the fits were 0 85 and 0 96 respectively the resulting parameter estimates were used to compute the apparent equilibrium contact angle θe for each disk following droplet diameter stabilization estimates of θe ranged from 37 2 for mancos shale to 75 6 for burlington limestone analysis of variance indicated statistically significant differences in θe between the rock types at the 95 confidence level the variability of θe on the polished rock surfaces as quantified by the coefficient of variation cv for θe varied between 3 and 9 there were no significant differences in cv between the rock types neutron radiography indicated changes droplet morphology over time were due to the

introduction determining the wettability of rocks is pivotal to understanding how water and other liquids move and are retained within the subsurface the wettability of a rock can be quantified by measuring the contact angle that a wetting fluid makes with the solid phase information on contact angles is needed for modeling multiphase flow and transport in porous media and is particularly

zone e g wallach et al 2013 for a liquid droplet resting on a flat horizontal solid surface the equilibrium contact angle θ is the angle of intersection between the solid surface and a tangent to the droplet profile originating at the three phase contact point the magnitude of θ is the result of mechanical equilibrium between the interfacial tensions for the different phase pairings as formalized in young s equation yuan and lee 2013 1 cos θ γ s v γ s l γ l v where γ lv γ sv and γ sl are the interfacial tensions of the liquid vapor solid vapor and solid liquid phase pairings respectively the contact angle is largely dependent upon the attractive force of the liquid droplet to the solid surface the stronger the attraction of the molecules of the liquid to the solid the greater the spreading of the droplet across the solid surface and the lower the contact angle will be the sessile drop method is commonly used to measure the contact angle of water on natural materials shang et al 2008 saulick et al 2017 for consolidated rocks θ is expected to depend upon the crystal size and mineralogical composition of the surface thus for an accurate determination of the contact angle on such surfaces multiple trials must be conducted to account for this heterogeneity e g borysenko et al 2009 kittu et al 2014 natural rock surfaces are generally rough and the equilibrium contact angle for a rough surface has been shown to deviate from the value for a flat surface wenzel 1936 hazlett 1990 onda et al 1996 kubiak et al 2011 rayudu and bulut 2014 some sedimentary rocks such as shales can be fractured along their bedding planes to yield relatively smooth natural surfaces suitable for contact angle measurements borysenko et al 2009 in most cases however rock fracture surfaces exhibit roughness over multiple scales develi and babadagli 1998 babadagli and develi 2003 as a result the sessile drop method is normally only employed to measure the wettability of rocks after they have been cut and polished to remove the effects of roughness the use of increasingly finer grits leaves fewer and fewer asperities on the surface theoretical models e g wenzel 1936 hazlett 1990 onda et al 1996 predict that a rough hydrophilic surface will become progressively less hydrophilic when made smoother by polishing the experimental observations of rayudu and bulut 2014 and kittu et al 2014 however are in direct opposition to this trend these authors found that the contact angle for water on prepared rock surfaces decreased with the use of increasingly finer polishing grits the greatest changes in θ occurred with the use of coarse grits while differences in θ were negligible for micron sized grits the reasons for this behavior are unknown a further complication of measuring the equilibrium contact angle on rocks is the presence of grain boundaries microfractures and pores because these void spaces are exposed at the surface the wetting fluid is not everywhere in contact with the solid phase as a result sessile drop measurements performed on porous media must be adjusted for porosity to account for this discrepancy using the following expression drelich and chibowski 2010 2 cos θ c o s θ e 1 ϕ ϕ where θ e is the measured apparent equilibrium contact angle and ϕ is the porosity note that for ϕ 0 θe θ dynamic changes in the contact angle can occur over time due to droplet spreading and spontaneous imbibition of the wetting fluid into the porous medium hilpert and ben david 2009 broke down the physical behavior of a water droplet placed onto the flat surface of a porous medium into three stages initially the droplet spreads over the surface during a period labeled the increasing drawing area ida phase in this phase the advancing contact angle decreases rapidly and non linearly the next phase known as the constant drawing area cda phase is characterized by infiltration from a constant basal area in this phase the advancing contact angle decreases more slowly and linearly the point in time that separates the ida and cda phases is designated as te the contact angle determined at te is taken to be the apparent equilibrium contact angle θe eventually the droplet enters a third phase known as the decreasing drawing area dda phase in which its basal area decreases over time resulting in a receding contact angle the θe is not an exact measure of the equilibrium contact angle muster and prestidge 2002 however it can be considered a physicochemical characteristic of the surface if one assumes that i prior to te infiltration is negligible and changes in the contact angle are due solely to the relative attraction of the droplet to the rock surface and ii after te spreading is negligible and changes in the contact angle are due solely to infiltration of the droplet into the porous matrix these assumptions were employed by muster and prestidge 2002 to estimate the θe of sulfathiazole crystals based on the time at which the droplet diameter stabilized most studies using the sessile drop method to measure contact angles on minerals and rocks have ignored the dynamic behavior of water droplets on these porous media ethington 1990 measured the contact angle of water on prepared mineral surfaces assuming the droplet was completely static borysenko et al 2009 observed decreasing contact angles through time for water on pure minerals and shales but did not compute θe or θ values shang et al 2008 reported temporal changes in droplet diameter and contact angle for water on soil colloids prepared as thin films on glass slides they suggested the initial contact angle measured at 0 s time provides the most accurate characterization however the initial contact angle is not an equilibrium value because the droplet is rapidly spreading over the surface koc 2013 reported single values for the contact angle of water on the polished surfaces of granite limestone and rhyolite samples measured using the sessile drop method these values were computed by averaging all measurements made over a 45 s period of time rayudu and bulut 2014 and kittu et al 2014 also averaged contact angles measured over a fixed time period despite pronounced decreases with time during that period this approach ignores the physical differences between spreading and infiltration and results in an estimate of the contact angle that is dependent upon the length of the measurement period the studies discussed above point to the necessity of developing a systematic method for calculating the contact angle that can account for the dynamic behavior of sessile droplets on prepared rock surfaces the objective of this research was to quantify the dynamic behavior of the contact angle for water in the presence of air on polished surfaces of a variety of rock types specifically we sought to develop a method of estimating the equilibrium contact angle that recognizes the balance between droplet spreading and infiltration while accounting for differences in porosity in pursuing this goal we also recognized the need to directly visualize droplet infiltration into the porous medium 2 materials and methods the rocks studied were burlington limestone known commercially as carthage marble crossville sandstone known commercially as crab orchard sandstone mancos shale cored perpendicular to bedding sierra white granite vermilion bay granite two variants 1 and 2 known commercially as morning rose and north american pink respectively and westerly granite a commercial vendor kocurek industries inc caldwell texas supplied core samples 5 08 cm long 2 54 cm diameter of each rock type obtained from outcrops with unknown locations solid phase densities ρ s for the seven rock types were experimentally determined using a helium gas pycnometer humipyc model 1 instruquest inc coconut creek florida as described by donnelly et al 2016 dry bulk densities ρ b were determined from the oven dry sample mass and core volume with the latter calculated assuming a cylinder from caliper measurements of core length and diameter the porosity was then computed from the relationship ϕ 1 ρ b ρ s the ρ s ρ b and ϕ determinations were made on three replicate cores of each rock type drainage capillary pressure versus saturation relationships were constructed for all of the rock types except westerly granite for which insufficient material was available using a water activity meter labmaster aw novasina ag lachen switzerland following the methodology of donnelly et al 2016 these unreplicated measurements were performed on rock fragments 0 5 2 0 cm3 in volume obtained by fracturing a single core of each rock type between flat parallel plates using the brazilian method li and wong 2013 the brooks and corey 1964 equation was fitted to the experimentally determined volumetric water content capillary pressure data pairs for each rock type using segmented non linear regression analysis in sas sas institute inc 2012 the mean porosity ϕ was included as a known value with the brooks and corey 1964 residual saturation sr air entry pressure hb and pore size distribution index λ parameters treated as unknown values to be estimated a bounds statement of zero was set for the sr parameter to prohibit the regression from estimating negative residual saturations all of the fits converged and were significant at p 0 05 the model goodness of fit defined as the coefficient of determination r2 between the observed and predicted values ranged from 0 81 to 0 99 with a median value of 0 92 for the contact angle measurements two replicate disks 1 27 cm long 2 54 cm diameter were cut from a core to yield four replicate surfaces for each rock type each surface was sequentially polished using finer and finer grits with 0 05 µm gamma alumina powder used to give a final mirror finish the discs were then cleaned using deionized water and chem wipes oven dried for 24 h at 105 c and re equilibrated to room temperature and humidity prior to the contact angle measurements an example of one of the disks is shown in fig 1 a contact angles were measured with a drop shape analyzer krüss dsa 30 hamburg germany in the center for nanophase materials sciences at oak ridge national laboratory using the sessile drop method shang et al 2008 saulick et al 2017 for each measurement a 2 µl droplet of deionized water was deposited randomly on a polished rock surface high definition images of the droplet cross sectional profile were recorded over time and analyzed using the krüss advance software an ellipse tangent model conic section or tangent method 1 saulick et al 2017 krűss 2008 was employed to estimate the contact angle by fitting an ellipse to the shape of the droplet and establishing a baseline representing the polished surface on which the droplet rested measurements of the contact angle were made on both sides of the cross sectional view of the droplet based on tangents originating at the intersections of the ellipse and the baseline fig 1b the average of the left and right values was computed for each time interval and recorded as the dynamic advancing contact angle θ the θ value and the droplet diameter on the baseline d were both determined every 0 5 s for 90 s these measurements were made at three random sampling locations on each polished surface to smooth the data and facilitate a robust estimation of the equilibrium contact angle it is desirable to fit non linear models to the θ and d time series physicochemical models for the spreading of a liquid droplet on a solid non porous surface predict power law relationships for both θ versus time and d versus time de genes 1985 leger and joanny 1992 blake 2006 however different physicochemical models produce different exponents blake 2006 and experimentally determined exponents are different for early versus late spreading times eddi et al 2013 since our measurements were made on porous non solid surfaces non linear models that best fitted the data over the entire range of spreading times were fitted to both sets of time series using non linear regression the θ data were normalized against the initial dynamic advancing contact angle θ 0 and regressed against time t using the following empirical expression 3 θ θ 0 1 α t β where α and β are fitting parameters in contrast the following empirical expression was employed to model the time dependency of the droplet diameter 4 d d o 1 ν 1 e t μ where do is the initial droplet diameter on the surface at time t 0 e is euler s number and ν and μ are fitting parameters the form of eq 4 corresponds with the exponential model used to fit experimental semi variogram data sas institute inc 2012 webster and oliver 1992 since this model approaches a maximum value asymptotically its effective range is defined in practice as 3 μ which corresponds to 95 of the maximum value sas institute inc 2012 in the present study this quantity was employed to represent the time at which the droplet ceased spreading and its diameter stabilized i e te 3 μ equations 3 and 4 were fitted to the experimental data from each random location using nonlinear regression in the r software environment r core team 2016 once convergence was achieved goodness of fit was assessed using the coefficient of determination r2 obtained by linearly regressing the predicted values on the observed values the apparent equilibrium contact angle θe was computed using the following expression obtained by rearranging equation 3 setting t te 3 μ and replacing all of the parameters with best fit estimates from the nonlinear regression analyses 5 θ e θ 0 1 α e s t 3 μ e s t β e s t where α est β est and μ est are the best fit estimates of α β and μ respectively mean values of θe were calculated from the three random sessile drop measurements performed on each surface coefficient s of variation cv were also calculated from the three measurements of θe for each surface the cv provides a measure of the local spatial variability in θe and was computed as a potential indicator of differences in geochemical heterogeneity between the various rock types statistical analyses were performed on the te θe cv ρ s ρ b and ϕ parameters using the sas 9 4 sas institute inc 2012 software program these included analysis of variance anova comparison of means tukey s range test correlation and linear regression statistical significance was always evaluated at the 95 confidence level with a standard drop shape analyzer it is not possible to view what is happening over time beneath the polished rock surface on which the sessile droplet has been deposited therefore dynamic neutron radiography perfect et al 2014 was performed to observe the infiltration of water beneath the sessile droplets because neutrons are strongly attenuated by the hydrogen in water and are only weakly attenuated by air and the solid rock matrix they are ideally suited to the task of visualizing water movement into a porous medium due to the capillary driven process of spontaneous imbibition perfect et al 2014 unreplicated qualitative observations of droplet morphology and basal infiltration were conducted at the cg 1d neutron imaging facility at the high flux isotope reactor hfir oak ridge national laboratory oak ridge tn the configuration and specifications of this cold neutron beam line are described in santodonato et al 2015 the same rock disks previously employed for the contact angle measurements with the drop shape analyzer were also used for the dynamic neutron radiography the rock discs were oven dried for a further 8 hours at 105 c and re equilibrated to room temperature and humidity before use in the neutron imaging experiments sessile deionized water droplets of 30 µl were placed on the polished surfaces of selected disks and imaged for 500 s with the neutron beam at 5 s exposure intervals using a microchannel plate mcp detector the mcp detector has a native spatial resolution equal to its pixel size of 55 55 μm santodonato et al 2015 3 results and discussion selected physical properties of the different rock types studied are given in table 1 analyses of variance indicated significant differences in dry bulk density solid phase density and porosity between the rock types the mean ρ b values ranged from 2 495 g cm 3 for mancos shale to 2 656 g cm 3 for burlington limestone burlington limestone also had the highest mean solid phase density 2 704 g cm 3 with vermilion bay granite 1 having the lowest mean ρ s value 2 628 g cm 3 mancos shale and crossville sandstone had the highest porosities with mean values falling between 5 and 6 the burlington limestone and sierra white granite cores had intermediate porosities with mean values falling between 1 and 2 the other three granites had mean porosities less than 1 best fit estimates of the brooks and corey 1964 parameters for the different rock types are given in table 1 plots of the experimentally determined capillary pressure saturation data along with the brooks and corey 1964 curves predicted from the parameter estimates in table 1 can be found under supplementary material most of the curves were similar with relatively low saturation values over the entire range of capillary pressures investigated this trend suggests a preponderance of voids that empty at low capillary pressures with subsequent drainage then restricted to small pores grain boundaries and or microfractures the one exception was the mancos shale in which the saturation values were close to unity in the middle of the capillary pressure saturation range investigated this pattern suggests an absence of larger pores with the majority of drainage occurring from meso and micro pores an interpretation which is consistent with other capillary pressure saturation data sets for shales donnelly et al 2016 the measurements of droplet diameter from the drop shape analyzer revealed that water initially spread rapidly over the polished rock surfaces as time progressed the droplet diameter asymptotically approached a maximum value and then remained approximately constant the tests were not run long enough to encounter the dda phase the typical spreading behavior of an individual water droplet on a polished rock surface is illustrated in fig 2 the best fit of equation 4 to the experimental data presented in fig 2 indicated that spreading ceased at a te of 17 55 s the average value of te from all of the experiments was 7 53 s with individual values ranging from 1 to 30 s an anova conducted on the te values indicated there were no significant differences in the times taken for the droplet diameter to stabilize between the rock types since the te parameter demarcates the end of macroscopic spreading this result can be interpreted in terms of tanner s law leger and joanny 1992 which predicts that macroscopic spreading should be independent of any differences in the wettability of the solid surfaces on which the spreading occurs overall equation 4 fitted the normalized droplet diameter data very well the median r2 value for the 81 fits i e 84 surfaces minus 3 surfaces that were excluded from the analyses due to either model non convergence or non representative droplet behavior was 0 85 with an interquartile range of 0 25 these statistics indicate that the majority of the fits were better than the one illustrated in fig 2 which had an r2 0 77 fig 3 a shows the relationship between the experimental values of normalized droplet diameter versus the predicted values from the best fits of equation 4 for all of the individual data sets linear regression analysis of these data resulted in a model that was very close to a 1 1 relationship with an intercept of 0 01 and a slope of 0 99 fig 4 shows a typical time series of average contact angle values for a sessile water droplet on a polished rock surface normalized to the initial value equation 3 provided a very good fit to these particular data with an r2 value of 0 98 equation 3 also fitted the other 80 normalized average contact angle versus time data sets very well resulting in a median r2 value of 0 96 and an interquartile range of 0 02 fig 3 b shows the relationship between the experimentally determined normalized values and the predicted values from the best fits of equation 3 for all of the contact angle time series the fitted linear regression model was very close to a 1 1 relationship with an intercept of 0 03 and a slope of 0 98 both the data and best fit model in fig 4 exhibit two distinct phases a short rapid curvilinear decrease with time followed by a prolonged less rapid and approximately linear decline with time these trends are due to changes in droplet morphology caused by spreading and infiltration into the porous medium hilpert and ben david 2009 muster and prestidge 2002 spreading is the dominant effect at early times ida phase but eventually ceases so that infiltration becomes the dominant effect at later times cda phase the apparent equilibrium contact angle θe is determined at the point in time te at which this crossover occurs in fig 4 the resulting division between the ida and cda phases is shown by the change in color of the data points note our experiments were not conducted over a long enough time span to encounter the dda phase identified by hilpert and ben david 2009 the apparent equilibrium contact angles were averaged for each rock type studied an anova indicated that there were significant differences between the mean values for the different the rock types table 2 displays the number of surfaces analyzed n mean apparent equilibrium contact angles θe and associated standard errors along with the results of a tukey s comparison of means test burlington limestone had the highest θe value and was significantly less hydrophilic than the other rock types mancos shale had the lowest θe value and was significantly more hydrophilic than the other rock types except for crossville sandstone the mean values of θe for the granites ranged from 45 8 to 58 6 with the mean value for sierra white granite significantly lower than the mean values for the three alkaline granites which were not significantly different from each other it is possible that apparent equilibrium contact angles obtained using sessile droplets on solid nonporous samples of the same material might differ from those reported here however nonporous samples of the rock types we investigated are not available to test this idea while porosity could be eliminated by resin impregnation the effects of the resin on the resulting contact angles would significantly complicate the analysis perhaps the best sample pairing for such an experiment would be solid and fritted glass this comparison would amount to an independent evaluation of the method of hilpert and ben david 2009 while there is no doubt that such an evaluation would be valuable it is beyond the scope of the present study the cv parameter is an indicator of the local variation in θe the higher the cv the greater the spatial variability the mean cv was 5 7 indicting relatively low variation in the θe values on the individual rock surfaces analysis of variance performed on this parameter resulted in no statistically significant differences in mean cv values between the different rock types westerly granite and burlington limestone had the lowest mean cv values 3 4 while vermillion bay granite 2 and crossville sandstone had the highest mean cv values 8 9 this ranking was somewhat surprising since we expected the granites being more geochemically heterogeneous than the sedimentary rocks to have the highest mean cv values mean equilibrium contact angles θ were calculated by inserting the θe values into equation 2 along with the porosity data listed in table 1 the results presented in table 2 reveal only minor differences between the equilibrium and apparent equilibrium contact angles this outcome can be attributed to the low porosities of the rock types studied there were no significant correlations between either θe or θ and the mean solid phase density the mean porosity or any of the brooks and corey 1964 parameter estimates however both θe and θ were significantly positively correlated with the mean dry bulk density r 0 79 and 0 77 respectively suggesting increasing hydrophilicity with decreasing dry bulk density because there was little difference between the correlation for θe versus that for θ these correlations were likely not driven by the increased pore space available for infiltration at low dry bulk densities instead they may reflect an underlying relationship between mineralogical composition and dry bulk density that is influencing the hydrophilicity the dynamic behavior of sessile droplets on polished rock surfaces during the cda phase is believed to be due to the presence of air filled pores into which the wetting fluid penetrates by a process of spontaneous imbibition dynamic neutron radiography showed water movement into the rock disks over time in fig 5 for example the development of an elliptical wetting bulb is clearly visible beneath a sessile water droplet placed on the polished surface of a crossville sandstone disk the time series of neutron radiographic images in fig 5 starts at 15 s and it can be seen that consistent with the cde phase the diameter of the droplet remains relatively constant as infiltration proceeds over time similar wetting bulbs were observed underneath droplets on the polished surfaces of other rock types confirming the occurrence of spontaneous imbibition when measuring contact angles by the sessile drop method 4 conclusions we investigated the wettability of seven different rock types including a limestone a sandstone a shale and four kinds of granite using the sessile drop method and neutron radiography the rocks were cut and polished to produce flat surfaces with a mirror finish estimates of the advancing dynamic contact angle were obtained by fitting non linear regression models to the measurements of droplet diameter versus time and contact angle versus time these models fitted the data very well all subsequent changes in the contact angle over time were shown using neutron radiography to be due to changes in droplet morphology as water imbibed spontaneously into the rock matrix replicated measurements permitted analysis of variance and comparison of means tests to be conducted these statistical analyses indicted significant differences between the mean apparent equilibrium contact angles for the different rock types with the limestone being the least hydrophilic and the shale the most hydrophilic because of the relatively low porosities of the rock types investigated calculated values of the equilibrium contact angle were only marginally different from the measured apparent equilibrium contact angle values to the best of our knowledge the transient analysis presented in this paper represents the first application of hilpert and ben david 2009 theory of droplet spreading and infiltration to geological materials it provides a logical framework for estimating equilibrium advancing contact angles from sessile drop measurements performed on polished rock surfaces because it explicitly accounts for the dynamic behavior of the droplet as it imbibes into the porous rock matrix it represents a noteworthy improvement on existing approaches such as ignoring

angle that is dependent upon the length of the measurement period the studies discussed above point to the necessity of developing a systematic method for calculating the contact angle that can account for the dynamic behavior of sessile droplets on prepared rock surfaces the objective of this research was to quantify the dynamic behavior of the contact angle for water in the presence of air on polished surfaces of a variety of rock types specifically we sought to develop a method of estimating the equilibrium contact angle that recognizes the balance between droplet spreading and infiltration while accounting for differences in porosity in pursuing this goal we also recognized the need to directly visualize droplet infiltration into the porous medium 2 materials and methods the rocks studied were burlington limestone known commercially as carthage marble crossville sandstone known commercially as crab orchard sandstone mancos shale cored perpendicular to bedding sierra white granite vermilion bay granite two variants 1 and 2 known commercially as morning rose and north american pink respectively and westerly granite a commercial vendor kocurek industries inc caldwell texas supplied core samples 5 08 cm long 2 54 cm diameter of each rock type obtained from outcrops with unknown locations solid phase densities ρ s for the seven rock types were experimentally determined using a helium gas pycnometer humipyc model 1 instruquest inc coconut creek florida as described by donnelly et al 2016 dry bulk densities ρ b were determined from the oven dry sample mass and core volume with the latter calculated assuming a cylinder from caliper measurements of core length and diameter the porosity was then computed from the relationship ϕ 1 ρ b ρ s the ρ s ρ b and ϕ determinations were made on three replicate cores of each rock type drainage capillary pressure versus saturation relationships were constructed for all of the rock types except westerly granite for which insufficient material was available using a water activity meter labmaster aw novasina ag lachen switzerland following the methodology of donnelly et al 2016 these unreplicated measurements were performed on rock fragments 0 5 2 0 cm3 in volume obtained by fracturing a single core of each rock type between flat parallel plates using the brazilian method li and wong 2013 the brooks and corey 1964 equation was fitted to the experimentally determined volumetric water content capillary pressure data pairs for each rock type using segmented non linear regression analysis in sas sas institute inc 2012 the mean porosity ϕ was included as a known value with the brooks and corey 1964 residual saturation sr air entry pressure hb and pore size distribution index λ parameters treated as unknown values to be estimated a bounds statement of zero was set for the sr parameter to prohibit the regression from estimating negative residual saturations all of the fits converged and were significant at p 0 05 the model goodness of fit defined as the coefficient of determination r2 between the observed and predicted values ranged from 0 81 to 0 99 with a median value of 0 92 for the contact angle measurements two replicate disks 1 27 cm long 2 54 cm diameter were cut from a core to yield four replicate surfaces for each rock type each surface was sequentially polished using finer and finer grits with 0 05 µm gamma alumina powder used to give a final mirror finish the discs were then cleaned using deionized water and chem wipes oven dried for 24 h at 105 c and re equilibrated to room temperature and humidity prior to the contact angle measurements an example of one of the disks is shown in fig 1 a contact angles were measured with a drop shape analyzer krüss dsa 30 hamburg germany in the center for nanophase materials sciences at oak ridge national laboratory using the sessile drop method shang et al 2008 saulick et al 2017 for each measurement a 2 µl droplet of deionized water was deposited randomly on a polished rock surface high definition images of the droplet cross sectional profile were recorded over time and analyzed using the krüss advance software an ellipse tangent model conic section or tangent method 1 saulick et al 2017 krűss 2008 was employed to estimate the contact angle by fitting an ellipse to the shape of the droplet and establishing a baseline representing the polished surface on which the droplet rested measurements of the contact angle were made on both sides of the cross sectional view of the droplet based on tangents originating at the intersections of the ellipse and the baseline fig 1b the average of the left and right values was computed for each time interval and recorded as the dynamic advancing contact angle θ the θ value and the droplet diameter on the baseline d were both determined every 0 5 s for 90 s these measurements were made at three random sampling locations on each polished surface to smooth the data and facilitate a robust estimation of the equilibrium contact angle it is desirable to fit non linear models to the θ and d time series physicochemical models for the spreading of a liquid droplet on a solid non porous surface predict power law relationships for both θ versus time and d versus time de genes 1985 leger and joanny 1992 blake 2006 however different physicochemical models produce different exponents blake 2006 and experimentally determined exponents are different for early versus late spreading times eddi et al 2013 since our measurements were made on porous non solid surfaces non linear models that best fitted the data over the entire range of spreading times were fitted to both sets of time series using non linear regression the θ data were normalized against the initial dynamic advancing contact angle θ 0 and regressed against time t using the following empirical expression 3 θ θ 0 1 α t β where α and β are fitting parameters in contrast the following empirical expression was employed to model the time dependency of the droplet diameter 4 d d o 1 ν 1 e t μ where do is the initial droplet diameter on the surface at time t 0 e is euler s number and ν and μ are fitting parameters the form of eq 4 corresponds with the exponential model used to fit experimental semi variogram data sas institute inc 2012 webster and oliver 1992 since this model approaches a maximum value asymptotically its effective range is defined in practice as 3 μ which corresponds to 95 of the maximum value sas institute inc 2012 in the present study this quantity was employed to represent the time at which the droplet ceased spreading and its diameter stabilized i e te 3 μ equations 3 and 4 were fitted to the experimental data from each random location using nonlinear regression in the r software environment r core team 2016 once convergence was achieved goodness of fit was assessed using the coefficient of determination r2 obtained by linearly regressing the predicted values on the observed values the apparent equilibrium contact angle θe was computed using the following expression obtained by rearranging equation 3 setting t te 3 μ and replacing all of the parameters with best fit estimates from the nonlinear regression analyses 5 θ e θ 0 1 α e s t 3 μ e s t β e s t where α est β est and μ est are the best fit estimates of α β and μ respectively mean values of θe were calculated from the three random sessile drop measurements performed on each surface coefficient s of variation cv were also calculated from the three measurements of θe for each surface the cv provides a measure of the local spatial variability in θe and was computed as a potential indicator of differences in geochemical heterogeneity between the various rock types statistical analyses were performed on the te θe cv ρ s ρ b and ϕ parameters using the sas 9 4 sas institute inc 2012 software program these included analysis of variance anova comparison of means tukey s range test correlation and linear regression statistical significance was always evaluated at the 95 confidence level with a standard drop shape analyzer it is not possible to view what is happening over time beneath the polished rock surface on which the sessile droplet has been deposited therefore dynamic neutron radiography perfect et al 2014 was performed to observe the infiltration of water beneath the sessile droplets because neutrons are strongly attenuated by the hydrogen in water and are only weakly attenuated by air and the solid rock matrix they are ideally suited to the task of visualizing water movement into a porous medium due to the capillary driven process of spontaneous imbibition perfect et al 2014 unreplicated qualitative observations of droplet morphology and basal infiltration were conducted at the cg 1d neutron imaging facility at the high flux isotope reactor hfir oak ridge national laboratory oak ridge tn the configuration and specifications of this cold neutron beam line are described in santodonato et al 2015 the same rock disks previously employed for the contact angle measurements with the drop shape analyzer were also used for the dynamic neutron radiography the rock discs were oven dried for a further 8 hours at 105 c and re equilibrated to room temperature and humidity before use in the neutron imaging experiments sessile deionized water droplets of 30 µl were placed on the polished surfaces of selected disks and imaged for 500 s with the neutron beam at 5 s exposure intervals using a microchannel plate mcp detector the mcp detector has a native spatial resolution equal to its pixel size of 55 55 μm santodonato et al 2015 3 results and discussion selected physical properties of the different rock types studied are given in table 1 analyses of variance indicated significant differences in dry bulk density solid phase density and porosity between the rock types the mean ρ b values ranged from 2 495 g cm 3 for mancos shale to 2 656 g cm 3 for burlington limestone burlington limestone also had the highest mean solid phase density 2 704 g cm 3 with vermilion bay granite 1 having the lowest mean ρ s value 2 628 g cm 3 mancos shale and crossville sandstone had the highest porosities with mean values falling between 5 and 6 the burlington limestone and sierra white granite cores had intermediate porosities with mean values falling between 1 and 2 the other three granites had mean porosities less than 1 best fit estimates of the brooks and corey 1964 parameters for the different rock types are given in table 1 plots of the experimentally determined capillary pressure saturation data along with the brooks and corey 1964 curves predicted from the parameter estimates in table 1 can be found under supplementary material most of the curves were similar with relatively low saturation values over the entire range of capillary pressures investigated this trend suggests a preponderance of voids that empty at low capillary pressures with subsequent drainage then restricted to small pores grain boundaries and or microfractures the one exception was the mancos shale in which the saturation values were close to unity in the middle of the capillary pressure saturation range investigated this pattern suggests an absence of larger pores with the majority of drainage occurring from meso and micro pores an interpretation which is consistent with other capillary pressure saturation data sets for shales donnelly et al 2016 the measurements of droplet diameter from the drop shape analyzer revealed that water initially spread rapidly over the polished rock surfaces as time progressed the droplet diameter asymptotically approached a maximum value and then remained approximately constant the tests were not run long enough to encounter the dda phase the typical spreading behavior of an individual water droplet on a polished rock surface is illustrated in fig 2 the best fit of equation 4 to the experimental data presented in fig 2 indicated that spreading ceased at a te of 17 55 s the average value of te from all of the experiments was 7 53 s with individual values ranging from 1 to 30 s an anova conducted on the te values indicated there were no significant differences in the times taken for the droplet diameter to stabilize between the rock types since the te parameter demarcates the end of macroscopic spreading this result can be interpreted in terms of tanner s law leger and joanny 1992 which predicts that macroscopic spreading should be independent of any differences in the wettability of the solid surfaces on which the spreading occurs overall equation 4 fitted the normalized droplet diameter data very well the median r2 value for the 81 fits i e 84 surfaces minus 3 surfaces that were excluded from the analyses due to either model non convergence or non representative droplet behavior was 0 85 with an interquartile range of 0 25 these statistics indicate that the majority of the fits were better than the one illustrated in fig 2 which had an r2 0 77 fig 3 a shows the relationship between the experimental values of normalized droplet diameter versus the predicted values from the best fits of equation 4 for all of the individual data sets linear regression analysis of these data resulted in a model that was very close to a 1 1 relationship with an intercept of 0 01 and a slope of 0 99 fig 4 shows a typical time series of average contact angle values for a sessile water droplet on a polished rock surface normalized to the initial value equation 3 provided a very good fit to these particular data with an r2 value of 0 98 equation 3 also fitted the other 80 normalized average contact angle versus time data sets very well resulting in a median r2 value of 0 96 and an interquartile range of 0 02 fig 3 b shows the relationship between the experimentally determined normalized values and the predicted values from the best fits of equation 3 for all of the contact angle time series the fitted linear regression model was very close to a 1 1 relationship with an intercept of 0 03 and a slope of 0 98 both the data and best fit model in fig 4 exhibit two distinct phases a short rapid curvilinear decrease with time followed by a prolonged less rapid and approximately linear decline with time these trends are due to changes in droplet morphology caused by spreading and infiltration into the porous medium hilpert and ben david 2009 muster and prestidge 2002 spreading is the dominant effect at early times ida phase but eventually ceases so that infiltration becomes the dominant effect at later times cda phase the apparent equilibrium contact angle θe is determined at the point in time te at which this crossover occurs in fig 4 the resulting division between the ida and cda phases is shown by the change in color of the data points note our experiments were not conducted over a long enough time span to encounter the dda phase identified by hilpert and ben david 2009 the apparent equilibrium contact angles were averaged for each rock type studied an anova indicated that there were significant differences between the mean values for the different the rock types table 2 displays the number of surfaces analyzed n mean apparent equilibrium contact angles θe and associated standard errors along with the results of a tukey s comparison of means test burlington limestone had the highest θe value and was significantly less hydrophilic than the other rock types mancos shale had the lowest θe value and was significantly more hydrophilic than the other rock types except for crossville sandstone the mean values of θe for the granites ranged from 45 8 to 58 6 with the mean value for sierra white granite significantly lower than the mean values for the three alkaline granites which were not significantly different from each other it is possible that apparent equilibrium contact angles obtained using sessile droplets on solid nonporous samples of the same material might differ from those reported here however nonporous samples of the rock types we investigated are not available to test this idea while porosity could be eliminated by resin impregnation the effects of the resin on the resulting contact angles would significantly complicate the analysis perhaps the best sample pairing for such an experiment would be solid and fritted glass this comparison would amount to an independent evaluation of the method of hilpert and ben david 2009 while there is no doubt that such an evaluation would be valuable it is beyond the scope of the present study the cv parameter is an indicator of the local variation in θe the higher the cv the greater the spatial variability the mean cv was 5 7 indicting relatively low variation in the θe values on the individual rock surfaces analysis of variance performed on this parameter resulted in no statistically significant differences in mean cv values between the different rock types westerly granite and burlington limestone had the lowest mean cv values 3 4 while vermillion bay granite 2 and crossville sandstone had the highest mean cv values 8 9 this ranking was somewhat surprising since we expected the granites being more geochemically heterogeneous than the sedimentary rocks to have the highest mean cv values mean equilibrium contact angles θ were calculated by inserting the θe values into equation 2 along with the porosity data listed in table 1 the results presented in table 2 reveal only minor differences between the equilibrium and apparent equilibrium contact angles this outcome can be attributed to the low porosities of the rock types studied there were no significant correlations between either θe or θ and the mean solid phase density the mean porosity or any of the brooks and corey 1964 parameter estimates however both θe and θ were significantly positively correlated with the mean dry bulk density r 0 79 and 0 77 respectively suggesting increasing hydrophilicity with decreasing dry bulk density because there was little difference between the correlation for θe versus that for θ these correlations were likely not driven by the increased pore space available for infiltration at low dry bulk densities instead they may reflect an underlying relationship between mineralogical composition and dry bulk density that is influencing the hydrophilicity the dynamic behavior of sessile droplets on polished rock surfaces during the cda phase is believed to be due to the presence of air filled pores into which the wetting fluid penetrates by a process of spontaneous imbibition dynamic neutron radiography showed water movement into the rock disks over time in fig 5 for example the development of an elliptical wetting bulb is clearly visible beneath a sessile water droplet placed on the polished surface of a crossville sandstone disk the time series of neutron radiographic images in fig 5 starts at 15 s and it can be seen that consistent with the cde phase the diameter of the droplet remains relatively constant as infiltration proceeds over time similar wetting bulbs were observed underneath droplets on the polished surfaces of other rock types confirming the occurrence of spontaneous imbibition when measuring contact angles by the sessile drop method 4 conclusions we investigated the wettability of seven different rock types including a limestone a sandstone a shale and four kinds of granite using the sessile drop method and neutron radiography the rocks were cut and polished to produce flat surfaces with a mirror finish estimates of the advancing dynamic contact angle were obtained by fitting non linear regression models to the measurements of droplet diameter versus time and contact angle versus time these models fitted the data very well all subsequent changes in the contact angle over time were shown using neutron radiography to be due to changes in droplet morphology as water imbibed spontaneously into the rock matrix replicated measurements permitted analysis of variance and comparison of means tests to be conducted these statistical analyses indicted significant differences between the mean apparent equilibrium contact angles for the different rock types with the limestone being the least hydrophilic and the shale the most hydrophilic because of the relatively low porosities of the rock types investigated calculated values of the equilibrium contact angle were only marginally different from the measured apparent equilibrium contact angle values to the best of our knowledge the transient analysis presented in this paper represents the first application of hilpert and ben david 2009 theory of droplet spreading and infiltration to geological materials it provides a logical framework for estimating equilibrium advancing contact angles from sessile drop measurements performed on polished rock surfaces because it explicitly accounts for the dynamic behavior of the droplet as it imbibes into the porous rock matrix it represents a noteworthy improvement on existing approaches such as ignoring

dimensionless z water depth m zo roughness length m zsed depth of sediment layer m 1 introduction lakes and reservoirs are primary drinking water resources in many parts of the world unlike estuaries horizontal currents in lakes and reservoirs are of smaller scales therefore effects of vertical mixing on temperature profiles and chemical constituents in water column can be more appreciable elçi 2008 vertical mixing variations due to diurnally and seasonally varying weather conditions can potentially affect mixing of both natural and intentionally discharged inflows to lakes and reservoirs which in turn affects distributions of discharged chemical constituents in the water column monomictic lacustrine systems are water bodies that experience single periods of thermal stratification and mixing during each annual cycle the stratification period is usually more pronounced in mid summer when shortwave radiation significantly increases such conditions lead to a sharp and stable thermocline and minimal mixing between epilimnion and hypolimnion waters vertical stability of the water column can be evaluated using the stability number n2 which is the square of the brunt väisälä buoyancy frequency n 1 n 2 g ρ o ρ z where g is gravity acceleration m s 2 ρo is average density of water column kg m 3 and ρ is water density at depth z kg m 3 the water column zone with the highest n2 value greatest stability denotes the thermocline a number of studies on deep lakes have reported n2 10 4 s 2 at thermocline depth bouffard and lemmin 2013 vidal et al 2007 wind and surface heat flux are usually the two main sources of turbulent kinetic energy tke in lakes imberger 2012 in stratified water bodies wind driven turbulence during warm summer months is mostly limited to top epilimnetic layers and buoyancy forces due to density stratification are strong enough to resist mixing in deeper layers in some cases wind induced drag forces can be strong enough to tilt the thermocline and result in upwelling the dimensionless wedderburn number we quantifies the importance of wind induced shear relative to buoyancy imberger and patterson 1989 2 w e g δ ρ ρ h 2 u 2 l e where δρ is the difference between densities of the upper mixed layer and lower layers h is the thickness of the upper mixed layer u is wind induced surface shear velocity and le is the basin s fetch length patterson et al 1984 classified four regimes of wind induced mixing we 10 indicates strong stratification and shear velocity effects are limited to upper epilimnetic layer 3 we 10 shows increasing effects of shear production 1 we 3 indicates that thermocline is close to the surface at the upwind end of the lake and a high degree of vertical mixing occurs we 1 indicates wind driven stress is sufficiently greater than buoyancy that upwelling is likely to occur when steady winds subside potential energy stored in a tilted interface converts to tke restoring imbalanced isotherms back to their equilibrium conditions this can propagate basin scale internal waves imberger 2012 martin and mccutcheon 1998 surface layer temperatures generally follow the trend of air temperature nighttime temperature drops in surface layers can result in density instability and convective motions in epilimnion as air temperatures gradually decrease with the onset of fall convection driven turbulence within the surface mixed layer increases and combined with wind induced turbulence results in deepening of the mixed layer fischer et al 1979 surface heat loss during cold fall and winter months gradually erodes density stratification and decreases resistance against entrainment of deeper waters by the mixed layer ji 2017 in large lakes the earth s rotation also can affect frequency of internal waves particularly in cold winter months when resistance by stratification is minimal valerio et al 2012 variations in heat flux between the surface and sediment layers wind driven shear and shortwave radiation intensity during the annual cycle result in vertical and temporal variations in vertical diffusivities within the water column fischer et al 1979 ji 2017 accurate vertical diffusivity values are required to correctly predict lake or reservoir mixing in many studies the vertical diffusion coefficient kz of the water column typically in stratified conditions has been estimated based on values of the stability number average dissipation rate of tke in water column wind induced shear velocity gradient richardson number or combinations of these terms bouffard and boegman 2013 chowdhury et al 2016 preusse et al 2010 tucker and green 1977 wang 2003 the gradient richardson number is calculated as 3 r i g n 2 u z 2 where u is the horizontal velocity m s 1 a number of studies benoit and hemond 1996 jassby and powell 1975 hondzo et al 1991 von rohden et al 2007 yang et al 2015 have estimated the vertical diffusion coefficient kz of the water column mainly in stratified conditions using the heat flux method which incorporates variations of temperature profiles shortwave radiation intensities and surface and sediment heat fluxes and then reapproximated the calculated kz values using n 2 or rig numbers however vertical diffusivities in the water column that occur in unstratified conditions could be significantly different compared to values estimated during a stratified period only a few studies patterson et al 1984 benoit and hemond 1996 von rohden et al 2007 have investigated the effects of seasonal climatic variations on water column vertical diffusivities in shallow lakes based on six hourly measured temperature conductivity and dissolved oxygen do profiles of the entire water column during may 2011 through january 2015 the current study for the first time calculates year round vertical diffusivity variations at all depths in boulder basin lake mead a deep subtropical reservoir hourly measured wind speeds and meteorological data were used to calculate surface heat flux which were subsequently used to calculate hourly tke and mixing intensities depths of wind driven and convection driven mixing regions were compared to the water column s vertical diffusivity and the gradient richardson number during the study period thermocline tilting due to wind stress and earth rotation effects on mixing were evaluated using the wedderburn and burger numbers respectively effects of vertical diffusivity variations on do profile depth of thermocline and epilimnetic and deep hypolimnetic chloride and sulfate concentrations were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and data collection lake mead located on southeastern and northwestern borders of nevada and arizona was formed in 1935 by constructing the hoover dam on the colorado river it is the largest reservoir in the united states by volume 36 7 109 m3 providing water for nearly 25 million people in nevada arizona and california the colorado river provides 97 of inflow to lake mead the remaining 3 is contributed by the las vegas wash virgin river and muddy river fig 1 labounty and burns 2005 moreo et al 2013 lake mead is a deep subtropical reservoir located in a hot semi arid climate consisting of four deep basins up to 140 m connected by narrow canyons boulder basin is the largest and furthest downstream basin with an average width of about 15 km water temperature conductivity photosynthetically active radiation par intensity and do profiles as well as chloride and sulfate concentrations at depths of 5 m epilimnion and about 100 m

wind speed and surface water temperature were recorded at the sentinel island platform 36 02 46 n 114 44 30 w maintained by the united states geological survey usgs vertical profiles of water temperature conductivity and do were also collected from this station every six hours by the usgs details regarding data collection and instruments used for measurement can be found in veley and moran 2012 veley and moran 2012 and supplementary table s1 2 2 calculation of density profiles temperature and conductivity profiles at cr346 4 bb3 and cr350 0se0 55 were measured every 1 m from surface to the depth of 10 m every 2 m from the depth of 10 m to depth of 30 m and every 5 m from the depth of 30 m until the bottom of the lake profiles at the sentinel island platform were measured every 5 m from surface to the bottom of the lake typically 105 m 110 m during the study period temperature and conductivity measurements farther than 1 m apart were interpolated at 1 m intervals to support the grid used in this study density profiles were calculated based upon water temperature and conductivity profiles using methods described in imboden and wüest 1995 hutter et al 2010 comparison of water temperature and density profiles from the three snwa stations to profiles recorded at the sentinel island platform showed negligible differences this is consistent with studies by anderson and pritchard 1951 and moreo et al 2013 reporting small differences between temperature profiles measured at different locations throughout lake mead and that a single temperature profile could represent the entire lake thus measured water temperature profiles at the sentinel island platform were considered representative of the entire basin and were used for this study s computations 2 3 thermal

placed at anchored surface of submerged buoys lagrangian drifters and acoustic techniques can be used to monitor currents in lakes and reservoirs with small scale velocities among these acoustic doppler current profilers adcps are the most commonly used devices for field studies that measure the velocity profile based on phase shift due to the doppler effects between a base sinusoidal signal and a signal that passed through the water column more information can be found in hutter et al 2014 in this study tke was estimated based surface heat loss and wind driven shear as the main sources of kinetic energy for mixing the rate of change of tke over time in the upper mixed layer of the lake can be expressed as imberger 2012 17 d d t e s h 2 g δ ρ h 2 ρ o d h d t c n 3 u 3 2 w 3 2 u s 2 2

water surface shear stress at the water surface can be estimated as 21 τ s ρ a c d u 10 2 where cd is drag coefficient and u 10 is wind speed at elevation of 10 m an iterative method was used for calculating τs and cd first assuming a roughness length of zo 0 0002 m for the water surface masters 2013 u 10 was estimated based on wind speed measured at an elevation of z 2 4 m lin et al 2002 22 u

10 z o 2 where k is the von karman constant approximately 0 41 finally the corrected cd was used to estimate u according to eq 20 a major portion of tke input is consumed for mixing the upper water layer spigel et al 1986 yeates and imberger 2003 suggest that about 0 2ρw 3δtof tkeconv and about 0 4 ρ u 3 δ t of tkewind are transferred to the base of the mixed layer shear layer and provide energy to potentially deepen the mixed layer a portion the energy transferred to the shear layer penetrates below the thermocline and increases the diffusivity of these lower layers this enhances the entrainment speed of the shear layer imberger and patterson 1989 denton and wood 1981 hence the portion of tke input consumed and dissipated in the mixed layer was estimated by subtracting the energy transferred to the shear layer from the total tke input shear produced by the reynold s stress due to velocity differences between the mixed layer and lower layers can also contribute to tke available at the base of the mixed layer and boost the deepening of mixed layer imberger 2012 imberger and patterson 1981 yeates and imberger 2003 contributions of both surface cooling and wind in turbulence production and mixing of epilimnetic waters vary with weather conditions and winds the monin obukhov length scale lm was used to determine the depth to which wind shear dominates velocity fluctuations below this depth velocity fluctuations are dominated by buoyancy fluxes the monin obukhov length scale lm was determined as thorpe 2007 27 l m u 3 k α g h n e t c p w ρ 2 5 effects of tke on thermocline wind stress produces turbulence in upper water layers due to surface shear which in turn disturbs the lower layers convective heat transfer motions also penetrate the epilimnetic waters until they reach the stable thermocline imberger and patterson 1989 fischer et al 1979 therefore the epilimnion depth was considered to represent the lower boundary of the actively mixed region below which in thermocline mixing mostly results from shear the thermocline is usually the most stable segment of the water column valerio et al 2012 hence the depth of greatest stability depth of maximum n2 value in the water column was considered as the middle of metalimnion due to considerable temperature gradients in the thermocline the sign of d2t dz2 will change from negative upper boundary to positive lower boundary across the extent of thermocline bade 2005 the thermocline s upper boundary was estimated by locating the minimum d2t dz2 value in each temperature profile see supplementary fig s1 the upper thermocline depth in each temperature profile was shallower than the depth of the highest stability confirming that it was above the middle of thermocline the thermocline depth time series was smoothed using a savitzky golay filter with a window size of 7 data points to remove a limited number of outliers 2 5 vertical diffusion coefficient the following method was used to estimate temporal and vertical variations in kz over the study period considering incoming shortwave radiation and sediment layer heat flux as the heat sources and assuming net vertical velocity in the water column to be small the vertical diffusion coefficient can be estimated as 28 k z 1 t z z t z z max t ζ d ζ h s h o r t z c p w ρ h s e d c p w ρ where hsed w m 2 is the heat exchange rate between the water and sediment layers seasonal water temperature variations in the hypolimnion can affect the temperature of the underlaying sediment layer a one dimensional heat conduction equation was used to compute sediment temperature profiles benoit and hemond 1996 hondzo et al 1991 29 t s e d z s e d t t k s e d 2 t s e d z s e d t z s e d 2 where tsed is temperature of sediment layer zsed is depth of sediment layer and ks is vertical thermal diffusivity of sediments m2 s 1 based upon values reported by benoit and hemond 1996 hondzo et al 1991 and von rohden et al 2007 a thermal diffusivity of 3 10 7 m2 s 1 was adopted for the sediment layer temperature variations in deep sediment layers are very small and can be assumed to be close the mean annual temperature of overlying hypolimnion water benoit and hemond 1996 von rohden et al 2007 hondzo et al 1991 and benoit and hemond 1996 reported negligible temperature variations for sediments at depths greater than 6 m and 2 m respectively therefore negligible temperature variations at sediment depths 10 m were assumed in this study assuming adiabatic conditions at a depth of 10 m as a lower boundary for sediments and the temperature at the upper sediment boundary to be equal to the temperature of overlying water unsteady heat transfer rates were computed eq 29 using an implicit central difference in space forward in time unconditionally stable numerical scheme a vertical grid size of 1 cm and a time step of 1 s were used in the computations the estimated temperature profiles in the sediment layer from eq 29 then were substituted in eq 30 to estimate heat fluxes between the reservoir and sediment layer hsed w m 2 hondzo et al 1991 30 h s e d ρ s e d c p s e d 0 z max t s e d z s e d t d z where ρsed is the density of sediment layer and cp sed is the specific heat of the sediments j kg 1 c 1 in eq 30 a water ρw 1000 kg m 3 cp w 4190 j kg 1 c 1 to dry sediment ρsed dry 2500 kg m 3 cp sed dry 837 j kg 1 c 1 ratio of 5 6 4 4 benoit and hemond 1996 was assumed for the sediment layer resulting in a bulk density of ρsed of 1450 kg m 3 and cp sed of 3184 j kg 1 c 1 for combined sediment and water weekly averaged values of hshort and hsed were calculated and substituted in eq 28 to compute kz the derivatives and integrals in eqs 28 and 30 were evaluated using central difference and trapezoidal approximations respectively 2 6 dimensional analyses dimensionless parameters can be used to evaluate the influence of different forces on mixing in lakes the gradient richardson number rig eq 3 is a measure of stratification stability against turbulence due to velocity gradients daily averaged velocity gradients du dz in eq 3 were calculated based on the daily averaged wind induced surface shear velocities u according to thorpe 2007 31 d u d z u k z the critical value of the gradient richardson number is rig c 0 25 below which turbulence can result in instability of water column the relative strength of the wind stress compared to buoyancy to tilt the thermocline was evaluated using the wedderburn number eq 2 the relative influence of coriolis force on internal waves in boulder basin was evaluated using the burger number s antenucci and imberger 2001 32 s c f l e where c is the phase speed of internal waves m s 1 f is the coriolis frequency s 1 and le is a length scale m characterizing the basin width which can be considered the half length of basin s major axis for a two layer reservoir the phase speed of internal waves at a density discontinuity can be estimated by 33 c g δ ρ h 1 h 2 ρ o h 1 h 2 where h 1 is the upper layer s thickness and h 2 is the bottom layer s thickness the coriolis parameter was calculated using eq 34 34 f 2 ω s i n λ where ω is the earth s angular velocity approximately 7 29 10 5 rad s 1 and λ is the latitude of the basin 36 05 n large burger numbers s 1 indicate that the gravity dominates the coriolis force and internal waves can freely respond to wind driven stress burger numbers less than unity s 1 show that earth s rotation affects the dynamics of internal waves the rate of dissipation of tke is a good indication of turbulence and mixing in water bodies relative mixing intensities in boulder basin during different seasons were evaluated using the dimensionless mixing intensity number i yang et al 2015 shih et al 2005 35 i ɛ υ n 2 where ε is rate of dissipated tke per unit mass of water w kg 1 and υ is kinematic viscosity of water m2 s 1 daily averaged values of ε in w kg 1 were calculated using depth water density and hourly rates of tke dissipated in the mixed layer values of υ were based on the average temperature and conductivity of the mixed layer daily averages of ε υ and n2 of the mixed layer were then substituted into eq 35 shih et al 2005 proposed three turbulence regimes based on mixing intensity number according to shih et al 2005 i 7 indicates a diffusive regime in which turbulence gradually decays and diffusivity tends to reach molecular ranges 7 i 100 indicates an intermediate regime in which turbulence is in equilibrium and does not propagate or decay and i 100 identifies an energetic regime in which turbulence tends to grow particularly in weakly stratified waters i 200 commonly occurs in very weakly stratified waters in which turbulence motions could be isotropic thorpe 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermal energy balance fig 2 a shows seasonal variations in air and surface water temperatures wind speed does not exhibit a noticeable periodic cycle however wind speeds between mid december and february were slightly lower that the annual average of 4 m s 1 fig 2b as seen from the wind rose in fig 2c prevailing winds in boulder basin were mostly southeasterly and northwesterly as prevailing winds were southeasterly and northwesterly and intensities of winds from other directions were significantly lower considering a fetch length along southeast to northwest direction could be acceptable this length is nearly equal to half the length of the basin s major axis which was considered as the length scale characterizing the basin dimension for effects of coriolis force on internal waves while temperatures of surface water layers generally follow air temperature trends due to the great depth of boulder basin temperature fluctuation patterns in deep waters were different supplementary fig s2 deep layer temperatures showed an increasing trend from april until january and then dropped from mid january to march possibly due to turnover intense shortwave radiation during the summer increased the thermal energy of water column fig 3 a particularly the upper layers and resulted in thermal stratification fig 3b although thermal energy absorption rates peaked in june positive thermal energy accumulation continued until late august increasing the temperature of upper water layers after this period surface water temperatures were typically greater than air temperature fig 2b and the lake began to lose thermal energy increasing metalimnetic heat content during the summer enhanced the buoyancy of these layers as a result high values of the square of buoyancy frequency stability number of n2 5 10 4 s 2 were observed between depths of 12 to 35 m during the summer fig 4 however because the thermocline hinders heat transfer to deeper layers the stability of the water column at depths greater than 60 m was significantly lower n2 10 5 s 2 fig 5 a and b show typical diurnal variations of heat fluxes during summer and winter respectively surface water layer temperatures reached 29 c in hot summer days yet considerable heat loss was observed during summer nights fig 5a latent heat flux evaporation was the main heat loss mechanism during the summer varying primarily with wind speed and water column heat content fig 6 shows evaporative heat loss increased due to increases in shortwave radiation on summer days latent heat loss began increasing by sunrise and typically peaked in the evenings resulting in strong diurnal fluctuations of surface heat flux fig 5a evaporative heat loss significantly decreased during winter and longwave radiation became the main heat loss mechanism figs 6 and 5b during winter air temperatures were also colder than surface water temperatures fig 2 resulting in positive sensible heat flux figs 6 and 5b while during the rest of the year sensible heat flux was negative 3 2 tke fluctuations fig 3a shows that the thermal energy absorption rate significantly decreased and water column temperatures became nearly homogeneous from november to february the relatively low heat content of the water column during this period also resulted in reduced net surface heat flux fig 6b the reduced surface heat flux led to decreased tkeconv fig 7 a however reduced buoyancy and reduced stability of water column n2 10 5 s 2 allowed available tke to extend deeper and increase epilimnion depth fig 4 fig 7a shows about 58 of total tke input was contributed by tkeconv from march to april surface heat losses were typically minimal and sporadic positive net surface fluxes were observed fig 6b this led to a noticeable decrease of tkeconv in this period and the ratio of tkeconv to the total tke input decreased to less than 45 the monin obukhov length scale lm in fig 7c shows that from may to november the effects of turbulent mixing by wind were generally limited to about the top 9 m of the water column however decreasing surface heat loss from november until late january resulted in relatively higher lm values in addition as during this time period the water column was also least stable wind induced tke could more effectively disturb deeper water layers and thus its contribution in mixing of deeper water layers was more noticeable fig 7c negative hourly averaged lm values in fig 7c correspond to positive surface heat fluxes fig 6b these mostly occurred from february to may the combined effects of decreased tke input fig 7b and increased shortwave radiation figs 3a and 6 on buoyancy increases in the upper water layers during march and april significantly decreased the epilimnion depth during this period the epilimnion depth decreased from about 65 m to less than 10 m fig 4 despite the relatively high tke input from june to september fig 7 strong stratification and high water column stability prevented the mixed layer from penetrating to deeper layers fig 4 3 3 vertical diffusivity of water column fig 8 shows temporal and vertical variations of the water column vertical diffusion coefficient diffusivities seasonally varied by 1 to 1 5 orders of magnitude typically 5 10 5 to 10 3 m2 s 1 in the upper water column and typically varied by about 1 5 orders of magnitude typically 3 10 6 to 10 4 m2 s 1 in the deeper layers diffusivities as high as 3 10 4 m2 s 1 occasionally occurred in the deeper waters during december through february the significant increase in vertical diffusivity during december through february is consistent with the lower stability of the water column fig 4 and deeper mixed layer in this period the average vertical diffusivity increased from 5 1 10 5 m2 s 1 to about 9 3 10 4 m2 s 1 in the top 60 m intense stratification during the summer reduced water column vertical diffusivities as values of lm fig 7c indicate the synergistic effects of tkewind and tkeconv were more conspicuous in the upper 8 m leading to higher vertical diffusivities in this zone than at greater depths fig 8 the average vertical diffusion coefficient in the top 8 m during the summer was about 1 2 10 4 m2 s 1 compared to 3 1 10 5 m2 s 1 for depths between 30 100 m yang et al 2015 reported average vertical diffusivities of 2 4 10 4 and 3 6 10 6 m2 s 1 in kranji reservoir singapore average depth of 5 m on 29 september and 5 october respectively in a deeper lake imboden et al 1983 found vertical diffusivities of lake baldegg switzerland maximum depth of 66 m during the summer ranged between 10 6 to 10 4 m2 s 1 orlob and selna 1970 reported average vertical diffusivities between 1 0 10 5 to 1 7 10 4 m2 s 1 during the summer for deep california lakes with maximum depths ranging between 104 to 490 m summer vertical diffusivities found in this study in boulder basin with a typical depth of 120 m are within the range reported by orlob and selna 1970 due to the great depth of boulder basin effects of calculated sediment heat fluxes on magnitudes of water column vertical diffusivities were small these effects were typically on the order of 10 8 m2 s 1 to 10 7 m2 s 1 and were somewhat higher during the turnover period up to 5 10 7 m2 s 1 values at the high end of this range 5 10 7 m2 s 1 could slightly influence deep water layers 3 4 analysis of representative dimensionless numbers 3 4 1 gradient richardson number in addition to molecular scale diffusion turbulence due to velocity gradients can also lead to vertical transport in the water column fig 9 depicts the computed gradient richardson number rig considering wind shear as the only driving force responsible for horizontal currents the dotted line in fig 9 represents rig c 0 25 water layers above the dotted line maintain the necessary conditions for a turbulent regime and thus could be dynamically unstable grachev et al 2013 during the summer the depth of rig c remained in the top epilimnetic layers however the depth of rig 0 25 reached more than 45 m because of gradual heat loss and decrease in stability of water column during the cold winter days the upper metalimnion depth depicted in fig 4 indicates the depth above which tke conv promotes vertical mixing in the water column rig in these layers was up to about 1 0 in contrast the depth of instability rig 0 25 in fig 9 corresponds to the depth where both tkewind and tkeconv could synergistically disturb the water layers this critical depth typically increased to values of about 50 m during winter unstratified conditions fig 9 good agreement was also observed between lm values in fig 7 and the depth of rig 0 25 in fig 9 the gradual increase of rig from less than 0 25 to greater than 1 0 in upper metalimnion layers indicates the transition from an unstable turbulent regime to a stable laminar regime grachev et al 2013 3 4 2 wedderburn number wedderburn we numbers in fig 10 a show that wind shear was not sufficiently strong to result in upwelling generally the average weekly we in stratified conditions was more than 10 dashed blue line fig 10a indicating that due to strong stratification wind stress could not noticeably tilt the thermocline decreases of we number below 3 0 dashed green line fig 10a during mid winter to mid spring and even below 1 0 dashed red line fig 10a between february to april 2012 indicate strong winds effects wind speed 6 m s 1 during a period of instability however these events mostly occurred during unstratified conditions during the summer when water quality in epilimnion and hypolimnion could be different the average we was about 31 indicating buoyancy dominated over wind induced stress 3 4 3 mixing intensity fig 10b shows the mixing intensity i in the epilimnion was typically about 100 during the summer green line in fig 10b fluctuating between the intermediate and energetic regimes during the late fall and winter the upper metalimnion depth significantly increased and tke input was distributed to a greater volume of water due to the decrease in water column stability the tke input could more effectively mix these layers and therefore mixing intensity increased to the energetic region i 100 shih et al 2005 from mid fall to winter i reached intensities greater than 200 red line in fig 10b suggesting isotropic turbulent motion in the mixed layer thorpe 2007 increasing shortwave radiation and subsequent increases in buoyance during the spring decreased the mixing intensity to about 100 3 4 4 burger number fig 10c shows the burger number s was commonly less than the critical value of 1 0 dashed red line in fig 10c the burger number sporadically exceeded 1 0 during the summer and early fall and then only slightly this indicates that boulder basin is large enough for the coriolis force to affect the dynamics of basin scale internal waves the burger number increased with intensity of stratification with maximum s occurring during late june and early july when the shortwave intensity was maximum decreased water column stability in the winter allowed the coriolis force to overpower gravity forces and the burger number decreased to less than 0 25 3 5 concentration variations of water constituents during annual cycles differences between the epilimnetic and hypolimnetic constituent concentrations are indicative of the degree of vertical mixing fig 11 compares chloride and sulfate concentrations at depths of 5 m and 100 m fig 11 shows that epilimnetic chloride and sulfate concentrations were higher than hypolimnnetic concentrations except for a few short periods after turnovers where they were similar the las vegas wash consists mostly of treated wastewater and discharges into las vegas bay dissolved ion mass loadings from the wash s discharge are usually sufficient to affect boulder basin s water quality average wash chloride and sulfate concentrations were calculated to be 296 31 mg l 1 and 529 56 mg l 1 respectively over the study period roughly 2 5 times higher than values found in boulder basin vertical diffusion eventually spreads and dilutes the wash plume as it moves from las vegas bay into boulder basin the plume typically tends to mix and disperse in the epilimnetic and metalimnetic layers of the water column when the lake is stratified as vertical diffusion increased during fall and winter cooling fig 8 distribution of chloride and sulfate in water column became more homogeneous and thus difference between epilimnetic and hypolimnetic concentrations decreased fig 11 depth of the well oxygenated zone is also an indicator of active mixing depth and can be used to approximate the epilimnion depth antonopoulos and gianniou 2003 çalişkan and ş elçi 2009 stefan et al 1995 as seen in fig 12 the depth of well oxygenated waters depth of minimum d2do dz2 profile the blue line in fig 12 and the epilimnion depth the red line in fig 12 followed similar trends but did not coincide the highest level of agreement between fluctuation patterns was observed during the noticeable drop in do concentrations at depths of 30 to 60 m during october through december low vertical diffusivities between the depths of 30 and 60 m were also observed during this period fig 8 during january and february vertical diffusivities in the entire water column significantly increased oxygen from top layers could reach deeper layers and the depth of the well oxygenated zone increased to more than 60 m do concentrations in deep waters increased from 6 0 mg l 1 to about 8 5 mg l 1 at this time of year after this period diffusivities of deep layers decreased but do of deep waters remained above 7 5 mg l 1 until summer the slow change in do could be due to low overall microbial metabolism rates in deep cold waters limiting rates of do depletion from late february to september the well oxygenated zone depth was noticeably higher than the epilimnion depth indicating different patterns of temperature and do profiles after turnover a typical minimum of well oxygenated depth in june and then an increase in august indicated some variability in well oxygenated depth during summer months 4 conclusions the hot semi arid climate of the southern nevada northern arizona desert region leads to evaporation causing most surface heat loss during the annual cycle in warm and dry climates where the difference between the saturated vapor pressure and air vapor pressure could be large local winds can increase evaporative heat loss rates and thus both tkewind and tkeconv could be influenced by the intensity of local winds in this study more than 58 of the total tke input was contributed by tkeconv thus the relative contribution of tkeconv to total tke input should be considered when modeling lakes located in warm and dry climates however in temperate climate conditions relatively smaller differences between the saturated vapor pressure and air vapor pressure would limit the wind effects on the evaporative heat flux and thus reduce the contribution of tkeconv seasonal climate variations significantly influenced the stability of top 60 m of water column in this deep lake this influence was more intense during the january february turnover period reflected by an 18 fold increase of vertical diffusivity despite the increased mixed layer depth and the greater volume of water to be mixed from late november to late february compared to spring and summer the intensity of mixing during this period was also considerably higher epilimnetic and hypolimnetic chloride and sulfate concentrations reflect the degree of vertical mixing in water column epilimnion depth and the depth of the well oxygenated zone showed similar decreasing trends during october and december however due to creation of an oxygen depleted zone during this time period between depths 30 50 m oxygen concentrations at epilimnion depth and the depth of well oxygenated zone were different after this period the two depths followed an increasing trend but the increase in do content of deep layers due to winter overturn and considerable fluctuations in the depth of the well oxygenated zone during the summer and early fall increased the deviation over time fetch length is an important factor that can affect internal waves produced by wind driven mixing and the coriolis force due to lake mead s size and the region s complex topography distributions of wind speeds and directions in other parts of the lake could be very different therefore results reported in

786,accurate vertical diffusivity estimates at different stratification conditions are essential to correctly model vertical mixing of discharges into lakes this study presents calculated variations in vertical mixing at different depths in boulder basin lake mead a deep reservoir over a four year period using hourly weather data and 6 hourly measured temperature conductivity and do profiles turbulent kinetic energy tke and mixing intensities within boulder basin calculated based on surface heat flux and wind speed were compared to water column stability and diffusivity over the study period analysis of surface heat fluxes showed that evaporation and longwave radiation were the main heat loss mechanisms in summer and winter respectively the lake showed strong summer stratification with stability numbers n 2 10 4 s 2 followed by increased water column instability during fall and eventually winter overturn resulting in gradient richardson numbers 0 25 in the water column s top 50 m the average calculated wedderburn number was 45 during summer stratification indicating that local winds were not sufficiently strong to generate upwelling burger numbers s 1 show that the coriolis force significantly affects vertical mixing in boulder basin over the entire annual cycle diffusivities seasonally varied by 1 to 1 5 orders of magnitude typically 5 10 5 to 10 3 m2 s 1 in the upper

dimensionless z water depth m zo roughness length m zsed depth of sediment layer m 1 introduction lakes and reservoirs are primary drinking water resources in many parts of the world unlike estuaries horizontal currents in lakes and reservoirs are of smaller scales therefore effects of vertical mixing on temperature profiles and chemical constituents in water column can be more appreciable elçi 2008 vertical mixing variations due to diurnally and seasonally varying weather conditions can potentially affect mixing of both natural and intentionally discharged inflows to lakes and reservoirs which in turn affects distributions of discharged chemical constituents in the water column monomictic lacustrine systems are water bodies that experience single periods of thermal stratification and mixing during each annual cycle the stratification period is usually more pronounced in mid summer when shortwave radiation significantly increases such conditions lead to a sharp and stable thermocline and minimal mixing between epilimnion and hypolimnion waters vertical stability of the water column can be evaluated using the stability number n2 which is the square of the brunt väisälä buoyancy frequency n 1 n 2 g ρ o ρ z where g is gravity acceleration m s 2 ρo is average density of water column kg m 3 and ρ is water density at depth z kg m 3 the water column zone with the highest n2 value greatest stability denotes the thermocline a number of studies on deep lakes have reported n2 10 4 s 2 at thermocline depth bouffard and lemmin 2013 vidal et al 2007 wind and surface heat flux are usually the two main sources of turbulent kinetic energy tke in lakes imberger 2012 in stratified water bodies wind driven turbulence during warm summer months is mostly limited to top epilimnetic layers and buoyancy forces due to density stratification are strong enough to resist mixing in deeper layers in some cases wind induced drag forces can be strong enough to tilt the thermocline and result in upwelling the dimensionless wedderburn number we quantifies the importance of wind induced shear relative to buoyancy imberger and patterson 1989 2 w e g δ ρ ρ h 2 u 2 l e where δρ is the difference between densities of the upper mixed layer and lower layers h is the thickness of the upper mixed layer u is wind induced surface shear velocity and le is the basin s fetch length patterson et al 1984 classified four regimes of wind induced mixing we 10 indicates strong stratification and shear velocity effects are limited to upper epilimnetic layer 3 we 10 shows increasing effects of shear production 1 we 3 indicates that thermocline is close to the surface at the upwind end of the lake and a high degree of vertical mixing occurs we 1 indicates wind driven stress is sufficiently greater than buoyancy that upwelling is likely to occur when steady winds subside potential energy stored in a tilted interface converts to tke restoring imbalanced isotherms back to their equilibrium conditions this can propagate basin scale internal waves imberger 2012 martin and mccutcheon 1998 surface layer temperatures generally follow the trend of air temperature nighttime temperature drops in surface layers can result in density instability and convective motions in epilimnion as air temperatures gradually decrease with the onset of fall convection driven turbulence within the surface mixed layer increases and combined with wind induced turbulence results in deepening of the mixed layer fischer et al 1979 surface heat loss during cold fall and winter months gradually erodes density stratification and decreases resistance against entrainment of deeper waters by the mixed layer ji 2017 in large lakes the earth s rotation also can affect frequency of internal waves particularly in cold winter months when resistance by stratification is minimal valerio et al 2012 variations in heat flux between the surface and sediment layers wind driven shear and shortwave radiation intensity during the annual cycle result in vertical and temporal variations in vertical diffusivities within the water column fischer et al 1979 ji 2017 accurate vertical diffusivity values are required to correctly predict lake or reservoir mixing in many studies the vertical diffusion coefficient kz of the water column typically in stratified conditions has been estimated based on values of the stability number average dissipation rate of tke in water column wind induced shear velocity gradient richardson number or combinations of these terms bouffard and boegman 2013 chowdhury et al 2016 preusse et al 2010 tucker and green 1977 wang 2003 the gradient richardson number is calculated as 3 r i g n 2 u z 2 where u is the horizontal velocity m s 1 a number of studies benoit and hemond 1996 jassby and powell 1975 hondzo et al 1991 von rohden et al 2007 yang et al 2015 have estimated the vertical diffusion coefficient kz of the water column mainly in stratified conditions using the heat flux method which incorporates variations of temperature profiles shortwave radiation intensities and surface and sediment heat fluxes and then reapproximated the calculated kz values using n 2 or rig numbers however vertical diffusivities in the water column that occur in unstratified conditions could be significantly different compared to values estimated during a stratified period only a few studies patterson et al 1984 benoit and hemond 1996 von rohden et al 2007 have investigated the effects of seasonal climatic variations on water column vertical diffusivities in shallow lakes based on six hourly measured temperature conductivity and dissolved oxygen do profiles of the entire water column during may 2011 through january 2015 the current study for the first time calculates year round vertical diffusivity variations at all depths in boulder basin lake mead a deep subtropical reservoir hourly measured wind speeds and meteorological data were used to calculate surface heat flux which were subsequently used to calculate hourly tke and mixing intensities depths of wind driven and convection driven mixing regions were compared to the water column s vertical diffusivity and the gradient richardson number during the study period thermocline tilting due to wind stress and earth rotation effects on mixing were evaluated using the wedderburn and burger numbers respectively effects of vertical diffusivity variations on do profile depth of thermocline and epilimnetic and deep hypolimnetic chloride and sulfate concentrations were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and data collection lake mead located on southeastern and northwestern borders of nevada and arizona was formed in 1935 by constructing the hoover dam on the colorado river it is the largest reservoir in the united states by volume 36 7 109 m3 providing water for nearly 25 million people in nevada arizona and california the colorado river provides 97 of inflow to lake mead the remaining 3 is contributed by the las vegas wash virgin river and muddy river fig 1 labounty and burns 2005 moreo et al 2013 lake mead is a deep subtropical reservoir located in a hot semi arid climate consisting of four deep basins up to 140 m connected by narrow canyons boulder basin is the largest and furthest downstream basin with an average width of about 15 km water temperature conductivity photosynthetically active radiation par intensity and do profiles as well as chloride and sulfate concentrations at depths of 5 m epilimnion and about 100 m

by the southern nevada water authority snwa at biweekly to monthly intervals solar shortwave radiation data and associated zenith angle from mccarran airport located 30 km from boulder basin were

2012 veley and moran 2012 and supplementary table s1 2 2 calculation of density profiles temperature and conductivity profiles at cr346 4 bb3 and cr350 0se0 55 were measured every 1 m from surface to the depth of 10 m every 2 m from the depth of 10 m to depth of 30 m and every 5 m from the depth of 30 m until the bottom of the lake profiles at the sentinel island platform were measured every 5 m from surface to the bottom of the lake typically 105 m 110 m during the study period temperature and conductivity measurements farther than 1 m apart were interpolated at 1 m intervals to support the grid used in this study density profiles were calculated based upon water temperature and conductivity profiles using methods described in imboden and wüest 1995 hutter et al 2010 comparison of water temperature and density profiles from the three snwa stations to profiles recorded at the sentinel island platform showed negligible differences this is consistent with studies by anderson and pritchard 1951 and moreo et al 2013 reporting small differences between temperature profiles measured at different locations throughout lake mead and that a single temperature profile could represent the entire lake thus measured water temperature profiles at the sentinel island platform were considered representative of the entire basin and were used for this study s computations 2 3 thermal

placed at anchored surface of submerged buoys lagrangian drifters and acoustic techniques can be used to monitor currents in lakes and reservoirs with small scale velocities among these acoustic doppler current profilers adcps are the most commonly used devices for field studies that measure the velocity profile based on phase shift due to the doppler effects between a base sinusoidal signal and a signal that passed through the water column more information can be found in hutter et al 2014 in this study tke was estimated based surface heat loss and wind driven shear as the main sources of kinetic energy for mixing the rate of change of tke over time in the upper mixed layer of the lake can be expressed as imberger 2012 17 d d t e s h 2 g δ ρ h 2 ρ o d h d t c n 3 u 3 2 w 3 2 u s 2 2

10 z o 2 where k is the von karman constant approximately 0 41 finally the corrected cd was used to estimate u according to eq 20 a major portion of tke input is consumed for mixing the upper water layer spigel et al 1986 yeates and imberger 2003 suggest that about 0 2ρw 3δtof tkeconv and about 0 4 ρ u 3 δ t of tkewind are transferred to the base of the mixed layer shear layer and provide energy to potentially deepen the mixed layer a portion the energy transferred to the shear layer penetrates below the thermocline and increases the diffusivity of these lower layers this enhances the entrainment speed of the shear layer imberger and patterson 1989 denton and wood 1981 hence the portion of tke input consumed and dissipated in the mixed layer was estimated by subtracting the energy transferred to the shear layer from the total tke input shear produced by the reynold s stress due to velocity differences between the mixed layer and lower layers can also contribute to tke available at the base of the mixed layer and boost the deepening of mixed layer imberger 2012 imberger and patterson 1981 yeates and imberger 2003 contributions of both surface cooling and wind in turbulence production and mixing of epilimnetic waters vary with weather conditions and winds the monin obukhov length scale lm was used to determine the depth to which wind shear dominates velocity fluctuations below this depth velocity fluctuations are dominated by buoyancy fluxes the monin obukhov length scale lm was determined as thorpe 2007 27 l m u 3 k α g h n e t c p w ρ 2 5 effects of tke on thermocline wind stress produces turbulence in upper water layers due to surface shear which in turn disturbs the lower layers convective heat transfer motions also penetrate the epilimnetic waters until they reach the stable thermocline imberger and patterson 1989 fischer et al 1979 therefore the epilimnion depth was considered to represent the lower boundary of the actively mixed region below which in thermocline mixing mostly results from shear the thermocline is usually the most stable segment of the water column valerio et al 2012 hence the depth of greatest stability depth of maximum n2 value in the water column was considered as the middle of metalimnion due to considerable temperature gradients in the thermocline the sign of d2t dz2 will change from negative upper boundary to positive lower boundary across the extent of thermocline bade 2005 the thermocline s upper boundary was estimated by locating the minimum d2t dz2 value in each temperature profile see supplementary fig s1 the upper thermocline depth in each temperature profile was shallower than the depth of the highest stability confirming that it was above the middle of thermocline the thermocline depth time series was smoothed using a savitzky golay filter with a window size of 7 data points to remove a limited number of outliers 2 5 vertical diffusion coefficient the following method was used to estimate temporal and vertical variations in kz over the study period considering incoming shortwave radiation and sediment layer heat flux as the heat sources and assuming net vertical velocity in the water column to be small the vertical diffusion coefficient can be estimated as 28 k z 1 t z z t z z max t ζ d ζ h s h o r t z c p w ρ h s e d c p w ρ where hsed w m 2 is the heat exchange rate between the water and sediment layers seasonal water temperature variations in the hypolimnion can affect the temperature of the underlaying sediment layer a one dimensional heat conduction equation was used to compute sediment temperature profiles benoit and hemond 1996 hondzo et al 1991 29 t s e d z s e d t t k s e d 2 t s e d z s e d t z s e d 2 where tsed is temperature of sediment layer zsed is depth of sediment layer and ks is vertical thermal diffusivity of sediments m2 s 1 based upon values reported by benoit and hemond 1996 hondzo et al 1991 and von rohden et al 2007 a thermal diffusivity of 3 10 7 m2 s 1 was adopted for the sediment layer temperature variations in deep sediment layers are very small and can be assumed to be close the mean annual temperature of overlying hypolimnion water benoit and hemond 1996 von rohden et al 2007 hondzo et al 1991 and benoit and hemond 1996 reported negligible temperature variations for sediments at depths greater than 6 m and 2 m respectively therefore negligible temperature variations at sediment depths 10 m were assumed in this study assuming adiabatic conditions at a depth of 10 m as a lower boundary for sediments and the temperature at the upper sediment boundary to be equal to the temperature of overlying water unsteady heat transfer rates were computed eq 29 using an implicit central difference in space forward in time unconditionally stable numerical scheme a vertical grid size of 1 cm and a time step of 1 s were used in the computations the estimated temperature profiles in the sediment layer from eq 29 then were substituted in eq 30 to estimate heat fluxes between the reservoir and sediment layer hsed w m 2 hondzo et al 1991 30 h s e d ρ s e d c p s e d 0 z max t s e d z s e d t d z where ρsed is the

1 ratio of 5 6 4 4 benoit and hemond 1996 was assumed for the sediment layer resulting in a bulk density of ρsed of 1450 kg m 3 and cp sed of 3184 j kg 1 c 1 for combined sediment and water weekly averaged values of hshort and hsed were calculated and substituted in eq 28 to compute kz the derivatives and integrals in eqs 28 and 30 were evaluated using central difference and trapezoidal approximations respectively 2 6 dimensional analyses dimensionless parameters can be used to evaluate the influence of different forces on mixing in lakes the gradient richardson number rig eq 3 is a measure of stratification stability against turbulence due to velocity gradients daily averaged velocity gradients du dz in eq 3 were calculated based on the daily averaged wind induced surface shear velocities u according to thorpe 2007 31 d u d z u k z the critical value of the gradient richardson number is rig c 0 25 below which turbulence can result in instability of water column the relative strength of the wind stress compared to buoyancy to tilt the thermocline was evaluated using the wedderburn number eq 2 the relative influence of coriolis force on internal waves in boulder basin was evaluated using the burger number s antenucci and imberger 2001 32 s c f l e where c is the phase speed of internal waves m s 1 f is the coriolis frequency s 1 and le is a length scale m characterizing the basin width which can be considered the half length of basin s major axis for a two layer reservoir the phase speed of internal waves at a density discontinuity can be estimated by 33 c g δ ρ h 1 h 2 ρ o h 1 h 2 where h 1 is the upper layer s thickness and h 2 is the bottom layer s thickness the coriolis parameter was calculated using eq 34 34 f 2 ω s i n λ where ω is the earth s angular velocity approximately 7 29 10 5 rad s 1 and λ is the latitude of the basin 36 05 n large burger numbers s 1 indicate that the gravity dominates the coriolis force and internal waves can freely respond to wind driven stress burger numbers less than unity s 1 show that earth s rotation affects the dynamics of internal waves the rate of dissipation of tke is a good indication of turbulence and mixing in water bodies relative mixing intensities in boulder basin during different seasons were evaluated using the dimensionless mixing intensity number i yang et al 2015 shih et al 2005 35 i ɛ υ n 2 where ε is rate of dissipated tke per unit mass of water w kg 1 and υ is kinematic viscosity of water m2 s 1 daily averaged values of ε in w kg 1 were calculated using depth water density and hourly rates of tke dissipated in the mixed layer values of υ were based on the average temperature and conductivity of the mixed layer daily averages of ε υ and n2 of the mixed layer were then substituted into eq 35 shih et al 2005 proposed three turbulence regimes based on mixing intensity number according to shih et al 2005 i 7 indicates a diffusive regime in which turbulence gradually decays and diffusivity tends to reach molecular ranges 7 i 100 indicates an intermediate regime in which turbulence is in equilibrium and does not propagate or decay and i 100 identifies an energetic regime in which turbulence tends to grow particularly in weakly stratified waters i 200 commonly occurs in very weakly stratified waters in which turbulence motions could be isotropic thorpe 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermal energy balance fig 2 a shows seasonal variations in air and surface water temperatures wind speed does not exhibit a noticeable periodic cycle however wind speeds between mid december and february were slightly lower that the annual average of 4 m s 1 fig 2b as seen from the wind rose in fig 2c prevailing winds in boulder basin were mostly southeasterly and northwesterly as prevailing winds were southeasterly and northwesterly and intensities of winds from other directions were significantly lower considering a fetch length along southeast to northwest direction could be acceptable this length is nearly equal to half the length of the basin s major axis which was considered as the length scale characterizing the basin dimension for effects of coriolis force on internal waves while temperatures of surface water layers generally follow air temperature trends due to the great depth of boulder basin temperature fluctuation patterns in deep waters were different supplementary fig s2 deep layer temperatures showed an increasing trend from april until january and then dropped from mid january to march possibly due to turnover intense shortwave radiation during the summer increased the thermal energy of water column fig 3 a particularly the upper layers and resulted in thermal stratification fig 3b although thermal energy absorption rates peaked in june positive thermal energy accumulation continued until late august increasing the temperature of upper water layers after this period surface water temperatures were typically greater than air temperature fig 2b and the lake began to lose thermal energy increasing metalimnetic heat content during the summer enhanced the buoyancy of these layers as a result high values of the square of buoyancy frequency stability number of n2 5 10 4 s 2 were observed between depths of 12 to 35 m during the summer fig 4 however because the thermocline hinders heat transfer to deeper layers the stability of the water column at depths greater than 60 m was significantly lower n2 10 5 s 2 fig 5 a and b show typical diurnal variations of heat fluxes during summer and winter respectively surface water layer temperatures reached 29 c in hot summer days yet considerable heat loss was observed during summer nights fig 5a latent heat flux evaporation was the main heat loss mechanism during the summer varying primarily with wind speed and water column heat content fig 6 shows evaporative heat loss increased due to increases in shortwave radiation on summer days latent heat loss began increasing by sunrise and typically peaked in the evenings resulting in strong diurnal fluctuations of surface heat flux fig 5a evaporative heat loss significantly decreased during winter and longwave radiation became the main heat loss mechanism figs 6 and 5b during winter air temperatures were also colder than surface water temperatures fig 2 resulting in positive sensible heat flux figs 6 and 5b while during the rest of the year sensible heat flux was negative 3 2 tke fluctuations fig 3a shows that the thermal energy absorption rate significantly decreased and water column temperatures became nearly homogeneous from november to february the relatively low heat content of the water column during this period also resulted in reduced net surface heat flux fig 6b the reduced surface heat flux led to decreased tkeconv fig 7 a however reduced buoyancy and reduced stability of water column n2 10 5 s 2 allowed available tke to extend deeper and increase epilimnion depth fig 4 fig 7a shows about 58 of total tke input was contributed by tkeconv from march to april surface heat losses were typically minimal and sporadic positive net surface fluxes were observed fig 6b this led to a noticeable decrease of tkeconv in this period and the ratio of tkeconv to the total tke input decreased to less than 45 the monin obukhov length scale lm in fig 7c shows that from may to november the effects of turbulent mixing by wind were generally limited to about the top 9 m of the water column however decreasing surface heat loss from november until late january resulted in relatively higher lm values in addition as during this time period the water column was also least stable wind induced tke could more effectively disturb deeper water layers and thus its contribution in mixing of deeper water layers was more noticeable fig 7c negative hourly averaged lm values in fig 7c correspond to positive surface heat fluxes fig 6b these mostly occurred from february to may the combined effects of decreased tke input fig 7b and increased shortwave radiation figs 3a and 6 on buoyancy increases in the upper water layers during march and april significantly decreased the epilimnion depth during this period the epilimnion depth decreased from about 65 m to less than 10 m fig 4 despite the relatively high tke input from june to september fig 7 strong stratification and high water column stability prevented the mixed layer from penetrating to deeper layers fig 4 3 3 vertical diffusivity of water column fig 8 shows temporal and vertical variations of the water column vertical diffusion coefficient diffusivities seasonally varied by 1 to 1 5 orders of magnitude typically 5 10 5 to 10 3 m2 s 1 in the upper water column and typically varied by about 1 5 orders of magnitude typically 3 10 6 to 10 4 m2 s 1 in the deeper layers diffusivities as high as 3 10 4 m2 s 1 occasionally occurred in the deeper waters during december through february the significant increase in vertical diffusivity during december through february is consistent with the lower stability of the water column fig 4 and deeper mixed layer in this period the average vertical diffusivity increased from 5 1 10 5 m2 s 1 to about 9 3 10 4 m2 s 1 in the top 60 m intense stratification during the summer reduced water column vertical diffusivities as values of lm fig 7c indicate the synergistic effects of tkewind and tkeconv were more conspicuous in the upper 8 m leading to higher vertical diffusivities in this zone than at greater depths fig 8 the average vertical diffusion coefficient in the top 8 m during the summer was about 1 2 10 4 m2 s 1 compared to 3 1 10 5 m2 s 1 for depths between 30 100 m yang et al 2015 reported average vertical diffusivities of 2 4 10 4 and 3 6 10 6 m2 s 1 in kranji reservoir singapore average depth of 5 m on 29 september and 5 october respectively in a deeper lake imboden et al 1983 found vertical diffusivities of lake baldegg switzerland maximum depth of 66 m during the summer ranged between 10 6 to 10 4 m2 s 1 orlob and selna 1970 reported average vertical diffusivities between 1 0 10 5 to 1 7 10 4 m2 s 1 during the summer for deep california lakes with maximum depths ranging between 104 to 490 m summer vertical diffusivities found in this study in boulder basin with a typical depth of 120 m are within the range reported by orlob and selna 1970 due to the great depth of boulder basin effects of calculated sediment heat fluxes on magnitudes of water column vertical diffusivities were small these effects were typically on the order of 10 8 m2 s 1 to 10 7 m2 s 1 and were somewhat higher during the turnover period up to 5 10 7 m2 s 1 values at the high end of this range 5 10 7 m2 s 1 could slightly influence deep water layers 3 4 analysis of representative dimensionless numbers 3 4 1 gradient richardson number in addition to molecular scale diffusion turbulence due to velocity gradients can also lead to vertical transport in the water column fig 9 depicts the computed gradient richardson number rig considering wind shear as the only driving force responsible for horizontal currents the dotted line in fig 9 represents rig c 0 25 water layers above the dotted line maintain the necessary conditions for a turbulent regime and thus could be dynamically unstable grachev et al 2013 during the summer the depth of rig c remained in the top epilimnetic layers however the depth of rig 0 25 reached more than 45 m because of gradual heat loss and decrease in stability of water column during the cold winter days the upper metalimnion depth depicted in fig 4 indicates the depth above which tke conv promotes vertical mixing in the water column rig in these layers was up to about 1 0 in contrast the depth of instability rig 0 25 in fig 9 corresponds to the depth where both tkewind and tkeconv could synergistically disturb the water layers this critical depth typically increased to values of about 50 m during winter unstratified conditions fig 9 good agreement was also observed between lm values in fig 7 and the depth of rig 0 25 in fig 9 the gradual increase of rig from less than 0 25 to greater than 1 0 in upper metalimnion layers indicates the transition from an unstable turbulent regime to a stable laminar regime grachev et al 2013 3 4 2 wedderburn number wedderburn we numbers in fig 10 a show that wind shear was not sufficiently strong to result in upwelling generally the average weekly we in stratified conditions was more than 10 dashed blue line fig 10a indicating that due to strong stratification wind stress could not noticeably tilt the thermocline decreases of we number below 3 0 dashed green line fig 10a during mid winter to mid spring and even below 1 0 dashed red line fig 10a between february to april 2012 indicate strong winds effects wind speed 6 m s 1 during a period of instability however these events mostly occurred during unstratified conditions during the summer when water quality in epilimnion and hypolimnion could be different the average we was about 31 indicating buoyancy dominated over wind induced stress 3 4 3 mixing intensity fig 10b shows the mixing intensity i in the epilimnion was typically about 100 during the summer green line in fig 10b fluctuating between the intermediate and energetic regimes during the late fall and winter the upper metalimnion depth significantly increased and tke input was distributed to a greater volume of water due to the decrease in water column stability the tke input could more effectively mix these layers and therefore mixing intensity increased to the energetic region i 100 shih et al 2005 from mid fall to winter i reached intensities greater than 200 red line in fig 10b suggesting isotropic turbulent motion in the mixed layer thorpe 2007 increasing shortwave radiation and subsequent increases in buoyance during the spring decreased the mixing intensity to about 100 3 4 4 burger number fig 10c shows the burger number s was commonly less than the critical value of 1 0 dashed red line in fig 10c the burger number sporadically exceeded 1 0 during the summer and early fall and then only slightly this indicates that boulder basin is large enough for the coriolis force to affect the dynamics of basin scale internal waves the burger number increased with intensity of stratification with maximum s occurring during late june and early july when the shortwave intensity was maximum decreased water column stability in the winter allowed the coriolis force to overpower gravity forces and the burger number decreased to less than 0 25 3 5 concentration variations of water constituents during annual cycles differences between the epilimnetic and hypolimnetic constituent concentrations are indicative of the degree of vertical mixing fig 11 compares chloride and sulfate concentrations at depths of 5 m and 100 m fig 11 shows that epilimnetic chloride and sulfate concentrations were higher than hypolimnnetic concentrations except for a few short periods after turnovers where they were similar the las vegas wash consists mostly of treated wastewater and discharges into las vegas bay dissolved ion mass loadings from the wash s discharge are usually sufficient to affect boulder basin s water quality average wash chloride and sulfate concentrations were calculated to be 296 31 mg l 1 and 529 56 mg l 1 respectively over the study period roughly 2 5 times higher than values found in boulder basin vertical diffusion eventually spreads and dilutes the wash plume as it moves from las vegas bay into boulder basin the plume typically tends to mix and disperse in the epilimnetic and metalimnetic layers of the water column when the lake is stratified as vertical diffusion increased during fall and winter cooling fig 8 distribution of chloride and sulfate in water column became more homogeneous and thus difference between epilimnetic and hypolimnetic concentrations decreased fig 11 depth of the well oxygenated zone is also an indicator of active mixing depth and can be used to approximate the epilimnion depth antonopoulos and gianniou 2003 çalişkan and ş elçi 2009 stefan et al 1995 as seen in fig 12 the depth of well oxygenated waters depth of minimum d2do dz2 profile the blue line in fig 12 and the epilimnion depth the red line in fig 12 followed similar trends but did not coincide the highest level of agreement between fluctuation patterns was observed during the noticeable drop in do concentrations at depths of 30 to 60 m during october through december low vertical diffusivities between the depths of 30 and 60 m were also observed during this period fig 8 during january and february vertical diffusivities in the entire water column significantly increased oxygen from top layers could reach deeper layers and the depth of the well oxygenated zone increased to more than 60 m do concentrations in deep waters increased from 6 0 mg l 1 to about 8 5 mg l 1 at this time of year after this period diffusivities of deep layers decreased but do of deep waters remained above 7 5 mg l 1 until summer the slow change in do could be due to low overall microbial metabolism rates in deep cold waters limiting rates of do depletion from late february to september the well oxygenated zone depth was noticeably higher than the epilimnion depth indicating different patterns of temperature and do profiles after turnover a typical minimum of well oxygenated depth in june and then an increase in august indicated some variability in well oxygenated depth during summer months 4 conclusions the hot semi arid climate of the southern nevada northern arizona desert region leads to evaporation causing most surface heat loss during the annual cycle in warm and dry climates where the difference between the saturated vapor pressure and air vapor pressure could be large local winds can increase evaporative heat loss rates and thus both tkewind and tkeconv could be influenced by the intensity of local winds in this study more than 58 of the total tke input was contributed by tkeconv thus the relative contribution of tkeconv to total tke input should be considered when modeling lakes located in warm and dry climates however in temperate climate conditions relatively smaller differences between the saturated vapor pressure and air vapor pressure would limit the wind effects on the evaporative heat flux and thus reduce the contribution of tkeconv seasonal climate variations significantly influenced the stability of top 60 m of water column in this deep lake this influence was more intense during the january february turnover period reflected by an 18 fold increase of vertical diffusivity despite the increased mixed layer depth and the greater volume of water to be mixed from late november to late february compared to spring and summer the intensity of mixing during this period was also considerably higher epilimnetic and hypolimnetic chloride and sulfate concentrations reflect the degree of vertical mixing in water column epilimnion depth and the depth of the well oxygenated zone showed similar decreasing trends during october and december however due to creation of an oxygen depleted zone during this time period between depths 30 50 m oxygen concentrations at epilimnion depth and the depth of well oxygenated zone were different after this period the two depths followed an increasing trend but the increase in do content of deep layers due to winter overturn and considerable fluctuations in the depth of the well oxygenated zone during the summer and early fall increased the deviation over time fetch length is an important factor that can affect internal waves produced by wind driven mixing and the coriolis force due to lake mead s size and the region s complex topography distributions of wind speeds and directions in other parts of the lake could be very different therefore results reported in

787,this study presents a two dimensional 2d direct numerical simulation dns of the effects of bed slope and sediment settling on the dynamic behaviors of lock exchange turbidity currents the 2d dns model is first validated against existing dns solutions and experimental data afterwards a series of numerical case studies on the effect of bed slope and sediment settling is conducted numerical solutions show three distinct stages of current evolution according to the behavior of the front velocity i e a rapid acceleration stage due to the collapse of the dense water followed by a second stage in which the characteristics vary with the bed slope and finally a deceleration stage for a relatively steep bed e g θ 30 the turbidity current continues to accelerate in the second stage with a reduced accelerating rate for an intermediate bed e g θ 10 the current appears to have a quasi constant front velocity in the second stage for a relatively mild slope e g a flat bed the current directly enters the final deceleration stage after the first acceleration stage a higher settling velocity causes greater sediment settling which reduces the driving force of the turbidity current and therefore the current front velocity the water entrainment effect is most dominant at the very beginning of the current evolution due to the collapsing effect later the water entrainment ratios drop rapidly due to the diminishing collapsing effect regarding the second and third stages the bulk entrainment ratio appears to have a constant value of approximately 0 05 the absolute values of the energy components potential energy kinetic energy dissipated energy etc vary greatly with the bed slope and the settling velocity the higher the bed slope is the higher the amount of potential energy that can be converted during the turbidity current evolution nevertheless when these energy components are normalized the differences in the energy conversion patterns between the potential energy and kinetic energy are greatly reduced specifically the normalized potential energy continuously decreases the normalized kinetic energy tends to sharply increase first then remain nearly constant and finally decrease keywords turbidity current direct numerical simulation energy dynamic reference plane front velocity 1 introduction a turbidity current is a type of subaqueous sediment laden gravity current meiburg et al 2015 meiburg and kneller 2010 hu et al 2015 hu et al 2012 which has been studied using both a lock exchange configuration i e fixed volume and a continuous flux configuration this study focuses on lock exchange depositional turbidity currents which represent those triggered by abrupt landslides and short lived floods emiliano et al 1999 most previous experimental results meiburg et al 2015 huppert and simpson 1980 have shown that a lock exchange saline gravity current on flat beds may go through several well defined phases a relatively short acceleration phase a slumping phase characterized by a nearly constant front velocity and finally a self similar deceleration phase experimental results dai 2013 beghin et al 1981 have also indicated that the conservative gravity current first experiences an acceleration stage and then a deceleration stage direct numerical simulations dns dai 2015 dai and huang 2016 show a nearly constant stage between the acceleration and deceleration stages the situation is even more complex in regard to the non conservative turbidity current down a slope an et al 2012 essentially the current front velocity is controlled by a driving force i e the negative buoyancy force that arises from the density contrast between the current and the ambient water the density contrast is affected by the water entrainment at the upper interface and sediment exchange at the topography an understanding of sediment deposition has been well established see eq 3 in section 2 in contrast quantification of water entrainment receives relatively little study previous empirical relations on water entrainment ratios turner 1986 krug et al 2013 are mostly derived using experimental data from conservative gravity currents in particular within the continuous flux configuration for those experimental studies within the lock exchange configuration most results dai 2013 beghin et al 1981 he et al 2017 are presented in the form of the bulk values i e the duration averaged entrainment ratio hallworth et al hallworth et al 1996 determined an average entrainment ratio of the lock exchange gravity current on a flat bed as 0 063 0 003 in which the entrainment ratio is defined as the ratio of the volumes of ambient and original fluid in the head recently both the experimental and large eddy simulation results nogueira et al 2014 ottolenghi et al 2016a steenhauer et al 2017 indicate that the entrainment ratio of a lock exchange gravity current is closely related to the initial density difference and the aspect ratio of the initial water depth to the lock length however the values of the water entrainment of a gravity current developing on a slope are controversial for example krug et al 2013 experimentally determined the entrainment ratio of a constant influx gravity current up a 10 slope as around 0 04 whereas the computational values from large eddy simulations nourazar and safavi 2017 show that the entrainment ratio decreases with a larger negative slope angle and the value is around 0 02 at a 3 5 negative slope for a turbidity current down a positive slope the effects of sediment and slope on water entrainment are still unclear the temporal and spatial variations of the water entrainment and the effects of suspended particles and bottom topography are still needed to be evaluated to shed insight on the abovementioned issues high resolution numerical simulations are one of the best choices various numerical models are feasible including reynolds averaged navier stokes simulation rans huang et al 2005 huang et al 2008 abd el gawad et al 2012 guo et al 2014 large eddy simulation les an et al 2012 ooi et al 2009 tokyay et al 2011 tokyay et al 2014 tokyay and constantinescu 2015 and dns härtel et al 2000 necker et al 2002 necker et al 2005 nasr azadani et al 2018 a detailed review can be found in meiburg et al 2015 the dns approach is applied here because it can provide the most accurate information on the flow field adoption of the dns solver is further motivated by its advantages to analyze the energy budget necker et al 2002 the 2d dns has made great contributions to elucidate the physics of fluids such as the self sustaining condition of turbidity currents blanchette et al 2005 instabilities in a near critical fluid layer amiroudine et al 2001 and the effect of small scale forcing on large scale structures chekhlov et al 1996 blanchette et al 2005 have applied 2d dns to investigate the conditions for self sustainment of turbidity currents prof ungarish and his colleagues ungarish and huppert 2006 ungarish and huppert 2008 ungarish 2005 have used 2d dns to validate theoretical models such as in the exchange of energy ungarish and huppert 2006 ungarish and huppert 2008 and the front velocity ungarish 2005 birman et al 2007 ungarish and huppert 2002 this study aims to reveal the effects of the particle settling velocity and bed slope on the bulk properties of particle laden gravity currents e g the longitudinal variation in front velocity energy budget and entrainment effect instead of resolving the three dimensional 3d structures the 2d dns is used this paper is organized as follows first the numerical model including the governing equations boundary conditions and numerical scheme is introduced then the model is validated by comparing the simulation results with data in the published literature later we present detailed analyses of the dynamics behaviors of the current obtained from the dns model finally conclusions are drawn 2 two dimensional dns solver for depositional turbidity currents 2 1 problem description fig 1 shows the sketch for the lock exchange turbidity current configuration the turbidity current develops in a rectangular flume height h length l with a lock gate separating the initial sediment laden water and clear water a reservoir storing turbid water length l height h sediment concentration c 0 is located on the left side of the lock gate on the right side of the lock gate is a slope with θ denoting the slope angle above which clear water is stored the water level of the clear water part of the flume is the same as that of the turbid water the horizontal and vertical directions are denoted as x and z respectively upon the lock releasing the turbid water would intrude to the right and propagate along the slope while moving downstream sediment deposits on the flume bed reducing the density and thus the driving force of the current gradually the current slows down and will finally die out in fig 1 the distance x f measures the distance between the current front to the slope transition position the current front position is determined by a threshold value of the particle concentration here a nondimensional threshold concentration of 0 01 is used and sensitivity analysis indicates that the front location is nearly invariable when the threshold value varies between 0 01 and 0 1 the sign refers to a dimensional quantity 2 2 two dimensional navier stokes governing equations an analysis of dns numerical solutions commonly adopts dimensionless parameters using the half height h 2 as the length scale and the initial buoyancy velocity u b as the velocity scale u b h g c 0 ρ p ρ ρ 2 the re number can be defined as r e u b h 2 ν here ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid ρ p and ρ are the density of the sediment and the fluid respectively g is gravitational acceleration and c 0 is the initial volume fraction of the sediment other scales include the following h 2 u b is the time scale c 0 is the sediment concentration scale and p u b 2 represents the pressure scale with these scales nondimensional parameters can be defined and are summarized in table 1 using these nondimensional parameters and considering the situation of relatively low sediment concentration the 2d governing equations are nasr azadani and meiburg 2014 1 u x x u z z 0 2a u x t u x u x x u

conditions a free slip condition is applied at the top boundary i e z h a no slip condition is applied at the bottom topography and sidewalls i e x 0 l where h and l are the nondimensional height and length of the computational domain respectively a no flux boundary condition is implemented at the sidewalls and the top boundary nasr azadani and meiburg 2014 4 c x 0 x 0 l 5 u s c 1 s c r e c z 0 z h at the bottom topography the particle is assumed to leave the flow due to sedimentation which is numerically achieved by necker et al 2002 6 c t u s cos θ c z where z denotes the direction of the normal vector on the bottom surface 2 4 numerical method the initial nondimensional concentration field is prescribed as unity in the gray area fig 1 and zero elsewhere a distance function is applied at the interface which is smoothed by solving the initialization equation osher and fedkiw 2006 the convection and diffusion terms in the transport equation are approximated using the upwinding combined compact difference uccd algorithm yu et al 2015 yu et al 2015 the time integration for the transport equation is performed via a third order runge kutta tvd rk3 scheme shu and osher 1988 to calculate the particle concentration c the convection terms in the momentum equation are discretized using the third order quadratic upwind interpolation for convective kinematics quick scheme and the diffusion terms are approximated by the second order center difference scheme finally to obtain the velocity field a projection method chorin 1968 is applied an intermediate velocity u is first computed by ignoring the pressure gradient term and the virtual force term the pressure poisson equation is then solved using the gauss seidel iteration solver to obtain the pressure field which is then used to correct the intermediate velocity i e compute u then the immersed boundary method fadlun et al 2000 is applied to consider the effects of the topography such that u and c are further corrected i e compute un 1 and cn 1 depending on the different locations of the mesh cell the immersed boundary method is implemented by adding a virtual force in the momentum equation the solid phase acts on the fluid phase by the virtual force expressed by 7 f n 1 u n 1 u η δ t where δt is the time step and η is the percent of the volume of the solid phase slope and the area below in one mesh cell and is calculated by further dividing the cell into finer grids as shown in fig 2 if η 0 the mesh cell is completely in the region that is outside the complex topography i e the slope thus c n 1 c at xk q zk q and u n 1 u at xk q zk q if η 0 the boundary of the topography crosses the mesh cell or the mesh cell is completely in the region of the complex topography thus c n 1 c 1 η at xk q zk q and u n 1 u 1 η at xk q zk q 2 5 validation of the numerical model here the dns numerical solver is validated by comparing the computed front location against both the previous numerical solutions and the experimental data we first present a comparison of the front location with the simulation results of necker et al 2002 as shown in fig 3 the simulation case is conducted on a flat bed with dimensionless parameters of l 18 h 2 l 1 us 0 02 and re 2236 1800 200 mesh cells are used a good agreement can be seen in fig 3 we proceed with a comparison with experimental data of b1 reported by kubo 2004 of which the main parameters are tan θ 0 1 l 10 m l 0 5 m h 0 2 m h 0 4 m c 0 0 02 u s 0 0055 m s and ρ p 2650 kg m3 the corresponding dimensionless parameters are l 100 h 2 l 5 h 4 us 0 03 and re 17 865 the computational length l is set to 26 in the simulations a total of 3510 540 cells are used fig 4 also includes the measured data which is reproduced satisfactorily by the numerical solver 3 numerical case studies dynamic behaviors of turbidity currents as summarized in table 2 seven numerical cases are designed with slopes ranging from 0 to 30 and sediment settling velocity ranging from 0 to 0 02 the computational domain i e l h is set sufficiently large such that within the computational time the turbidity current does not arrive at the boundary of the domain here h l is set equal to 2 the reynolds number re is set to 3000 the horizontal and vertical spatial step δx is set to 2 110 which is of a similar order as o 1 resc 0 5 and thus satisfies the requirement for high quality dns modeling dai 2015 the time step δt is set to 0 005δx one of the advantages of applying dimensionless parameters is that one dimensionless simulation can represent many dimensional cases for example in a simulation case the dimensionless height of the initial dense fluid is h 2 if the characteristic length scale is 1 cm the dimensionless simulation represents a case with h 2 cm however if the characteristic length scale is 1 m the dimensionless simulation represents a case with h 2 m the dimensional scale varies with the characteristic scale here we take the nondimensional parameters of case 1 in table 2 as an example to express the represented dimensional scales the nondimensional parameters of case 1 are l 16 h h 2 l 1 re 3000 us 0 02 and θ 0 the corresponding dimensional scales can be l 1 28 m h h 0 16 m l 0 08 m c 0 0 1 d p 30 μ m ρ p 2650 k g m 3 ρ 1000 k g m 3 u s 0 008 m s and θ 0 3 1 development of the turbidity current the computed current evolution process from case 3 is shown in fig 5 once the lock is released the heavy sediment laden fluid collapses down immediately within the initial short period the evolution of the turbidity current is mainly controlled by this collapsing effect later as the dense fluid continues to flow down a clear head structure is developed from t 1 4 at the lower interface between the turbidity current and the slope a lifted nose is formed at the upper interface between the turbidity current and the ambient water a velocity shear layer is generated which promotes the kelvin helmholtz kh instabilities and turbulent billows in addition as time passes a raising cloud emerges at the tail part of the current fig 5 g and h show the velocity field and the streamlines of the turbidity current at t 5 72 respectively it can be identified that the velocity vectors and the streamlines appear uniformly in the main body of the current however in the area with the kh instabilities the turbulent billows and the raising cloud the velocity vectors grow irregularly and smaller streamline circles develop these structures generate mixing at the upper interface and the ambient clear water is entrained into the descending current the density of the turbidity current is persistently reduced by water entrainment as well as settling of suspended sediments these observations are consistent with dai 2015 and blanchette et al 2005 suggesting that the present model has satisfactorily reproduced development of a turbidity current fig 6 shows the comparison of turbidity currents down different slopes at t 6 the typical characteristics of the abovementioned turbidity current still exist as the slope varies although a recent study kneller et al 2016 indicated that the kh instabilities and turbulent billows could be greatly damped when θ 0 these turbulent structures have clearly been seen in many previous experimental and numerical studies meiburg et al 2015 härtel et al 2000 necker et al 2002 simpson and britter 1979 of compositional gravity currents and turbidity currents on a flat bed as the slope angle increases the length of the turbidity current head becomes shorter and its height becomes larger in addition the two main turbulent billows at the upper interface tend to become more complex when the slope angle increases to 30 the two billows are even mixed together and a larger cloud is then formed the change in the shape indicates that the mixed region of the turbidity current increases as the slope angle increases to demonstrate this conclusion quantitatively the mixed region of the turbidity current am is calculated which is defined as the area where the particle concentration is in the range between 0 01 and 0 99 in the whole domain i e 8 a m 0 h 0 l ϕ c d x d z with ϕ c 1 0 01 c 0 99 ϕ c 0 c 0 01 or c 0 99 where φ c is a defined parameter changing with c the time evolution of the normalized volume of the mixed region in different cases is presented in fig 7 at the initial period during which the turbidity current is mainly controlled by the collapsing process the mixed region is not sensitive to the change in slope angle while at the later stage the increase in the slope angle makes the area of the mixed region grow more quickly this conclusion agrees with the previous numerical study of the compositional gravity current dai 2015 however it is more appropriate to evaluate the mixing and entrainment effect between the current and the ambient water by the dimensionless parameter i e the entrainment ratio ellison and turner 1959 which is related to both the entrainment volume of the ambient water and the front velocity of the current the analysis of the front velocity can also serve as a quantitative approach to show the development process of the turbidity current in section 3 3 a detailed analysis of the front velocity is presented 3 2 energy budget turbidity current evolution is essentially an energy conversion process the initial potential energy of the turbid water behind the lock i e ep 0 t is the energy source during evolution the initial potential energy will be transformed into three parts 1 those that have been converted to kinetic energy i e econ t 2 those that become temporally unconvertible due to sediment deposition this part may become convertible if resuspension is allowed however this is not the present focus i e the inactive potential energy ed t and 3 those remaining as active potential energy ep t specifically active inactive describe whether this part of the potential energy can be further transformed into kinetic energy or not the converted kinetic energy econ t has two elements 1 those remaining as the kinetic energy during the current evolution i e ek t and 2 those edis t that have been dissipated therefore nasr azadani and meiburg 2014 9 for description convenience the remaining potential energy including both convertible and unconvertible parts is defined as er t ep t ed t necker et al 2002 2005 presented an analysis of the energy budget for lock exchange turbidity currents on a flat bed nasr azadani and meiburg 2014 extended it to turbidity currents over seafloor topography the specific expressions for these energy components have been derived for a flat bed by necker et al 2002 2005 and for an unflat bed by nasr azadani and meiburg 2014 they are reformulated as follows

reference plane at the flat bed this makes ed t invariably equal to zero and explains the lack of the term ed t in necker et al 2002 2005 for a turbidity current down a slope the term ed t 0 because sediments deposit at different heights from a physical perspective the idealized reference plane zd must be defined at the position where the current finally dies out however it is difficult to define the time that the current dies out because the mixing process lasts for a very long time nasr azadani et al 2018 as a compromise this study proposes a dynamic reference plane at a certain time t the reference plane is defined at the lowest point of the turbidity current which is determined by a threshold value of the sediment concentration of 0 01 in the following analyses of the energy terms are conducted against time by following the conventional practice dai 2015 necker et al 2002 3 2 1 influence of the slope angle on the energy budget fig 8 presents the temporal variations of the kinetic energy ek for turbidity currents down different slopes cases 1 2 3 6 and 7 at the initial period t 1 6 the kinetic energy ek experiences a rapid increase this is because at the initial stage the flow is mainly controlled by the collapsing effect as the current moves forward the collapsing effect diminishes and the slope effects accumulate consequently considerable differences are seen after the initial stage on a flat bed case 1 the kinetic energy ek starts to decrease on sloping beds cases 2 3 6 and 7 the kinetic energy ek continues to increase although at a reduced rate a gentler slope tends to exhibit a slower increase in the kinetic energy which is also due to the slope effects the steeper the bed slope the larger the amount of potential energy that can be converted nevertheless as sediment continues to deposit it is expected that the kinetic energy over the largest slope e g θ 30 would also decrease after propagating a sufficiently long distance though this phase is not simulated in this paper we proceed to discuss the proportions of different energy components within the total energy fig 9 shows the time evolutions of the proportions of the remaining kinetic energy ek fig 9 a the active potential energy ep fig 9 b the dissipated energy edis fig 9 c the inactive potential energy ed due to deposition fig 9 d the total converted potential energy econ i e ek edis fig 9 e and the total unconverted including both the active and inactive parts potential energy er i e ep ed fig 9 f over different slopes compared to the absolute values of the kinetic energy fig 8 that differ greatly as the bed slope varies a consistent overall variation pattern for the proportion of kinetic energy can be identified fig 9 a specifically three stages can be identified an initial stage of rapid increase followed by a relatively stable stage and finally a decreasing stage in the initial stage the kinetic energy proportion ek etot increases to its maximum value 55 for case 1 at t 3 2 51 for case 2 at t 3 5 50 for case 3 at t 3 8 51 for case 6 at t 4 3 54 for case 7 at t 6 7 this occurs because the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy fig 9 e at the initial stage when the collapsing effect dominates is much more than the energy dissipation fig 9 c the different timing for the maximum value of the kinetic energy proportion ek etot is due to the sloping effects the steeper the bed slope the stronger the collapsing effect and thus the later the appearance of the maximum value the relatively stable behavior of the proportion ek etot after the initial stage indicates a temporary balance between the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy fig 9 e and the dissipation of energies fig 9 c this occurs because of the weakening collapsing effect and thus the reduced conversion rate of potential energy to kinetic energy the final decreasing stage of the proportion ek etot indicates that the energy dissipation overwhelms the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy on the one hand this is due to the further weakening of the conversion and on the other hand the increasingly dominant viscous effects that dissipate energies fig 9 c similar to fig 9 a for the kinetic energy proportion ek etot the proportion ep etot of the remaining potential energy also exhibits a consistent variation trend for turbidity currents over different slopes the potential energy proportion ep etot decreases with time two stages can be noted in the initial collapsing period the potential energy proportion ep etot decreases very rapidly later it decreases gradually at a considerably reduced rate for those turbidity currents moving over a steeper slope there tends to be relatively less potential energy being converted econ see fig 9 e less energy being dissipated edis see fig 9 c clearly more sediment deposition induced inactive potential energy ed see fig 9 d and slightly more active potential energy ep see fig 9 b these can be explained by the different extent of sediment deposition over different slopes the results in fig 8 demonstrate that a turbidity current over a steeper slope has higher kinetic energy which implies a higher ability to transport sediment and thus less sediment deposition more sediment in suspension leads to high proportion of ep fig 9 b in contrast the behavior of the inactive potential energy proportion ed etot t depends on the quantity and relative location of sediment deposition see eq 10c for the definition of ed as well as the initial total energy on the one hand sediment deposits mainly near the lock position where the sediment initially stays this means that the difference of the relative position of the sediment decreases as the dynamic reference plane descends with time on the other hand the proportion of the sediment deposition compared to the total amount of sediment is essentially of similar magnitude for depositional turbidity currents these two aspects lead to a higher proportion of inactive potential energy ed etot t over a steeper slope fig 9 d the proportion of the remaining potential energy er ep ed is thus larger fig 9 f implying a smaller percentage of the total energy being converted fig 9 e accordingly the proportion of the dissipated energy that originates from the converted energy is also smaller fig 9 c 3 2 2 influence of the settling velocity on the energy budget fig 10 illustrates the effects of the particle settling velocity on the proportions of these energy components cases 3 4 and 5 a turbidity current carrying coarser sediment deposits more sediment and thus has less along slope effective gravitation accordingly turbidity currents carrying coarser sediments exhibit a smaller proportion of ep fig 10 b and ek fig 10 a but a larger portion of ed fig 10 d on the other hand since the presence of the settling velocity contributes to an additional energy loss eq 10d a higher percentage of the total energy of the turbidity current with a larger us is dissipated fig 10 c the significant increase in the dissipated energy also makes the portion of the converted energy larger fig 10 e consequently a smaller percentage of the total energy remains in the system fig 10 f 3 3 front velocity the current front velocity is normally used as an index for distinguishing different stages of the turbidity current evolution 3 3 1 influence of the settling velocity on the front velocity fig 11 a shows the time evolution of the front velocity of turbidity currents down an intermediate slope of 10 with different settling velocities cases 3 4 and 5 from fig 11 a the evolution process of a turbidity current down the intermediate slope can be divided into three distinct stages it can be seen that from t 0 to t 1 4 the sudden collapse of the dense water leads to a short acceleration stage during which uf increases rapidly from zero to the maximum value ufmax 0 67 after t 1 4 the turbidity current experiences a quasi constant stage with uf maintaining a nearly constant value of 0 66 in this stage a temporary balance is reached between the viscous force and the driving force due to entrainment with ambient water the driving force decreases and thus the current enters the next deceleration stage at approximately t 8 8 when the settling velocity is varied quantitative differences are seen in fig 11 b the parameter mp in fig 11 b represents the nondimensional mass of sediments in motion it can be seen that the higher the settling velocity is the smaller the current front velocity this is because a higher settling velocity causes greater sediment settling which reduces the driving force of the turbidity current and therefore the current front velocity nevertheless the qualitative behaviors as described above are consistent it is because only a small part of the total sediment is deposited as shown in fig 11 b specifically all the sediments are suspended for the case of us 0 when us increases to 0 02 over 80 of the total sediments are still suspended at t 12 3 3 2 influence of the slope angle on the front velocity fig 12 shows time evolutions of the front velocity of turbidity currents down different slopes cases 1 2 3 6 and 7 in all the cases the current front velocity uf experiences a rapid increase stage before t 1 4 during this stage uf is not greatly influenced by θ due to the dominance of the collapsing effect afterwards turbidity currents tend to behave differently depending on the magnitude of the bed slope the quasi constant stage is absent for a turbidity current over a horizontal bottom the current transits from the accelerating stage to the decelerating stage directly specifically its uf decreases by approximately 20 from t 1 4 to t 9 and approximately 18 from t 9 to t 12 for those over an intermediate slope e g 6 or 10 the quasi constant stage is retained with uf 0 65 from t 1 4 to t 8 6 for θ 6 and uf 0 68 from t 1 4 to t 8 4 for θ 10 after t 8 6 the front velocity starts to decrease for those over a steep slope the quasi constant stage is also missing instead the current has an extended accelerating stage though its accelerating rate is much reduced compared to the initial rapid accelerating stage for the cases of θ 15 the accelerating rate of the front velocity is approximately 0 012 during the extended accelerating stage from t 1 4 to t 7 1 compared to 0 503 during the initial rapid accelerating stage t 1 4 for the case of θ 30 this trend is more obvious at the initial period the sudden removal of the lock leads to a rapid collapse of dense fluid at the final period the density contrast is small and the turbidity current is mainly dominated by the viscous effect consequently turbidity currents down different slopes all have the first rapid acceleration stage and the final deceleration stage the along slope effective gravitation that serves as the positive effect increases with θ the interplay of the positive effective along slope gravitation and negative effect viscous force results in the presented behavior of the front velocity in the second stage for a relatively small slope e g θ 0 uf slightly decreases because the negative effect exceeds the positive effect with the increase in θ a temporary balance is reached between the positive and negative effects the second phase thus turns into a quasi constant stage on an intermediate slope e g 6 θ 10 during which uf is characterized by a nearly constant value when θ becomes larger the positive effect gradually surpasses the negative effect the quasi constant stage is replaced by an accelerating process e g θ 30 during which the acceleration of the turbidity current increases with θ 3 4 entrainment ratio when a turbidity current propagates downstream it entrains ambient water and dilutes the turbid water this phenomenon is normally quantified using water entrainment ratios which can be defined as follows wells and nadarajah 2009 11a e b u l k n w b u l k n u f n 11b e i n s t n w i n s t n 0 5 u f n u f n 1 where ebulk n and einst n represent the bulk and instantaneous water entrainment ratios respectively the subscript bulk indicates a time averaged bulk value the subscript inst indicates a transient value the subscripts n and n 1 are time step indicators corresponding to tn and tn 1 uf n and uf n 1 are the front velocities at t tn and t tn 1 and wbulk n and winst n represent the bulk and instantaneous water entrainment velocity which are defined as 12a w b u l k n q b u l k n s n 12b w i n s t n q i n s t n 0 5 s n s n 1 where qbulk n and qinst n are the effective bulk and instantaneous water entrainment discharge and sn and sn 1 are the area of the upper interface at t tn and t tn 1 a first order relation proposed by ottolenghi et al 2016a is used to compute the area sn h l x f n 1 where xf n is the front position at t tn the parameters qbulk and qinst n can be estimated using the principle of mass conservation i e an increase in

the choice of the criterion c 0 01 is based on a sensitivity analysis that shows the current volume changes only slightly when the concentration c varies between 0 01 and 0 05 3 4 1 influence of the slope angle on water entrainment fig 13 shows time evolutions of the entrainment ratio ebulk and einst of turbidity currents down different slopes cases 1 2 3 6 and 7 it appears that the bed slope does not have an obvious effect on the overall tendency of both the bulk and instantaneous entrainment ratios turbidity currents over a steeper bed tend to have a greater front velocity fig 12 and at the same time a larger mixed region fig 7 or alternatively a larger volume of entrained water the increase in both the numerator water entrainment velocity and the denominator front velocity leads to a subtle effect on the entrainment ratios the following is devoted to the overall trend of the entrainment ratios both ebulk and einst assume the greatest values at the very beginning which is due to the engulfing of water accompanying the initial collapse and the formation of the head bhaganagar 2017 later both ebulk and einst decrease rapidly with time as the collapsing effects diminish during the acceleration stage from t 0 to t 1 4 afterwards water entrainment is due to the kelvin helmholtz instabilities and turbulent billows developed at the upper interface fig 5 ottolenghi et al 2016a bhaganagar 2017 during this stage both ebulk and einst take on a relatively small value of approximately 0 05 compared to the relatively stable values of the bulk entrainment ratios fig 13 a the instantaneous entrainment ratio fluctuates at approximately 0 05 the fluctuation of einst is essentially related to the emergence and disappearance of the turbulent billows see fig 5 ottolenghi et al 2016b 3 4 2 influence of the settling velocity on water entrainment here the effects of the settling velocity on the entrainment ratio are analyzed the presence of sediment leads to two important effects on the water entrainment sediment deposition may lead to a weaker density stratification at the upper interface on the one hand nasr azadani et al 2018 and a reduced driving force and thus a smaller front velocity on the other hand the entrainment effect is enhanced by a weaker interface stratification nasr azadani et al 2018 and is decreased by a smaller front velocity fig 14 a and b show time evolutions of ebulk and einst of turbidity currents with different us down a 10 slope also shown in fig 14 c and d are time evolutions of ebulk and einst of turbidity currents down a flat bed the entrainment ratios of turbidity currents with different us have almost the same development tendency and value which means that the two opposite effects on the entrainment ratio offset each other as the settling velocity has little effect on ebulk and einst of a current down a slope the value of the entrainment ratio measured from a compositional gravity current may be applied in the case of a turbidity current at least in the slope within the range between 0 and 10 3 5 comparisons with 3d results two additional 3d simulations are run to make comparisons with the present 2d simulations the width in the spanwise direction in 3d cases is set at 2 with a non slip and non flux boundary condition applied at two lateral walls the other simulation setups are the same as the 2d cases on a flat bed see case 1 in table 2 down a 10 slope see case 2 in table 2 the comparisons are conducted towards the front location and energy term the mixed region and the bulk entrainment ratio as shown in fig 15 it is evident that the predictions from the two approaches exhibit some quantitative differences due to ignoring the wall effects in the 2d cases however these quantitative differences are very much limited both 2d and 3d dns approaches provide qualitatively similar trends for these parameters since this study aims to reveal the effects of the particle settling velocity and bed slope on the bulk properties of particle laden gravity currents e g the longitudinal variation in front velocity energy budget and entrainment effect instead of resolving the 3d structures the 2d dns approach is considered appropriate for the purpose of the present study although using 2d dns would veritably sacrifice some extent of the accuracy e g the 3d structures developed at the later stage of the current it does not affect the understanding obtained by this work 4 conclusions in this paper two dimensional direct numerical simulations are implemented for lock exchange turbidity currents down different slopes θ 30 the obtained high resolution numerical results are used to analyze the effects of the bed slope and the particle settling velocity on the dynamics in terms of the energy budget front velocity and water entrainment ratio in 12 nondimensional time units initially a reservoir of turbid water is placed on the left end of the computational domain the potential energy of this reservoir of turbid water provides the energy sources of the later formed turbidity current once the current starts to move in response to lock release potential energy is converted into kinetic energy ek at the same time some part of the kinetic energy is dissipated some part of the potential energy also becomes unconvertible or inactive ed as suspended particles deposit on the topography our simulation shows that during the initial period the collapse of the dense fluid introduces a very fast energy conversion process of potential energy into kinetic energy ek with only a small part of the kinetic energy dissipated later a leading head of the turbidity current is formed with kelvin helmholtz instabilities and turbulent billows generated at the upper interface which promote an entrainment effect with the ambient water after a first fast energy conversion process the energy conversion rate slows down the behavior of uf after the acceleration stage is determined by the interplay of the driving force and the viscous force the main highlights and conclusions of this study are as follows 1 a dynamic reference plane which is defined at the lowest point of the turbidity current and descends with time is proposed to analyze the energy budget of a turbidity current down a slope by this definition the total initial energy of the turbidity current that increases with time can serve as a good energy scale to analyze the temporal variation in the proportions of different energy components in contrast to the static reference plane defined previously at the position of the initial turbid water the dynamic reference plane can avoid the negative values of the energy terms 2 the absolute values of the energy components are diverse when the slope angle and the settling velocity are different these diversities can be greatly reduced by normalizing the absolute values with the total initial energy the normalized kinetic energy tends to first quickly increase then remain nearly constant and finally decrease the normalized potential energy continuously decreases with an initially great decelerating rate 3 the evolution process of a turbidity current down a slope can be divided into a first acceleration stage a second stage during which its behavior is determined by the slope angle and a third deceleration stage in the second stage uf changes from a slight decrease on a relatively slight slope e g θ 0 to a quasi constant state on an intermediate slope e g θ 10 and then an increasing process on a relatively steep bed e g θ 30 the turbidity current with a larger us has a smaller front velocity 4 both bed slope and sediment settling do not show an appreciable effect on the water entrainment ratios during the first acceleration stage both the bulk and instantaneous entrainment ratios ebulk and einst acquire the greatest values due to the engulfing of ambient water in the collapsing process of the particle laden fluid later einst fluctuates with time intensely while ebulk maintains a nearly constant value of approximately 0 05 acknowledgements this work was partially supported by the national natural science foundation

787,this study presents a two dimensional 2d direct numerical simulation dns of the effects of bed slope and sediment settling on the dynamic behaviors of lock exchange turbidity currents the 2d dns model is first validated against existing dns solutions and experimental data afterwards a series of numerical case studies on the effect of bed slope and sediment settling is conducted numerical solutions show three distinct stages of current evolution according to the behavior of the front velocity i e a rapid acceleration stage due to the collapse of the dense water followed by a second stage in which the characteristics vary with the bed slope and finally a deceleration stage for a relatively steep bed e g θ 30 the turbidity current continues to accelerate in the second stage with a reduced accelerating rate for an intermediate bed e g θ 10 the current appears to have a quasi constant front velocity in the second stage for a relatively mild slope e g a flat bed the current directly enters the final deceleration stage after the first acceleration stage a higher settling velocity causes greater sediment settling which reduces the driving force of the turbidity current and therefore the current front velocity the water entrainment effect is most dominant at the very beginning of the current evolution due to the collapsing effect later the water entrainment ratios drop rapidly due to the diminishing collapsing effect regarding the second and third stages the bulk entrainment ratio appears to have a constant value of approximately 0 05 the absolute values of the energy components potential energy kinetic energy dissipated energy etc vary greatly with the bed slope and the settling velocity the higher the bed slope is the higher the amount of potential energy that can be converted during the turbidity current evolution nevertheless when these energy components are normalized the differences in the energy conversion patterns between the potential energy and kinetic energy are greatly reduced specifically the normalized potential energy continuously decreases the normalized kinetic energy tends to sharply increase first then remain nearly constant and finally decrease keywords turbidity current direct numerical simulation energy dynamic reference plane front velocity 1 introduction a turbidity current is a type of subaqueous sediment laden gravity current meiburg et al 2015 meiburg and kneller 2010 hu et al 2015 hu et al 2012 which has been studied using both a lock exchange configuration i e fixed volume and a continuous flux configuration this study focuses on lock exchange depositional turbidity currents which represent those triggered by abrupt landslides and short lived floods emiliano et al 1999 most previous experimental results meiburg et al 2015 huppert and simpson 1980 have shown that a lock exchange saline gravity current on flat beds may go through several well defined phases a relatively short acceleration phase a slumping phase characterized by a nearly constant front velocity and finally a self similar deceleration phase experimental results dai 2013 beghin et al 1981 have also indicated that the conservative gravity current first experiences an acceleration stage and then a deceleration stage direct numerical simulations dns dai 2015 dai and huang 2016 show a nearly constant stage between the acceleration and deceleration stages the situation is even more complex in regard to the non conservative turbidity current down a slope an et al 2012 essentially the current front velocity is controlled by a driving force i e the negative buoyancy force that arises from the density contrast between the current and the ambient water the density contrast is affected by the water entrainment at the upper interface and sediment exchange at the topography an understanding of sediment deposition has been well established see eq 3 in section 2 in contrast quantification of water entrainment receives relatively little study previous empirical relations on water entrainment ratios turner 1986 krug et al 2013 are mostly derived using experimental data from conservative gravity currents in particular within the continuous flux configuration for those experimental studies within the lock exchange configuration most results dai 2013 beghin et al 1981 he et al 2017 are presented in the form of the bulk values i e the duration averaged entrainment ratio hallworth et al hallworth et al 1996 determined an average entrainment ratio of the lock exchange gravity current on a flat bed as 0 063 0 003 in which the entrainment ratio is defined as the ratio of the volumes of ambient and original fluid in the head recently both the experimental and large eddy simulation results nogueira et al 2014 ottolenghi et al 2016a steenhauer et al 2017 indicate that the entrainment ratio of a lock exchange gravity current is closely related to the initial density difference and the aspect ratio of the initial water depth to the lock length however the values of the water entrainment of a gravity current developing on a slope are controversial for example krug et al 2013 experimentally determined the entrainment ratio of a constant influx gravity current up a 10 slope as around 0 04 whereas the computational values from large eddy simulations nourazar and safavi 2017 show that the entrainment ratio decreases with a larger negative slope angle and the value is around 0 02 at a 3 5 negative slope for a turbidity current down a positive slope the effects of sediment and slope on water entrainment are still unclear the temporal and spatial variations of the water entrainment and the effects of suspended particles and bottom topography are still needed to be evaluated to shed insight on the abovementioned issues high resolution numerical simulations are one of the best choices various numerical models are feasible including reynolds averaged navier stokes simulation rans huang et

forcing on large scale structures chekhlov et al 1996 blanchette et al 2005 have applied 2d dns to investigate the conditions for self sustainment of turbidity currents prof ungarish and his colleagues ungarish and huppert 2006 ungarish and huppert 2008 ungarish 2005 have used 2d dns to validate theoretical models such as in the exchange of energy ungarish and huppert 2006 ungarish and huppert 2008 and the front velocity ungarish 2005 birman et al 2007 ungarish and huppert 2002 this study aims to reveal the effects of the particle settling velocity and bed slope on the bulk properties of particle laden gravity currents e g the longitudinal variation in front velocity energy budget and entrainment effect instead of resolving the three dimensional 3d structures the 2d dns is used this paper is organized as follows first the numerical model including the governing equations boundary conditions and numerical scheme is introduced then the model is validated by comparing the simulation results with data in the published literature later we present detailed analyses of the dynamics behaviors of the current obtained from the dns model finally conclusions are drawn 2 two dimensional dns solver for depositional turbidity currents 2 1 problem description fig 1 shows the sketch for the lock exchange turbidity current configuration the turbidity current develops in a rectangular flume height h length l with a lock gate separating the initial sediment laden water and clear water a reservoir storing turbid water length l height h sediment concentration c 0 is located on the left side of the lock gate on the right side of the lock gate is a slope with θ denoting the slope angle above which clear water is stored the water level of the clear water part of the flume is the same as that of the turbid water the horizontal and vertical directions are denoted as x and z respectively upon the lock releasing the turbid water would intrude to the right and propagate along the slope while moving downstream sediment deposits on the flume bed reducing the density and thus the driving force of the current gradually the current slows down and will finally die out in fig 1 the distance x f measures the distance between the current front to the slope transition position the current front position is determined by a threshold value of the particle concentration here a nondimensional threshold concentration of 0 01 is used and sensitivity analysis indicates that the front location is nearly invariable when the threshold value varies between 0 01

computed by ignoring the pressure gradient term and the virtual force term the pressure poisson equation is then solved using the gauss seidel iteration solver to obtain the pressure field which is then used to correct the intermediate velocity i e compute u then the immersed boundary method fadlun et al 2000 is applied to consider the effects of the topography such that u and c are further corrected i e compute un 1 and cn 1 depending on the different locations of the mesh cell the immersed boundary method is implemented by adding a virtual force in the momentum equation the solid phase acts on the fluid phase by the virtual force expressed by 7 f n 1 u n 1 u η δ t where δt is the time step and η is the percent of the volume of the solid phase slope and the area below in one mesh cell and is calculated by further dividing the cell into finer grids as shown in fig 2 if η 0 the mesh cell is completely in the region that is outside the complex topography i e the slope thus c n 1 c at xk q zk q and u n 1 u at xk q zk q if η 0 the boundary of the topography crosses the mesh cell or the mesh cell is completely in the region of the complex topography thus c n 1 c 1 η at xk q zk q and u n 1 u 1 η at xk q zk q 2 5 validation of the numerical model here the dns numerical solver is validated by comparing the computed front location against both the previous numerical solutions and the experimental data we first present a comparison of the front location with the simulation results of necker et al 2002 as shown in fig 3 the simulation case is conducted on a flat bed with dimensionless parameters of l 18 h 2 l 1 us 0 02 and re 2236 1800 200 mesh cells are used a good agreement can be seen in fig 3 we proceed with a comparison with experimental data of b1 reported by kubo 2004 of which the main parameters are tan θ 0 1 l 10 m l 0 5 m h 0 2 m h 0 4 m c 0 0 02 u s 0 0055 m s and ρ p 2650 kg m3 the corresponding dimensionless parameters are l 100 h 2 l 5 h 4 us 0 03 and re 17 865 the computational length l is set to 26 in the simulations a total of 3510 540 cells are used fig 4 also includes the measured data which is reproduced satisfactorily by the numerical solver 3 numerical case studies dynamic behaviors of turbidity currents as summarized in table 2 seven numerical cases are designed with slopes ranging from 0 to 30 and sediment settling velocity ranging from 0 to 0 02 the computational domain i e l h is set sufficiently large such that within the computational time the turbidity current does not arrive at the boundary of the domain here h l is set equal to 2 the reynolds number re is set to 3000 the horizontal and vertical spatial step δx is set to 2 110 which is of a similar order as o 1 resc 0 5 and thus satisfies the requirement for high quality dns modeling dai 2015 the time step δt is set to 0 005δx one of the advantages of applying dimensionless parameters is that one dimensionless simulation can represent many dimensional cases for example in a simulation case the dimensionless height of the initial dense fluid is h 2 if the characteristic length scale is 1 cm the dimensionless simulation represents a case with h 2 cm however if the characteristic length scale is 1 m the dimensionless simulation represents a case with h 2 m the dimensional scale varies with the characteristic scale here we take the nondimensional parameters of case 1 in table 2 as an example to express the represented dimensional scales the nondimensional parameters of case 1 are l 16 h h 2 l 1 re 3000 us 0 02 and θ 0 the corresponding dimensional scales can be l 1 28 m h h 0 16 m l 0 08 m c 0 0 1 d p 30 μ m ρ p 2650 k g m 3 ρ 1000 k g m 3 u s 0 008 m s and θ 0 3 1 development of the turbidity current the computed current evolution process from case 3 is shown in fig 5 once the lock is released the heavy sediment laden fluid collapses down immediately within the initial short period the evolution of the turbidity current is mainly controlled by this collapsing effect later as the dense fluid continues to flow down a clear head structure is developed from t 1 4 at the lower interface between the turbidity current and the slope a lifted nose is formed at the upper interface between the turbidity current and the ambient water a velocity shear layer is generated which promotes the kelvin helmholtz kh instabilities and turbulent billows in addition as time passes a raising cloud emerges at the tail part of the current fig 5 g and h show the velocity field and the streamlines of the turbidity current at t 5 72 respectively it can be identified that the velocity vectors and the streamlines appear uniformly in the main body of the current however in the area with the kh instabilities the turbulent billows and the raising cloud the velocity vectors grow irregularly and smaller streamline circles develop these structures generate mixing at the upper interface and the ambient clear water is entrained into the descending current the density of the turbidity current is persistently reduced by water entrainment as well as settling of suspended sediments these observations are consistent with dai 2015 and blanchette et al 2005 suggesting that the present model has satisfactorily reproduced development of a turbidity current fig 6 shows the comparison of turbidity currents down different slopes at t 6 the typical characteristics of the abovementioned turbidity current still exist as the slope varies although a recent study kneller et al 2016 indicated that the kh instabilities and turbulent billows could be greatly damped when θ 0 these turbulent structures have clearly been seen in many previous experimental and numerical studies meiburg et al 2015 härtel et al 2000 necker et al 2002 simpson and britter 1979 of compositional gravity currents and turbidity currents on a flat bed as the slope angle increases the length of the turbidity current head becomes shorter and its height becomes larger in addition the two main turbulent billows at the upper interface tend to become more complex when the slope angle increases to 30 the two billows are even mixed together and a larger cloud is then formed the change in the shape indicates that the mixed region of the turbidity current increases as the slope angle increases to demonstrate this conclusion quantitatively the mixed region of the turbidity current am is calculated which is defined as the area where the particle concentration is in the range between 0 01 and 0 99 in the whole domain i e 8 a m 0 h 0 l ϕ c d x d z with ϕ c 1 0 01 c 0 99 ϕ c 0 c 0 01 or c 0 99 where φ c is a defined parameter changing with c the time evolution of the normalized volume of the mixed region in different cases is presented in fig 7 at the initial period during which the turbidity current is mainly controlled by the collapsing process the mixed region is not sensitive to the change in slope angle while at the later stage the increase in the slope angle makes the area of the mixed region grow more quickly this conclusion agrees with the previous numerical study of the compositional gravity current dai 2015 however it is more appropriate to evaluate the mixing and entrainment effect between the current and the ambient water by the dimensionless parameter i e the entrainment ratio ellison and turner 1959 which is related to both the entrainment volume of the ambient water and the front velocity of the current the analysis of the front velocity can also serve as a quantitative approach to show the development process of the turbidity current in section 3 3 a detailed analysis of the front velocity is presented 3 2 energy budget turbidity current evolution is essentially an energy conversion process the initial potential energy of the turbid water behind the lock i e ep 0 t is the energy source during evolution the initial potential energy will be transformed into three parts 1 those that have been converted to kinetic energy i e econ t 2 those that become temporally unconvertible due to sediment deposition this part may become convertible if resuspension is allowed however this is not the present focus i e the inactive potential energy ed t and 3 those remaining as active potential energy ep t specifically active inactive describe whether this part of the potential energy can be further transformed into kinetic energy or not the converted kinetic energy econ t has two elements 1 those remaining as the kinetic energy during the current evolution i e ek t and 2 those edis t that have been dissipated therefore nasr azadani and meiburg 2014 9 for description convenience the remaining potential energy including both convertible and unconvertible parts is defined as er t ep t ed t necker et al 2002 2005 presented an analysis of the energy budget for lock exchange turbidity currents on a flat bed nasr azadani and meiburg 2014 extended it to turbidity currents over seafloor topography the specific expressions for these energy components have been derived for a flat bed by necker et al 2002 2005 and for an unflat bed by nasr azadani and meiburg 2014 they are reformulated as follows

b τ d τ is the volume of deposited sediments per unit area from eqs 10b and 10c the potential energy components ep t and ed t depend on the reference plane i e zd necker et al 2002 2005 defined the reference plane at the flat bed this makes ed t invariably equal to zero and explains the lack of the term ed t in necker et al 2002 2005 for a turbidity current down a slope the term ed t 0 because sediments deposit at different heights from a physical perspective the idealized reference plane zd must be defined at the position where the current finally dies out however it is difficult to define the time that the current dies out because the mixing process lasts for a very long time nasr azadani et al 2018 as a compromise this study proposes a dynamic reference plane at a certain time t the reference plane is defined at the lowest point of the turbidity current which is determined by a threshold value of the sediment concentration of 0 01 in the following analyses of the energy terms are conducted against time by following the conventional practice dai 2015 necker et al 2002 3 2 1 influence of the slope angle on the energy budget fig 8 presents the temporal variations of the kinetic energy ek for turbidity currents down different slopes cases 1 2 3 6 and 7 at the initial period t 1 6 the kinetic energy ek experiences a rapid increase this is because at the initial stage the flow is mainly controlled by the collapsing effect as the current moves forward the collapsing effect diminishes and the slope effects accumulate consequently considerable differences are seen after the initial stage on a flat bed case 1 the kinetic energy ek starts to decrease on sloping beds cases 2 3 6 and 7 the kinetic energy ek continues to increase although at a reduced rate a gentler slope tends to exhibit a slower increase in the kinetic energy which is also due to the slope effects the steeper the bed slope the larger the amount of potential energy that can be converted nevertheless as sediment continues to deposit it is expected that the kinetic energy over the largest slope e g θ 30 would also decrease after propagating a sufficiently long distance though this phase is not simulated in this paper we proceed to discuss the proportions of different energy components within the total energy fig 9 shows the time evolutions of the proportions of the remaining kinetic energy ek fig 9 a the active potential energy ep fig 9 b the dissipated energy edis fig 9 c the inactive potential energy ed due to deposition fig 9 d the total converted potential energy econ i e ek edis fig 9 e and the total unconverted including both the active and inactive parts potential energy er i e ep ed fig 9 f over different slopes compared to the absolute values of the kinetic energy fig 8 that differ greatly as the bed slope varies a consistent overall variation pattern for the proportion of kinetic energy can be identified fig 9 a specifically three stages can be identified an initial stage of rapid increase followed by a relatively stable stage and finally a decreasing stage in the initial stage the kinetic energy proportion ek etot increases to its maximum value 55 for case 1 at t 3 2 51 for case 2 at t 3 5 50 for case 3 at t 3 8 51 for case 6 at t 4 3 54 for case 7 at t 6 7 this occurs because the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy fig 9 e at the initial stage when the collapsing effect dominates is much more than the energy dissipation fig 9 c the different timing for the maximum value of the kinetic energy proportion ek etot is due to the sloping effects the steeper the bed slope the stronger the collapsing effect and thus the later the appearance of the maximum value the relatively stable behavior of the proportion ek etot after the initial stage indicates a temporary balance between the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy fig 9 e and the dissipation of energies fig 9 c this occurs because of the weakening collapsing effect and thus the reduced conversion rate of potential energy to kinetic energy the final decreasing stage of the proportion ek etot indicates that the energy dissipation overwhelms the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy on the one hand this is due to the further weakening of the conversion and on the other hand the increasingly dominant viscous effects that dissipate energies fig 9 c similar to fig 9 a for the kinetic energy proportion ek etot the proportion ep etot of the remaining potential energy also exhibits a consistent variation trend for turbidity currents over different slopes the potential energy proportion ep etot decreases with time two stages can be noted in the initial collapsing period the potential energy proportion ep etot decreases very rapidly later it decreases gradually at a considerably reduced rate for those turbidity currents moving over a steeper slope there tends to be relatively less potential energy being converted econ see fig 9 e less energy being dissipated edis see fig 9 c clearly more sediment deposition induced inactive potential energy ed see fig 9 d and slightly more active potential energy ep see fig 9 b these can be explained by the different extent of sediment deposition over different slopes the results in fig 8 demonstrate that a turbidity current over a steeper slope has higher kinetic energy which implies a higher ability to transport sediment and thus less sediment deposition more sediment in suspension leads to high proportion of ep fig 9 b in contrast the behavior of the inactive potential energy proportion ed etot t depends on the quantity and relative location of sediment deposition see eq 10c for the definition of ed as well as the initial total energy on the one hand sediment deposits mainly near the lock position where the sediment initially stays this means that the difference of the relative position of the sediment decreases as the dynamic reference plane descends with time on the other hand the proportion of the sediment deposition compared to the total amount of sediment is essentially of similar magnitude for depositional turbidity currents these two aspects lead to a higher proportion of inactive potential energy ed etot t over a steeper slope fig 9 d the proportion of the remaining potential energy er ep ed is thus larger fig 9 f implying a smaller percentage of the total energy being converted fig 9 e accordingly the proportion of the dissipated energy that originates from the converted energy is also smaller fig 9 c 3 2 2 influence of the settling velocity on the energy budget fig 10 illustrates the effects of the particle settling velocity on the proportions of these energy components cases 3 4 and 5 a turbidity current carrying coarser sediment deposits more sediment and thus has less along slope effective gravitation accordingly turbidity currents carrying coarser sediments exhibit a smaller proportion of ep fig 10 b and ek fig 10 a but a larger portion of ed fig 10 d on the other hand since the presence of the settling velocity contributes to an additional energy loss eq 10d a higher percentage of the total energy of the turbidity current with a larger us is dissipated fig 10 c the significant increase in the dissipated energy also makes the portion of the converted energy larger fig 10 e consequently a smaller percentage of the total energy remains in the system fig 10 f 3 3 front velocity the current front velocity is normally used as an index for distinguishing different stages of the turbidity current evolution 3 3 1 influence of the settling velocity on the front velocity fig 11 a shows the time evolution of the front velocity of turbidity currents down an intermediate slope of 10 with different settling velocities cases 3 4 and 5 from fig 11 a the evolution process of a turbidity current down the intermediate slope can be divided into three distinct stages it can be seen that from t 0 to t 1 4 the sudden collapse of the dense water leads to a short acceleration stage during which uf increases rapidly from zero to the maximum value ufmax 0 67 after t 1 4 the turbidity current experiences a quasi constant stage with uf maintaining a nearly constant value of 0 66 in this stage a temporary balance is reached between the viscous force and the driving force due to entrainment with ambient water the driving force decreases and thus the current enters the next deceleration stage at approximately t 8 8 when the settling velocity is varied quantitative differences are seen in fig 11 b the parameter mp in fig 11 b represents the nondimensional mass of sediments in motion it can be seen that the higher the settling velocity is the smaller the current front velocity this is because a higher settling velocity causes greater sediment settling which reduces the driving force of the turbidity current and therefore the current front velocity nevertheless the qualitative behaviors as described above are consistent it is because only a small part of the total sediment is deposited as shown in fig 11 b specifically all the sediments are suspended for the case of us 0 when us increases to 0 02 over 80 of the total sediments are still suspended at t 12 3 3 2 influence of the slope angle on the front velocity fig 12 shows time evolutions of the front velocity of turbidity currents down different slopes cases 1 2 3 6 and 7 in all the cases the current front velocity uf experiences a rapid increase stage before t 1 4 during this stage uf is not greatly influenced by θ due to the dominance of the collapsing effect afterwards turbidity currents tend to behave differently depending on the magnitude of the bed slope the quasi constant stage is absent for a turbidity current over a horizontal bottom the current transits from the accelerating stage to the decelerating stage directly specifically its uf decreases by approximately 20 from t 1 4 to t 9 and approximately 18 from t 9 to t 12 for those over an intermediate slope e g 6 or 10 the quasi constant stage is retained with uf 0 65 from t 1 4 to t 8 6 for θ 6 and uf 0 68 from t 1 4 to t 8 4 for θ 10 after t 8 6 the front velocity starts to decrease for those over a steep slope the quasi constant stage is also missing instead the current has an extended accelerating stage though its accelerating rate is much reduced compared to the initial rapid accelerating stage for the cases of θ 15 the accelerating rate of the front velocity is approximately 0 012 during the extended accelerating stage from t 1 4 to t 7 1 compared to 0 503 during the initial rapid accelerating stage t 1 4 for the case of θ 30 this trend is more obvious at the initial period the sudden removal of the lock leads to a rapid collapse of dense fluid at the final period the density contrast is small and the turbidity current is mainly dominated by the viscous effect consequently turbidity currents down different slopes all have the first rapid acceleration stage and the final deceleration stage the along slope effective gravitation that serves as the positive effect increases with θ the interplay of the positive effective along slope gravitation and negative effect viscous force results in the presented behavior of the front velocity in the second stage for a relatively small slope e g θ 0 uf slightly decreases because the negative effect exceeds the positive effect with the increase in θ a temporary balance is reached between the positive and negative effects the second phase thus turns into a quasi constant stage on an intermediate slope e g 6 θ 10 during which uf is characterized by a nearly constant value when θ becomes larger the positive effect gradually surpasses the negative effect the quasi constant stage is replaced by an accelerating process e g θ 30 during which the acceleration of the turbidity current increases with θ 3 4 entrainment ratio when a turbidity current propagates downstream it entrains ambient water and dilutes the turbid water this phenomenon is normally quantified using water entrainment ratios which can be defined as follows wells and nadarajah 2009 11a e b u l k n w b u l k n u

2016a is used to compute the area sn h l x f n 1 where xf n is the front position at t tn the parameters qbulk and qinst n can be estimated using the principle of mass conservation i e an increase in

the choice of the criterion c 0 01 is based on a sensitivity analysis that shows the current volume changes only slightly when the concentration c varies between 0 01 and 0 05 3 4 1 influence of the slope angle on water entrainment fig 13 shows time evolutions of the entrainment ratio ebulk and einst of turbidity currents down different slopes cases 1 2 3 6 and 7 it appears that the bed slope does not have an obvious effect on the overall tendency of both the bulk and instantaneous entrainment ratios turbidity currents over a steeper bed tend to have a greater front velocity fig 12 and at the same time a larger mixed region fig 7 or alternatively a larger volume of entrained water the increase in both the numerator water entrainment velocity and the denominator front velocity leads to a subtle effect on the entrainment ratios the following is devoted to the overall trend of the entrainment ratios both ebulk and einst assume the greatest values at the very beginning which is due to the engulfing of water accompanying the initial collapse and the formation of the head bhaganagar 2017 later both ebulk and einst decrease rapidly with time as the collapsing effects diminish during the acceleration stage from t 0 to t 1 4 afterwards water entrainment is due to the kelvin helmholtz instabilities and turbulent billows developed at the upper interface fig 5 ottolenghi et al 2016a bhaganagar 2017 during this stage both ebulk and einst take on a relatively small value of approximately 0 05 compared to the relatively stable values of the bulk entrainment ratios fig 13 a the instantaneous entrainment ratio fluctuates at approximately 0 05 the fluctuation of einst is essentially related to the emergence and disappearance of the turbulent billows see fig 5 ottolenghi et al 2016b 3 4 2 influence of the settling velocity on water entrainment here the effects of the settling velocity on the entrainment ratio are analyzed the presence of sediment leads to two important effects on the water entrainment sediment deposition may lead to a weaker density stratification at the upper interface on the one hand nasr azadani et al 2018 and a reduced driving force and thus a smaller front velocity on the other hand the entrainment effect is enhanced by a weaker interface stratification nasr azadani et al 2018 and is decreased by a smaller front velocity fig 14 a and b show time evolutions of ebulk and einst of turbidity currents with different us down a 10 slope also shown in fig 14 c and d are time evolutions of ebulk and einst of turbidity currents down a flat bed the entrainment ratios of turbidity currents with different us have almost the same development tendency and value which means that the two opposite effects on the entrainment ratio offset each other as the settling velocity has little effect on ebulk and einst of a current down a slope the value of the entrainment ratio measured from a compositional gravity current may be applied in the case of a turbidity current at least in the slope within the range between 0 and 10 3 5 comparisons with 3d results two additional 3d simulations are run to make comparisons with the present 2d simulations the width in the spanwise direction in 3d cases is set at 2 with a non slip and non flux boundary condition applied at two lateral walls the other simulation setups are the same as the 2d cases on a flat bed see case 1 in table 2 down a 10 slope see case 2 in table 2 the comparisons are conducted towards the front location and energy term the mixed region and the bulk entrainment ratio as shown in fig 15 it is evident that the predictions from the two approaches exhibit some quantitative differences due to ignoring the wall effects in the 2d cases however these quantitative differences are very much limited both 2d and 3d dns approaches provide qualitatively similar trends for these parameters since this study aims to reveal the effects of the particle settling velocity and bed slope on the bulk properties of particle laden gravity currents e g the longitudinal variation in front velocity energy budget and entrainment effect instead of resolving the 3d structures the 2d dns approach is considered appropriate for the purpose of the present study although using 2d dns would veritably sacrifice some extent of the accuracy e g the 3d structures developed at the later stage of the current it does not affect the understanding obtained by this work 4 conclusions in this paper two dimensional direct numerical simulations are implemented for lock exchange turbidity currents down different slopes θ 30 the obtained high resolution numerical results are used to analyze the effects of the bed slope and the particle settling velocity on the dynamics in terms of the energy budget front velocity and water entrainment ratio in 12 nondimensional time units initially a reservoir of turbid water is placed on the left end of the computational domain the potential energy of this reservoir of turbid water provides the energy sources of the later formed turbidity current once the current starts to move in response to lock release potential energy is converted into kinetic energy ek at the same time some part of the kinetic energy is dissipated some part of the potential energy also becomes unconvertible or inactive ed as suspended particles deposit on the topography our simulation shows that during the initial period the collapse of the dense fluid introduces a very fast energy conversion process of potential energy into kinetic energy ek with only a small part of the kinetic energy dissipated later a leading head of the turbidity current is formed with kelvin helmholtz instabilities and turbulent billows generated at the upper interface which promote an entrainment effect with the ambient water after a first fast energy conversion process the energy conversion rate slows down the behavior of uf after the acceleration stage is determined by the interplay of the driving force and the viscous force the main highlights and conclusions of this study are as follows 1 a dynamic reference plane which is defined at the lowest point of the turbidity current and descends with time is proposed to analyze the energy budget of a turbidity current down a slope by this definition the total initial energy of the turbidity current that increases with time can serve as a good energy scale to analyze the temporal variation in the proportions of different energy components in contrast to the static reference plane defined previously at the position of the initial turbid water the dynamic reference plane can avoid the negative values of the energy terms 2 the absolute values of the energy components are diverse when the slope angle and the settling velocity are different these diversities can be greatly reduced by normalizing the absolute values with the total initial energy the normalized kinetic energy tends to first quickly increase then remain nearly constant and finally decrease the normalized potential energy continuously decreases with an initially great decelerating rate 3 the evolution process of a turbidity current down a slope can be divided into a first acceleration stage a second stage during which its behavior is determined by the slope angle and a third deceleration stage in the second stage uf changes from a slight decrease on a relatively slight slope e g θ 0 to a quasi constant state on an intermediate slope e g θ 10 and then an increasing process on a relatively steep bed e g θ 30 the turbidity current with a larger us has a smaller front velocity 4 both bed slope and sediment settling do not show an appreciable effect on the water entrainment ratios during the first acceleration stage both the bulk and instantaneous entrainment ratios ebulk and einst acquire the greatest values due to the engulfing of ambient water in the collapsing process of the particle laden fluid later einst fluctuates with time intensely while ebulk maintains a nearly constant value of approximately 0 05 acknowledgements this work was partially supported by the national natural science foundation

788,the protection of groundwater abstraction is primarily based on the delineation of time of travel capture zones known as well head protection areas whpas their delineation is subject to several uncertainties the scarcity of hydrogeological data due to limited budgets for exploration and additional uncertainty from time varying flow conditions while the former has lead to the use of probabilistic strategies no existing approaches for whpa delineation consider jointly geological uncertainties transient flow conditions and the associated additional uncertainties we propose to extend existing steady state probabilistic approaches for whpa delineation to account for transient flow conditions and their related uncertainties in our synthetic scenario transiency is represented through four selected transient drivers i regional groundwater flow direction ii regional strength of the hydraulic gradient iii natural groundwater recharge and iv pumping rate as a result of our proposed probabilistic framework we obtain probabilistic catchment maps that consider the joint effect of uncertain transient flow conditions and geological uncertainty to represent hydraulic conductivity we use a random space function using a matérn covariance function in order to reduce computational costs so that we can conduct monte carlo analysis over both sources of uncertainty we represent transiency as a dynamic superposition of steady state flow solutions overall we show that 1 each transient driver defines a distinctive pattern of temporal catchment membership with the ambient flow direction driving most of the changes 2 the transient analysis enhances decision support for probabilistic whpa delineation by providing additional information in terms of time reliability levels now a whpa can be defined from this analysis by selecting a reliability level for time and one for geological uncertainty 3 time reliability addresses a different kind of risk when compared to geological reliability while a lack of time reliability implies a known risk to the well for a fraction of time a lack of geological reliability means that one does not know whether the well is at risk 4 in the presence of uncertain transient and geological conditions high time reliability levels are cheap compared to high reliability levels against geological uncertainties 5 the combined use of time geological reliability information with land use information leads towards more targeted risk reduction measures that align with the two different types of risk addressed by time

influences 1 spatial heterogeneity and 2 time varying boundary and flow conditions the first main influence denotes the variability of hydrogeological parameters that describe the aquifer geological conditions the effect of heterogeneity on groundwater flow causes irregular contour lines and streamlines haitjema 1995 thus influencing contaminant transport processes considering that a complete characterization of the aquifer at the field scale is prohibitively expensive the limited available information about aquifer geological conditions leads to an associated uncertainty during the delineation of whpas and pumping well capture zones together with its uncertainty the influence of heterogeneity on pumping well protection zones has been extensively covered in the literature e g enzenhoefer et al 2014 enzenhoefer et al 2012 franzetti and guadagnini 1996 leeuwen et al 1998 stauffer et al 2004 varljen and shafer 1991 vassolo et al 1998 however in these studies they did not explore the effect of transiency instead they base on steady state considerations thus the second main challenge includes all those forces producing transiency in the flow field towards the well transient flow behavior is triggered by stochastically occurring weather conditions seasonal variations and demand adjusted pumping rates in general several studies have been conducted about temporal variability and its influence on aquifer response e g niu et al 2015 serrano and workman 1998 townley 1995 trefry 1999 and on transport processes e g cirpka and attinger 2003 elfeki et al 2012 goode and konikow 1990 leray et al 2014 rein et al 2009 recently libera et al 2017a explored the effects that known time varying pumping rates have on key features of contaminant transport in a randomly heterogeneous aquifer they showed that such dynamic conditions have a significant impact on the temporal behavior of contaminant breakthrough curves observed at pumping wells furthermore in a subsequent study libera et al 2017b showed that these fluctuations hold regardless of the different geostatistical models multi gaussian and non multi gaussian used to represent heterogeneity despite recognizing transiency as an important influence in both studies they did not consider the impact of other transient drivers others than pumping rates nor the effects of uncertainty associated to transient flow behavior in general there is only a limited number of studies addressing the impact of transiency on pumping well protection zones early studies addressing transiency due to pumping regimes have been conducted since the nineties ramanarayanan et al 1995 used numerical models to contrast a whpa between steady state and transient conditions they concluded that seasonal variations seem not to average out with time and that they increase the whpa extension by approximately 30 musa and kemblowski 1996 defined an effective capture zone under time varying velocity fields caused by temporal evolution of the cone of depression under constant pumping rates they tracked particles through a time sequence of steady state analytical solutions for flow towards a well the works of masterson et al 2004 and jeffrey starn et al 2014 analyzed the influence of transient pumping regimes in real site conditions for capture zone delineation they showed how temporal variations in the flow field caused by unsteady pumping rates can induce flow from new contributing areas to the well as well as to introduce significant changes on the mean transport process in addition to transient pumping regimes changes in the size and shape of capture outlines due to transient natural groundwater recharge have been initially investigated by lerner 1992 later numerical analyses were implemented by reilly and pollock 1996 and barry et al 2009 other studies have investigated the influence of transient behavior in the ambient groundwater flow festger and walter 2002 showed that changes in the regional hydraulic gradient have a significant effect on expanding and shrinking the capture zone once compared to its steady state solution rock and kupfersberger 2002 showed how a solution under transient conditions differs from steady state outlines driving high and low groundwater level conditions all previous studies neglected the influence of uncertain transient conditions instead they identified transient capture zones based on given time series of groundwater levels although both sources of uncertainty transient conditions and geological uncertainties are relevant for whpa delineation we have found only a few whpa studies exploring their joint effect stauffer et al 2005 qualitatively listed both sources of uncertainty among a set of parameters and conditions that cause uncertainty in the characterization of capture zones franssen et al 2002 used monte carlo analysis in order to measure the impact on capture delineation of spatiotemporally variable natural recharge for moderately heterogeneous transmissivity fields in summary none of those studies that address transient effects in whpa provide a corresponding decision rule for delineation only two consider jointly effects of transience and uncertainties from heterogeneity and none of them recognizes uncertainty in describing transient drivers however both studies did not consider the influence that uncertain transient conditions might trigger into whpa delineation the goal of this study is to improve the robustness of well protection against uncertain transient flow conditions thus we propose a probabilistic delineation rule for whpas in the presence of uncertain transient conditions and geological uncertainty the final output is again a fixed whpa outline but based on probabilistic concepts and transient considerations our work is a novel combination of concepts well addressed in the literature e g quasi steady state assumptions response time for groundwater flow probabilistic whpa delineation that extends previous steady state probabilistic frameworks see e g the studies of enzenhoefer et al 2012 franssen et al 2002 stauffer et al 2005 towards the implementation of uncertain transient flow considerations to represent transiency in a synthetic application scenario we use four transient drivers the regional groundwater flow direction the strength of the regional hydraulic gradient the natural groundwater recharge and the pumping rates overall we show 1 the influence of each considered transient driver in whpa delineation results in a distinctive pattern of temporal catchment membership with the ambient flow direction resulting the greater influence among the analyzed transient drivers 2 the implementation of transient analysis improves decision support for probabilistic whpa delineation it provides as additional information time reliability levels now probabilistic whpa delineation requires to select reliability levels for time and for geological conditions 3 time reliability depicts a different form of risk when contrasted to geological reliability lack of time reliability depicts a known risk to the well for a specific time period the lack of geological reliability depicts lack of knowledge whether the well is at risk 4 in the presence of uncertain transient and geological conditions higher time reliability protection represents a cheaper condition compared to high geological reliability levels 5 the use of time geological reliability information combined with land use information lead to a better decision making process concerning sensitive locations within a whpa the delineation of whpas influenced by transient flow conditions is computationally more expensive in comparison to their steady state solutions even more if they are coupled with monte carlo analysis for obtaining probabilistic whpas enzenhoefer et al 2012 consequently as the first step we formulate a methodology which makes it possible to achieve faster but asymptotically for large aquifer hydraulic diffusivity valid transient flow conditions see section 2 1 for this we combine the principle of superposition with an assumption of quasi stationarity for seasonal changes in dynamic drivers in the second step transient capture zones are characterized see section 2 2 through reverse particle tracking random walk in the third step see sections 2 3 and 2 4 we define probabilistic transient capture zones by statistical aggregation over many instances in time representing transiency and over many monte carlo realizations representing uncertainty in the last step we analyze the results to achieve the four goals stated above the above methodology is explained in section 2 in section 3 we describe our synthetic scenario in which we will address the impact of transient conditions on probabilistic whpas delineations in section 4 we present the respective results and discussion and provide the corresponding conclusion and outlook of our study in section 5 2 methodology in the present section we describe the methodology we use for a fast and asymptotically accurate solution for large hydraulic aquifer diffusivity of probabilistic whpa delineations influenced by uncertainty and transient flow conditions 2 1 transient groundwater flow formulation by the dynamic superposition of steady state solutions the general governing equation for transient groundwater flow in heterogeneous and isotropic conditions for 3d confined aquifers is 1 s s ϕ t k ϕ q s x t in ω with hydraulic transmissivity k hydraulic head ϕ specific storage ss and sink source term qs x t in the domain ω the boundary conditions for eq 1 are 2 k ϕ n q t on γ 1 ϕ ϕ t on γ 2 where q and ϕ are predefined fluxes and heads on neumann γ1 and dirichlet γ2 boundaries respectively and n is the outward directed unit normal to γ where γ γ 1 γ2 domenico and schwarz 1998 presented a time constant t s s l 2 k derived from dimensionless analysis of eq 1 neglecting qs relating the aquifer hydraulic diffusivity term s s k 1 and a relevant length scale l such as the distance between the aquifer boundaries this diffusivity term is applicable to aquifers where the saturated thickness remains constant and thus is aimed principally at confined aquifers for practical purposes however one can use this concept for unconfined aquifers if the change in the saturated thickness does not exceed for instance 10 of the initial saturated thickness barlow and leake 2012 they proposed to compare this time constant t to the time scale t at which we wish to observe the aquifer here t depicts the time required to reach equilibrium after some hydraulic perturbation alley et al 2002 thus for times t t the aquifer would appear to be at steady state where the influence of the storage term in eq 1 is negligible 3 s s ϕ t k ϕ t t this equation is a common approximation that has been used in previous studies e g bellin et al 1996 consequently eq 1 can be reformulated without the storage term following the same boundary conditions as before in eq 2 4 k ϕ i 1 n i q i x t in ω eq 4 when applied to fully saturated confined aquifers becomes a linear differential equation reilly et al 1984 thus we can write without further loss of generality the solution ϕ and its boundary conditions as a linear superposition of the influences from external driving forces 5 ϕ x t ϕ 0 x j 1 n j λ j t ϕ j x here ϕ 0 x is the solution of eq 4 under time averaged boundary conditions and without internal sources and sinks λj t is the magnitude of the j th transient driver influence in the solution of eq 4 at time t the functions ϕ j x are the sensitivities of the solution ϕ x t with respect to the i th transient driver further sensitivities result from the likewise treated boundary conditions similarly we decompose again without loss of further generality for fully saturated confined aquifers the changes over time for the boundary conditions and internal source sink terms the source sink terms become 6 q s x t q 0 i 1 n i λ i t q i x we apply the same treatment as in eq 6 to the boundary conditions of eq 2 as an example the influence from a pumping well is represented by 7 q p w x t λ p w t q p w x q p w t δ x x i on x i ω t 0 here qpw x t is the point like sink term qpw t is the pumping rate with negative values and δ is the dirac function being zero at all x except at the position of the well x i all boundary conditions transient drivers are treated likewise we solve the proposed dynamic superposition of steady state solutions using a standard galerkin finite element code as used by nowak et al 2008 the same mathematical treatment holds approximately for unconfined aquifers where the changes in the saturated thickness are small compared to the steady state saturated thickness 2 2 transport formulation under transient conditions the advective dispersive transport of a conservative tracer is given by 8 c t v c d c 0 in ω here c is concentration t is time v q ne is velocity q is darcy velocity effective porosity ne assumed constant in this study and d is the hydromechanic dispersion tensor scheidegger 1954 given by 9 d α t v d e i α l α t v v t v with longitudinal and transversal dispersivities αl and αt respectively effective diffussion coefficient de and the identity matrix i eq 8 is subject to the boundary conditions 10 n v c n d c j on γ 1 11 c c on γ γ 1 here j is a prescribed normal flux density and c represents prescribed concentrations our methodology to solve eq 8 relies on a backward in time formulation where the source of contaminants starts at the pumping well neupauer and wilson 2002 we choose a particle tracking random walk scheme due to its absence of numerical dispersion kinzelbach 1988 salamon 2006 in comparison to steady state flow scenarios when particles are released under transient conditions they experience a sequence of velocity fields throughout their entire life time hence we define points in time tj 0 t at which batches of particles are released in order to discretize the continuous injection in time particles are tracked until they reach a life time τcrit that is relevant for whpa analysis then we use the transient time of travel capture zone analysis described in section 2 3 at points in time tk that discretize the solution of eq 8 thus our approach involves three time discretizations 1 one for the flow time domain to discretize the flow conditions of different stress periods at points in time tl 2 another for the particle release at times tj and 3 a discretization with time points tk on which we read out the transient transport simulations for capture analysis the latter runs from tj to tj τcrit for each particle batch where τcrit is the critical time related to the delineation of whpas 2 3 time frequency map representation of whpas the backtracking of each particle batch j results in a batch wise and hence time dependent map of mean travel time towards the well the mean refers to the respective mean over all particles subject to hydrodynamic dispersion that pass through the pixels of the map we generate each particle age map using the same grid as for the flow discretization then using eq 13 we convert each travel time map to a boolean yes no map fj xi that indicates whether the mean travel time is below the critical value τcrit this map expresses for each pixel xi whether it represents a risk to the well in case of contaminant spills finally we assess the frequency across all nj batch wise maps i e over the transient behavior of the system how often each map pixel has a critical or smaller mean travel time this yields a frequency map f xi of whpa membership 12 f x i 1 n j j 1 n j f j x i 13 f j x i 1 if τ x i t j τ c r i t 0 otherwise lower values represent a smaller temporal window for possible contamination which is inversely proportional to how urgently a pixel should be included in the whpa therefore we convert from frequency map to reliability map by 14 r t x i 1 f x i 100 we use the index t for these reliability maps to distinguish the time frequency related reliability from the probabilistic reliability that we will discuss later the time related reliability expresses how likely the production well remains safe in case of an instantaneous spill event happening in each map pixel x i as the resulting transient contaminant plume may bypass the well under the current transient flow conditions for instance for a total simulation time t of 360 days the area outlined by the 90 time reliability isoline r 90 is safe in 324 360 90 days of the year thus time reliability denotes a different kind of risk in whpa analysis a lack of time reliability means that we know that such location will put the well at risk the only remaining question is for how many days per year and this question is answered through the pixelwise time reliability values 2 4 probabilistic whpa formulation and delineation rules besides the uncertainty in whpa delineation attributed to transient flow considerations additional uncertainty might be triggered due to a imprecise information regarding aquifer parameters and b inexact knowledge about the behavior of the different transient drivers we tackle both sources of uncertainty via monte carlo simulation of time reliability maps 15 r t x i r t x i w above w denotes the dependence on random input parameters the ensemble of time reliability maps represents the joint probability distribution of pixel wise frequencies in transient flow conditions and under uncertain aquifer parameters the above formulation resembles the probabilistic framework for whpas given by enzenhoefer et al 2012 but now extended for transience related frequencies it is important to emphasize the difference between time reliability and geological reliability values while both handle risk in the face of uncertainty time and geological respectively a lack of geological reliability defines that we do not know whether the well is safe this is a different risk condition compared to the lack of time reliability which means that we acknowledge that the well is already at risk for a certain fraction of days per year the resulting decision rule for delineating whpas requires two decision parameters a desired time frequency reliability level and a desired geological uncertainty reliability level how different transient drivers and the choice of these parameters affects the area consumed by the whpa will become clear in sections 4 1 and 4 2 3 model scenario we set up a synthetic model scenario in order to address and analyze the effects of transiency and uncertainties on capture zones and whpa delineation first we describe the model domain then we introduce and explain the four transient drivers we have considered 3 1 set up of the synthetic base model the geometry used for the synthetic base model resembles a single geological layer it is confined only by a leaky layer that permits recharge the model uses prescribed fluxes and heads for the neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions see fig 1 the aquifer model domain has a size of 3500 m 3500 m 50 m discretized with 10 m 10 m 10 m cells we select τcrit 180 days setting the total simulation time for transport to 360 days ensuring at least 180 days of simulation for any batch of particles injected over the half year period of system time the quasi steady flow is discretized in time steps of 20 days and we release a new batch of particles every day into a single fully penetrating well located at x 2800 m and y 1750 m in the domain additionally we highlight four locations see fig 1 within the domain in order to analyze how the results of our approach i e time reliability and geological reliability can be used in decision making 3 2 representation of transient flow conditions several studies rely on sinusoidal time series to represent the behavior of natural transient flow conditions e g almedeij and al ruwaih 2006 festger and walter 2002 psarropoulou and karatzas 2012 serrano et al 2007 this arrangement resembles the cyclic pattern of natural phenomena the same pattern can be representative of dynamic pumping rates in response to seasonal fluctuations e g bell et al 2008 conlon et al 2005 hoffmann et al 2001 hence we represent the transiency of all model forces as sinusoidal patterns 16 λ i t l α i ɛ i sin ω i t l φ i here λi tl is the magnitude of the transient driver to be used in eq 5 as already stated in section 3 1 we discretize eq 16 in time periods of 20 days with a constant value for λi in each twenty day period tl the parameters αi ε i ωi and φ i describe average value amplitude frequency and phase shift respectively the pumping strength and natural conditions are representative from case scenarios found in the literature specifically we base the amplitude of the strength of the regional hydraulic gradient on the values given in festger and walter 2002 for the natural recharge we consider values given in franssen et al 2002 for pumping rate conditions the actual choice of distribution is meaningful because there is often a legal or regulated upper bound to pumping therefore we stick to the magnitudes given in frind et al 2002 uncertainty in transiency is represented by treating amplitudes and phase shift as random variables for randomizing amplitudes we multiply the literature values with random numbers drawn independently from the uniform distribution u 0 1 the choice of uniform distributions is arbitrary and represents a simple uncertainty scenario that is specific to each study we treat pumping rates as random although they may be perceived as controllable parameters of well operation however we argue that future pumping rates are unknown because they react to the joint influence of future water demand and future weather conditions for instance a pumping well will be at steady state if its amplitude value is multiplied by zero while it would be imposing a fully transient regime with amplitude equal to 100 any value in between will control the strength of the amplitude likewise we randomize the phase shift uniformly between zero and π the only assumption made about phase shifts in the transient behavior is that the pumping rate acts precisely opposite to natural recharge i e stronger pumping takes place during the dry season phase shifted by half of the used period because the recovery from pumping begins at the end of the irrigation season before the beginning of the rainy season conlon et al 2005 in order to investigate the impact of transient flow conditions on whpas combined with aquifer geological uncertainty we use hydraulic conductivity as a random space function described by a matẽrn covariance function minasny and mcbratney 2005 we treat the parameters of the structural model e g covariance parameters as uncertain following uniform distributions in our scenario we assumed a specific storage of 1 10 6 utilizing the distance between boundaries l 3500 m and both extreme values of mean k see table 1 we obtain time constants t ranging from 0 034 to 0 26 days thus the groundwater system will reach equilibrium after the introduction of a new set of transient conditions on a time scale of 369 min at the latest table 1 lists all relevant parameters for transient flow transport and the covariance model 4 results and discussion 4 1 influence of transient conditions in single whpa delineations in our investigation we distinguish between the influence of transient flow conditions on deterministic whpa delineation eq 14 and its impact on probabilistic whpa solutions eq 15 in this first section we investigate the changes in whpa delineation triggered by the individual influence of each considered transient driver based on this we examine and rank their individual influence on the whpa outlines 4 1 1 each transient driver has a distinct pattern how does a transiency driven whpa outline differ from a steady state whpa delineation fig 2 displays an example of the individual contribution that heterogeneous aquifer conditions and each considered transient driver can cause in whpa delineation all transient realizations utilize the same amplitude 100 phase shift 0 and period π year values each figure shows the isolated influence of a single transient driver or heterogeneity as specified in the figure headings while all other drivers are fixed to their average steady state values additionally we show the equivalent solution for a homogeneous aquifer under fully steady state conditions for comparison in each figure we outline in white the steady state whpa as well as the corresponding 100 time reliability whpa in red the blue cross indicates the pumping well location at first we look at steady state cases as a basis for comparison fig 2a presents the straightforward whpa solution based on steady state assumptions and homogeneous aquifer conditions fig 2b shows the influence of aquifer heterogeneity in a single aquifer realization under steady state assumptions that depending on the individual realization of hydraulic conductivity deforms the theoretically required whpa outline the absence of transiency and assumption of complete knowledge of aquifer heterogeneity in these two cases should result in a deterministic whpa outline now we look at the influence of seasonal changes in the regional groundwater flow direction in a homogeneous aquifer i e ignoring all aspects of heterogeneity and uncertainty fig 2c shows the corresponding frequency map of whpa membership through dynamic changes a transient direction results in a narrower guaranteed membership area yellow in the transverse direction but with increasing whpa area for higher time reliability levels compared to the homogeneous steady state case in fig 2a there is minimum impact on the whpa downgradient right of the pumping well position overall transiency in regional flow direction mainly calls for a laterally expanded whpa at the upstream and middle sections the pattern caused by seasonal changes in the strength of the regional hydraulic gradient is shown in fig 2d two system states arise during its temporal variations 1 during periods of larger magnitudes the hydraulic gradient will have a higher influence on the velocity field than the current pumping rate this extends the required whpa into the upgradient flow direction leading to a larger although narrower whpa 2 periods of weaker gradients on the other hand permit a stronger relative influence from current pumping rate conditions leading to a shorter yet wider whpa the combination of both effects induce an extended whpa at almost all sections of the outline but only at large time reliability values hence a visual ranking between the factors may be misguiding next in fig 2e we look at the effects of seasonal changes in the natural groundwater recharge among all analyzed transient drivers natural recharge causes the smallest variations in whpa delineation our scenarios are inspired by moderate climates so the importance of natural recharge variations may be more pronounced in regions with a rain season followed by a clearly arid season however we have the discussion of quantitative statements about significance of the drivers to section 4 1 2 finally in fig 2f we look at the pattern caused by variations in pumping rates the influence of transient pumping conditions and the resulting pattern can be understood as the exact opposite of the two effects mentioned for the strength of the regional gradient when comparing the time frequency patterns between the transient pumping case fig 2f and the transient hydraulic gradient scenario fig 2d it shows a smaller variation in the time frequency pattern this smaller variation however is attributed to the assumed pumping rate amplitude rather than to the transient driver effect by itself nevertheless in both whpa solutions we used magnitudes from real case scenarios festger and walter 2002 frind et al 2002 that represent realistic situations from the literature overall we conclude that each individual transient driver has a distinct pattern of temporal catchment memberships they lead to different whpa shapes than the steady state case and they have their own regions of increased frequency related uncertainty 4 1 2 ambient flow direction is the dominant driver which transient driver is the most important condition in our analyzed scenario in order to answer this question beyond the visual impression from section 4 1 1 and in combination with geological uncertainty we carried out a global sensitivity analysis gsa based on the method of morris 1991 to analyze sensitivities the gsa computes two sensitivity measurements per randomized variable known as factors within the morris framework first it calculates the absolute mean effect μ i to describe the global influence of each input factor second it computes the standard deviation σi to point out whether a factor depicts a non linear behavior or interactions with other factors a factor can be acknowledged as unimportant if both morris measures show low values i e both sensitivity measures are located near to the origin linear effects depict high values of μ i and low values of σi while non linearity or interactions with other transient drivers are indicated by high magnitudes in both measurements for the sake of brevity we postpone the mathematical definition of both sensitivity measures to the appendix in our analysis we consider the sensitivities with respect to four amplitude and three phase shift values because pumping depends on recharge using 5000 monte carlo repetitions per factor see appendix in our assessment we investigate three different sensitivity aspects case a depicts changes in time reliabilities for each pixel within the whpa case b compares the total areal demand land surface area delineated by arbitrarily selected reliability levels inside the 100 time reliability finally case c measures changes in delineation by counting the number of pixels left that flip from inside whpa to outside and vice versa fig 3 displays for cases a red b blue and c black the sensitivity measures due to changes in the regional flow direction circles regional hydraulic gradient diamonds pumping rate triangles and natural recharge squares first we analyze the overall behavior from all transient drivers for the three mentioned cases as expected each transient driver introduces a change in whpa delineation indicated by μi 0 while additionally showing a non linear behavior or interaction expressed by σi 0 the location of all transient drivers on the diagonal of the plot indicates the importance of transient flow conditions during whpa analysis next we analyze the relation between both sensitivity measures μ i and σi for each transient driver apparently we can group their overall influence into two main clusters the first cluster groups all sensitivities attributed to changes in the regional groundwater flow direction circles case a areal demand becomes the most sensitive case in comparison to the other two cases as seen by the larger values in both sensitivity measures the second cluster groups all transient drivers that modify in some extent the velocity field here transient pumping rate conditions triangle depict for all three cases an overall greater influence than the remaining two transient flow behaviors in general changes of the regional hydraulic gradient are described as the third most influential condition although only for cases a red and c black dynamic behavior in the natural recharge is ranked in general as the least influential transient driver although this analysis is specific to the used range of transient driver magnitudes it allows us to formulate tentative recommendations about the treatment of transient drivers first in the presence of dynamic fluctuations of the regional flow direction one should account for these variations during whpa delineation rather than introducing a mean flow direction into simulation second pumping regimes and dynamic changes in the regional hydraulic gradient can represent an important source of transiency which should not be neglected however pumping regimes can be easier to predict because they are under control of the operator finally dynamic variations in the natural groundwater recharge might be viewed as a mean value in case other transient conditions are strongly pronounced 4 2 transient analysis improves probabilistic whpa delineation in the previous section we discussed how the individual effects of each considered transient driver modify the conventional whpa outline now in this section we introduce uncertainty in whpa delineation attributed to the insufficient knowledge about parameters of transient drivers in eq 16 and also to inexact characterization of aquifer heterogeneity we investigate this issue via monte carlo analysis 4 2 1 the difference between transient and steady state probabilistic analysis how does our probabilistic transient analysis and decision rule including uncertainty in transient drivers and in heterogeneity differ from probabilistic steady state whpa analysis to investigate this question we compare the solution of our fully uncertain transient analysis with an equivalent scenario that considers only geological uncertainty and replaces transient flow conditions by their long term average see table 1 fig 4 shows for both analyses the delineation for a 50 geological reliability level using 100 time reliability in the transient analysis larger white contour line and in the steady state analysis smaller white contour line of course the transient analysis leads to the larger outline this is because the transient analysis integrates all locations that due to transient flow conditions might contribute groundwater to the well at any time of the year the transient analysis provides richer information than conventional probabilistic analyses in the form of time reliability outlines for example fig 4 highlights in red the 10 50 and 90 time reliability outlines for the same 50 geological reliability level these outlines include all locations in the whpa that contribute to the pumped water quality in 10 50 and 90 of all days in the year the larger the time reliability value the larger the corresponding outline the observable increase in areal demand of the whpa is a combination of the individual patterns discussed in section 4 1 with the help of these time reliability outlines a decision maker can elucidate here for a chosen geological reliability value the time frame of protection against groundwater contamination that the whpa should provide of course there will be trade offs between choosing higher geological reliability versus higher time reliability as will be discussed in section 4 2 2 in section 4 2 3 we show how the richer information provided by time reliability maps is useful in decision making about whpa delineation 4 2 2 choosing higher time reliability levels is much cheaper than increasing geological reliability how does the overall areal demand for whpa delineation depend on the chosen reliability and what is the trade off between geological and time reliability fig 5 shows the corresponding areal demand for combinations of geological and time reliability levels 50 the greater these levels are the greater the safety and the corresponding areal demand reaching the maximum protection and area at the 100 100 time geological combination for instance the curve for areal demand for a fixed 100 time reliability value indicates the area required for full temporal protection as a function of geological reliability do time and geological reliability behave differently in demanding area first we compare the steepness of the slopes in areal demand with increasing time reliability for the fixed 50 and 100 geological reliability levels while both curves seem to increase linearly with increasing time reliability the steeper increment in areal demand at the 100 geological reliability level shows that the greater transient influence occurs when requiring larger geological reliability now we look at the slopes along the geological reliability axis e g for fixed time reliability levels of 50 and 100 here we see a strong increase in slope over the last 10 of geological reliability for both time reliability levels by comparing the behavior along the two directions we can conclude that the additional areal demand for more time reliability is always smaller than the additional areal demand for larger geological reliability thus there is an obvious preference for choosing larger time reliability over larger geological reliabilities especially at high reliability levels 4 2 3 time reliability information can help to prioritize protection in this analysis we investigate how the availability of time reliability information improves decision making in whpa delineation and when deciding on individual protection measures for sensitive locations within the whpa for our analysis we utilize the cumulative distribution function cdf of time reliability values over all realizations we extract there cdf at for the four different locations marked in fig 1 as blue red black and green lines for locations l1 l2 l3 and l4 respectively in addition for reasons of clarity we add axes of opposite magnitude to indicate risk if we look at the lower right corner of the plot the combined 100 100 time geological risk scenario will represent the worst case for any location since it indicates a 100 probability risk for groundwater contamination at all times vice versa the 100 100 time geological reliability conditions in the upper left corner describe that the location under analysis represent zero risk at all times first we analyze location l1 taking the new time reliability information into account the decision maker will not hesitate to include such a location within the whpa outline there is more than a 70 probability 30 geological reliability that the pumped water is contaminated by an event that occurs at l1 at any time of the year 0 time reliability now we start moving away from the well and examine position l2 of course while the distance from the well increases the risk of groundwater contamination at any given time reduces only 15 of all realizations above was 70 exhibit a zero time reliability additionally 20 of all realizations have a time reliability of 100 and 50 of all realizations have at least a 50 time reliability that means an instantaneous in time spill at location l2 could occur in a lucky moment that does not contaminate the well while a continuous spill will hit the well with 80 probability the probability that a spill at any time will impact the well 0 time reliability is less than 3 for l3 and less than 1 for l4 but our analysis also shows a continuous release at l3 looking at close to 100 time reliability will impact the well at some days of the year with more than 40 for a good decision we can look at the type of land use of the featured locations for instance if there is industrial activity at l3 the need to implement strong regulations is obvious and l3 should be treated just like l1 however if locations l3 and l4 show only limited human activity such as a forest area we would be willing to discuss rather mild and cost effective strategies for risk reduction in this way we enhance the decision making about the treatment of sensitive locations within the whpa by introducing our transient analysis 5 conclusions and outlook transient conditions in groundwater flow have received only little attention regarding their effects in whpa delineation instead most whpa solutions are derived from steady state models for instance most whpa programs from water supply companies base their decision making on fixed maps although the catchment to protect is in fact transient in this study we implement four chosen transient conditions and analyze how they influence whpa delineation our key analysis tools are joint frequency probability maps that indicate the degree of membership to the area that should be protected in the end our analysis results in a fixed whpa map but the construction of the map explicitly considers transiency and uncertainty in summary our findings are 1 the influence of every considered transient driver resulted in a distinctive pattern how whpa maps are affected the ambient flow direction drives most of the changes in whpa delineation 2 working under steady state conditions is not enough transient analysis for probabilistic whpa delineation provides additional information in terms of time reliability maps now a whpa can be defined from this analysis by selecting a reliability level for time and one for geological uncertainty 3 time reliability relates to a different kind of risk when compared to geological reliability a lack of time reliability denotes that we know that the well is at risk for a certain fraction of days per year while a lack of geological reliability means that we do not know whether the well is at risk 4 in the presence of uncertain transient and geological conditions selecting a higher time reliability level becomes much cheaper than increasing geological reliability 5 transient analysis enhances decision making for sensitive locations within a whpa the use of time geological reliability information combined with land use information helps to take more targeted risk reduction measures that align with the two different types of risk added by time reliability and geological reliability we are aware that the results and conclusions of our study are specific to the analyzed

adequacy of geostatistical models will differ from site to site e g libera et al 2017a libera et al 2017b however we expect that on a qualitative level the effects and the ranking between heterogeneity and transiency generalizes as an outlook for future research we look into mitigating transient behavior through dynamic optimization of pumping rates in extended well fields

2 at the university of stuttgart appendix here we provide the mathematical definition of the global sensitivity analysis gsa based on the morris technique in order to determine the influence of each considered randomized variable the gsa technique computes the difference of outcomes between a reference solution and a second solution using identical initial values but with a first variable of interest drawn randomly then the gsa measures sensitivity by dividing this difference by the change of the variable of interest subsequent analyses repeat the same process by randomizing a next variable of interest until all variables of interest k have been modified here the k 1 realizations define a monte carlo iteration with each k 1 realizations utilizing same randomly generated hydraulic conductivity field this procedure is repeated for n k 1 simulations and describes the screening technique originally developed by morris 1991 with n representing the number of monte carlo iterations here each variable is known as input factor i and the computed sensitivity measure is the elementary effect eei we refer to saltelli et al 2008 for a more detailed explanation of the method the morris technique uses two measures per factor in order to analyze sensitivities first the absolute mean effect μ i denoting the average of eei over all realizations describes the global influence

788,the protection of groundwater abstraction is primarily based on the delineation of time of travel capture zones known as well head protection areas whpas their delineation is subject to several uncertainties the scarcity of hydrogeological data due to limited budgets for exploration and additional uncertainty from time varying flow conditions while the former has lead to the use of probabilistic strategies no existing approaches for whpa delineation consider jointly geological uncertainties transient flow conditions and the associated additional uncertainties we propose to extend existing steady state probabilistic approaches for whpa delineation to account for transient flow conditions and their related uncertainties in our synthetic scenario transiency is represented through four selected transient drivers i regional groundwater flow direction ii regional strength of the hydraulic gradient iii natural groundwater recharge and iv pumping rate as a result of our proposed probabilistic framework we obtain probabilistic catchment maps that consider the joint effect of uncertain transient flow conditions and geological uncertainty to represent hydraulic conductivity we use a random space function using a matérn covariance function in order to reduce computational costs so that we can conduct monte carlo analysis over both sources of uncertainty we represent transiency as a dynamic superposition of steady state flow solutions overall we show that 1 each transient driver defines a distinctive pattern of temporal catchment membership with the ambient flow direction driving most of the changes 2 the transient analysis enhances decision support for probabilistic whpa delineation by providing additional information in terms of time reliability levels now a whpa can be defined from this analysis by selecting a reliability level for time and one for geological uncertainty 3 time reliability addresses a different kind of risk when compared to geological reliability while a lack of time reliability implies a known risk to the well for a fraction of time a lack of geological reliability means that one does not know whether the well is at risk 4 in the presence of uncertain transient and geological conditions high time reliability levels are cheap compared to high reliability levels against geological uncertainties 5 the combined use of time geological reliability information with land use information leads towards more targeted risk reduction measures that align with the two different types of risk addressed by time reliability and geological reliability keywords well catchment delineation groundwater protection transient flow conditions risk assessment uncertainty quantification 1 introduction in order to reduce the risk of pumping contaminated groundwater at drinking water wells a common strategy is to restrict land use activities surrounding these wells according to many national regulations these well head protection areas whpas usepa 1993 envelope theoretical time of travel capture zones specifying the travel time required for a contaminant to reach a pumping well such delineations frequently rely on modeled 2d or 3d scenarios based on conceptual assumptions and approximations using either analytic or numerical methods kinzelbach et al 1992 there is a tendency to favor numerical simulations in order to implement arbitrary hydro geo logical parameters and boundary conditions franke et al 1998 the most challenging aspects for groundwater models for whpa analysis can be grouped in two main influences 1 spatial heterogeneity and 2 time varying boundary and flow conditions the first main influence denotes the variability of hydrogeological parameters that describe the aquifer geological conditions the effect of heterogeneity on groundwater flow causes irregular contour lines and streamlines haitjema 1995 thus influencing contaminant transport processes considering that a complete characterization of the aquifer at the field scale is prohibitively expensive the limited available information about aquifer geological conditions leads to an associated uncertainty during the delineation of whpas and pumping well capture zones together with its uncertainty the influence of heterogeneity on pumping well protection zones has been extensively covered in the literature e g enzenhoefer et al 2014 enzenhoefer et al 2012 franzetti and guadagnini 1996 leeuwen et al 1998 stauffer et al 2004 varljen and shafer 1991 vassolo et al 1998 however in these studies they did not explore the effect of transiency instead they base on steady state considerations thus the second main challenge includes all those forces producing transiency in the flow field towards the well transient flow behavior is triggered by stochastically occurring weather conditions seasonal variations and demand adjusted pumping rates in general several studies have been conducted about temporal variability and its influence on aquifer response e g niu et al 2015 serrano and workman 1998 townley 1995 trefry 1999 and on transport processes e g cirpka and attinger 2003 elfeki et al 2012 goode and konikow 1990 leray et al 2014 rein et al 2009 recently libera et al 2017a explored the effects that known time varying pumping rates have on key features of contaminant transport in a randomly heterogeneous aquifer they showed that such dynamic conditions have a significant impact on the temporal behavior of contaminant breakthrough curves observed at pumping wells furthermore in a subsequent study libera et al 2017b showed that these fluctuations hold regardless of the different geostatistical models multi gaussian and non multi gaussian used to represent heterogeneity despite recognizing transiency as an important influence in both studies they did not consider the impact of other transient drivers others than pumping rates nor the effects of uncertainty associated to transient flow behavior in general there is only a limited number of studies addressing the impact of transiency on pumping well protection zones early studies addressing transiency due to pumping regimes have been conducted since the nineties ramanarayanan et al 1995 used numerical models to contrast a whpa between steady state and transient conditions they concluded that seasonal variations seem not to average out with time and that they increase the whpa extension by approximately 30 musa and kemblowski 1996 defined an effective capture zone under time varying velocity fields caused by temporal evolution of the cone of depression under constant pumping rates they tracked particles through a time sequence of steady state analytical solutions for flow towards a well the works of masterson et al 2004 and jeffrey starn et al 2014 analyzed the influence of transient pumping regimes in real site conditions for capture zone delineation they showed how temporal variations in the flow field caused by unsteady pumping rates can induce flow from new contributing areas to the well as well as to introduce significant changes on the mean transport process in addition to transient pumping regimes changes in the size and shape of capture outlines due to transient natural groundwater recharge have been initially investigated by lerner 1992 later numerical analyses were implemented by reilly and pollock 1996 and barry et al 2009 other studies have investigated the influence of transient behavior in the ambient groundwater flow festger and walter 2002 showed that changes in the regional hydraulic gradient have a significant effect on expanding and shrinking the capture zone once compared to its steady state solution rock and kupfersberger 2002 showed how a solution under transient conditions differs from steady state outlines driving high and low groundwater level conditions all previous studies neglected the influence of uncertain transient conditions instead they identified transient capture zones based on given time series of groundwater levels although both sources of uncertainty transient conditions and geological uncertainties are relevant for whpa delineation we have found only a few whpa studies exploring their joint effect stauffer et al 2005 qualitatively listed both sources of uncertainty among a set of parameters and conditions that cause uncertainty in the characterization of capture zones franssen et al 2002 used monte carlo analysis in order to measure the impact on capture delineation of spatiotemporally variable natural recharge for moderately heterogeneous transmissivity fields in summary none of those studies that address transient effects in whpa provide a corresponding decision rule for delineation only two consider jointly effects of transience and uncertainties from heterogeneity and none of them recognizes uncertainty in describing transient drivers however both studies did not consider the influence that uncertain transient conditions might trigger into whpa delineation the goal of this study is to improve the robustness of well protection against uncertain transient flow conditions thus we propose a probabilistic delineation rule for whpas in the presence of uncertain transient conditions and geological uncertainty the final output is again a fixed whpa outline but based on probabilistic concepts and transient considerations our work is a novel combination of concepts well addressed in the literature e g quasi steady state assumptions response time for groundwater flow probabilistic whpa delineation that extends previous steady state probabilistic frameworks see e g the studies of enzenhoefer et al 2012 franssen et al 2002 stauffer et al 2005 towards the implementation of uncertain transient flow considerations to represent transiency in a synthetic application scenario we use four transient drivers the regional groundwater flow direction the strength of the regional hydraulic gradient the natural groundwater recharge and the pumping rates overall we show 1 the influence of each considered transient driver in whpa delineation results in a distinctive pattern of temporal catchment membership with the ambient flow direction resulting the greater influence among the analyzed transient drivers 2 the implementation of transient analysis improves decision support for probabilistic whpa delineation it provides as additional information time reliability levels now probabilistic whpa delineation requires to select reliability levels for time and for geological conditions 3 time reliability depicts a different form of risk when contrasted to geological reliability lack of time reliability depicts a known risk to the well for a specific time period the lack of geological reliability depicts lack of knowledge whether the well is at risk 4 in the presence of uncertain transient and geological conditions higher time reliability protection represents a cheaper condition compared to high geological reliability levels 5 the use of time geological reliability information combined with land use information lead to a better decision making process concerning sensitive locations within a whpa the delineation of whpas influenced by transient flow conditions is computationally more expensive in comparison to their steady state solutions even more if they are coupled with monte carlo analysis for obtaining probabilistic whpas enzenhoefer et al 2012 consequently as the first step we formulate a methodology which makes it possible to achieve faster but asymptotically for large aquifer hydraulic diffusivity valid transient flow conditions see section 2 1 for this we combine the principle of superposition with an assumption of quasi stationarity for seasonal changes in dynamic drivers in the second step transient capture zones are characterized see section 2 2 through reverse particle tracking random walk in the third step see sections 2 3 and 2 4 we define probabilistic transient capture zones by statistical aggregation over many instances in time representing transiency and over many monte carlo realizations representing uncertainty in the last step we analyze the results to achieve the four goals stated above the above methodology is explained in section 2 in section 3 we describe our synthetic scenario in which we will address the impact of transient conditions on probabilistic whpas delineations in section 4 we present the respective results and discussion and provide the corresponding conclusion and outlook of our study in section 5 2 methodology in the present section we describe the methodology we use for a fast and asymptotically accurate solution for large hydraulic aquifer diffusivity of probabilistic whpa delineations influenced by uncertainty and transient flow conditions 2 1 transient groundwater flow formulation by the dynamic superposition of steady state solutions the general governing equation for transient groundwater flow in heterogeneous and isotropic conditions for 3d confined aquifers is 1 s s ϕ t k ϕ q s x t in ω with hydraulic transmissivity k hydraulic head ϕ specific storage ss and sink source term qs x t in the domain ω the boundary conditions for eq 1 are 2 k ϕ n q t on γ 1 ϕ ϕ t on γ 2 where q and ϕ are predefined fluxes and heads on neumann γ1 and dirichlet γ2 boundaries respectively and n is the outward directed unit normal to γ where γ γ 1 γ2 domenico and schwarz 1998 presented a time constant t s s l 2 k derived from dimensionless analysis of eq 1 neglecting qs relating the aquifer hydraulic diffusivity term s s k 1 and a relevant length scale l such as the distance between the aquifer boundaries this diffusivity term is applicable to aquifers where the saturated thickness remains constant and thus is aimed principally at confined aquifers for practical purposes however one can use this concept for unconfined aquifers if the change in the saturated thickness does not exceed for instance 10 of the initial saturated thickness barlow and leake 2012 they proposed to compare this time constant t to the time scale t at which we wish to observe the aquifer here t depicts the time required to reach equilibrium after some hydraulic perturbation alley et al 2002 thus for times t t the aquifer would appear to be at steady state where the influence of the storage term in eq 1 is negligible 3 s s ϕ t k ϕ t t this equation is a common approximation that has been used in previous studies e g bellin et al 1996 consequently eq 1 can be reformulated without the storage term following the same boundary conditions as before in eq 2 4 k ϕ i 1 n i q i x t in ω eq 4 when applied to fully saturated confined aquifers becomes a linear differential equation reilly et al 1984 thus we can write without further loss of generality the solution ϕ and its boundary conditions as a linear superposition of the influences from external driving forces 5 ϕ x t ϕ 0 x j 1 n j λ j t ϕ j x here ϕ 0 x is the solution of eq 4 under time averaged boundary conditions and without internal sources and sinks λj t is the magnitude of the j th transient driver influence in the solution of eq 4 at time t the functions ϕ j x are the sensitivities of the solution ϕ x t with respect to the i th transient driver further sensitivities result from the likewise treated boundary conditions similarly we decompose again without loss of further generality for fully saturated confined aquifers the changes over time for the boundary conditions and internal source sink terms the source sink terms become 6 q s x t q 0 i 1 n i λ i t q i x we apply the same treatment as in eq 6 to the boundary conditions of eq 2 as an example the influence from a pumping well is represented by 7 q p w x t λ p w t q p w x q p w t δ x x i on x i ω t 0 here qpw x t is the point like sink term qpw t is the pumping rate with negative values and δ is the dirac function being zero at all x except at the position of the well x i all boundary conditions transient drivers are treated likewise we solve the proposed dynamic superposition of steady state solutions using a standard galerkin finite element code as used by nowak et al 2008 the same mathematical treatment holds approximately for unconfined aquifers where the changes in the saturated thickness are small compared to the steady state saturated thickness 2 2 transport formulation under transient conditions the advective dispersive transport of a conservative tracer is given by 8 c t v c d c 0 in ω here c is concentration t is time v q ne is velocity q is darcy velocity effective porosity ne assumed constant in this study and d is the hydromechanic dispersion tensor scheidegger 1954 given by 9 d α t v d e i α l α t v v t v with longitudinal and transversal dispersivities αl and αt respectively effective diffussion coefficient de and the identity matrix i eq 8 is subject to the boundary conditions 10 n v c n d c j on γ 1 11 c c on γ γ 1 here j is a prescribed normal flux density and c represents prescribed concentrations our methodology to solve eq 8 relies on a backward in time formulation where the source of contaminants starts at the pumping well neupauer and wilson 2002 we choose a particle tracking random walk scheme due to its absence of numerical dispersion kinzelbach 1988 salamon 2006 in comparison to steady state flow scenarios when particles are released under transient conditions they experience a sequence of velocity fields throughout their entire life time hence we define points in time tj 0 t at which batches of particles are released in order to discretize the continuous injection in time particles are tracked until they reach a life time τcrit that is relevant for whpa analysis then we use the transient time of travel capture zone analysis described in section 2 3 at points in time tk that discretize the solution of eq 8 thus our approach involves three time discretizations 1 one for the flow time domain to discretize the flow conditions of different stress periods at points in time tl 2 another for the particle release at times tj and 3 a discretization with time points tk on which we read out the transient transport simulations for capture analysis the latter runs from tj to tj τcrit for each particle batch where τcrit is the critical time related to the delineation of whpas 2 3 time frequency map representation of whpas the backtracking of each particle batch j results in a batch wise and hence time dependent map of mean travel time towards the well the mean refers to the respective mean over all particles subject to hydrodynamic dispersion that pass through the pixels of the map we generate each particle age map using the same grid as for the flow discretization then using eq 13 we convert each travel time map to a boolean yes no map fj xi that indicates whether the mean travel time is below the critical value τcrit this map expresses for each pixel xi whether it represents a risk to the well in case of contaminant spills finally we assess the frequency across all nj batch wise maps i e over the transient behavior of the system how often each map pixel has a critical or smaller mean travel time this yields a frequency map f xi of whpa membership 12 f x i 1 n j j 1 n j f j x i 13 f j x i 1 if τ x i t j τ c r i t 0 otherwise lower values represent a smaller temporal window for possible contamination which is inversely proportional to how urgently a pixel should be included in the whpa therefore we convert from frequency map to reliability map by 14 r t x i 1 f x i 100 we use the index t for these reliability maps to distinguish the time frequency related reliability from the probabilistic reliability that we will discuss later the time related reliability expresses how likely the production well remains safe in case of an instantaneous spill event happening in each map pixel x i as the resulting transient contaminant plume may bypass the well under the current transient flow conditions for instance for a total simulation time t of 360 days the area outlined by the 90 time reliability isoline r 90 is safe in 324 360 90 days of the year thus time reliability denotes a different kind of risk in whpa analysis a lack of time reliability means that we know that such location will put the well at risk the only remaining question is for how many days per year and this question is answered through the pixelwise time reliability values 2 4 probabilistic whpa formulation and delineation rules besides the uncertainty in whpa delineation attributed to transient flow considerations additional uncertainty might be triggered due to a imprecise information regarding aquifer parameters and b inexact knowledge about the behavior of the different transient drivers we tackle both sources of uncertainty via monte carlo simulation of time reliability maps 15 r t x i r t x i w above w denotes the dependence on random input parameters the ensemble of time reliability maps represents the joint probability distribution of pixel wise frequencies in transient flow conditions and under uncertain aquifer parameters the above formulation resembles the probabilistic framework for whpas given by enzenhoefer et al 2012 but now extended for transience related frequencies it is important to emphasize the difference between time reliability and geological reliability values while both handle risk in the face of uncertainty time and geological respectively a lack of geological reliability defines that we do not know whether the well is safe this is a different risk condition compared to the lack of time reliability which means that we acknowledge that the well is already at risk for a certain fraction of days per year the resulting decision rule for delineating whpas requires two decision parameters a desired time frequency reliability level and a desired geological uncertainty reliability level how different transient drivers and the choice of these parameters affects the area consumed by the whpa will become clear in sections 4 1 and 4 2 3 model scenario we set up a synthetic model scenario in order to address and analyze the effects of transiency and uncertainties on capture zones and whpa delineation first we describe the model domain then we introduce and explain the four transient drivers we have considered 3 1 set up of the synthetic base model the geometry used for the synthetic base model resembles a single geological layer it is confined only by a leaky layer that permits recharge the model uses prescribed fluxes and heads for the neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions see fig 1 the aquifer model domain has a size of 3500 m 3500 m 50 m discretized with 10 m 10 m 10 m cells we select τcrit 180 days setting the total simulation time for transport to 360 days ensuring at least 180 days of simulation for any batch of particles injected over the half year period of system time the quasi steady flow is discretized in time steps of 20 days and we release a new batch of particles every day into a single fully penetrating well located at x 2800 m and y 1750 m in the domain additionally we highlight four locations see fig 1 within the domain in order to analyze how the results of our approach i e time reliability and geological reliability can be used in decision making 3 2 representation of transient flow conditions several studies rely on sinusoidal time series to represent the behavior of natural transient flow conditions e g almedeij and al ruwaih 2006 festger and walter 2002 psarropoulou and karatzas 2012 serrano et al 2007 this arrangement resembles the cyclic pattern of natural phenomena the same pattern can be representative of dynamic pumping rates in response to seasonal fluctuations e g bell et al 2008 conlon et al 2005 hoffmann et al 2001 hence we represent the transiency of all model forces as sinusoidal patterns 16 λ i t l α i ɛ i sin ω i t l φ i here λi tl is the magnitude of the transient driver to be used in eq 5 as already stated in section 3 1 we discretize eq 16 in time periods of 20 days with a constant value for λi in each twenty day period tl the parameters αi ε i ωi and φ i describe average value amplitude frequency and phase shift respectively the pumping strength and natural conditions are representative from case scenarios found in the literature specifically we base the amplitude of the strength of the regional hydraulic gradient on the values given in festger and walter 2002 for the natural recharge we consider values given in franssen et al 2002 for pumping rate conditions the actual choice of distribution is meaningful because there is often a legal or regulated upper bound to pumping therefore we stick to the magnitudes given in frind et al 2002 uncertainty in transiency is represented by treating amplitudes and phase shift as random variables for randomizing amplitudes we multiply the literature values with random numbers drawn independently from the uniform distribution u 0 1 the choice of uniform distributions is arbitrary and represents a simple uncertainty scenario that is specific to each study we treat pumping rates as random although they may be perceived as controllable parameters of well operation however we argue that future pumping rates are unknown because they react to the joint influence of future water demand and future weather conditions for instance a pumping well will be at steady state if its amplitude value is multiplied by zero while it would be imposing a fully transient regime with amplitude equal to 100 any value in between will control the strength of the amplitude likewise we randomize the phase shift uniformly between zero and π the only assumption made about phase shifts in the transient behavior is that the pumping rate acts precisely opposite to natural recharge i e stronger pumping takes place during the dry season phase shifted by half of the used period because the recovery from pumping begins at the end of the irrigation season before the beginning of the rainy season conlon et al 2005 in order to investigate the impact of transient flow conditions on whpas combined with aquifer geological uncertainty we use hydraulic conductivity as a random space function described by a matẽrn covariance function minasny and mcbratney 2005 we treat the parameters of the structural model e g covariance parameters as uncertain following uniform distributions in our scenario we assumed a specific storage of 1 10 6 utilizing the distance between boundaries l 3500 m and both extreme values of mean k see table 1 we obtain time constants t ranging from 0 034 to 0 26 days thus the groundwater system will reach equilibrium after the introduction of a new set of transient conditions on a time scale of 369 min at the latest table 1 lists all relevant parameters for transient flow transport and the covariance model 4 results and discussion 4 1 influence of transient conditions in single whpa delineations in our investigation we distinguish between the influence of transient flow conditions on deterministic whpa delineation eq 14 and its impact on probabilistic whpa solutions eq 15 in this first section we investigate the changes in whpa delineation triggered by the individual influence of each considered transient driver based on this we examine and rank their individual influence on the whpa outlines 4 1 1 each transient driver has a distinct pattern how does a transiency driven whpa outline differ from a steady state whpa delineation fig 2 displays an example of the individual contribution that heterogeneous aquifer conditions and each considered transient driver can cause in whpa delineation all transient realizations utilize the same amplitude 100 phase shift 0 and period π year values each figure shows the isolated influence of a single transient driver or heterogeneity as specified in the figure headings while all other drivers are fixed to their average steady state values additionally we show the equivalent solution for a homogeneous aquifer under fully steady state conditions for comparison in each figure we outline in white the steady state whpa as well as the corresponding 100 time reliability whpa in red the blue cross indicates the pumping well location at first we look at steady state cases as a basis for comparison fig 2a presents the straightforward whpa solution based on steady state assumptions and homogeneous aquifer conditions fig 2b shows the influence of aquifer heterogeneity in a single aquifer realization under steady state assumptions that depending on the individual realization of hydraulic conductivity deforms the theoretically required whpa outline the absence of transiency and assumption of complete knowledge of aquifer heterogeneity in these two cases should result in a deterministic whpa outline now we look at the influence of seasonal changes in the regional groundwater flow direction in a homogeneous aquifer i e ignoring all aspects of heterogeneity and uncertainty fig 2c shows the corresponding frequency map of whpa membership through dynamic changes a transient direction results in a narrower guaranteed membership area yellow in the transverse direction but with increasing whpa area for higher time reliability levels compared to the homogeneous steady state case in fig 2a there is minimum impact on the whpa downgradient right of the pumping well position overall transiency in regional flow direction mainly calls for a laterally expanded whpa at the upstream and middle sections the pattern caused by seasonal changes in the strength of the regional hydraulic gradient is shown in fig 2d two system states arise during its temporal variations 1 during periods of larger magnitudes the hydraulic gradient will have a higher influence on the velocity field than the current pumping rate this extends the required whpa into the upgradient flow direction leading to a larger although narrower whpa 2 periods of weaker gradients on the other hand permit a stronger relative influence from current pumping rate conditions leading to a shorter yet wider whpa the combination of both effects induce an extended whpa at almost all sections of the outline but only at large time reliability values hence a visual ranking between the factors may be misguiding next in fig 2e we look at the effects of seasonal changes in the natural groundwater recharge among all analyzed transient drivers natural recharge causes the smallest variations in whpa delineation our scenarios are inspired by moderate climates so the importance of natural recharge variations may be more pronounced in regions with a rain season followed by a clearly arid season however we have the discussion of quantitative statements about significance of the drivers to section 4 1 2 finally in fig 2f we look at the pattern caused by variations in pumping rates the influence of transient pumping conditions and the resulting pattern can be understood as the exact opposite of the two effects mentioned for the strength of the regional gradient when comparing the time frequency patterns between the transient pumping case fig 2f and the transient hydraulic gradient scenario fig 2d it shows a smaller variation in the time frequency pattern this smaller variation however is attributed to the assumed pumping rate amplitude rather than to the transient driver effect by itself nevertheless in both whpa solutions we used magnitudes from real case scenarios festger and walter 2002 frind et al 2002 that represent realistic situations from the literature overall we conclude that each individual transient driver has a distinct pattern of temporal catchment memberships they lead to different whpa shapes than the steady state case and they have their own regions of increased frequency related uncertainty 4 1 2 ambient flow direction is the dominant driver which transient driver is the most important condition in our analyzed scenario in order to answer this question beyond the visual impression from section 4 1 1 and in combination with geological uncertainty we carried out a global sensitivity analysis gsa based on the method of morris 1991 to analyze sensitivities the gsa computes two sensitivity measurements per randomized variable known as factors within the morris framework first it calculates the absolute mean effect μ i to describe the global influence of each input factor second it computes the standard deviation σi to point out whether a factor depicts a non linear behavior or interactions with other factors a factor can be acknowledged as unimportant if both morris measures show low values i e both sensitivity measures are located near to the origin linear effects depict high values of μ i and low values of σi while non linearity or interactions with other transient drivers are indicated by high magnitudes in both measurements for the sake of brevity we postpone the mathematical definition of both sensitivity measures to the appendix in our analysis we consider the sensitivities with respect to four amplitude and three phase shift values because pumping depends on recharge using 5000 monte carlo repetitions per factor see appendix in our assessment we investigate three different sensitivity aspects case a depicts changes in time reliabilities for each pixel within the whpa case b compares the total areal demand land surface area delineated by arbitrarily selected reliability levels inside the 100 time reliability finally case c measures changes in delineation by counting the number of pixels left that flip from inside whpa to outside and vice versa fig 3 displays for cases a red b blue and c black the sensitivity measures due to changes in the regional flow direction circles regional hydraulic gradient diamonds pumping rate triangles and natural recharge squares first we analyze the overall behavior from all transient drivers for the three mentioned cases as expected each transient driver introduces a change in whpa delineation indicated by μi 0 while additionally showing a non linear behavior or interaction expressed by σi 0 the location of all transient drivers on the diagonal of the plot indicates the importance of transient flow conditions during whpa analysis next we analyze the relation between both sensitivity measures μ i and σi for each transient driver apparently we can group their overall influence into two main clusters the first cluster groups all sensitivities attributed to changes in the regional groundwater flow direction circles case a areal demand becomes the most sensitive case in comparison to the other two cases as seen by the larger values in both sensitivity measures the second cluster groups all transient drivers that modify in some extent the velocity field here transient pumping rate conditions triangle depict for all three cases an overall greater influence than the remaining two transient flow behaviors in general changes of the regional hydraulic gradient are described as the third most influential condition although only for cases a red and c black dynamic behavior in the natural recharge is ranked in general as the least influential transient driver although this analysis is specific to the used range of transient driver magnitudes it allows us to formulate tentative recommendations about the treatment of transient drivers first in the presence of dynamic fluctuations of the regional flow direction one should account for these variations during whpa delineation rather than introducing a mean flow direction into simulation second pumping regimes and dynamic changes in the regional hydraulic gradient can represent an important source of transiency which should not be neglected however pumping regimes can be easier to predict because they are under control of the operator finally dynamic variations in the natural groundwater recharge might be viewed as a mean value in case other transient conditions are strongly pronounced 4 2 transient analysis improves probabilistic whpa delineation in the previous section we discussed how the individual effects of each considered transient driver modify the conventional whpa outline now in this section we introduce uncertainty in whpa delineation attributed to the insufficient knowledge about parameters of transient drivers in eq 16 and also to inexact characterization of aquifer heterogeneity we investigate this issue via monte carlo analysis 4 2 1 the difference between transient and steady state probabilistic analysis how does our probabilistic transient analysis and decision rule including uncertainty in transient drivers and in heterogeneity differ from probabilistic steady state whpa analysis to investigate this question we compare the solution of our fully uncertain transient analysis with an equivalent scenario that considers only geological uncertainty and replaces transient flow conditions by their long term average see table 1 fig 4 shows for both analyses the delineation for a 50 geological reliability level using 100 time reliability in the transient analysis larger white contour line and in the steady state analysis smaller white contour line of course the transient analysis leads to the larger outline this is because the transient analysis integrates all locations that due to transient flow conditions might contribute groundwater to the well at any time of the year the transient analysis provides richer information than conventional probabilistic analyses in the form of time reliability outlines for example fig 4 highlights in red the 10 50 and 90 time reliability outlines for the same 50 geological reliability level these outlines include all locations in the whpa that contribute to the pumped water quality in 10 50 and 90 of all days in the year the larger the time reliability value the larger the corresponding outline the observable increase in areal demand of the whpa is a combination of the individual patterns discussed in section 4 1 with the help of these time reliability outlines a decision maker can elucidate here for a chosen geological reliability value the time frame of protection against groundwater contamination that the whpa should provide of course there will be trade offs between choosing higher geological reliability versus higher time reliability as will be discussed in section 4 2 2 in section 4 2 3 we show how the richer information provided by time reliability maps is useful in decision making about whpa delineation 4 2 2 choosing higher time reliability levels is much cheaper than increasing geological reliability how does the overall areal demand for whpa delineation depend on the chosen reliability and what is the trade off between geological and time reliability fig 5 shows the corresponding areal demand for combinations of geological and time reliability levels 50 the greater these levels are the greater the safety and the corresponding areal demand reaching the maximum protection and area at the 100 100 time geological combination for instance the curve for areal demand for a fixed 100 time reliability value indicates the area required for full temporal protection as a function of geological reliability do time and geological reliability behave differently in demanding area first we compare the steepness of the slopes in areal demand with increasing time reliability for the fixed 50 and 100 geological reliability levels while both curves seem to increase linearly with increasing time reliability the steeper increment in areal demand at the 100 geological reliability level shows that the greater transient influence occurs when requiring larger geological reliability now we look at the slopes along the geological reliability axis e g for fixed time reliability levels of 50 and 100 here we see a strong increase in slope over the last 10 of geological reliability for both time reliability levels by comparing the behavior along the two directions we can conclude that the additional areal demand for more time reliability is always smaller than the additional areal demand for larger geological reliability thus there is an obvious preference for choosing larger time reliability over larger geological reliabilities especially at high reliability levels 4 2 3 time reliability information can help to prioritize protection in this analysis we investigate how the availability of time reliability information improves decision making in whpa delineation and when deciding on individual protection measures for sensitive locations within the whpa for our analysis we utilize the cumulative distribution function cdf of time reliability values over all realizations we extract there cdf at for the four different locations marked in fig 1 as blue red black and green lines for locations l1 l2 l3 and l4 respectively in addition for reasons of clarity we add axes of opposite magnitude to indicate risk if we look at the lower right corner of the plot the combined 100 100 time geological risk scenario will represent the worst case for any location since it indicates a 100 probability risk for groundwater contamination at all times vice versa the 100 100 time geological reliability conditions in the upper left corner describe that the location under analysis represent zero risk at all times first we analyze location l1 taking the new time reliability information into account the decision maker will not hesitate to include such a location within the whpa outline there is more than a 70 probability 30 geological reliability that the pumped water is contaminated by an event that occurs at l1 at any time of the year 0 time reliability now we start moving away from the well and examine position l2 of course while the distance from the well increases the risk of groundwater contamination at any given time reduces only 15 of all realizations above was 70 exhibit a zero time reliability additionally 20 of all realizations have a time reliability of 100 and 50 of all realizations have at least a 50 time reliability that means an instantaneous in time spill at location l2 could occur in a lucky moment that does not contaminate the well while a continuous spill will hit the well with 80 probability the probability that a spill at any time will impact the well 0 time reliability is less than 3 for l3 and less than 1 for l4 but our analysis also shows a continuous release at l3 looking at close to 100 time reliability will impact the well at some days of the year with more than 40 for a good decision we can look at the type of land use of the featured locations for instance if there is industrial activity at l3 the need to implement strong regulations is obvious and l3 should be treated just like l1 however if locations l3 and l4 show only limited human activity such as a forest area we would be willing to discuss rather mild and cost effective strategies for risk reduction in this way we enhance the decision making about the treatment of sensitive locations within the whpa by introducing our transient analysis 5 conclusions and outlook transient conditions in groundwater flow have received only little attention regarding their effects in whpa delineation instead most whpa solutions are derived from steady state models for instance most whpa programs from water supply companies base their decision making on fixed maps although the catchment to protect is in fact transient in this study we implement four chosen transient conditions and analyze how they influence whpa delineation our key analysis tools are joint frequency probability maps that indicate the degree of membership to the area that should be protected in the end our analysis results in a fixed whpa map but the construction of the map explicitly considers transiency and uncertainty in summary our findings are 1 the influence of every considered transient driver resulted in a distinctive pattern how whpa maps are affected the ambient flow direction drives most of the changes in whpa delineation 2 working under steady state conditions is not enough transient analysis for probabilistic whpa delineation provides additional information in terms of time reliability maps now a whpa can be defined from this analysis by selecting a reliability level for time and one for geological uncertainty 3 time reliability relates to a different kind of risk when compared to geological reliability a lack of time reliability denotes that we know that the well is at risk for a certain fraction of days per year while a lack of geological reliability means that we do not know whether the well is at risk 4 in the presence of uncertain transient and geological conditions selecting a higher time reliability level becomes much cheaper than increasing geological reliability 5 transient analysis enhances decision making for sensitive locations within a whpa the use of time geological reliability information combined with land use information helps to take more targeted risk reduction measures that align with the two different types of risk added by time reliability and geological reliability we are aware that the results and conclusions of our study are specific to the analyzed scenario i e to the used set of parameters and employed models to represent geological uncertainty conditions for example the choice of sinusoidal dynamics the selection of dynamic drivers and the adequacy of geostatistical models will differ from site to site e g libera et al 2017a libera et al 2017b however we expect that on a qualitative level the effects and the ranking between heterogeneity and transiency generalizes as an outlook for future research we look into mitigating transient behavior through dynamic optimization of pumping rates in extended well fields

considered randomized variable the gsa technique computes the difference of outcomes between a reference solution and a second solution using identical initial values but with a first variable of interest drawn randomly then the gsa measures sensitivity by dividing this difference by the change of the variable of interest subsequent analyses repeat the same process by randomizing a next variable of interest until all variables of interest k have been modified here the k 1 realizations define a monte carlo iteration with each k 1 realizations utilizing same randomly generated hydraulic conductivity field this procedure is repeated for n k 1 simulations and describes the screening technique originally developed by morris 1991 with n representing the number of monte carlo iterations here each variable is known as input factor i and the computed sensitivity measure is the elementary effect eei we refer to saltelli et al 2008 for a more detailed explanation of the method the morris technique uses two measures per factor in order to analyze sensitivities first the absolute mean effect μ i denoting the average of eei over all realizations describes the global influence

789,sediment is a major source of non point pollution suspended sediment can transport nutrients toxicants and pesticides and can contribute to eutrophication of rivers and lakes modeling suspended sediment in rivers is of particular importance in the field of environmental science and engineering however understanding and quantifying nonlinear interactions between river discharge and sediment dynamics has always been a challenge in this paper we introduce a parsimonious probabilistic model to describe the relationship between suspended sediment load ssl and discharge volume this model rooted in multivariate probability theory and bayesian network infers conditional marginal distribution of ssl for a given discharge level the proposed framework relaxes the need for detailed information about the physical characteristics of the watershed climatic forcings and the nature of rainfall runoff transformation by drawing samples from the probability distribution functions pdfs of the underlying process here discharge and ssl data discharge and ssl pdfs can be simplified into a joint distribution that describes the relationship between ssl and discharge in which the latter acts as a proxy for different predictors of ssl the joint distribution is created based on historical discharge and ssl data and stores information about the discharge ssl relationship and sediment transport process of the watershed of interest we test this framework for seven major rivers in the u s results of which show promising performance to predict ssl and its likelihood given different discharge levels keywords sediment transport suspended sediment load stochastic modeling copula uncertainty analysis 1 introduction understanding and quantifying nonlinear interactions between river discharge and sediment dynamics and its short and long term impacts on the river morphology and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is challenging given the heterogeneity of watersheds stochastic nature of turbulent flow and characteristics of erosion processes garcia 2008 malmon et al 2002 sediment transport and deposition can induce major environmental problems such as deteriorating aquatic habitat and surface water quality filling reservoirs redirecting the course of streams widening floodplains of rivers and destroying buildings and properties best and bristow 1993 morris and fan 1998 parker and ikeda 1989 hence understanding and modeling sedimentation processes in streams and rivers is important in different fields of study including environmental quality and resource management river management and river transportation aytek and kişi 2008 lovejoy et al 1997 schumm et al 1984 sediment transport can occur in two general forms 1 suspended load and 2 bed load which in great part depends on sediment particle size distribution garcia 2008 for example cohesive clay particles form consolidated particles which can increase critical shear stress and subsequently fall velocity of the consolidated particles berlamont et al 1993 this property decreases sediment transport rate and hence lessen suspended sediment concentration wiberg and smith 1987 on the other hand silt particles have lower fall velocity compared to the consolidated clay particles silt is usually eroded from watershed surface and is dominantly transported as suspended load in rivers bagnold 1962 sand contents on the contrary mostly source from the river bed and their suspension depends on discharge value and shape of the river garcia 2008 moreover land use and cover can also affect sediment transport urban land cover for example can augment impervious area and increase flood peaks which in turn decreases erosion at the source but enhances suspension of bed load wolman 1967 agricultural land use can also increase watershed s sediment yield as a result of removing natural vegetal cover and disturbing soil surface walling 1999 on the contrary forest can protect land surface from erosion and diminish soil mobility leopold 1968 these parameters along with flow shear stress govern sediment transport in rivers yang 1996 sediment transport modeling is commonly interconnected to hydraulic engineering yang 1996 traditionally physical models have been used to tackle this challenge van rijn 1984 vanoni 2006 but more recently computational and empirical models have gained popularity with the advancement of computational power garcia 2008 morgan et al 1998 warner et al 2008 also black box approaches such as artificial intelligence techniques and machine learning algorithms have recently been used in various fields of environmental modeling including sediment transport cobaner et al 2009 kisi et al 2012 stochastic approaches for modeling sediment transport and yield however received less attention and were only sparsely used to account for processes related to rivers hydraulic properties such as turbulence effect on incipient motion of bed load material particle motion on a mobile bed and particle trajectory estimation kleinhans and van rijn 2002 lisle et al 1998 van rijn et al 1993 in this study we introduce a stochastic approach for modeling suspended sediment load ssl in alluvial rivers this event based probabilistic approach draws insights from the multivariate probability theory and bayesian networks and estimates the conditional marginal distribution of ssl in a high flow event given the discharge volume ssl consists of wash load from upstream erosion and suspended bed load which are both dependent on stochastic processes such as flow turbulence and precipitation intensity energy and angle among others garcia 2008 ssl is highly interrelated with high flow volume chalov et al 2015 in fact a majority of watersheds sediment yield is transported during flood events rankl 2004 we model this correlation structure using copulas and exploit this dependence structure to estimate ssl based on discharge volume this approach has a sound probabilistic basis and estimates likelihood of different ssl levels which in turn provides insights for uncertainty quantification of predictions the proposed approach characterizes the underlying data generating probability distribution function pdf from which random samples are drawn to construct the conditional marginal distribution of ssl the underlying data generating pdf is constructed from historical observed data and stores key components of the watersheds sedimentation processes such as slope vegetation cover and soil characteristics among others this framework not only relaxes the need for detailed information about watershed characteristics and climatic forcing but also requires a significantly lower computational cost to model ssl compared to its computational and physical counterparts note that in this study the joint distribution of ssl and discharge has been exploited given the availability of long term observations of both variables one may construct the joint distribution of ssl discharge velocity profile and pressure field among others and condition the marginal distribution of ssl on multiple drivers for a more confined uncertainty range however lack of long term observation of such detailed information might be prohibitive 2 methodology 2 1 stochastic modeling of environmental processes environmental models strive to capture response of a system to some drivers which might not be necessarily unique sadegh et al 2018a if the relationship between observed inputs r r 1 r 2 r n states x and system response y is stochastic the modeling approach should also be stochastic indeed most environmental modeling frameworks should adopt a stochastic nature considering the random characteristics of the measurement errors the underlying data generating process for an environmental system then can be described as a conditional pdf f y x r derived from the joint pdf f y x r constrained by the conservation principles and the physical limitations of the system bulygina and gupta 2009 2010 bulygina et al 2009 2011 2 2 bayesian network we can employ bayesian networks bns to derive the underlying data generating conditional pdf f for environmental modeling bns are probabilistic graphical models that describe a set of random variables r and their conditional dependencies f ri rj through a directed acyclic graph thulasiraman and swamy 1992 the joint density function f of random variables r that collectively form a bn given an ordering similar to that of the parent variables can be described as russel and norvig 2003 1 f r r j r f r j n r j n 1 r j 1 which using the chain rule in the probability theory can be reorganized to madadgar and moradkhani 2013 2 f r j n r j n 1 r j 1 f r j n r j n 1 r j 1 f r j n 1 r j 1 the joint density function f in eq 2 can then be modeled using copulas 2 3 copulas copulas are mathematical functions that describe the dependence structure between two or more time independent random variables regardless of their marginal distributions joe 2014 a bivariate copula informally defined maps from a space i i i 0 1 to the space i nelsen 2007 if f 1 r 1 u 1 and f 2 r 2 u 2 are marginal distributions of random variables r 1 and r 2 according to sklar s theorem sklar 1959 there is a copula that explains their multivariate cumulative distribution function 3 f r 1 r 2 c f 1 r 1 f 2 r 2 c u 1 u 2 and the copula function c is unique if the marginal distributions f 1 and f 2 are continuous the copula density function c can then be simply derived as sadegh et al 2018b 4 c u 1 u 2 2 c u 1 u 2 u 1 u 2 the joint density function can be decomposed as madadgar and moradkhani 2013 5 f r 1 r 2 c u 1 u 2 i 1 2 f i r i which reorganizes eq 2 to madadgar et al 2017 mazdiyasni et al 2017 6 f r 2 r 1 c u 1 u 2 f r 2 f r 1 f r 1 c u 1 u 2 f r 2 this framework can be readily extended to higher dimensions to find the best copula model to describe the dependence structure between ssl and discharge we employ the 26 copula families of the multivariate copula analysis toolbox mvcat sadegh et al 2017 namely 1 gaussian 2 t 3 clayton 4 frank 5 gumbel 6 independence 7 ali kikhail haq amh 8 joe 9 farlie gumbel morgenstern fgm 10 gumbel barnett 11 plackett 12 cuadras auge 13 raftery 14 shih louis 15 linear spearman 16 cubic 17 burr 18 nelsen 19 galambos 20 marshall olkin 21 fischer hinzmann 22 roch alegre 23 fischer kock 24 bb1 25 bb5 and 26 tawn copulas refer to table 1 of sadegh et al 2017 for more information also to find the best marginal distribution of the observed data r 1 and r 2 we use 17 different continuous marginal distribution functions including 1 beta 2 birnbaum saunders 3 exponential 4 extreme value 5 gamma 6 generalized extreme value 7 generalized pareto 8 inverse gaussian 9 logistic 10 log logistic 11 lognormal 12 nakagami 13 normal 14 rayleigh 15 rician 16 t location scale and 17 weibull distributions bowman and azzalini 1997 johnson et al 1993 1994 2 4 modeling ssl given discharge volume high flow events are major contributors 70 80 of the annual sediment yield of most basins chalov et al 2015 we therefore focused our attention on modeling the relationship between discharge volume and ssl during high flow events as defined by the daily discharge levels exceeding x th percentile of the long term discharge series we have considered different levels of x 65 th 70 th 90 th percentiles of discharge series and selected 70th percentile as a good representative for the threshold of high flows this threshold warrants that the high flow events are associated with a majority of the sediment load of the watersheds table 1 indeed 70 90 table 1 column 6 of annual suspended sediment yield of our case studies are transported in such events more in section 3 our proposed framework is graphically presented in fig 1 we first identify high flow events as defined by discharge above 70th percentile of historical flow record fig 1 1 and devise a set of discharge volumes and associated ssls from these events fig 1 2 we then fit marginal distributions to the ssl and discharge volume observations figs 1 3 1 and 3 2 which are in turn used in constructing copula models fig 1 4 we then using fitted marginal and copula models exploit eq 6 to derive the conditional marginal distribution of ssl given discharge volume fig 1 5 it is worth mentioning that we have carefully examined the high flow events for temporal independence each single event is at least two days apart from the following and preceding events the ssl associated with each flood event is estimated as total sediment load during the extended period of the event which includes one day before the start and one day after the finish date of the event discharge volume and ssl show significant inter dependency at 1 significance level as documented by the pearson correlation coefficient in table 1 last column it is also noteworthy that we have tested the historical data for hysteresis effects buendia et al 2016 sherriff et al 2016 and concluded that such effect is negligible given the watershed sizes and average annual discharge of the rivers table 1 column 5 3 case studies we test the capability of the proposed model fig 1 for prediction of ssl given discharge volumes over seven major rivers nine united states geological survey usgs stations geographically dispersed across the contiguous u s we carefully select stations obtained from the sediment portal of the usgs https cida usgs gov sediment with a historical record of at least 15 years of daily river discharge and ssl these stations are listed in table 1 and fig 2 displays their geographical locations in the u s as well as their long term daily river discharge and ssl observations it is noteworthy that usgs usually estimates ssl based on suspended sediment concentration ssc measurements ssc measurement and derivation of ssl as well as discharge measurement are prone to errors which in turn introduce a level of uncertainty to the modeling approach 4 results and discussion to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework the derived event based data are divided into calibration and evaluation periods with the calibration section including 70 of the record randomly selected and the evaluation section comprising of the rest of the record we then fit the proposed model eq 6 to the calibration data and evaluate the fitted model against the out of sample evaluation data in doing so the first step is to find the marginal distributions f 1 r 1 and f 2 r 2 that best fit the observed data r 1 and r 2 we fit the 17 aforementioned marginal distribution functions to the log transformed discharge r 1 and ssl r 2 observations sadegh et al 2018a and select the best model according to the bayesian information criterion bic as formulated by 7 bic n log i 1 n r j i r j i 2 n k log n in which n denotes the length of record k signifies the model s degrees of freedom and rj i and r j i are the i th elements of the modeled and observed values of the j th j 1 2 driver i e discharge and ssl respectively next step is to find the copula model c r 1 r 2 in eq 3 from the aforementioned 26 copula models that best describes the dependence structure of the two drivers in this study i e river discharge r 1 and ssl r 2 one approach to select the best bivariate model could be to find the copula function c r 1 r 2 with the best performance metric i e minimum bic an alternative approach could be selection of the copula model c r 1 r 2 that collectively with the marginal distribution function of ssl f 2 r 2 as characterized by the eq 6 yield the best prediction of ssl compared to the observed data both approaches merge to the selection of a common model mostly but we have adopted the latter method and selected a copula model c r 1 r 2 for which the most likely prediction of ssl mode in the conditional marginal distribution of eq 6 is closest to that of the observation as documented by the nash sutcliffe efficiency 8 nse 1 i 1 n r 2 i r 2 i 2 i 1 n r 2 i r 2 2 in which r 2 represents average value of the second driver i e ssl bic and nse hold properties that fit the interests of this study bic takes into account the length of record and model complexity to select the best model usually models with higher degrees of freedom are more flexible and hence tend to yield a closer fit to the observed data this however might result in overfitting the calibration data in which the model closely follows the observed data but fails to accurately describe the out of sample data record bic hence fairly compares the models with different degrees of freedom nse on the other hand scales the goodness of performance of the models into the interval of 1 for which nse 1 is associated with a perfect fit this helps us compare performance of the proposed model for different rivers table 2 lists the marginal distributions that best fit the log transformed discharge and ssl data for each of the nine usgs stations as well as the selected copula model interestingly the generalized pareto gp distribution is consistently selected to represent the discharge distribution except for the mississippi river i this selection is consistent with the literature that use the gp distribution to model hydroclimate variables above a certain threshold in our study 70th percentile of long term flow time series is selected as the threshold the ssl distribution however is represented by a variety of different distribution functions namely generalized extreme value gev generalized pareto gp gamma and inverse gaussian distribution functions for different stations as for the copula models placket seems to be more frequently selected but gumbel burr and galambos copulas are also used for some stations table 2 also presents the statistics of model performance for prediction of observed ssl values in terms of nse as well as the coverage and spread of the uncertainty ranges nse is calculated based on the divergence of the highest likely estimation of ssl from the observed value the results show good performance of the proposed model with nse values in the range of 0 7 to 0 9 for all the stations table 2 moreover the model prediction performance is consistent over the calibration and evaluation periods in terms of similar nses the coverage of the observed ssl within the 68 and 95 predictive uncertainty ranges along with the average width spread in terms of fraction of average annual ssl delivery of the uncertainty bounds are also presented in table 2 last eight columns as expected the coverage within the 68 and 95 uncertainty bounds fall in the vicinity of 68 and 95 this confirms that our methodology is indeed able to capture the overall behavior of the underlying data generating pdf fig 3 visually demonstrates ssl model simulations given discharge volume for the calibration data for all the nine usgs stations of this study high flow discharge volume x axis km3 and ssl y axis ton are both presented in log scale each vertical line represents the conditional marginal distribution of ssl for a given discharge volume as presented on the x axis color coded to display the density levels red sections represent higher density levels more likely whereas blue sections portray lower densities less likely as expected greater discharge volumes bigger high flow events are associated with larger ssl levels however the relationship between them is nonlinear for example see fig 3i these results display that the proposed modeling framework can closely track the ssl levels with highly likely ranges of prediction red section of the conditional marginal distribution covering the majority of observed ssls black dots it is also noticeable in this figure that the relationship between ssl and discharge volume is highly stochastic see fig 3e for example in which a similar discharge volume 0 4 km3 can yield hugely different ssls 2 10 4 10 5 the sedimentation processes are indeed dependent on several factors including the river shape the distribution of sediment particle size the heterogeneous spatio temporal characteristics of the watershed climate forcing availability of sediment load impacts of wildfires river flow energy to transport suspended sediment land cover and use and human activities among others asselman et al 2003 garcia 2008 gupta 2008 hall et al 2010 kuhnle et al 1996 while the impacts of such factors are captured in the constructed underlying data generating pdf our parsimonious framework condition ssl only on the discharge level and presents the impacts of the other determining factors as the uncertainty ranges around the most likely prediction in fact the hydrologic and hydraulic forces as represented by the proxy variable of discharge volume play a major role in generating and transporting sediment loads and hence our simplification is quite pragmatic future studies will focus on extending the conditional framework to include states of the system such as burned area and seasonality impacts to elaborate the concept of model prediction in terms of conditional marginal distribution fig 4 displays the estimated distribution of ssl at a discharge volume of 1 km3 for all the studied stations in other words this figure shows the probabilistic prediction of suspended sediment delivery as defined by accumulated suspended sediment load passing a specific cross section of a river garcia 2008 given a high flow event with 1 km3 volume the suspended sediment delivery at the lower station a on the colorado river for example is one order of magnitude larger than that of the upper station b for a high flow event of 1 km3 in volume 0 5 106 vs 0 5 107 ton different factors play into this behavior station a is downstream of station b and some branches of the colorado river such as the green river discharge significant quantities of sediment to the river in between these two cross sections andrews 1991 moreover although upstream sediment load could be deposited along the river bed between points a and b likelihood of such behavior is minimal given the high energy level of the high flow events in fact not only they have enough energy to transport upstream sediment loads to the downstream but also flood events could prompt suspension of the bed materials garcia 2008 note that the study period for station a is bound between 1930 and 1962 before the construction of the glen canyon dam lake powell which significantly changed the behavior of the colorado river the conditional marginal distributions also provide insights into the likelihood of ssl levels highest likely ssl level for the missouri river f for example has a density of 0 95 which holds a higher confidence degree compared to that of the arkansas river h with a density of 0 4 higher confidence is associated with lower variance in the distributions indeed the ssl distribution of the missouri river f is least scattered compared to the other cases note that the scatter of ssl distributions might significantly change at a different high flow volume level see fig 3c for example furthermore while most of the predictive distribution forms are close to gaussian those of the upper mississippi river c and the hudson river d are skewed to the left and the ssl distribution of the middle mississippi river i is skewed to the right finally fig 5 depicts the conditional marginal distributions of ssl for the out of sample evaluation data for the nine stations of this study these results confirm our previous claim table 2 that the performance of the proposed model is consistent for the calibration and the evaluation sections compare figs 4 and dummytxdummy 6 an interesting observation here is that the uncertainty span of ssl predictions for smaller and larger high flow events in terms of discharge volumes for each station are considerably higher than that of the medium range high flow events the smaller events might include flash floods as a result of relatively large quantities of precipitation over a short period of time sediment generation of which is highly dependent on the seasonality of the event as well as the availability of sediment for erosion for example majority of the hudson river s d watershed area 68 phillips and hanchar 1996 is covered by forest which during spring and summer yields lower sediment load and during fall yields more another example is the colorado river a b watershed which experiences significant number of wildfires throughout the dry summer and fall months this can potentially prompt generation of large quantities of sediment with precipitation over the burned area wohl et al 1998 one potential approach is to perform this study at seasonal scale to diminish such impacts but the drawback is that some seasons may not hold a long enough record to do the analysis the larger extreme events are generally difficult to model in the field of environmental science sadegh and vrugt 2013 sadegh et al 2016 sadegh and vrugt 2014 indeed these events are rare and usually there is not enough data to sufficiently constrain the components of the model associated with them results for the upper mississippi c and sacramento e rivers however contradict this finding the upper mississippi river holds a peculiar characteristic with a watershed and a river bed that can store and remobilize sediment with a lag time of several years to decades initiative 1993 this basin wide property makes it very difficult to model the sedimentation processes in this section of the mississippi river however it is the choice of the burr copula model that dominates the uncertainty ranges for prediction of ssl for larger high flow events in this case figures s31 35 supplementary materials show the uncertainty bounds of the marginal distributions of ssl for large flood events are indeed very wide using gaussian clayton frank gumbel and amh copulas as previously discussed we select the copula model to maximize the nse performance metric for the best ssl prediction without recourse to the uncertainty levels this depicts the importance of the choice of model as well as the significance of the selection metric the sacramento river s fig 5e sediment yield is sourced from agricultural activities in the watershed the bankline shifts of the river and the wildfire induced sediment load among others hall et al 2010 we hypothesize that the larger high flow events are bounded by the sediment availability in the watershed and hence show a lower uncertainty range for the prediction of ssl this hypothesis is however to be tested in future detailed studies our relative confidence in such hypothesis stems from the conditional marginal distributions of ssl that are skewed to the left for the large high flow events 10 km3 the smaller high flow events 0 2 km3 for this river on the contrary have conditional marginal distributions of ssl that are skewed to the right this might suggest the availability of sediment load but the lack of energy in the small high flow event to transport the sediment load the ssl s conditional distribution form for the mid sized high flow events 0 2 10 km3 in the sacramento river e as well as for most of the high flow events for other rivers is close to normal one remark is due here that the proposed framework requires the underlying data generating process to be stationary indeed most of the environmental modeling practices assume by default that the behavior of the studied processes are time invariant and vary around a constant mean value with a fixed variance and serial correlation structure clarke 2007 this assumption is convenient and opens an arsenal of statistical and numerical frameworks for environmental modeling sadegh et al 2015 we have carefully examined the selected rivers for stationarity assumption in the period of study indeed none of these cases have undergone significant development in the period of observation however time series of the sacramento e and san joaquin g rivers might suggest that some watershed management practices have been employed in the recent decades fig 2 while we don t have physical evidence to prove these two rivers has endured nonstationarity we hypothesize the wide uncertainty ranges of the ssl predictions for these two rivers average 95 predictive uncertainty spread of 2 6 and 9 average annual sediment yield for the sacramento and san joaquin rivers table 2 might be partly influenced by the anthropogenic interventions in the sediment generation processes to wrap up sedimentation processes are stochastic in nature and a stochastic framework is hence required to adequately capture the system behavior and explain the underlying uncertainties in this paper we propose a probabilistic modeling scheme that can accurately and precisely predict the suspended sediment load and its uncertainty ranges in alluvial rivers the proposed approach is a data driven model which requires long term observations of ssl and discharge this drawback is however shadowed by relaxing the need for detailed physical characteristics of the watershed and by diminishing the computational burden of physics based models modeling the sediment load in rivers is of paramount importance in the field of environmental engineering and science belmont et al 2011 as moderate concentrations of fine sediment deliver important nutrient loads to the aquatic biota and the downstream agricultural sector mohajeri et al 2016

789,sediment is a major source of non point pollution suspended sediment can transport nutrients toxicants and pesticides and can contribute to eutrophication of rivers and lakes modeling suspended sediment in rivers is of particular importance in the field of environmental science and engineering however understanding and quantifying nonlinear interactions between river discharge and sediment dynamics has always been a challenge in this paper we introduce a parsimonious probabilistic model to describe the relationship between suspended sediment load ssl and discharge volume this model rooted in multivariate probability theory and bayesian network infers conditional marginal distribution of ssl for a given discharge level the proposed framework relaxes the need for detailed information about the physical characteristics of the watershed climatic forcings and the nature of rainfall runoff transformation by drawing samples from the probability distribution functions pdfs of the underlying process here discharge and ssl data discharge and ssl pdfs can be simplified into a joint distribution that describes the relationship between ssl and discharge in which the latter acts as a proxy for different predictors of ssl the joint distribution is created based on historical discharge and ssl data and stores information about the discharge ssl relationship and sediment transport process of the watershed of interest we test this framework for seven major rivers in the u s results of which show promising performance to predict ssl and its likelihood given different discharge levels keywords sediment transport suspended sediment load stochastic modeling copula uncertainty analysis 1 introduction understanding and quantifying nonlinear interactions between river discharge and sediment dynamics and its short and long term impacts on the river morphology and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is challenging given the heterogeneity of watersheds stochastic nature of turbulent flow and characteristics of erosion processes garcia 2008 malmon et al 2002 sediment transport and deposition can induce major environmental problems such as deteriorating aquatic habitat and surface water quality filling reservoirs redirecting the course of streams widening floodplains of rivers and destroying buildings and properties best and bristow 1993 morris and fan 1998 parker and ikeda 1989 hence understanding and modeling sedimentation processes in streams and rivers is important in different fields of study including environmental quality and resource management river management and river transportation aytek and kişi 2008 lovejoy et al 1997 schumm et al 1984 sediment transport can occur in two general forms 1 suspended load and 2 bed load which in great part depends on sediment particle size distribution garcia 2008 for example cohesive clay particles form consolidated particles which can increase critical shear stress and subsequently fall velocity of the consolidated particles berlamont et al 1993 this property decreases sediment transport rate and hence lessen suspended sediment concentration wiberg and smith 1987 on the other hand silt particles have lower fall velocity compared to the consolidated clay particles silt is usually eroded from watershed surface and is dominantly transported as suspended load in rivers bagnold 1962 sand contents on the contrary mostly source from the river bed and their suspension depends on discharge value and shape of the river garcia 2008 moreover land use and cover can also affect sediment transport urban land cover for example can augment impervious area and increase flood peaks which in turn decreases erosion at the source but enhances suspension of bed load wolman 1967 agricultural land use can also increase watershed s sediment yield as a result of removing natural vegetal cover and disturbing soil surface walling 1999 on the contrary forest can protect land surface from erosion and diminish soil mobility leopold 1968 these parameters along with flow shear stress govern sediment transport in rivers yang 1996 sediment transport modeling is commonly interconnected to hydraulic engineering yang 1996 traditionally physical models have been used to tackle this challenge van rijn 1984 vanoni 2006 but more recently computational and empirical models have gained popularity with the advancement of computational power garcia 2008 morgan et al 1998 warner et al 2008 also black box approaches such as artificial intelligence techniques and machine learning algorithms have recently been used in various fields of environmental modeling including sediment transport cobaner et al 2009 kisi et al 2012 stochastic approaches for modeling sediment transport and yield however received less attention and were only sparsely used to account for processes related to rivers hydraulic properties such as turbulence effect on incipient motion of bed load material particle motion on a mobile bed and particle trajectory estimation kleinhans and van rijn 2002 lisle et al 1998 van rijn et al 1993 in this study we introduce a stochastic approach for modeling suspended sediment load ssl in alluvial rivers this event based probabilistic approach draws insights from the multivariate probability theory and bayesian networks and estimates the conditional marginal distribution of ssl in a high flow event given the discharge volume ssl consists of wash load from upstream erosion and suspended bed load which are both dependent on stochastic processes such as flow turbulence and precipitation intensity energy and angle among others garcia 2008 ssl is highly interrelated with high flow volume chalov et al 2015 in fact a majority of watersheds sediment yield is transported during flood events rankl 2004 we model this correlation structure using copulas and exploit this dependence structure to estimate ssl based on discharge volume this approach has a sound probabilistic basis and estimates likelihood of different ssl levels which in turn provides insights for uncertainty quantification of predictions the proposed approach characterizes the underlying data generating probability distribution function pdf from which random samples are drawn to construct the conditional marginal distribution of ssl the underlying data generating pdf is constructed from historical observed data and stores key components of the watersheds sedimentation processes such as slope vegetation cover and soil characteristics among others this framework not only relaxes the need for detailed information about watershed characteristics and climatic forcing but also requires a significantly lower computational cost to model ssl compared to its computational and physical counterparts note that in this study the joint distribution of ssl and discharge has been exploited given the availability of long term observations of both variables one may construct the joint distribution of ssl discharge velocity profile and pressure field among others and condition the marginal distribution of ssl on multiple drivers for a more confined uncertainty range however lack of long term observation of such detailed information might be prohibitive 2 methodology 2 1 stochastic modeling of environmental processes environmental models strive to capture response of a system to some drivers which might not be necessarily unique sadegh et al 2018a if the relationship between observed inputs r r 1 r 2 r n states x and system response y is stochastic the modeling approach should also be stochastic indeed most environmental modeling frameworks should adopt a stochastic nature considering the random characteristics of the measurement errors the underlying data generating process for an environmental system then can be described as a conditional pdf f y x r derived from the joint pdf f y x r constrained by the conservation principles and the physical limitations of the system bulygina and gupta 2009 2010 bulygina et al 2009 2011 2 2 bayesian network we can employ bayesian networks bns to derive the underlying data generating conditional pdf f for environmental modeling bns are probabilistic graphical models that describe a set of random variables r and their conditional dependencies f ri rj through a directed acyclic graph thulasiraman and swamy 1992 the joint density function f of random variables r that collectively form a bn given an ordering similar to that of the parent variables can be described as russel and norvig 2003 1 f r r j r f r j n r j n 1 r j 1 which using the chain rule in the probability theory can be reorganized to madadgar and moradkhani 2013 2 f r j n r j n 1 r j 1 f r j n r j n 1 r j 1 f r j n 1 r j 1 the joint density function f in eq 2 can then be modeled using copulas 2 3 copulas copulas are mathematical functions that describe the dependence structure between two or more time independent random variables regardless of their marginal distributions joe 2014 a bivariate copula informally defined maps from a space i i i 0 1 to the space i nelsen 2007 if f 1 r 1 u 1 and f 2 r 2 u 2 are marginal distributions of random variables r 1 and r 2 according to sklar s theorem sklar 1959 there is a copula that explains their multivariate cumulative distribution function 3 f r 1 r 2 c f 1 r 1 f 2 r 2 c u 1 u 2 and the copula function c is unique if the marginal distributions f 1 and f 2 are continuous the copula density function c can then be simply derived as sadegh et al 2018b 4 c u 1 u 2 2 c u 1 u 2 u 1 u 2 the joint density function can be decomposed as madadgar and moradkhani 2013 5 f r 1 r 2 c u 1 u 2 i 1 2 f i r i which reorganizes eq 2 to madadgar et al 2017 mazdiyasni et al 2017 6 f r 2 r 1 c u 1 u 2 f r 2 f r 1 f r 1 c u 1 u 2 f r 2 this framework can be readily extended to higher dimensions to find the best copula model to describe the dependence structure between ssl and discharge we employ the 26 copula families of the multivariate copula analysis toolbox mvcat sadegh et al 2017 namely 1 gaussian 2 t 3 clayton 4 frank 5 gumbel 6 independence 7 ali kikhail haq amh 8 joe 9 farlie gumbel morgenstern fgm 10 gumbel barnett 11 plackett 12 cuadras auge 13 raftery 14 shih louis 15 linear spearman 16 cubic 17 burr 18 nelsen 19 galambos 20 marshall olkin 21 fischer hinzmann 22 roch alegre 23 fischer kock 24 bb1 25 bb5 and 26 tawn copulas refer to table 1 of sadegh et al 2017 for more information also to find the best marginal distribution of the observed data r 1 and r 2 we use 17 different continuous marginal distribution functions including 1 beta 2 birnbaum saunders 3 exponential 4 extreme value 5 gamma 6 generalized extreme value 7 generalized pareto 8 inverse gaussian 9 logistic 10 log logistic 11 lognormal 12 nakagami 13 normal 14 rayleigh 15 rician 16 t location scale and 17 weibull distributions bowman and azzalini 1997 johnson et al 1993 1994 2 4 modeling ssl given discharge volume high flow events are major contributors 70 80 of the annual sediment yield of most basins chalov et al 2015 we therefore focused our attention on modeling the relationship between discharge volume and ssl during high flow events as defined by the daily discharge levels exceeding x th percentile of the long term discharge series we have considered different levels of x 65 th 70 th 90 th percentiles of discharge series and selected 70th percentile as a good representative for the threshold of high flows this threshold warrants that the high flow events are associated with a majority of the sediment load of the watersheds table 1 indeed 70 90 table 1 column 6 of annual suspended sediment yield of our case studies are transported in such events more in section 3 our proposed framework is graphically presented in fig 1 we first identify high flow events as defined by discharge above 70th percentile of historical flow record fig 1 1 and devise a set of discharge volumes and associated ssls from these events fig 1 2 we then fit marginal distributions to the ssl and discharge volume observations figs 1 3 1 and 3 2 which are in turn used in constructing copula models fig 1 4 we then using fitted marginal and copula models exploit eq 6 to derive the conditional marginal distribution of ssl given discharge volume fig 1 5 it is worth mentioning that we have carefully examined the high flow events for temporal independence each single event is at least two days apart from the following and preceding events the ssl associated with each flood event is estimated as total sediment load during the extended period of the event which includes one day before the start and one day after the finish date of the event discharge volume and ssl show significant inter dependency at 1 significance level as documented by the pearson correlation coefficient in table 1 last column it is also noteworthy that we have tested the historical data for hysteresis effects buendia et al 2016 sherriff et al 2016 and concluded that such effect is negligible given the watershed sizes and average annual discharge of the rivers table 1 column 5 3 case studies we test the capability of the proposed model fig 1 for prediction of ssl given discharge volumes over seven major rivers nine united states geological survey usgs stations geographically dispersed across the contiguous u s we carefully select stations obtained from the sediment portal of the usgs https cida usgs gov sediment with a historical record of at least 15 years of daily river discharge and ssl these stations are listed in table 1 and fig 2 displays their geographical locations in the u s as well as their long term daily river discharge and ssl observations it is noteworthy that usgs usually estimates ssl based on suspended sediment concentration ssc measurements ssc measurement and derivation of ssl as well as discharge measurement are prone to errors which in turn introduce a level of uncertainty to the modeling approach 4 results and discussion to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework the derived event based data are divided into calibration and evaluation periods with the calibration section including 70 of the record randomly selected and the evaluation section comprising of the rest of the record we then fit the proposed model eq 6 to the calibration data and evaluate the fitted model against the out of sample evaluation data in doing so the first step is to find the marginal distributions f 1 r 1 and f 2 r 2 that best fit the observed data r 1 and r 2 we fit the 17 aforementioned marginal distribution functions to the log transformed discharge r 1 and ssl r 2 observations sadegh et al 2018a and select the best model according to the bayesian information criterion bic as formulated by 7 bic n log i 1 n r j i r j i 2 n k log n in which n denotes the length of record k signifies the model s degrees of freedom and rj i and r j i are the i th elements of the modeled and observed values of the j th j 1 2 driver i e discharge and ssl respectively next step is to find the copula model c r 1 r 2 in eq 3 from the aforementioned 26 copula models that best describes the dependence structure of the two drivers in this study i e river discharge r 1 and ssl r 2 one approach to select the best bivariate model could be to find the copula function c r 1 r 2 with the best performance metric i e minimum bic an alternative approach could be selection of the copula model c r 1 r 2 that collectively with the marginal distribution function of ssl f 2 r 2 as characterized by the eq 6 yield the best prediction of ssl compared to the observed data both approaches merge to the selection of a common model mostly but we have adopted the latter method and selected a copula model c r 1 r 2 for which the most likely prediction of ssl mode in the conditional marginal distribution of eq 6 is closest to that of the observation as documented by the nash sutcliffe efficiency 8 nse 1 i 1 n r 2 i r 2 i 2 i 1 n r 2 i r 2 2 in which r 2 represents average value of the second driver i e ssl bic and nse hold properties that fit the interests of this study bic takes into account the length of record and model complexity to select the best model usually models with higher degrees of freedom are more flexible and hence tend to yield a closer fit to the observed data this however might result in overfitting the calibration data in which the model closely follows the observed data but fails to accurately describe the out of sample data record bic hence fairly compares the models with different degrees of freedom nse on the other hand scales the goodness of performance of the models into the interval of 1 for which nse 1 is associated with a perfect fit this helps us compare performance of the proposed model for different rivers table 2 lists the marginal distributions that best fit the log transformed discharge and ssl data for each of the nine usgs stations as well as the selected copula model interestingly the generalized pareto gp distribution is consistently selected to represent the discharge distribution except for the mississippi river i this selection is consistent with the literature that use the gp distribution to model hydroclimate variables above a certain threshold in our study 70th percentile of long term flow time series is selected as the threshold the ssl distribution however is represented by a variety of different distribution functions namely generalized extreme value gev generalized pareto gp gamma and inverse gaussian distribution functions for different stations as for the copula models placket seems to be more frequently selected but gumbel burr and galambos copulas are also used for some stations table 2 also presents the statistics of model performance for prediction of observed ssl values in terms of nse as well as the coverage and spread of the uncertainty ranges nse is calculated based on the divergence of the highest likely estimation of ssl from the observed value the results show good performance of the proposed model with nse values in the range of 0 7 to 0 9 for all the stations table 2 moreover the model prediction performance is consistent over the calibration and evaluation periods in terms of similar nses the coverage of the observed ssl within the 68 and 95 predictive uncertainty ranges along with the average width spread in terms of fraction of average annual ssl delivery of the uncertainty bounds are also presented in table 2 last eight columns as expected the coverage within the 68 and 95 uncertainty bounds fall in the vicinity of 68 and 95 this confirms that our methodology is indeed able to capture the overall behavior of the underlying data generating pdf fig 3 visually demonstrates ssl model simulations given discharge volume for the calibration data for all the nine usgs stations of this study high flow discharge volume x axis km3 and ssl y axis ton are both presented in log scale each vertical line represents the conditional marginal distribution of ssl for a given discharge volume as presented on the x axis color coded to display the density levels red sections represent higher density levels more likely whereas blue sections portray lower densities less likely as expected greater discharge volumes bigger high flow events are associated with larger ssl levels however the relationship between them is nonlinear for example see fig 3i these results display that the proposed modeling framework can closely track the ssl levels with highly likely ranges of prediction red section of the conditional marginal distribution covering the majority of observed ssls black dots it is also noticeable in this figure that the relationship between ssl and discharge volume is highly stochastic see fig 3e for example in which a similar discharge volume 0 4 km3 can yield hugely different ssls 2 10 4 10 5 the sedimentation processes are indeed dependent on several factors including the river shape the distribution of sediment particle size the heterogeneous spatio temporal characteristics of the watershed climate forcing availability of sediment load impacts of wildfires river flow energy to transport suspended sediment land cover and use and human activities among others asselman et al 2003 garcia 2008 gupta 2008 hall et al 2010 kuhnle et al 1996 while the impacts of such factors are captured in the constructed underlying data generating pdf our parsimonious framework condition ssl only on the discharge level and presents the impacts of the other determining factors as the uncertainty ranges around the most likely prediction in fact the hydrologic and hydraulic forces as represented by the proxy variable of discharge volume play a major role in generating and transporting sediment loads and hence our simplification is quite pragmatic future studies will focus on extending the conditional framework to include states of the system such as burned area and seasonality impacts to elaborate the concept of model prediction in terms of conditional marginal distribution fig 4 displays the estimated distribution of ssl at a discharge volume of 1 km3 for all the studied stations in other words this figure shows the probabilistic prediction of suspended sediment delivery as defined by accumulated suspended sediment load passing a specific cross section of a river garcia 2008 given a high flow event with 1 km3 volume the suspended sediment delivery at the lower station a on the colorado river for example is one order of magnitude larger than that of the upper station b for a high flow event of 1 km3 in volume 0 5 106 vs 0 5 107 ton different factors play into this behavior station a is downstream of station b and some branches of the colorado river such as the green river discharge significant quantities of sediment to the river in between these two cross sections andrews 1991 moreover although upstream sediment load could be deposited along the river bed between points a and b likelihood of such behavior is minimal given the high energy level of the high flow events in fact not only they have enough energy to transport upstream sediment loads to the downstream but also flood events could prompt suspension of the bed materials garcia 2008 note that the study period for station a is bound between 1930 and 1962 before the construction of the glen canyon dam lake powell which significantly changed the behavior of the colorado river the conditional marginal distributions also provide insights into the likelihood of ssl levels highest likely ssl level for the missouri river f for example has a density of 0 95 which holds a higher confidence degree compared to that of the arkansas river h with a density of 0 4 higher confidence is associated with lower variance in the distributions indeed the ssl distribution of the missouri river f is least scattered compared to the other cases note that the scatter of ssl distributions might significantly change at a different high flow volume level see fig 3c for example furthermore while most of the predictive distribution forms are close to gaussian those of the upper mississippi river c and the hudson river d are skewed to the left and the ssl distribution of the middle mississippi river i is skewed to the right finally fig 5 depicts the conditional marginal distributions of ssl for the out of sample evaluation data for the nine stations of this study these results confirm our previous claim table 2 that the performance of the proposed model is consistent for the calibration and the evaluation sections compare figs 4 and dummytxdummy 6 an interesting observation here is that the uncertainty span of ssl predictions for smaller and larger high flow events in terms of discharge volumes for each station are considerably higher than that of the medium range high flow events the smaller events might include flash floods as a result of relatively large quantities of precipitation over a short period of time sediment generation of which is highly dependent on the seasonality of the event as well as the availability of sediment for erosion for example majority of the hudson river s d watershed area 68 phillips and hanchar 1996 is covered by forest which during spring and summer yields lower sediment load and during fall yields more another example is the colorado river a b watershed which experiences significant number of wildfires throughout the dry summer and fall months this can potentially prompt generation of large quantities of sediment with precipitation over the burned area wohl et al 1998 one potential approach is to perform this study at seasonal scale to diminish such impacts but the drawback is that some seasons may not hold a long enough record to do the analysis the larger extreme events are generally difficult to model in the field of environmental science sadegh and vrugt 2013 sadegh et al 2016 sadegh and vrugt 2014 indeed these events are rare and usually there is not enough data to sufficiently constrain the components of the model associated with them results for the upper mississippi c and sacramento e rivers however contradict this finding the upper mississippi river holds a peculiar characteristic with a watershed and a river bed that can store and remobilize sediment with a lag time of several years to decades initiative 1993 this basin wide property makes it very difficult to model the sedimentation processes in this section of the mississippi river however it is the choice of the burr copula model that dominates the uncertainty ranges for prediction of ssl for larger high flow events in this case figures s31 35 supplementary materials show the uncertainty bounds of the marginal distributions of ssl for large flood events are indeed very wide using gaussian clayton frank gumbel and amh copulas as previously discussed we select the copula model to maximize the nse performance metric for the best ssl prediction without recourse to the uncertainty levels this depicts the importance of the choice of model as well as the significance of the selection metric the sacramento river s fig 5e sediment yield is sourced from agricultural activities in the watershed the bankline shifts of the river and the wildfire induced sediment load among others hall et al 2010 we hypothesize that the larger high flow events are bounded by the sediment availability in the watershed and hence show a lower uncertainty range for the prediction of ssl this hypothesis is however to be tested in future detailed studies our relative confidence in such hypothesis stems from the conditional marginal distributions of ssl that are skewed to the left for the large high flow events 10 km3 the smaller high flow events 0 2 km3 for this river on the contrary have conditional marginal distributions of ssl that are skewed to the right this might suggest the availability of sediment load but the lack of energy in the small high flow event to transport the sediment load the ssl s conditional distribution form for the mid sized high flow events 0 2 10 km3 in the sacramento river e as well as for most of the high flow events for other rivers is close to normal one remark is due here that the proposed framework requires the underlying data generating process to be stationary indeed most of the environmental modeling practices assume by default that the behavior of the studied processes are time invariant and vary around a constant mean value with a fixed variance and serial correlation structure clarke 2007 this assumption is convenient and opens an arsenal of statistical and numerical frameworks for environmental modeling sadegh et al 2015 we have carefully examined the selected rivers for stationarity assumption in the period of study indeed none of these cases have undergone significant development in the period of observation however time series of the sacramento e and san joaquin g rivers might suggest that some watershed management practices have been employed in the recent decades fig 2 while we don t have physical evidence to prove these two rivers has endured nonstationarity we hypothesize the wide uncertainty ranges of the ssl predictions for these two rivers average 95 predictive uncertainty spread of 2 6 and 9 average annual sediment yield for the sacramento and san joaquin rivers table 2 might be partly influenced by the anthropogenic interventions in the sediment generation processes to wrap up sedimentation processes are stochastic in nature and a stochastic framework is hence required to adequately capture the system behavior and explain the underlying uncertainties in this paper we propose a probabilistic modeling scheme that can accurately and precisely predict the suspended sediment load and its uncertainty ranges in alluvial rivers the proposed approach is a data driven model which requires long term observations of ssl and discharge this drawback is however shadowed by relaxing the need for detailed physical characteristics of the watershed and by diminishing the computational burden of physics based models modeling the sediment load in rivers is of paramount importance in the field of environmental engineering and science belmont et al 2011 as moderate concentrations of fine sediment deliver important nutrient loads to the aquatic biota and the downstream agricultural sector mohajeri et al 2016 but excessive concentrations of sediment inflict detrimental environmental impacts heppell et al 2009 wood and armitage 1997 indeed excessive nutrients may prompt algal blooms reduce dissolved oxygen harm aquatic life and limit the recreational services of the bodies of water wohl et al 1998 sediments also transport pesticides toxicants salts and heavy metals to the downstream river and lake habitats mussetter engineering 2000 5 conclusion accurate modeling of sediment transport and characterizing its underlying uncertainties in alluvial rivers has historically been a challenge sediment is not only a non point source of pollution but it also transports pesticides toxicants and heavy metals numerical models of sediment transport are computationally demanding and require large amounts of data that are often not available here we have introduced a stochastic framework rooted in the multivariate probability theory and bayesian network to model suspended sediment load ssl in rivers the majority of the annual sediment load of rivers 70 90 is transported in high flow events and hence the ssl and discharge volume are highly interdependent we exploit their dependence structure to estimate ssl based on discharge volume as the predictor this event based approach approximates the conditional marginal distribution of ssl for any given high flow volume the proposed model characterizes the likelihood of the ssl prediction and pinpoints the modeling uncertainties the presented framework relaxes the need for detailed information about the physical characteristics of the watershed and river system and employs a parsimonious model to describe the highly nonlinear relationship between discharge and ssl we have tested this approach for nine usgs stations the results of
