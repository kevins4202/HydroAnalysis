19625,magnetic fe3o4 bioi agi fba spheres were synthesized through a multi step process the fabricated photocatalysts were characterized by different techniques to testify the visible light driven photocatalytic activity of fba rhodamine b and bisphenol a were chosen as model common and emerging organic contaminants respectively while gram negative strain escherichia coli was selected as model waterborne bacteria the results showed that under visible light irradiation fba contained strong photocatalytic degradation capacity towards both rhb and bpa moreover fba was also found to exhibit excellent disinfection activity towards e coli the photocatalytic mechanisms for different pollutants by fba were determined and found to vary for different pollutants specifically scavenger experiments degradation intermediates determination as well as theoretical density functional theory dft analysis showed that rhb and bpa were degraded via photosensitization dominated by e and o2 and direct photocatalytic oxidation contributed by h e and o2 respectively whereas e coli cells yet were found to be inactivated by the generation of e and o2 rather than by the released ag since it contained superparamagnetic property fba could be easily separated from the reaction suspension after use due to the excellent photo stability fba exhibited strong photocatalytic activity in the fourth reused recycle therefore fba could serve as a promising alternative for water purification graphical abstract image 1 keywords fe3o4 bioi agi photocatalytic activity degradation kinetics of rhb and bpa bacterial disinfection active species reusability 1 introduction due to the potential in solving energy crisis and water pollution problems semiconductor photocatalysis has been regarded as one of the most fascinating technologies in the field of water decontamination in the past decades hoffmann et al 1995 traditional tio2 particles exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity in the degradation of various organic pollutants as well as microbe disinfection paramasivam et al 2012 verma et al 2014 however the wide band gap of tio2 particles limited their performance associated with visible light application pelaez et al 2012 in order to utilize solar energy great efforts have been devoted to develop semiconductors with narrow band gap in the past years a variety of visible light driven vld photocatalysts including tio2 based goei and lim 2014 jin et al 2013 bi based cheng et al 2013 liang et al 2015 wu et al 2015 c3n4 based deng et al 2017 li et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 as well as different kinds of heterojunctions cai et al 2017 cheng et al 2011 liang et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 thus were developed and demonstrated to be effective in water purification owing to the unique structure of alternate bi2o2 2 sheets with the x slabs and internal electric fields between positive and anionic slabs the photo generated charge carriers in bismuth oxyiodide bioi generated under visible light irradiation could be effectively separated liu et al 2014 bioi thus has recently drawn great attention in the field of vld photocatalytic water decontamination cheng et al 2014 cui et al 2017 wang et al 2014 to further improve the photocatalytic activity of bioi under visible light conditions bioi particles have been previously modified with different elemental doping such as ag doping chen et al 2013 cheng et al 2013 ti doping liang et al 2016b and br doping guo et al 2015 due to the enhanced separation of photo generated charge carriers in the hybrid photocatalysts agi particles have been widely employed to modify vld photocatalysts hu et al 2007 wang et al 2016a 2016b the photocatalytic activity of bioi could also be significantly enhanced by heterojunction with agi chen et al 2013 liang et al 2015 however it is difficult to recycle agi bioi from the reaction suspension after treatment when they were well dispersed into the water due to their convenient separation from water magnetic particles have been demonstrated to have great potentials for recycle and repeated utilization deng et al 2005 zhang et al 2014 it is expected that magnetic cores modified with agi bioi would not only contain strong photocatalytic activity but also could be easily recovered from solution after use by modifying cofe2o4 particles with agi bioi zhang et al 2017 recently fabricated magnetic agi bioi cofe2o4 hybrid composites however this previous study yet focused on the removal of hg0 by agi bioi cofe2o4 composite under fluorescent light fsl irradiation to the best of our knowledge superparamagnetic fe3o4 modified with bioi agi has never been fabricated and applied in the field of vld degradation of organic pollutants as well as bacteria disinfection herein this study is aimed to fabricate the novel photocatalyts i e superparamagnetic fe3o4 bioi agi fba spheres and to investigate the vld photocatalytic activity for water decontamination fba particles were successfully synthesized via a multi step method the vld photocatalytic activity of the as prepared photocatalysts were tested against degradation of model common organic pollutants rhodamine b rhb and model emerging organic contaminants bisphenol a bpa moreover the bacterial disinfection activity of fba was also examined by using escherichia coli e coli as model waterborne bacteria the mechanisms involved in the process of individual pollutant degradation disinfection were also systematically discussed we found that fba contained excellent photo stability and maintained high photocatalytic activity in four consecutive reused cycles fba fabricated in this study could be a promising alternative for water purification 2 material and methods 2 1 materials ferric chloride

aldrich 2 2 synthesis and characterization of fe3o4 bioi agi 2 2 1 fe3o4 nanoparticles the synthesis was carried out according to a previous study with slight modification deng et al 2005 in a typical procedure 2 7 g fecl3 6h2o 2 0 g peg 20000 and 4 34 g ch3coona were dissolved into 80 ml eg to form a transparent yellow solution then the mixture was transferred into a teflon lined autoclave to

into the mixture and mechanically stirred for 2 h the dark red products were magnetically collected and rinsed with deionized water and absolute ethyl alcohol for three times each then dried under vacuum at room temperature for 12 h pure bioi was also prepared via a similar procedure except for the absence of fe3o4 2 2 3 fe3o4 bioi agi fba microspheres agi was deposited on the surface of fb via

into the solution with ultrasonic treatment for 5 min the mixture was subsequently mechanically stirred for another 2 h the products were collected through the same method with fb agi bioi was also prepared by replacing pure bioi with fb and noted as ba 2 3 characterization the fabricated materials were characterized by powder x ray diffraction xrd x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps high resolution transmission electron microscope hrtem scanning electron microscope sem uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra drs brunauer emmett teller bet adsorption isotherm as well as hysteresis loop analysis the detailed information was provided in supplementary information 2 4 visible light driven photocatalytic performances the visible light driven photocatalytic activity of fba was investigated by the degradation of model common organic pollutants rhb and model emerging organic contaminants bpa moreover the bacterial disinfection activity of fba was also examined by using gram negative strain escherichia coli e coli as model waterborne bacteria the photocatalytic experiments were carried out using the devices shown in fig s1 a uv cutoff filter λ 400 nm was placed in the light path to exclude the uv portion of the light source xenon arc lamp 300 w cel hxf300 beijing jin yuan technology co the filtered light spectrum fig s2 confirmed that little uv light could pass the filter in addition the light intensity on the surface of the reaction suspension was measured to be 100 1 mw cm2 by a solar power meter tm 207 tenmars electronics co the temperature of the reaction system was maintain at 25 0 0 2 c by the circulating water between the double walls of the reaction beaker in a typical experiment 30 mg of the photocatalyst was added into 60 ml rhb 5 mg l or bpa 20 mg l aqueous solution prior to light irradiation the suspension was vigorously stirred for 30 min in the dark to achieve an adsorption desorption equilibrium preliminary experiments showed that 30 min was enough to obtain the adsorption desorption equilibrium the suspension was then exposed to visible light illumination under stirring at given intervals 2 ml of the solution was collected from the suspension and immediately filtrated by a 0 22 μm millipore membrane to remove suspended solids the concentration of rhb was determined by a uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 1800 via measuring the adsorption at 552 nm the concentration of bpa was determined by a high performance liquid chromatography agilent u3000 equipped with an agilent zorbax sb aq column 4 6 mm 250 mm 5 μm and a uv detector set at 276 nm the mobile phase was a mixture of acetonitrile and water 50 50 v v with a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 in the recycle experiments the photocatalysts were magnetically separated from the reaction suspension by an external magnetic field washed with deionized water and ethanol and then re dispersed in the fresh reaction suspensions for the subsequent cycle e coli atcc15597 was chosen as the model bacteria to test the photocatalytic disinfection activity of fba details about the preparation of bacterial stock suspensions could be found in our previous research liang et al 2016b as well as in the supplementary information the viable cell density of the e coli stock suspension was 3 0 109 colony forming unit per milliliter cfu ml 1 in a typical vld disinfection experiment 4 mg of photocatalyst was fully dispersed in 49 5 ml sterilized saline 15 mm nacl ph 7 with 10 min ultra sonication then 0 5 ml of e coli stock suspension was added into the suspension and the initial viable cell density was set to be 3 0 107 cfu ml 1 prior to the illumination the suspension was mechanically stirred for 5 min during the photocatalytic disinfection experiments 0 5 ml of the reaction suspension was withdrawn at given time intervals the viable cell density in each sample was determined by a plate counting method details about the plate counting method could be found in the supplementary information each set of the experiments was conducted in triplicate 2 5 photocatalytic mechanisms to determine the dominant reactive species involved in the photolytic processes a series of scavengers were individually added into the reaction suspensions to remove the corresponding active species briefly sodium oxalate na2c2o4 and isopropanol ipa were added to scavenge photo generated holes h and diffusing oh respectively cr vi and tempol were employed to remove photo generated electrons e and o2 respectively the scavengers used in the experiments were widely used in the photocatalytic system and non toxic to the bacterial cells chen et al 2011 zhang et al 2010 moreover the generation of o2 during the photocatalytic process were also detected by using nirtoblue tetrazolium nbt as probe molecules respectively details could be found in the supplementary information due to the intrinsic toxicity towards bacterial cells the concentration of bi3 fe3 as well as ag released by fba was detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms x series ii thermo scientific waltham ma usa samples for measurements were directly collected from the reaction suspension at given intervals and filtered by 0 22 μm millipore membranes before analyses to clarify the degradation pathway of rhb and bpa a liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms instrument equipped with an electrospray ionization esi source was applied and operated in the positive and negative ionization mode respectively in addition theoretical density functional theory dft analysis was also used to elucidate the exact photocatalytic degradation pathways of both rhb and bpa the detailed information could be found in the supplementary information to determine the mineralization of rhb and bpa during the photocatalytic process the total organic carbon toc of the reaction suspensions collected at different intervals were measured through combustion catalytic oxidation at 680 c by a toc meter toc lcph shimadzu japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the prepared photocatalysts the phase and crystal structure of the as synthesized photocatalysts were characterized by xrd analyses and the results were shown in fig s3 the xrd pattern of pure fe3o4 could be indexed to orthorhombic magnetite jcpds 75 1609 deng et al 2005 diffraction peaks at 2θ 30 1 35 5 43 1 57 1 and 62 6 corresponded to the planes of 112 103 004 321 and 224 respectively in addition to fe3o4 the strong characteristic diffraction peaks at 29 6 31 7 45 3 and 55 2 in the xrd pattern of fe3o4 bioi fb could be indexed to the 102 110 200 212 planes of tetragonal bioi jcpds 10 0445 which confirmed the successful deposition of bioi on the surface of magnetic cores in addition to bioi and fe3o4 the diffraction peaks corresponding to the hexagonal agi jcpds 09 0347 were also clearly displayed in the xrd pattern of fe3o4 bioi agi fba the width of the characteristic diffraction peak at 29 6 corresponding to the 102 plane of bioi was broadened during the ion exchange process the observation indicated the formation of agi bioi heterojunctions liang et al 2015 2016a no peak corresponding to impurities was detected suggesting that the as synthesized samples were of high purity the elemental composition and chemical state of the as prepared agi bioi ba fb and fba were characterized by xps analyses and the results were shown in fig s4 as shown in fig s4a peaks at around 159 ev and 164 ev were ascribed to bi 4f7 2 and bi 4f5 2 respectively which indicated the bismuth species in all three samples were bi3 ions cheng et al 2013 ye et al 2012 moreover the characteristic peaks located at 619 ev and 630 ev fig s4b could be indexed to i 3d5 2 and i 3d3 2 respectively which confirmed the existence of i ions in the high resolution xps spectra of ag only two peaks corresponding to the binding energy of ag 3d5 2 and ag 3d3 2 were observed fig s4c indicating that only one form of silver was presented since the presence of agi was confirmed by xrd analyses no elemental silver was formed in neither ba nor fba three peaks were present in the high resolution xps spectra of o 1s fig s4d which could be indexed to bi o fe o and surface adsorbed oh during the ion exchange process ag was deposited onto the surface of bioi by replacing the position of bio cheng et al 2011 thus the relative intensity of the peak corresponding to bi o in both ba and fba was significantly lower than that in fb the results above agreed well with our previous study and confirmed that the as synthesized fba contained the agi bioi heterojunction liang et al 2015 in addition to agi bioi only 8 72 atomic ratio of fe atoms were detected according to the xps spectrum of fe 2p in fba fig s4e the value was significantly lower than the theoretical content of fe3o4 since the xps analysis could only reveal the surface composition the observation indicated that the magnetic cores were well covered with agi bioi heterojunction the morphology and microstructure of fba were investigated by both sem and tem as shown in fig 1 a fba exhibited a morphology of microspheres with porous surfaces which consisted of numerous ultrathin bioi nano plates moreover agi nanospheres were found to be uniformly present on the surface of bioi fig 1b hrtem image of bioi nano plate showed clear lattice fringes with a spacing of 0 91 nm fig 1c which was in accordance with 001 planes of tetragonal bioi the thickness of the bioi nano plate was estimated to be around 20 nm fig 1d displayed a high resolution image of the nanospheres deposited on the surface of bioi nano plate the lattice fringes with a spacing of 0 23 nm were consistent with the 110 plane of β agi and the diameter of the agi nanospheres was around 40 nm the optical properties of the fabricated materials were characterized by uv drs analysis as shown in fig 2 a the adsorption edge of bioi was 665 nm and the band gap eg of bioi was calculated to be 1 68 ev using eq s1 which was consistent with previous studies cheng et al 2013 liang et al 2015 after the incorporation of fe3o4 nanoparticles the light absorbance of both bioi and agi bioi were significantly enhanced however it should be noted that the strong absorbance via the combination with fe3o4 was mainly due to the dmso d6 transitions of fe in the magnetic cores zhang et al 2014 which would not have contribution to the photocatalytic activity the observation suggested that photocatalysts were successfully anchored on the magnetic cores to investigate the structrual characteristics of the as prepared materials a nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm measurement was performed fb ba and fba displayed iv adsorption desorption isotherms with a type h3 hysteresis loop at a high relative pressure between 0 75 and 1 0 fig 2b which was consistent with the typical characteristics of mesoporous materials xiong et al 2016 the observation also corresponded to the porous hierarchical surface structure shown in fig 1 a and b the results of barrett joyner halenda bjh pore diameter analyses fig 2b inset showed that fb had two main pore diameter distribution peaks the small distribution peak at about 25 nm could be attributed to the intervals among the intercross bioi nano plates while the relative large pores were formed between the bioi nano plate and fe3o4 nanoparticles xia et al 2011 since the agi nanoparticles on the surface of bioi would partially block the mesopores the pore diameter of ba and fba were found to be larger than that of fb therefore the bet specific surface area of fb 42 6 m2 g was detected to be higher than that of fba 21 5 m2 g or ba 14 4 m2 g the magnetic hysteresis loops suggested that both fe3o4 and fba were superparamagnetic fig 2c the magnetic saturation ms values of fe3o4 and fba were determined to be 58 4 emu g 1 and 22 4 emu g 1 respectively the decreased ms value of fba could be attributed to the deposition of non magnetic agi bioi onto fe3o4 core the magnetic properties of fba could ensure its convenient and rapid separation from water in 2 min with a magnet fig s5 3 2 photocatalytic performances the vld photocatalytic activity of as prepared materials were evaluated towards different types of pollutants specifically rhb which could strongly absorb visible light irradiation and undergo either the direct photocatalytic or photosensitization process was employed as model common organic dyes hu et al 2014 xiong et al 2016 bpa the representative of the endocrine disruptors and e coli were chosen as model emerging contaminants zhang et al 2014 and model bacteria strain liang et al 2015 respectively 3 2 1 degradation of rhb the photocatalytic degradation kinetics of rhb by fe3o4 nanoparticles fb ba and fba were investigated and the results were displayed in fig 3 a it should be noted that preliminary adsorption experiments fig 3a inset showed that adsorption of rhb by all four types of particles reached equilibrium in 30 min thus prior to the photocatalytic experiments the adsorption experiments of rhb by four types of particles were conducted for 30 min under dark conditions obviously the adsorption of rhb by fe3o4 nanoparticles was negligible while fb ba and fba could remove a small portion of rhb moreover due to the relatively larger bet surface area the adsorption of rhb by fb was larger than ba or fba specifically the removal rate of rhb by fb was detected to be 29 while ba and fba could remove 13 and 17 of rhb respectively fig 3a inset under visible light irradiation the concentration of rhb did not decrease over time in the blank control experiment indicating that in the absence of photocatalysts rhb did not photolyze within the experimental duration under visible light irradiation negligible decrease of rhb concentration was obtained in the presence of fe3o4 nanoparticles after 60 min reaction indicating that fe3o4 particles did not contain photocatalytic activity for rhb degradation the observation was consistent with previous study li et al 2013 in contrast fb ba and fba could degrade rhb under visible light irradiation overall among all these three particles the photocatalytic performance of fba towards rhb was obviously the best specifically after 60 min irradiation over 92 of rhb was degraded by fba while only 44 3 and 74 of rhb was removed by fb and ba respectively although the adsorption capacity of fb was the highest the photocatalytic activity of fb towards rhb yet was lower than that of ba and fba the kinetics data of rhb degradation were fitted well with the pseudo first order model the pseudo first order kinetic constant k of fba was determined to be 3 36 10 2 min 1 which was about 7 5 times higher than that of fb 4 49 10 3 min 1 and 2 9 times of ba 1 14 10 2 min 1 fig 3b clearly under visible light irradiation fba was much more efficient to degrade rhb than fb and ba the above observation further confirmed the superior photocatalytic activity of agi bioi over pure bioi which could be attributed to the better separation of charge carriers by agi bioi heterojunction chen et al 2013 cheng et al 2013 liang et al 2015 ye et al 2012 in addition it is worth noting that the presence of magnetic particles could slightly enhance the photocatalytic activity of agi bioi as shown in fig 2a fe3o4 contained strong adsorption of visible light irradiation although it could not directly form reactive species on the surface of fe3o4 nanoparticles due to the dmso d6 transition mechanisms part of the photoinduced electrons generated by fe3o4 nanoparticles might transfer to the conduction band of bioi and further generated superoxide radicals thus the photocatalytic activity of fba was slightly enhanced relative to agi bioi the positive role of magnetic particles was also previously reported for magnetic bioi li et al 2013 to determine the mechanisms involved in the degradation of rhb by fba a series of scavengers were introduced into the reaction suspension to remove corresponding reactive species as shown in fig 3b and fig s6 the addition of tempol the scavenger of o2 and cr vi the scavenger of e significantly decreased the k value from 3 36 10 2 min 1 to 1 27 10 3 min 1 and 9 83 10 3 min 1 respectively the observation indicated that o2 and e played important roles in the degradation of rhb the generation of o2 was further confirmed by using nbt as a molecular probe fig s7 the addition of ipa oh scavenger did not have obvious effect on the degradation kinetic indicating that oh did not contribute to the rhb degradation when sodium oxalate h scavenger was added the degradation of rhb did not decrease yet it was enhanced indicating that h did not have contribution to the degradation process the recombination of h and e would be decreased due to the removal of h by the addition of sodium oxalate thus the amount of e available for rhb degradation would be increased as a result enhancement of rhb degradation was achieved with the presence of sodium oxalate h scavenger briefly o2 and e was found to be the dominant reactive species contributing to the photocatalytic degradation of rhb by fba it was well reported that the photocatalytic degradation of rhb mainly occurred via two competitive processes n demethylation and the destruction of the conjugated structure fu et al 2008 to clarify the degradation pathway temporal evolution of the spectral changes during the photocatalytic degradation of rhb were recorded during the degradation process the maximum adsorption peak of rhb exhibited an obvious hypsochromic shift fig s8a suggesting the formation of a series of n deethylated intermediates in a stepwise manner lei et al 2005 theoretical dft analysis also confirmed the as mentioned degradation mechanism fig 3c showed the natural population analysis npa charge distribution and fukui index representing radical attack f 0 of the atoms in rhb the red color degree in fig 3d provided different levels of f 0 and it suggested that the n1 and n1 in rhb with the highest values were the most reactive sites for radical attack moreover c4 was also a high reactive site besides the two n atoms and further attacked of rhb on c13 by radicals o2 in this study would lead to formation of ring open products fig 3d the generation of a series of n deethylated intermediates including der eer dr and er in the reaction system were also confirmed by lc ms analysis table s1 in addition the toc of the reaction suspension did not obviously decline within the experimental duration fig s9 which indicated that the conjugated structure of rhb was not broken during the photocatalysis process based on the observation above o2 dominated n deethylated process would be the main photocatalytic degradation mechanisms of rhb by fba rhb thus was degraded via a photosensitization process in a typical degradation process rhb molecules were firstly excited by photons into an excited state rhb and then injected the electrons to the conduction band of fba electrons were captured by o2 on the surface of fba to generate o2 which result into the degradation of rhb wang et al 2012 the scheme of rhb degradation process by fba was provided in fig s8b 3 2 2 degradation of bpa the degradation kinetics of bpa by the as prepared photocatalysts were investigated visible light condition and the results were displayed in fig 4 a preliminary adsorption experiments fig 4a inset showed that adsorption of bpa by fe3o4 nanoparticles fb ba and fba reached equilibrium in 30 min similar to rhb the adsorption experiments of bpa by four types of particles under dark conditions were conducted for 30 min prior to the photocatalytic experiments under visible light irradiation the removal rate of bpa via adsorption by fe3o4 nanoparticles fb ba and fba were found to be 0 11 4 and 5 respectively fig 4a inset under visible light irradiation blank control experiment showed that bpa would not degrade within the experimental duration without the presence of photocatalysts the presence of fe3o4 nanoparticles did not decrease the concentration of bpa over time indicating that fe3o4 nanoparticles did not contain photocatalytic activity towards bpa fig 4a in contrast ba fb and fba yet could efficiently degrade bpa with visible light irradiation specifically over 70 of bpa was photocatalytically removed by ba fb and fba after 50 min irradiation the pseudo first order kinetic constant of fba 2 79 10 2 min 1 yet was slightly greater than that of ba 2 56 10 2 min 1 or fb 2 51 10 2 min 1 the observation indicated that agi decoration also enhanced the degradation kinetics of bpa and the presence of fe3o4 nanoparticles did not affect the photocatalytic activity of fba to explore the degradation mechanisms the scavenger experiments were performed fig 4b and fig s10 showed that the introduction of sodium oxalate tempol and cr vi into the reaction suspension significantly decreased the k values specifically the k values decreased to 0 61 10 2 min 1 1 14 10 2 min 1 and 1 47 10 2 min 1 in the presence of sodium oxalate tempol and cr vi respectively however the addition of oh scavenger ipa lead to negligible decrease of k value the observations suggested that h o2 and e played important roles in the degradation of bpa yet oh had negligible contribution to understand the degradation pathway of bpa by fba a series of degradation intermediates were determined by lc ms analysis table s2 based on the results hydroxylation and cleavage were deduced to be the main degradation processes fig s11 in addition the toc analysis showed that 70 1 of toc in the reaction system was removed within the experimental duration fig s12 which further suggested that hydroxylation and cleavage were the main degradation processes moreover according to the npa charge distribution and f 0 of the atoms in bpa fig 4c the c1 c1 c4 c4 c6 and c6 in bpa with high f 0 values were the reactive sites for radical attacks whereas c1 and c1 were occupied by o and could not be further attacked thus the c4 c4 c6 and c6 were determined to be the most reactive sites marked in pink in fig 4d according to the observations above it could be concluded that bpa was degraded via a direct photocatalytic pathway repousi et al 2017 sharma et al 2015 it should be noted that although the photocatalytic activities of fba were improved by the agi decoration the degree of enhancement yet varied between rhb and bpa specifically the degradation efficiency of rhb by fba was 7 5 times higher than that by fb while for bpa the degradation activity by fba was improved by 11 relative to that by fb the observation could be explained by the characteristics of agi bioi heterojunction as well as the different degradation mechanisms of rhb and bpa previous studies liang et al 2015 2016a found that in agi bioi heterojunction the photocatalytic activity of bioi could be enhanced by improving the separation of e and h pairs while the more negative conduction band of agi in agi bioi heterojunction would enhance the activity of e for the photocatalytic degradation of rhb the more negative conduction band contributed to the capture of e by dissolved o2 and thus resulted in the generation of o2 which was found to be dominated in the photosensitization process in contrast bpa was degraded via a direct photocatalytic process in which h also played a major role in addition to o2 and e the enhancement of bpa degradation efficiency due to agi modification thus would not be same as that of rhb as a result the moderate improvement of bpa degradation efficiency by fba relative to fb was obtained 3 2 3 e coli disinfection the vld disinfection activities of the prepared photocatalysts were tested using e coli as model strain under visible light irradiation the viable cell density did not decrease in the blank control experiment indicating that the light irradiation had no toxic effect on the e coli cells fig 5 a fe3o4 nanoparticles exhibited negligible antibacterial effect which was consistent with previous study ng et al 2016 only 0 52 log decrease of viable cell density was observed in the presence of fb in 60 min while complete inactivation of 3 0 107 cfu ml 1 of e coli cells was achieved by fba and ba within 48 min with visible light irradiation clearly the modification of agi significantly enhanced the vld disinfection activity of fba while the presence of fe3o4 did not decrease that of fba previous studies showed that ag released from the silver based disinfection materials might be one of the main potential disinfection mechanisms shi et al 2014 wang and lim 2013 to explore the antibacterial mechanisms of fba the ag released during the experimental duration was detected the concentration of ag released by fba within the experimental duration was detected to be below 12 5 μg l fig s13 previous study liang et al 2017 showed that the toxicity of 100 μg l ag was negligible under similar condition clearly the released ag from fba could not contribute to the cell disinfection photo generated reactive species might play important roles in the disinfection process scavenger experiments thus were conducted to determine the roles of active species fig 5b showed that the addition of cr vi and tempol significantly decreased the disinfection activity of fba indicating that e and o2 played major roles in the cell disinfection process however when sodium oxalate and ipa were respectively added the antibacterial effect of fba was not affected which indicated neither h nor oh contributed to the disinfection process briefly the main active species responsible for e coli inactivation was determined to be e and o2 in summary compared to fb the decoration of agi nanoparticles not only contributed to the separation of charge carriers but also enhanced the activity of e thus fba exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity for e coli disinfection as well as the degradation of rhb and bpa moreover the mechanisms towards different pollutants were found to be different specifically rhb was degraded via photosensitization which was dominated by e and o2 while bpa was decomposed by direct photocatalytic oxidation in which h e and o2 played major roles in addition e coli cells was inactivated by the generation of e and o2 the schematic illustration of the photocatalytic mechanisms was illustrated in fig 6 3 3 reusability the reusability of fba towards rhb bpa and e coli was tested in four consecutive cycles fba exhibited strong photocatalytic activity towards all three different pollutants in the four reused recycles particularly even in the fourth reused cycle over 87 of rhb and 74 of bpa were degraded by fba within 60 min under visible light conditions respectively fig 7 a and b the inactivation efficiency of e coli cells was still over 92 in the fourth cycle fig 7c to testify the photo stability of fba the used photocatalysts were characterized by xrd analysis results showed that comparing with fresh fba no obvious shift of peak position was observed for the used fba fig 7d the observation indicated that the crystal structure of fba remained stable during the photocatalytic process furthermore metal ions released by fba during the photocatalytic reaction were also detected and the final concentrations of bi3 fe2 and ag were 0 9 8 and 10 5 μg l respectively the negligible release of individual elements in the treated supernatant further confirmed the stability of the photocatalyst the results suggested that fba had good photo stability under visible light irradiation and could be repeated utilization for the pollutants decontamination 4 conclusion magnetic fe3o4 bioi agi microspheres were prepared via a multi step process the as prepared photocatalyst exhibited excellent photocatalytic degradation activity towards pollutants such as rhb and bpa as well as e coli disinfection under visible light irradiation moreover the photocatalytic mechanisms were found to be different for different pollutants rhb was

19625,magnetic fe3o4 bioi agi fba spheres were synthesized through a multi step process the fabricated photocatalysts were characterized by different techniques to testify the visible light driven photocatalytic activity of fba rhodamine b and bisphenol a were chosen as model common and emerging organic contaminants respectively while gram negative strain escherichia coli was selected as model waterborne bacteria the results showed that under visible light irradiation fba contained strong photocatalytic degradation capacity towards both rhb and bpa moreover fba was also found to exhibit excellent disinfection activity towards e coli the photocatalytic mechanisms for different pollutants by fba were determined and found to vary for different pollutants specifically scavenger experiments degradation intermediates determination as well as theoretical density functional theory dft analysis showed that rhb and bpa were degraded via photosensitization dominated by e and o2 and direct photocatalytic oxidation contributed by h e and o2 respectively whereas e coli cells yet were found to be inactivated by the generation of e and o2 rather than by the released ag since it contained superparamagnetic property fba could be easily separated from the reaction suspension after use due to the excellent photo stability fba exhibited strong photocatalytic activity in the fourth reused recycle therefore fba could serve as a promising alternative for water purification graphical abstract image 1 keywords fe3o4 bioi agi photocatalytic activity degradation kinetics of rhb and bpa bacterial disinfection active species reusability 1 introduction due to the potential in solving energy crisis and water pollution problems semiconductor photocatalysis has been regarded as one of the most fascinating technologies in the field of water decontamination in the past decades hoffmann et al 1995 traditional tio2 particles exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity in the degradation of various organic pollutants as well as microbe disinfection paramasivam et al 2012 verma et al 2014 however the wide band gap of tio2 particles limited their performance associated with visible light application pelaez et al 2012 in order to utilize solar energy great efforts have been devoted to develop semiconductors with narrow band gap in the past years a variety of visible light driven vld photocatalysts including tio2 based goei and lim 2014 jin et al 2013 bi based cheng et al 2013 liang et al 2015 wu et al 2015 c3n4 based deng et al 2017 li et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 as well as different kinds of heterojunctions cai et al 2017 cheng et al 2011 liang et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 thus were developed and demonstrated to be effective in water purification owing to the unique structure of alternate bi2o2 2 sheets with the x slabs and internal electric fields between positive and anionic slabs the photo generated charge carriers in bismuth oxyiodide bioi generated under visible light irradiation could be effectively separated liu et al 2014 bioi thus has recently drawn great attention in the field of vld photocatalytic water decontamination cheng et al 2014 cui et al 2017 wang et al 2014 to further improve the photocatalytic activity of bioi under visible light conditions bioi particles have been previously modified with different elemental doping such as ag doping chen et al 2013 cheng et al 2013 ti doping liang et al 2016b and br doping guo et al 2015 due to the enhanced separation of photo generated charge carriers in the hybrid photocatalysts agi particles have been widely employed to modify vld photocatalysts hu et al 2007 wang et al 2016a 2016b the photocatalytic activity of bioi could also be significantly enhanced by heterojunction with agi chen et al 2013 liang et al 2015 however it is difficult to recycle agi bioi from the reaction suspension after treatment when they were well dispersed into the water due to their convenient separation from water magnetic particles have been demonstrated to have great potentials for recycle and repeated utilization deng et al 2005 zhang et al 2014 it is expected that magnetic cores modified with agi bioi would not only contain strong photocatalytic activity but also could be easily recovered from solution after use by modifying cofe2o4 particles with agi bioi zhang et al 2017 recently fabricated magnetic agi bioi cofe2o4 hybrid composites however this previous study yet focused on the removal of hg0 by agi bioi cofe2o4 composite under fluorescent light fsl irradiation to the best of our knowledge superparamagnetic fe3o4 modified with bioi agi has never been fabricated and applied in the field of vld degradation of organic pollutants as well as bacteria disinfection herein this study is aimed to fabricate the novel photocatalyts i e superparamagnetic fe3o4 bioi agi fba spheres and to investigate the vld photocatalytic activity for water decontamination fba particles were successfully synthesized via a multi step method the vld photocatalytic activity of the as prepared photocatalysts were tested against degradation of model common organic pollutants rhodamine b rhb and model emerging organic contaminants bisphenol a bpa moreover the bacterial disinfection activity of fba was also examined by using escherichia coli e coli as model waterborne bacteria the mechanisms involved in the process of individual pollutant degradation disinfection were also systematically discussed we found that fba contained excellent photo stability and maintained high photocatalytic activity in four consecutive reused cycles fba fabricated in this study could be a promising alternative for water purification 2 material and methods 2 1 materials ferric chloride

aldrich 2 2 synthesis and characterization of fe3o4 bioi agi 2 2 1 fe3o4 nanoparticles the synthesis was carried out according to a previous study with slight modification deng et al 2005 in a typical procedure 2 7 g fecl3 6h2o 2 0 g peg 20000 and 4 34 g ch3coona were dissolved into 80 ml eg to form a transparent yellow solution then the mixture was transferred into a teflon lined autoclave to undergo a solvothermal process at the temperature of 200 c for 11 h the black products were collected and rinsed with deionized water and absolute ethyl alcohol for three times each then dried under vacuum at room temperature for 12 h 2 2 2 fe3o4 bioi fb microspheres bioi was decorated onto the surface of fe3o4 nanoparticles via a simple precipitation method in a typical procedure 400 mg fe3o4 nanoparticles was dispersed into 100 ml eg containing 0 97 g bi no3 3 5h2o the mixture was ultrasonically treated for 30 min subsequently 50 ml ki solution containing 0 332 g ki was dropwise added into the mixture and mechanically stirred for 2 h the dark red products were magnetically collected and rinsed with deionized water and absolute ethyl alcohol for three times each then dried under vacuum at room temperature for 12 h pure bioi was also prepared via a similar procedure except for the absence of fe3o4 2 2 3 fe3o4 bioi agi fba microspheres agi was deposited on the surface of fb via an in situ ion exchange reaction chen et al 2013 which could be described as follows 1 b i o i a g a g i b i o briefly 85 mg agno3 was first fully dissolved into 100 ml eg then 400 mg fb was dispersed into the solution with ultrasonic treatment for 5 min the mixture was subsequently mechanically stirred for another 2 h the products were collected through the same method with fb agi bioi was also prepared by replacing pure bioi with fb and noted as ba 2 3 characterization the fabricated materials were characterized by powder x ray diffraction xrd x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps high

analysis the detailed information was provided in supplementary information 2 4 visible light driven photocatalytic performances the visible light driven photocatalytic activity of fba was investigated by the degradation of model common organic pollutants rhb and model emerging organic contaminants bpa moreover the bacterial disinfection activity of fba was also examined by using gram negative strain escherichia coli e coli as model waterborne bacteria the photocatalytic experiments were carried out using the devices shown in fig s1 a uv cutoff filter λ 400 nm was placed in the light path to exclude the uv portion of the light source xenon arc lamp 300 w cel hxf300 beijing jin yuan technology co the filtered light spectrum fig s2 confirmed that little uv light could pass the filter in addition the light intensity on the surface of the reaction suspension was measured to be 100 1 mw cm2 by a solar power meter tm 207 tenmars electronics co the temperature of the reaction system was maintain at 25 0 0 2 c by the circulating water between the double walls of the reaction beaker in a typical experiment 30 mg of the photocatalyst was added into 60 ml rhb 5 mg l or bpa 20 mg l aqueous solution prior to light irradiation the suspension was vigorously stirred for 30 min in the dark to achieve an adsorption desorption equilibrium preliminary experiments showed that 30 min was enough to obtain the adsorption desorption equilibrium the suspension was then exposed to visible light illumination under stirring at given intervals 2 ml of the solution was collected from the suspension and immediately filtrated by a 0 22 μm millipore membrane to remove suspended solids the concentration of rhb was determined by a uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 1800 via measuring the adsorption at 552 nm the concentration of bpa was determined by a high performance liquid chromatography agilent u3000 equipped with an agilent zorbax sb aq column 4 6 mm 250 mm 5 μm and a uv detector set at 276 nm the mobile phase was a mixture of acetonitrile and water 50 50 v v with a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 in the recycle experiments the photocatalysts were magnetically separated from the reaction suspension by an external magnetic field washed with deionized water and ethanol and then re dispersed in the fresh reaction suspensions for the subsequent cycle e coli atcc15597 was chosen as the model bacteria to test the photocatalytic disinfection activity of fba details about the preparation of bacterial stock suspensions could be found in our previous research liang et al 2016b as well as in the supplementary information the viable cell density of the e coli stock suspension was 3 0 109 colony forming unit per milliliter cfu ml 1 in a typical vld disinfection experiment 4 mg of photocatalyst was fully dispersed in 49 5 ml sterilized saline 15 mm nacl ph 7 with 10 min ultra sonication then 0 5 ml of e coli stock suspension was added into the suspension and the initial viable cell density was set to be 3 0 107 cfu ml 1 prior to the illumination the suspension was mechanically stirred for 5 min during the photocatalytic disinfection experiments 0 5 ml of the reaction suspension was withdrawn at given time intervals the viable cell density in each sample was determined by a plate counting method details about the plate counting method could be found in the supplementary information each set of the experiments was conducted in triplicate 2 5 photocatalytic mechanisms to determine the dominant reactive species involved in the photolytic processes a series of scavengers were individually added into the reaction suspensions to remove the corresponding active species briefly sodium oxalate na2c2o4 and isopropanol ipa were added to scavenge photo generated holes h and diffusing oh respectively cr vi and tempol were employed to remove photo generated electrons e and o2 respectively the scavengers used in the experiments were widely used in the photocatalytic system and non toxic to the bacterial cells chen et al 2011 zhang et al 2010 moreover the generation of o2 during the photocatalytic process were also detected by using nirtoblue tetrazolium nbt as probe molecules respectively details could be found in the supplementary information due to the intrinsic toxicity towards bacterial cells the concentration of bi3 fe3 as well as ag released by fba was detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms x series ii thermo scientific waltham ma usa samples for measurements were directly collected from the reaction suspension at given intervals and filtered by 0 22 μm millipore membranes before analyses to clarify the degradation pathway of rhb and bpa a liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms instrument equipped with an electrospray ionization esi source was applied and operated in the positive and negative ionization mode respectively in addition theoretical density functional theory dft analysis was also used to elucidate the exact photocatalytic degradation pathways of both rhb and bpa the detailed information could be found in the supplementary information to determine the mineralization of rhb and bpa during the photocatalytic process the total organic carbon toc of the reaction suspensions collected at different intervals were measured through combustion catalytic oxidation at 680 c by a toc meter toc lcph shimadzu japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the prepared photocatalysts the phase and crystal structure of the as synthesized photocatalysts were characterized by xrd analyses and the results were shown in fig s3 the xrd pattern of pure fe3o4 could be indexed to orthorhombic magnetite jcpds 75 1609 deng et al 2005 diffraction peaks at 2θ 30 1 35 5 43 1 57 1 and 62 6 corresponded to the planes of 112 103 004 321 and 224 respectively in addition to fe3o4 the strong characteristic diffraction peaks at 29 6 31 7 45 3 and 55 2 in the xrd pattern of fe3o4 bioi fb could be indexed to the 102 110 200 212 planes of tetragonal bioi jcpds 10 0445 which confirmed the successful deposition of bioi on the surface of magnetic cores in addition to bioi and fe3o4 the diffraction peaks corresponding to the hexagonal agi jcpds 09 0347 were also clearly displayed in the xrd pattern of fe3o4 bioi agi fba the width of the characteristic diffraction peak at 29 6 corresponding to the 102 plane of bioi was broadened during the ion exchange process the observation indicated the formation of agi bioi heterojunctions liang et al 2015 2016a no peak corresponding to impurities was detected suggesting that the as synthesized samples were of high purity the elemental composition and chemical state of the as prepared agi bioi ba fb and fba were characterized by xps analyses and the results were shown in fig s4 as shown in fig s4a peaks at around 159 ev and 164 ev were ascribed to bi 4f7 2 and bi 4f5 2 respectively which indicated the bismuth species in all three samples were bi3 ions cheng et al 2013 ye et al 2012 moreover the characteristic peaks located at 619 ev and 630 ev fig s4b could be indexed to i 3d5 2 and i 3d3 2 respectively which confirmed the existence of i ions in the high resolution xps spectra of ag only two peaks corresponding to the binding energy of ag 3d5 2 and ag 3d3 2 were observed fig s4c indicating that only one form of silver was presented since the presence of agi was confirmed by xrd analyses no elemental silver was formed in neither ba nor fba three peaks were present in the high resolution xps spectra of o 1s fig s4d which could be indexed to bi o fe o and surface adsorbed oh during the ion exchange process ag was deposited onto the surface of bioi by replacing the position of bio cheng et al 2011 thus the relative intensity of the peak corresponding to bi o in both ba and fba was significantly lower than that in fb the results above agreed well with our previous study and confirmed that the as synthesized fba contained the agi bioi heterojunction liang et al 2015 in addition to agi bioi only 8 72 atomic ratio of fe atoms were detected according to the xps spectrum of fe 2p in fba fig s4e the value was significantly lower than the theoretical content of fe3o4 since the xps analysis could only reveal the surface composition the observation indicated that the magnetic cores were well covered with agi bioi heterojunction the morphology and microstructure of fba were investigated by both sem and tem as shown in fig 1 a fba exhibited a morphology of microspheres with porous surfaces which consisted of numerous ultrathin bioi nano plates moreover agi nanospheres were found to be uniformly present on the surface of bioi fig 1b hrtem image of bioi nano plate showed clear lattice fringes with a spacing of 0 91 nm fig 1c which was in accordance with 001 planes of tetragonal bioi the thickness of the bioi nano plate was estimated to be around 20 nm fig 1d displayed a high resolution image of the nanospheres deposited on the surface of bioi nano plate the lattice fringes with a spacing of 0 23 nm were consistent with the 110 plane of β agi and the diameter of the agi nanospheres was around 40 nm the optical properties of the fabricated materials were characterized by uv drs analysis as shown in fig 2 a the adsorption edge of bioi was 665 nm and the band gap eg of bioi was calculated to be 1 68 ev using eq s1 which was consistent with previous studies cheng et al 2013 liang et al 2015 after the incorporation of fe3o4 nanoparticles the light absorbance of both bioi and agi bioi were significantly enhanced however it should be noted that the strong absorbance via the combination with fe3o4 was mainly due to the dmso d6 transitions of fe in the magnetic cores zhang et al 2014 which would not have contribution to the photocatalytic activity the observation suggested that photocatalysts were successfully anchored on the magnetic cores to investigate the structrual characteristics of the as prepared materials a nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm measurement was performed fb ba and fba displayed iv adsorption desorption isotherms with a type h3 hysteresis loop at a high relative pressure between 0 75 and 1 0 fig 2b which was consistent with the typical characteristics of mesoporous materials xiong et al 2016 the observation also corresponded to the porous hierarchical surface structure shown in fig 1 a and b the results of barrett joyner halenda bjh pore diameter analyses fig 2b inset showed that fb had two main pore diameter distribution peaks the small distribution peak at about 25 nm could be attributed to the intervals among the intercross bioi nano plates while the relative large pores were formed between the bioi nano plate and fe3o4 nanoparticles xia et al 2011 since the agi nanoparticles on the surface of bioi would partially block the mesopores the pore diameter of ba and fba were found to be larger than that of fb therefore the bet specific surface area of fb 42 6 m2 g was detected to be higher than that of fba 21 5 m2 g or ba 14 4 m2 g the magnetic hysteresis loops suggested that both fe3o4 and fba were superparamagnetic fig 2c the magnetic saturation ms values of fe3o4 and fba were determined to be 58 4 emu g 1 and 22 4 emu g 1 respectively the decreased ms value of fba could be attributed to the deposition of non magnetic agi bioi onto fe3o4 core the magnetic properties of fba could ensure its convenient and rapid separation from water in 2 min with a magnet fig s5 3 2 photocatalytic performances the vld photocatalytic activity of as prepared materials were evaluated towards different types of pollutants specifically rhb which could strongly absorb visible light irradiation and undergo either the direct photocatalytic or photosensitization process was employed as model common organic dyes hu et al 2014 xiong et al 2016 bpa the representative of the endocrine disruptors and e coli were chosen as model emerging contaminants zhang et al 2014 and model bacteria strain liang et al 2015 respectively 3 2 1 degradation of rhb the photocatalytic degradation kinetics of rhb by fe3o4 nanoparticles fb ba and fba were investigated and the results were displayed in fig 3 a it should be noted that preliminary adsorption experiments fig 3a inset showed that adsorption of rhb by all four types of particles reached equilibrium in 30 min thus prior to the photocatalytic experiments the adsorption experiments of rhb by four types of particles were conducted for 30 min under dark conditions obviously the adsorption of rhb by fe3o4 nanoparticles was negligible while fb ba and fba could remove a small portion of rhb moreover due to the relatively larger bet surface area the adsorption of rhb by fb was larger than ba or fba specifically the removal rate of rhb by fb was detected to be 29 while ba and fba could remove 13 and 17 of rhb respectively fig 3a inset under visible light irradiation the concentration of rhb did not decrease over time in the blank control experiment indicating that in the absence of photocatalysts rhb did not photolyze within the experimental duration under visible light irradiation negligible decrease of rhb concentration was obtained in the presence of fe3o4 nanoparticles after 60 min reaction indicating that fe3o4 particles did not contain photocatalytic activity for rhb degradation the observation was consistent with previous study li et al 2013 in contrast fb ba and fba could degrade rhb under visible light irradiation overall among all these three particles the photocatalytic performance of fba towards rhb was obviously the best specifically after 60 min irradiation over 92 of rhb was degraded by fba while only 44 3 and 74 of rhb was removed by fb and ba respectively although the adsorption capacity of fb was the highest the photocatalytic activity of fb towards rhb yet was lower than that of ba and fba the kinetics data of rhb degradation were fitted well with the pseudo first order model the pseudo first order kinetic constant k of fba was determined to be 3 36 10 2 min 1 which was about 7 5 times higher than that of fb 4 49 10 3 min 1 and 2 9 times of ba 1 14 10 2 min 1 fig 3b clearly under visible light irradiation fba was much more efficient to degrade rhb than fb and ba the above observation further confirmed the superior photocatalytic activity of agi bioi over pure bioi which could be attributed to the better separation of charge carriers by agi bioi heterojunction chen et al 2013 cheng et al 2013 liang et al 2015 ye et al 2012 in addition it is worth noting that the presence of magnetic particles could slightly enhance the photocatalytic activity of agi bioi as shown in fig 2a fe3o4 contained strong adsorption of visible light irradiation although it could not directly form reactive species on the surface of fe3o4 nanoparticles due to the dmso d6 transition mechanisms part of the photoinduced electrons generated by fe3o4 nanoparticles might transfer to the conduction band of bioi and further generated superoxide radicals thus the photocatalytic activity of fba was slightly enhanced relative to agi bioi the positive role of magnetic particles was also previously reported for magnetic bioi li et al 2013 to determine the mechanisms involved in the degradation of rhb by fba a series of scavengers were introduced into the reaction suspension to remove corresponding reactive species as shown in fig 3b and fig s6 the addition of tempol the scavenger of o2 and cr vi the scavenger of e significantly decreased the k value from 3 36 10 2 min 1 to 1 27 10 3 min 1 and 9 83 10 3 min 1 respectively the observation indicated that o2 and e played important roles in the degradation of rhb the generation of o2 was further confirmed by using nbt as a molecular probe fig s7 the addition of ipa oh scavenger did not have obvious effect on the degradation kinetic indicating that oh did not contribute to the rhb degradation when sodium oxalate h scavenger was added the degradation of rhb did not decrease yet it was enhanced indicating that h did not have contribution to the degradation process the recombination of h and e would be decreased due to the removal of h by the addition of sodium oxalate thus the amount of e available for rhb degradation would be increased as a result enhancement of rhb degradation was achieved with the presence of sodium oxalate h scavenger briefly o2 and e was found to be the dominant reactive species contributing to the photocatalytic degradation of rhb by fba it was well reported that the photocatalytic degradation of rhb mainly occurred via two competitive processes n demethylation and the destruction of the conjugated structure fu et al 2008 to clarify the degradation pathway temporal evolution of the spectral changes during the photocatalytic degradation of rhb were recorded during the degradation process the maximum adsorption peak of rhb exhibited an obvious hypsochromic shift fig s8a suggesting the formation of a series of n deethylated intermediates in a stepwise manner lei et al 2005 theoretical dft analysis also confirmed the as mentioned degradation mechanism fig 3c showed the natural population analysis npa charge distribution and fukui index representing radical attack f 0 of the atoms in rhb the red color degree in fig 3d provided different levels of f 0 and it suggested that the n1 and n1 in rhb with the highest values were the most reactive sites for radical attack moreover c4 was also a high reactive site besides the two n atoms and further attacked of rhb on c13 by radicals o2 in this study would lead to formation of ring open products fig 3d the generation of a series of n deethylated intermediates including der eer dr and er in the reaction system were also confirmed by lc ms analysis table s1 in addition the toc of the reaction suspension did not obviously decline within the experimental duration fig s9 which indicated that the conjugated structure of rhb was not broken during the photocatalysis process based on the observation above o2 dominated n deethylated process would be the main photocatalytic degradation mechanisms of rhb by fba rhb thus was degraded via a photosensitization process in a typical degradation process rhb molecules were firstly excited by photons into an excited state rhb and then injected the electrons to the conduction band of fba electrons were captured by o2 on the surface of fba to generate o2 which result into the degradation of rhb wang et al 2012 the scheme of rhb degradation process by fba was provided in fig s8b 3 2 2 degradation of bpa the degradation kinetics of bpa by the as prepared photocatalysts were investigated visible light condition and the results were displayed in fig 4 a preliminary adsorption experiments fig 4a inset showed that adsorption of bpa by fe3o4 nanoparticles fb ba and fba reached equilibrium in 30 min similar to rhb the adsorption experiments of bpa by four types of particles under dark conditions were conducted for 30 min prior to the photocatalytic experiments under visible light irradiation the removal rate of bpa via adsorption by fe3o4 nanoparticles fb ba and fba were found to be 0 11 4 and 5 respectively fig 4a inset under visible light irradiation blank control experiment showed that bpa would not degrade within the experimental duration without the presence of photocatalysts the presence of fe3o4 nanoparticles did not decrease the concentration of bpa over time indicating that fe3o4 nanoparticles did not contain photocatalytic activity towards bpa fig 4a in contrast ba fb and fba yet could efficiently degrade bpa with visible light irradiation specifically over 70 of bpa was photocatalytically removed by ba fb and fba after 50 min irradiation the pseudo first order kinetic constant of fba 2 79 10 2 min 1 yet was slightly greater than that of ba 2 56 10 2 min 1 or fb 2 51 10 2 min 1 the observation indicated that agi decoration also enhanced the degradation kinetics of bpa and the presence of fe3o4 nanoparticles did not affect the photocatalytic activity of fba to explore the degradation mechanisms the scavenger experiments were performed fig 4b and fig s10 showed that the introduction of sodium oxalate tempol and cr vi into the reaction suspension significantly decreased the k values specifically the k values decreased to 0 61 10 2 min 1 1 14 10 2 min 1 and 1 47 10 2 min 1 in the presence of sodium oxalate tempol and cr vi respectively however the addition of oh scavenger ipa lead to negligible decrease of k value the observations suggested that h o2 and e played important roles in the degradation of bpa yet oh had negligible contribution to understand the degradation pathway of bpa by fba a series of degradation intermediates were determined by lc ms analysis table s2 based on the results hydroxylation and cleavage were deduced to be the main degradation processes fig s11 in addition the toc analysis showed that 70 1 of toc in the reaction system was removed within the experimental duration fig s12 which further suggested that hydroxylation and cleavage were the main degradation processes moreover according to the npa charge distribution and f 0 of the atoms in bpa fig 4c the c1 c1 c4 c4 c6 and c6 in bpa with high f 0 values were the reactive sites for radical attacks whereas c1 and c1 were occupied by o and could not be further attacked thus the c4 c4 c6 and c6 were determined to be the most reactive sites marked in pink in fig 4d according to the observations above it could be concluded that bpa was degraded via a direct photocatalytic pathway repousi et al 2017 sharma et al 2015 it should be noted that although the photocatalytic activities of fba were improved by the agi decoration the degree of enhancement yet varied between rhb and bpa specifically the degradation efficiency of rhb by fba was 7 5 times higher than that by fb while for bpa the degradation activity by fba was improved by 11 relative to that by fb the observation could be explained by the characteristics of agi bioi heterojunction as well as the different degradation mechanisms of rhb and bpa previous studies liang et al 2015 2016a found that in agi bioi heterojunction the photocatalytic activity of bioi could be enhanced by improving the separation of e and h pairs while the more negative conduction band of agi in agi bioi heterojunction would enhance the activity of e for the photocatalytic degradation of rhb the more negative conduction band contributed to the capture of e by dissolved o2 and thus resulted in the generation of o2 which was found to be dominated in the photosensitization process in contrast bpa was degraded via a direct photocatalytic process in which h also played a major role in addition to o2 and e the enhancement of bpa degradation efficiency due to agi modification thus would not be same as that of rhb as a result the moderate improvement of bpa degradation efficiency by fba relative to fb was obtained 3 2 3 e coli disinfection the vld disinfection activities of the prepared photocatalysts were tested using e coli as model strain under visible light irradiation the viable cell density did not decrease in the blank control experiment indicating that the light irradiation had no toxic effect on the e coli cells fig 5 a fe3o4 nanoparticles exhibited negligible antibacterial effect which was consistent with previous study ng et al 2016 only 0 52 log decrease of viable cell density was observed in the presence of fb in 60 min while complete inactivation of 3 0 107 cfu ml 1 of e coli cells was achieved by fba and ba within 48 min with visible light irradiation clearly the modification of agi significantly enhanced the vld disinfection activity of fba while the presence of fe3o4 did not decrease that of fba previous studies showed that ag released from the silver based disinfection materials might be one of the main potential disinfection mechanisms shi et al 2014 wang and lim 2013 to explore the antibacterial mechanisms of fba the ag released during the experimental duration was detected the concentration of ag released by fba within the experimental duration was detected to be below 12 5 μg l fig s13 previous study liang et al 2017 showed that the toxicity of 100 μg l ag was negligible under similar condition clearly the released ag from fba could not contribute to the cell disinfection photo generated reactive species might play important roles in the disinfection process scavenger experiments thus were conducted to determine the roles of active species fig 5b showed that the addition of cr vi and tempol significantly decreased the disinfection activity of fba indicating that e and o2 played major roles in the cell disinfection process however when sodium oxalate and ipa were respectively added the antibacterial effect of fba was not affected which indicated neither h nor oh contributed to the disinfection process briefly the main active species responsible for e coli inactivation was determined to be e and o2 in summary compared to fb the decoration of agi nanoparticles not only contributed to the separation of charge carriers but also enhanced the activity of e thus fba exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity for e coli disinfection as well as the degradation of rhb and bpa moreover the mechanisms towards different pollutants were found to be different specifically rhb was degraded via photosensitization which was dominated by e and o2 while bpa was decomposed by direct photocatalytic oxidation in which h e and o2 played major roles in addition e coli cells was inactivated by the generation of e and o2 the schematic illustration of the photocatalytic mechanisms was illustrated in fig 6 3 3 reusability the reusability of fba towards rhb bpa and e coli was tested in four consecutive cycles fba exhibited strong photocatalytic activity towards all three different pollutants in the four reused recycles particularly even in the fourth reused cycle over 87 of rhb and 74 of bpa were degraded by fba within 60 min under visible light conditions respectively fig 7 a and b the inactivation efficiency of e coli cells was still over 92 in the fourth cycle fig 7c to testify the photo stability of fba the used photocatalysts were characterized by xrd analysis results showed that comparing with fresh fba no obvious shift of peak position was observed for the used fba fig 7d the observation indicated that the crystal structure of fba remained stable during the photocatalytic process furthermore metal ions released by fba during the photocatalytic reaction were also detected and the final concentrations of bi3 fe2 and ag were 0 9 8 and 10 5 μg l respectively the negligible release of individual elements in the treated supernatant further confirmed the stability of the photocatalyst the results suggested that fba had good photo stability under visible light irradiation and could be repeated utilization for the pollutants decontamination 4 conclusion magnetic fe3o4 bioi agi microspheres were prepared via a multi step process the as prepared photocatalyst exhibited excellent photocatalytic degradation activity towards pollutants such as rhb and bpa as well as e coli disinfection under visible light irradiation moreover the photocatalytic mechanisms were found to be different for different pollutants rhb was degraded via photosensitization dominated by e and o2 while bpa was decomposed by direct photocatalytic oxidation dominated by h e and o2 e coli cells yet was inactivated by the generation of e and o2 rather than the released ag due to the superparamagnetic property fba could be easily collected after use with an external magnetic field fba also exhibited excellent photo stability and maintained high photocatalytic activity in the four consecutive reused cycles the results revealed that fba could be a promising alternative for water purification acknowledgements this work was supported by the

2014 liu et al 2016 x wang et al 2016 polydopamine pda was utilized to ensure the dense growth of ceo2 co3o4 on the stainless steel mesh substrate the resultant ceo2 co3o4 coated mesh with a hierarchical structure is capable of efficiently separating cook oil from the oily mixtures and simultaneously degrading the water soluble food flavors and dyes under the uv irradiation typically we choose the soybean oil pretty common for cooking vanillic aldehyde va a widely used flavor in cakes bread ice cream and so on amaranth red ar a widespread food dye for juices ice cream cans and lots of food as the representative contaminants in food wastewater as a proof of concept the oil was removed efficiently and va as well as ar were degraded quickly in situ indicating the material a great application foreground scheme 1 to the best of our knowledge this is the first work to apply the special wettability material into the food wastewater treatment realizing a highly efficient removal of three different typical contaminants in food waste water with a facile and time saving one step filtration 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials dopamine hydrochloride sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china was used as purchased vanillic aldehyde amaranth red and cerium nitrate hexahydrate ce no3 3 6h2o were of analytical grade from heowns scientific ltd tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane tris urea and cobalt nitrate hexahydrate co no3 3 6h2o were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagents and soybean oil was purchased from supermarket all other chemicals were used without further purification the freshwater microalgae scenedesmus obliquus was supplied by the institute of hydrobiology of chinese academy of sciences and cultivated in 100 ml liquid hb 4medium in 250 ml flasks the axenic cultures were incubated in an environmental chamber using standard lighting and temperature conditions 16 8 light dark cycle illumination 3000 4000 lx 25 c 2 2 fabrication of pda pretreated mesh the stainless steel mesh was immersed in an aqueous solution of dopamine hydrochloride 10 mm after ultrasonic cleaning in acetone to remove the dirt on the surface then a tris solution 1 m ph 8 5 was added dropwise the entire reaction was kept at room temperature in a sealed condition after 24 h the obtained mesh was removed and cleaned by water for further use 2 3 fabrication of ceo2 co3o4 composites on the mesh 1 520 g ce no3 3 6h2o 1 019 g co no3 3 6h2o and 1 051 g urea were dissolved in 35 ml deionized water and then transferred into a 50 ml teflon line stainless steel autoclave the pda pretreated mesh was immersed into the above mixture solution and the autoclave was kept in a conventional oven for 12 h at 110 c then cooling down to room temperature naturally the mesh was washed by deionized water and ethanol for several times and dried at 80 c for 24 h finally the mesh was calcinated at 350 c for 3 h and the functional mesh was obtained the pda ceo2 mesh was fabricated in the same way without using co no3 3 6h2o similarly the pda co3o4 mesh fabricated in the same way without using ce no3 3 6h2o while the ceo2 co3o4 mesh was fabricated following the second step without using dopamine the immobilized amount of ceo2 co3o4 particles was calculated by the equation mi m1 m0 where m1 and m0 are the masses of pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh and pda decorated mesh respectively and the released amount mr is calculated by the equation mr m1 mc where m1 is the initial mass of the pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh and mc is the mass of the pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh after 5 cycles of catalysis and oil separation 2 4 materials characterization fesem and eds images were obtained on a field emission scanning electron microscope su 8010 hitachi limited japan ftir spectra were recorded using a fourier infrared spectrometer nicolet6700 thermo co operation usa the variation of amaranth red and vanillic aldehyde concentration through the catalytic reactions were tested with a perkin elmer lambda 750 uv spectrometer united kingdom x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurements were carried out on a thermo escalab 250 xi spectrometer using an al kα x ray source 1486 6 ev the xrd pattern was measured on a polycrystalline x ray diffractometer with a cu kα radiation source bruker d8 advance bruker axs germany contact angles were measured on a contact angle measurement machine oca 15 machine data physics germany the oil content in the filtrate was measured with an infrared spectrometer oil content analyzer oil 480 beijing chinainvent instrument tech co ltd china inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes was for the ce and co content measurement toc analyzer toc lcph soe 103 was employed to measure toc in the sample solution 2 5 photocatalytic performance test the functional mesh was fixed between two teflon fixtures that were attached with a glass tube whose diameter was 30 mm the photocatalytic performance of the mesh for the degradation of amaranth red and vanillic aldehyde under ultraviolet was evaluated by recording the absorption of the catalyzed solution illuminated by a 125 w high pressure mercury lamp philips hpk 125 w λ 365 nm the solution of ar 5 mg l 1 10 ml va 5 mg l 1 10 ml or ar and va mixture ar and va were 5 mg l 1 respectively 10 ml were poured onto the meshes under the ultralight three meshes were used to reduce the permeation flux the degradation efficiency d was calculated by the equation as follows d 1 ct c0 100 in which the c0 and ct were the initial contaminant concentration and the final concentration after the solution ran out solely by gravity under ultraviolet respectively 2 6 emulsion separation experiment a surfactant free oil in water emulsion was prepared by adding 1 ml edible oil into 100 ml water and sonicating for 30 min the mesh was placed in the same device as the photocatalytic experiment and the emulsion was poured onto the mesh to achieve separation the separation efficiency was measured by the oil rejection coefficient r according to the follow equation r 1 cf c0 100 where the cf and c0 were the oil concentration of the collected filtrate and the original emulsion respectively the corresponding fluxes were calculated by measuring the needed time that collected a certain volume of filtrate 2 7 toxicity measurements the toxicity of the simultaneously treated pollutants was examined by the effects on the growth of freshwater algae scenedesmus obliquus according to the method of oecd 201 briefly first there is a pre culture of 3 days which is intended to give an amount of algae suitable for the inoculation of test cultures measurement of biomass is done by manual cell counting by microscope then 0 ml 1 ml 5 ml treated food wastewater filtrates water as well as culture medium were added into the algae solution and the concentration of the algae was all kept at 4 105 cells ml each group including three replicates all flasks were shaken three times and repositioned daily to prevent clumping of cells at the end of 96 h s obliquus cell density was monitored at od 650 and the inhibition of algae growth was calculated by the cell density of the 5 ml group or 1 ml group minus the controlled group the equation is as follows i yc yt yc 100 where i is the inhibition rate yc is mean value of cell density in the control group and yt is the cell density of the group treated by wasterwater filtrates 3 results and discussion 3 1 sem to investigate the nanostructures of the pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh the field emission scanning electron microscope fesem was conducted firstly the substrates before and after being coated by pda were observed and shown in supporting information fig s1a showed the typical knit of stainless steel while fig s1b was the mesh coated by pda which can also be confirmed by the color change of the substrate after 24 h coating the insert images of figs s1a and b obviously turning brown yellow figs s1c and s1d were the eds images of s1a and s1b respectively the increased ratios of c and o elements and the appearance of n elements are all the hints of pda coating to further investigate the reaction between pda and the substrate ftir spectra of blank substrate and modified mesh were inspected and the detailed analysis was shown in fig s2 providing further proofs of pda modification the special micro nano structures with microspheres composed of interlaced rectangular sheets could be observed in fig 1 a and 1b having increased the roughness of the surface which is critical to the special wettability of the mesh besides the particular microspheres also endued the mesh with large surface areas which would offer more contacts between reactants and materials to validate the needful role of pda the sem images of the mesh without pda treatment in other words coated by ceo2 co3o4 directly were shown in fig 1c and d it can be seen that although the high magnificated structures are similar the low magnificated image shows the uneven growth of ceo2 co3o4 composites on substrate without pda which can also be proved by the insert pictures of fig 1a and c indicating the essential role of pda for dense growth of the bimetal catalyst in the meanwhile pda ceo2 mesh was observed fig 1e and f in contrast with pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh where ceo2 distributed a little sparsely and unevenly with the aggregation in rod shape hinting co3o4 may also contribute to the uniform growth of ceo2 3 2 catalysis of food additives under uv 3 2 1 catalysis of amaranth red ar to further validate the indispensable roles of pda and co3o4 the catalytic abilities of three resultant meshes under uv were tested with the fixture shown in figure s3 5 ppm aqueous solution of amaranth red ar a widely used food dye was poured onto the pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh surface under uv irradiation the faded filtrates run through the mesh solely driven by gravity exhibiting the outstanding catalytic efficiency moreover the same experiments with pda ceo2 and ceo2 co3o4 meshes were carried out and the corresponding uv vis spectra are shown in fig 2 a one can uncover that almost complete dislodge of pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh towards ar was achieved with the degradation efficiency of 99 49 while the efficiencies of ceo2 co3o4 and pda ceo2 meshes were only 74 03 and 76 61 respectively in addition the degradation of ar solely under uv was performed as control fig s4a besides it can be clearly seen that both pda ceo2 and ceo2 co3o4 mesh performed much worse compared with pda ceo2 co3o4 in ar degrading further confirming the necessity of pda and co3o4 which would be discussed later 3 2 2 catalysis of vanillic aldehyde va in addition vanillic aldehyde va is a common food additive to enrich food flavors same manipulation as ar photodegradation was done for 5 ppm va solution here three pieces of pda ceo2 co3o4 meshes were applied to decrease the permeation rate of va solution and increase more sufficient contacts with catalysts the contrast experiments with only uv treatment fig s4b pda ceo2 mesh and ceo2 co3o4 mesh fig 2b were also done it can be concluded that pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh possesses enhanced capacity with an 89 26 degradation rate compared with pda ceo2 mesh 50 43 and ceo2 co3o4 mesh 36 28 proving the critical status of pda and co3o4 besides to exclude the possibility that the removal of ar and va is due to the electrostatic interaction of dopamine ar 5 ppm and va 5 ppm mixed solution was filtrated without uv irradiation almost no change of the absorbance fig s5 verified the role of photodegradation as a result pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh was chosen to be the ideal one and further characterized in the following experiments for understanding the composition and property 3 3 xrd and xps the x ray diffraction pattern is shown in fig s6 with two sets of diffraction peaks that one set labeled red corresponds to ceo2 phase jcpds 34 0394 and the other one labeled green is indexed to co3o4 phase jcpds 43 1003 indicating our resultant material is indeed composed of ceo2 co3o4 hybrid composites meanwhile the surface composition and chemical state were investigated by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps as shown in fig 3 a the peaks of c 1s n 1s and o 1s are further proofs of the successful pda coating and the surface of substrate was covered by ce and co in majority the xps spectrum of o 1s is shown in fig 3b in which o 1s has been deconvolved into two peaks the peak located at 531 4 ev is ascribed to the oxygen in hydroxyl groups while the peak centered at 529 9 ev stands for the surface lattice oxygen in metal oxides yuan et al 2012 zheng et al 2015 fig 3c is the xps spectrum of ce 3d which can be assigned to four pairs of spin orbit doublets the peaks labeled as u1 902 2 ev and v1 884 5 ev are indicative of ce3 while another three doublets u 901 2 ev and v 882 6 ev u2 907 2 ev and v2 887 8 ev u3 917 1 ev and v3 898 7 ev are characteristics of ce4 indicating the coexistence of ce3 and ce4 in the resultant pda ceo2 co3o4 sample which is important for the catalytic ability improvement liu et al 2015 yuan et al 2012 the co 2p xps spectrum in fig 3d shows two major peaks with binding energies at 779 9 ev and 794 8 ev corresponding to co 2p3 2 and co 2p1 2 the value of δe is 15 2 ev which is precisely the value for the mixed valence co3o4 liu et al 2015 therefore xps analysis is in agreement with xrd pattern throwing light on the composition and chemical state of our pda ceo2 co3o4 composites 3 4 food oil and water separation and ph resistance environment it is generally known that food oil is one of major contaminants in food wastewater causing water eutrophication and threatening our environment and daily life seriously aurell and gullett 2010 inspired by oil repellency of fish scales materials with special wettability that are superhydrophilic and superoleophobic underwater have gained considerable attention to achieve oil removal from oily mixtures providing us the inspiration to endow our material with unoil ability feng et al 2002 2004 liu et al 2009 the wetting behaviors of pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh were evaluated by measuring the contact angle ca of water and 1 2 dichloroethane on it figs s7a and s7b owing to the high surface tension of ceo2 co3o4 the mesh is superhydrophilic with the water drop immediately being soaked in addition when immersed in water the mesh shows superoleophobic with oca larger than 150 because water infiltrates the mesh surface and is trapped into the rough structures thus the contact area between oil and mesh is decreased greatly this property provides the possibility for food oil being separated from food wastewater considering practical condition oil usually exists in an emulsified form in food wastewater therefore we prepared a soybean oil in water emulsion with 1 ml oil dispersing in 100 ml h2o sonicating for 1 h to obtain a relatively stable state with the fixture in fig s3 the soybean oil in water emulsion was separated by gravity solely with an efficiency more than 99 attributing to its superhydrophilic property and the dense growth of ceo2 co3o4 composites besides the stability against different ph environments of the mesh was measured fig 4 by immersing it in different ph solutions for 90 min the mesh was stable in a wide range of ph 3 13 while invalid in strong acid environment ph 2 for the ceo2 co3o4 composites would react with h fesem images of the immersed mesh can also prove the strong resistance towards tough ph environments 3 5 reusability test and simulative food wastewater treatment subsequently the reusability of the mesh was tested by catalyzing ar and separating food oil emulsion for 5 times fig 5 a and 5b the degradation efficiency and separation efficiency almost remained unchanged after 5 cycles and fesem images figs s8a and s8b of the tested mesh showed no changes in microstuctures confirming its good reusability moreover simulated food wastewater with ar va and soybean oil together was treated by the above filtrate fixture under uv with one step operation fig 5c and d cheerfully the catalytic efficiency for ar 98 1 and va 84 06 as well as the separation ability for soybean oil emulsion 99 92 were scarcely decreased when contaminants were treated simultaneously compared with the individual operations above besides the performance of ceo2 and co3o4 was evaluated individually fig s9 and results stressed importance of the synergistic effects between ceo2 and co3o4 moreover the water flux was 1 3777 103 l m2 h by measuring the needed time that collected a certain volume of filtrates besides the average immobilized amount of ceo2 co3o4 particles was calculated as 0 1393 g 0 0006 g and after 5 cycles for treating ar and oil the immobilized amount decreased the released amount was 0 0276 g 0 0002 g besides the static and dynamic leaching experiments have been carried out to observe ce or co has been leached out after immersing the mesh in simulated wastewater for 24h and filtrating the wastewater under uv irradiation the soaking solution and filtrate were measured by icp oes results showed there was no existence of ce or co indicating the material friendly to environment as for the mass reduction of the reused mesh it might attribute to the abrasion with the filtration fixture there is a circle imprint after removing the mesh from the fixture seen in fig s10 with such a simple time saving manipulation and high catalytic capacity the co processing with ar va and soybean oil makes pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh a promising candidate for practical production and application 3 6 possible catalytic mechanism of food additives it is evident that pda and co3o4 both play important roles for this ceria based mesh the function of pda is to act as a biological glue to get a denser growth of ceo2 co3o4 which can be verified by the uneven distribution of ceo2 co3o4 on the stainless steel mesh without pda coating however the detailed binding mechanisms of dopamine to substrate still remain unknown lee et al 2006 but might owes to pda contributing to substantial catechol functional groups that could cross link with cerium and cobalt ions in a highly reactive forms then further robustly immobilizing ceo2 co3o4 as for co3o4 the synergistic effect of ceo2 co3o4 has been researched a lot zhen et al 2014 nano ceria has a unique property of easy interchange between reduced ce3 and oxidized states ce4 leading the formation of oxygen vacancies what s more the addition of co3o4 can lead to a slight lattice contraction in the ceria lattice because co3 has a smaller size resulting in more production of oxygen vacancies besides the one component sites like ce4 ce3 and co3 co2 there are also bivalent catalytic centers like ce4 co3 and ce3 co2 and therefore when the bivalent co2 or trivalent co3 replaces the ce4 in ceo2 more oxygen vacancies would be generated for electrostatic balance cui et al 10425 in conclusion the cooperation of ceo2 and co3o4 has largely increased the numbers of oxygen vacancies equation 1 contributing to an enhanced catalytic ability based on the above information an overview of possible photodegradation mechanism of pollutant molecules r is shown in scheme 2 first the redox of metal ions excited by uv light produces some oxygen vacancies turning the oxygen on the mesh surface into active oxygen then the absorbed pollutant molecules by ceo2 co3o4 sites are readily oxidized to co2 and h2o sudarsanam et al 3496 ceo2 ceo2 x ovac co3o4 co2 co3 ovac 1 co2 ceo2 co3 ceo2 x ovac 3 7 mineralization of the food additives and toxicity tests the mineralization of the food additives was measured by toc and the removal efficiency is 80 83 indicating a relatively complete degradation of ar and va having been achieved and the toxicity tests of catalyzed filtrates were evaluated by the inhibition rate towards the growth of freshwater algae scenedesmus obliquus according to the method of oecd 201 huang et al 2012 at the end of 96 h s obliquus cell density in control group was 1 6 109 cells ml and absorbance was 0 562 as a result the group with 1 ml filtrate has a growth cell density with 2 0 109 cells ml and the growth rate was 26 44 with the absorbance at 0 711 this induced effect may be explained by that algae possibly took advantage of a supply of carbon and nitrogen sources coming from the filtrates when added 5 ml filtrate the cell density has a slight decrease about 19 03 appearing at 1 3 109 cells ml with 0 455 absorbance the result shows that a low amount addment of the catalyzed filtrate has very slight effects on the growth of algae showing a low toxicity and friendly to environment besides table s1 showed some works with other methods to process different kinds of food wastewater from the table we can see that compared to the particles photocatalysis pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh has the advantages such as time saving high efficiency easy to collect and without secondary pollution 4 conclusions the pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh was fabricated by a hydrothermal method on the pda pretreated stainless steel substrate here pda has ensured enough amounts of catalysts while the doping of cobalt has greatly improved catalytic ability and provided the mesh special wettability through the pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh food dye ar and food flavor va were almost readily degraded under uv individually and the soybean oil emulsion was also separated with a satisfying efficiency the simulated food wastewater with the three representative contaminants was processed by pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh simultaneously and the result is uplifting with both catalytic ability and separation efficiency rarely influenced the toc removal is high and the catalyzed filtrate shows low toxicity towards algae scenedesmus obliquus the mesh is stable in a wide ph range from 3 to 13 and possesses good reusability in food oil emulsion separation and photodegradation of food dyes compared to other food watsewater treatments this work performs high efficiency time saving facile operation environmental friendly acknowledgement the authors are grateful for financial support from the

2014 liu et al 2016 x wang et al 2016 polydopamine pda was utilized to ensure the dense growth of ceo2 co3o4 on the stainless steel mesh substrate the resultant ceo2 co3o4 coated mesh with a hierarchical structure is capable of efficiently separating cook oil from the oily mixtures and simultaneously degrading the water soluble food flavors and dyes under the uv irradiation typically we choose the soybean oil pretty common for cooking vanillic aldehyde va a widely used flavor in cakes bread ice cream and so on amaranth red ar a widespread food dye for juices ice cream cans and lots of food as the representative contaminants in food wastewater as a proof of concept the oil was removed efficiently and va as well as ar were degraded quickly in situ indicating the material a great application foreground scheme 1 to the best of our knowledge this is the first work to apply the special wettability material into the food wastewater treatment realizing a highly efficient removal of three different typical contaminants in food waste water with a facile and time saving one step filtration 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials dopamine hydrochloride sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china was used as purchased vanillic aldehyde amaranth red and cerium nitrate hexahydrate ce no3 3 6h2o were of analytical grade from heowns scientific ltd tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane tris urea and cobalt nitrate hexahydrate co no3 3 6h2o were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagents and soybean oil was purchased from supermarket all other chemicals were used without further purification the freshwater microalgae scenedesmus obliquus was supplied by the institute of hydrobiology of chinese academy of sciences and cultivated in 100 ml liquid hb 4medium in 250 ml flasks the axenic cultures were incubated in an environmental chamber using standard lighting and temperature conditions 16 8 light dark cycle illumination 3000 4000 lx 25 c 2 2 fabrication of pda pretreated mesh the stainless steel mesh was immersed in an aqueous solution of dopamine hydrochloride 10 mm after ultrasonic cleaning in acetone to remove the dirt on the surface then a tris solution 1 m ph 8 5 was added dropwise the entire reaction was kept at room temperature in a sealed condition after 24 h the obtained mesh was removed and cleaned by water for further use 2 3 fabrication of ceo2 co3o4 composites on the mesh 1 520 g ce no3 3 6h2o 1 019 g co no3 3 6h2o and 1 051 g urea were dissolved in 35 ml deionized water and then transferred into a 50 ml teflon line stainless steel autoclave the pda pretreated mesh was immersed into the above mixture solution and the autoclave was kept in a conventional oven for 12 h at 110 c then cooling down to room temperature naturally the mesh was washed by deionized water and ethanol for several times and dried at 80 c for 24 h finally the mesh was calcinated at 350 c for 3 h and the functional mesh was obtained the pda ceo2 mesh was fabricated in the same way without using co no3 3 6h2o similarly the pda co3o4 mesh fabricated in the same way without using ce no3 3 6h2o while the ceo2 co3o4 mesh was fabricated following the second step without using dopamine the immobilized amount of ceo2 co3o4 particles was calculated by the equation mi m1 m0 where m1 and m0 are the masses of pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh and pda decorated mesh respectively and the released amount mr is calculated by the equation mr m1 mc where m1 is the initial mass of the pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh and mc is the mass of the pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh after 5 cycles of catalysis and oil separation 2 4 materials characterization fesem and eds images were obtained on a field emission scanning electron microscope su 8010 hitachi limited japan ftir spectra were recorded using a fourier infrared spectrometer nicolet6700 thermo co operation usa the variation of amaranth red and vanillic aldehyde concentration through the catalytic reactions were tested with a perkin elmer lambda 750 uv spectrometer united kingdom x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurements were carried out on a thermo escalab 250 xi spectrometer using an al kα x ray source 1486 6 ev the xrd pattern was measured on a polycrystalline x ray diffractometer with a cu kα radiation source bruker d8 advance bruker axs germany contact angles were measured on a contact angle measurement machine oca 15 machine data physics germany the oil content in the filtrate was measured with an infrared spectrometer oil content analyzer oil 480 beijing chinainvent instrument tech co ltd china inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes was for the ce and co content measurement toc analyzer toc lcph soe 103 was employed to measure toc in the sample solution 2 5 photocatalytic performance test the functional mesh was fixed between two teflon fixtures that were attached with a glass tube whose diameter was 30 mm the photocatalytic performance of the mesh for the degradation of amaranth red and vanillic aldehyde under ultraviolet was evaluated by recording the absorption of the catalyzed solution illuminated by a 125 w high pressure mercury lamp philips hpk 125 w λ 365 nm the solution of ar 5 mg l 1 10 ml va 5 mg l 1 10 ml or ar and va mixture ar and va were 5 mg l 1 respectively 10 ml were poured onto the meshes under the ultralight three meshes were used to reduce the permeation flux the degradation efficiency d was calculated by the equation as follows d 1 ct c0 100 in which the c0 and ct were the initial contaminant concentration and the final concentration after the solution ran out solely by gravity under ultraviolet respectively 2 6 emulsion separation experiment a surfactant free oil in water emulsion was prepared by adding 1 ml edible oil into 100 ml water and sonicating for 30 min the mesh was placed in the same device as the photocatalytic experiment and the emulsion was poured onto the mesh to achieve separation the separation efficiency was measured by the oil rejection coefficient r according to the follow equation r 1 cf c0 100 where the cf and c0 were the oil concentration of the collected filtrate and the original emulsion respectively the corresponding fluxes were calculated by measuring the needed time that collected a certain volume of filtrate 2 7 toxicity measurements the toxicity of the simultaneously treated pollutants was examined by the effects on the growth of freshwater algae scenedesmus obliquus according to the method of oecd 201 briefly first there is a pre culture of 3 days which is intended to give an amount of algae suitable for the inoculation of test cultures measurement of biomass is done by manual cell counting by microscope then 0 ml 1 ml 5 ml treated food wastewater filtrates water as well as culture medium were added into the algae solution and the concentration of the algae was all kept at 4 105 cells ml each group including three replicates all flasks were shaken three times and repositioned daily to prevent clumping of cells at the end of 96 h s obliquus cell density was monitored at od 650 and the inhibition of algae growth was calculated by the cell density of the 5 ml group or 1 ml group minus the controlled group the equation is as follows i yc yt yc 100 where i is the inhibition rate yc is mean value of cell density in the control group and yt is the cell density of the group treated by wasterwater filtrates 3 results and discussion 3 1 sem to investigate the nanostructures of the pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh the field emission scanning electron microscope fesem was conducted firstly the substrates before and after being coated by pda were observed and shown in supporting information fig s1a showed the typical knit of stainless steel while fig s1b was the mesh coated by pda which can also be confirmed by the color change of the substrate after 24 h coating the insert images of figs s1a and b obviously turning brown yellow figs s1c and s1d were the eds images of s1a and s1b respectively the increased ratios of c and o elements and the appearance of n elements are all the hints of pda coating to further investigate the reaction between pda and the substrate ftir spectra of blank substrate and modified mesh were inspected and the detailed analysis was shown in fig s2 providing further proofs of pda modification the special micro nano structures with microspheres composed of interlaced rectangular sheets could be observed in fig 1 a and 1b having increased the roughness of the surface which is critical to the special wettability of the mesh besides the particular microspheres also endued the mesh with large surface areas which would offer more contacts between reactants and materials to validate the needful role of pda the sem images of the mesh without pda treatment in other words coated by ceo2 co3o4 directly were shown in fig 1c and d it can be seen that although the high magnificated structures are similar the low magnificated image shows the uneven growth of ceo2 co3o4 composites on substrate without pda which can also be proved by the insert pictures of fig 1a and c indicating the essential role of pda for dense growth of the bimetal catalyst in the meanwhile pda ceo2 mesh was observed fig 1e and f in contrast with pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh where ceo2 distributed a little sparsely and unevenly with the aggregation in rod shape hinting co3o4 may also contribute to the uniform growth of ceo2 3 2 catalysis of food additives under uv 3 2 1 catalysis of amaranth red ar to further validate the indispensable roles of pda and co3o4 the catalytic abilities of three resultant meshes under uv were tested with the fixture shown in figure s3 5 ppm aqueous solution of amaranth red ar a widely used food dye was poured onto the pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh surface under uv irradiation the faded filtrates run through the mesh solely driven by gravity exhibiting the outstanding catalytic efficiency moreover the same experiments with pda ceo2 and ceo2 co3o4 meshes were carried out and the corresponding uv vis spectra are shown in fig 2 a one can uncover that almost complete dislodge of pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh towards ar was achieved with the degradation efficiency of 99 49 while the efficiencies of ceo2 co3o4 and pda ceo2 meshes were only 74 03 and 76 61 respectively in addition the degradation of ar solely under uv was performed as control fig s4a besides it can be clearly seen that both pda ceo2 and ceo2 co3o4 mesh performed much worse compared with pda ceo2 co3o4 in ar degrading further confirming the necessity of pda and co3o4 which would be discussed later 3 2 2 catalysis of vanillic aldehyde va in addition vanillic aldehyde va is a common food additive to enrich food flavors same manipulation as ar photodegradation was done for 5 ppm va solution here three pieces of pda ceo2 co3o4 meshes were applied to decrease the permeation rate of va solution and increase more sufficient contacts with catalysts the contrast experiments with only uv treatment fig s4b pda ceo2 mesh and ceo2 co3o4 mesh fig 2b were also done it can be concluded that pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh possesses enhanced capacity with an 89 26 degradation rate compared with pda ceo2 mesh 50 43 and ceo2 co3o4 mesh 36 28 proving the critical status of pda and co3o4 besides to exclude the possibility that the removal of ar and va is due to the electrostatic interaction of dopamine ar 5 ppm and va 5 ppm mixed solution was filtrated without uv irradiation almost no change of the absorbance fig s5 verified the role of photodegradation as a result pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh was chosen to be the ideal one and further characterized in the following experiments for understanding the composition and property 3 3 xrd and xps the x ray diffraction pattern is shown in fig s6 with two sets of diffraction peaks that one set labeled red corresponds to ceo2 phase jcpds 34 0394 and the other one labeled green is indexed to co3o4 phase jcpds 43 1003 indicating our resultant material is indeed composed of ceo2 co3o4 hybrid composites meanwhile the surface composition and chemical state were investigated by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps as shown in fig 3 a the peaks of c 1s n 1s and o 1s are further proofs of the successful pda coating and the surface of substrate was covered by ce and co in majority the xps spectrum of o 1s is shown in fig 3b in which o 1s has been deconvolved into two peaks the peak located at 531 4 ev is ascribed to the oxygen in hydroxyl groups while the peak centered at 529 9 ev stands for the surface lattice oxygen in metal oxides yuan et al 2012 zheng et al 2015 fig 3c is the xps spectrum of ce 3d which can be assigned to four pairs of spin orbit doublets the peaks labeled as u1 902 2 ev and v1 884 5 ev are indicative of ce3 while another three doublets u 901 2 ev and v 882 6 ev u2 907 2 ev and v2 887 8 ev u3 917 1 ev and v3 898 7 ev are characteristics of ce4 indicating the coexistence of ce3 and ce4 in the resultant pda ceo2 co3o4 sample which is important for the catalytic ability improvement liu et al 2015 yuan et al 2012 the co 2p xps spectrum in fig 3d shows two major peaks with binding energies at 779 9 ev and 794 8 ev corresponding to co 2p3 2 and co 2p1 2 the value of δe is 15 2 ev which is precisely the value for the mixed valence co3o4 liu et al 2015 therefore xps analysis is in agreement with xrd pattern throwing light on the composition and chemical state of our pda ceo2 co3o4 composites 3 4 food oil and water separation and ph resistance environment it is generally known that food oil is one of major contaminants in food wastewater causing water eutrophication and threatening our environment and daily life seriously aurell and gullett 2010 inspired by oil repellency of fish scales materials with special wettability that are superhydrophilic and superoleophobic underwater have gained considerable attention to achieve oil removal from oily mixtures providing us the inspiration to endow our material with unoil ability feng et al 2002 2004 liu et al 2009 the wetting behaviors of pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh were evaluated by measuring the contact angle ca of water and 1 2 dichloroethane on it figs s7a and s7b owing to the high surface tension of ceo2 co3o4 the mesh is superhydrophilic with the water drop immediately being soaked in addition when immersed in water the mesh shows superoleophobic with oca larger than 150 because water infiltrates the mesh surface and is trapped into the rough structures thus the contact area between oil and mesh is decreased greatly this property provides the possibility for food oil being separated from food wastewater considering practical condition oil usually exists in an emulsified form in food wastewater therefore we prepared a soybean oil in water emulsion with 1 ml oil dispersing in 100 ml h2o sonicating for 1 h to obtain a relatively stable state with the fixture in fig s3 the soybean oil in water emulsion was separated by gravity solely with an efficiency more than 99 attributing to its superhydrophilic property and the dense growth of ceo2 co3o4 composites besides the stability against different ph environments of the mesh was measured fig 4 by immersing it in different ph solutions for 90 min the mesh was stable in a wide range of ph 3 13 while invalid in strong acid environment ph 2 for the ceo2 co3o4 composites would react with h fesem images of the immersed mesh can also prove the strong resistance towards tough ph environments 3 5 reusability test and simulative food wastewater treatment subsequently the reusability of the mesh was tested by catalyzing ar and separating food oil emulsion for 5 times fig 5 a and 5b the degradation efficiency and separation efficiency almost remained unchanged after 5 cycles and fesem images figs s8a and s8b of the tested mesh showed no changes in microstuctures confirming its good reusability moreover simulated food wastewater with ar va and soybean oil together was treated by the above filtrate fixture under uv with one step operation fig 5c and d cheerfully the catalytic efficiency for ar 98 1 and va 84 06 as well as the separation ability for soybean oil emulsion 99 92 were scarcely decreased when contaminants were treated simultaneously compared with the individual operations above besides the performance of ceo2 and co3o4 was evaluated individually fig s9 and results stressed importance of the synergistic effects between ceo2 and co3o4 moreover the water flux was 1 3777 103 l m2 h by measuring the needed time that collected a certain volume of filtrates besides the average immobilized amount of ceo2 co3o4 particles was calculated as 0 1393 g 0 0006 g and after 5 cycles for treating ar and oil the immobilized amount decreased the released amount was 0 0276 g 0 0002 g besides the static and dynamic leaching experiments have been carried out to observe ce or co has been leached out after immersing the mesh in simulated wastewater for 24h and filtrating the wastewater under uv irradiation the soaking solution and filtrate were measured by icp oes results showed there was no existence of ce or co indicating the material friendly to environment as for the mass reduction of the reused mesh it might attribute to the abrasion with the filtration fixture there is a circle imprint after removing the mesh from the fixture seen in fig s10 with such a simple time saving manipulation and high catalytic capacity the co processing with ar va and soybean oil makes pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh a promising candidate for practical production and application 3 6 possible catalytic mechanism of food additives it is evident that pda and co3o4 both play important roles for this ceria based mesh the function of pda is to act as a biological glue to get a denser growth of ceo2 co3o4 which can be verified by the uneven distribution of ceo2 co3o4 on the stainless steel mesh without pda coating however the detailed binding mechanisms of dopamine to substrate still remain unknown lee et al 2006 but might owes to pda contributing to substantial catechol functional groups that could cross link with cerium and cobalt ions in a highly reactive forms then further robustly immobilizing ceo2 co3o4 as for co3o4 the synergistic effect of ceo2 co3o4 has been researched a lot zhen et al 2014 nano ceria has a unique property of easy interchange between reduced ce3 and oxidized states ce4 leading the formation of oxygen vacancies what s more the addition of co3o4 can lead to a slight lattice contraction in the ceria lattice because co3 has a smaller size resulting in more production of oxygen vacancies besides the one component sites like ce4 ce3 and co3 co2 there are also bivalent catalytic centers like ce4 co3 and ce3 co2 and therefore when the bivalent co2 or trivalent co3 replaces the ce4 in ceo2 more oxygen vacancies would be generated for electrostatic balance cui et al 10425 in conclusion the cooperation of ceo2 and co3o4 has largely increased the numbers of oxygen vacancies equation 1 contributing to an enhanced catalytic ability based on the above information an overview of possible photodegradation mechanism of pollutant molecules r is shown in scheme 2 first the redox of metal ions excited by uv light produces some oxygen vacancies turning the oxygen on the mesh surface into active oxygen then the absorbed pollutant molecules by ceo2 co3o4 sites are readily oxidized to co2 and h2o sudarsanam et al 3496 ceo2 ceo2 x ovac co3o4 co2 co3 ovac 1 co2 ceo2 co3 ceo2 x ovac 3 7 mineralization of the food additives and toxicity tests the mineralization of the food additives was measured by toc and the removal efficiency is 80 83 indicating a relatively complete degradation of ar and va having been achieved and the toxicity tests of catalyzed filtrates were evaluated by the inhibition rate towards the growth of freshwater algae scenedesmus obliquus according to the method of oecd 201 huang et al 2012 at the end of 96 h s obliquus cell density in control group was 1 6 109 cells ml and absorbance was 0 562 as a result the group with 1 ml filtrate has a growth cell density with 2 0 109 cells ml and the growth rate was 26 44 with the absorbance at 0 711 this induced effect may be explained by that algae possibly took advantage of a supply of carbon and nitrogen sources coming from the filtrates when added 5 ml filtrate the cell density has a slight decrease about 19 03 appearing at 1 3 109 cells ml with 0 455 absorbance the result shows that a low amount addment of the catalyzed filtrate has very slight effects on the growth of algae showing a low toxicity and friendly to environment besides table s1 showed some works with other methods to process different kinds of food wastewater from the table we can see that compared to the particles photocatalysis pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh has the advantages such as time saving high efficiency easy to collect and without secondary pollution 4 conclusions the pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh was fabricated by a hydrothermal method on the pda pretreated stainless steel substrate here pda has ensured enough amounts of catalysts while the doping of cobalt has greatly improved catalytic ability and provided the mesh special wettability through the pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh food dye ar and food flavor va were almost readily degraded under uv individually and the soybean oil emulsion was also separated with a satisfying efficiency the simulated food wastewater with the three representative contaminants was processed by pda ceo2 co3o4 mesh simultaneously and the result is uplifting with both catalytic ability and separation efficiency rarely influenced the toc removal is high and the catalyzed filtrate shows low toxicity towards algae scenedesmus obliquus the mesh is stable in a wide ph range from 3 to 13 and possesses good reusability in food oil emulsion separation and photodegradation of food dyes compared to other food watsewater treatments this work performs high efficiency time saving facile operation environmental friendly acknowledgement the authors are grateful for financial support from the

19627,arsenic as is toxic to human and is often found in drinking water in india and bangladesh due to the natural abundance of arsenides ores different removal procedures such as precipitation sorption ion exchange and membrane separation have been employed for removal of as from contaminated drinking water cdw however there is a critical need for low cost economically viable biochar modification methods which can enhance as sorption here we studied the effectiveness of zero valent iron zvi biochar complexes produced by high temperature pyrolysis of biomass and magnetite for removing as5 from cdw batch equilibration and column leaching studies show that zvi biochar complexes are effective for removing as5 from cdw for the studied ph range ph 7 7 5 and in the presence of competing ions xps as 3d analysis of zvi biochar complexes exposed to as5 in the batch and column studies show primarily as3 indicating simultaneous oxidation of fe to fe3 and reduction of as5 to as3 sem eds and xrd analyses show isomorphous substitution of as3 for fe3 in neo formed α γ feooh on biochar surfaces which is attribute to co precipitation this study also demonstrates the efficacy of pyrolyzing biomass with low cost iron ores at 900 c to rapidly produce zvi biochar complexes which have potential to be used for treatment of as cdw graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic biochar pyrolysis zero valent iron co precipitation contaminated drinking water 1 introduction arsenic as a metalloid element is toxic to both humans and animals and is often found in environmental samples such as soil sediment water and vegetation in india and bangladesh as is commonly found in soils and sediments due to the natural abundance of arsenide ores mainly of cu ni and fe nickson et al 1998 patel et al 2005 hossain 2006 mobilization of as in sediments by weathering reactions and biological activity mohan and pittman 2007 may cause contamination of surface and groundwater in addition to natural sources inappropriate disposal of as containing agricultural products some pesticides has contributed to the contamination of water resources in the region mandal and suzuki 2002 tragically as contamination of public drinking water has adversely affected the health of at least 50 million people in the bengal delta plain bangladesh and west bengal india and in bihar assam chhattisgarh in india acharya 2002 chakraborti et al 2003 jain 2002 shrivastava et al 2015 arsenic concentrations in groundwater of the bengal delta plain and the ganges alluvial deposits can reach 2000 μg l 1 tondel et al 1999 erickson 2003 whereas the standard provisional guideline of both the world health organization who and united states environmental protection agency usepa for drinking water is 10 μg l 1 different removal procedures such as precipitation sorption ion exchange and membrane separation have been employed for removal of as from drinking water however sorption of as has been found to be the most effective method tuutijarvi et al 2009 mohan et al 2007 wang et al 2015a several studies have demonstrated the sorption of as onto metal oxyhydroxides surfaces and clay minerals containing fe mn al cu and co mandal and suzuki 2002 hematite an abundant and natural fe mineral has also been showed to be a good agent for sorbing as gimenez et al 2007 however auffan et al 2008 showed that synthesized hematite has better as sorption ability than natural hematite because of higher surface area and purity ramirez muniz et al 2012 used thermal treatment to activate hematite to increase its ability to sorb aqueous as in an another study dixit and hering 2003 investigated as mobility and diagenesis of fe oxide minerals by comparing as v and as iii sorption onto amorphous fe oxyhydroxide goethite and magnetite and found that surface complexation reduced as v mobility at near neutral ph conditions in soil as adsorption has been found to increase with increasing fe oh 3 concentration feng et al 2013 couture et al 2013 found strong sorption of arsenate arsenite and thioarsenates onto ferrihydrite although arsenate and arsenite were sorbed to a greater extent than thioarsenates goethite α feo oh is an effective as sorbent with 98 61 removal efficiency and an effluent concentration of 0 005 mg l 1 garrido hoyos and romero velazquez 2016 which is within the who guideline for drinking water zero valent iron zvi has been utilized for the removal of both as iii and as v from aqueous solutions for example zvi in a sand matrix reduced as iii concentrations form 500 μg l 1 to 50 μg l 1 by partial oxidation to as v and precipitation with the forming hydrous ferric oxides leupin and hug 2005 in another batch sorption study lien and wilkin 2005 reported that zvi removed

demonstrated that oxic corrosion of 1 g l 1 zvi to metal hydroxides increases the adsorption of as v up to 99 8 at ph 6 biochar a carbonaceous material has drawn substantial interest due to its ability to sequester carbon lehmann 2007 laird 2008 improve various soil functions chen et al 2012 hale et al 2011 glaser et al 2002 kookana et al 2011 bakshi et al 2014 and reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions spokas 2013 mukherjee and lal 2013 also several studies have shown the potential of biochar to reduce the of mobility and bioavailability of toxic heavy metals bakshi et al 2014 ahmad et al 2014 uchimiya et al 2010 however the sorption of negatively charged arsenate and arsenite onto biochar surfaces is restricted due to the predominance of net negative charge on most biochar surfaces mukherjee et al 2011 yao et al 2012 beesley and marmiroli 2011 several studies have reported that various modifications of biochar surfaces enhance as sorption borah et al 2008 demonstrated that pretreated of biochar with h2so4 increased as v sorption and that as sorption followed the pseudo second order kinetics model hu et al 2015 found that fe impregnated biochar produced by adding fe no3 3 to biochar had an as sorption capacity of 2 16 mg g 1 from aqueous solution whereas untreated biochar had no or little as sorption capacity wang et al 2015b reported that co precipitation of fe and mn is an effective way to prepare fe mn impregnated biochar for arsenate removal sorption capacity of 3 44 mg kg 1 vs 0 50 mg kg 1 for controls wang et al 2015a reported that magnetic biochar prepared from pinewood and natural hematite removed as from aqueous solutions and reported a maximum sorption capacity of 429 mg kg 1 chen et al 2011 found that fe oxide biochar composites produced by pyrolysis of fecl3 salt with biomass greatly enhanced as sorption similar observation was found by zhang et al 2013 however they prepared there composites by precipitation of fe2 fe3 onto biochar surface zvi biochar complexes have been evaluated for removal of as from water in several previous studies in the presence of dispersing and soldering agent chitosan biochar supported zvi has been shown to sorb as on the fe particles with efficacy increasing 23 95 sorbed with increasing fe content zhou et al 2014 support of nanoscale zvi on activated carbon increased sorption of both as iii and as v the maximum sorption capacities with a 72 h of equilibrium time were 18 2 and 12 0 mg g 1 respectively zhu et al 2009 in these studies the zvi and biochar were produced separately and then physically mixed together which may make zvi biochar complexes cost prohibitive for practical applications recently however lawrinenko et al 2017 showed that zvi biochar complexes could be produced by pyrolyzing mixtures of fecl3 or magnetite and biomass feedstocks at high temperatures 900 c the authors observed the formation of zvi with low ash biomass feedstocks and formation of fayalite and fe phosphates and phosphides in presence of high ash feedstocks i e high si and p content of the biomass the process used by lawrinenko et al 2017 has the potential to greatly reduce the cost of producing zvi biochar complexes relative to producing biochar and zvi separately and combining them in some way to form zvi biochar complexes in prior studies zvi and biochars have been produced separately and then physically mixed together or fe3 has been added to biochars and then chemically reduced these production process significantly increase the cost of producing zvi biochar complexes therefore the main objectives of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of low cost zvi biochar complexes produced by co pyrolysis of high and low ash biomass feedstocks in the presence of magnetite furthermore no prior studies have identifying mechanisms of as sorption by zvi biochar complexes therefore our second objective was to investigate mechanisms of as sorption by zvi biochar complexes we hypothesize that zvi biochar complexes are highly effective for removal of as5 from cdw because zvi provides electrons for reduction of as5 to as3 and as3 is co precipitated with fe3 forming secondary fe as oxyhydroxides on biochar surfaces 2 material and methods 2 1 reagents analytical grade chemicals and 18 2 mῳ milli q water nanopure water barnstead were used in this study

equilibrium sorption study as sorption by the zvi biochar complexes was evaluated using a batch equilibration method about 0 05 g of zvi biochar complexes both zvi ro and zvi sg was placed in 60 ml

isotherm the batch equilibration study indicated substantial sorption of as onto zvi biochar complexes the relationship between as equilibrium 48 h concentration in solution mg l 1 and as sorbed mg g 1 on the zvi biochar complexes was well described r2 0 98 table 1 by the langmuir isotherm model fig 1 a and b the amount of as sorbed from the highest concentration solution q e experimental table 1 and the sorption maximum as predicted by the langmuir isotherm model were in close agreement table 1 the results indicate that the sorption maximum was greater for the zvi ro than for the zvi sg and that sorption maximum increased with decreasing amount of zvi biochar complex in the solution the maximum adsorption capacities of as v found on zvi ro 15 58 mg g 1 zvi biochar complex equivalent to 26 12 mg g 1 fe and zvi sg 7 92 mg g 1 zvi biochar complex equivalent to 14 21 mg g 1 fe for our experimental conditions are higher than reported previously for most as sorption on zvi studies thirunavukkarasu et al 2003 hristovski et al 2009 sun et al 2006 lin and wu 2001 but lower than reported by zhu et al 2009 and wang et al 2017 possibly due to the higher as fe ratios used in the later studies which facilitates higher as sorption capacities by contrast the control experiments with ro and sg biochars no zvi yielded maximum as v adsorption capacities of 1 42 and 1 15 mg g 1 respectively data not shown the ro magnetite and sg magnetite and magnetite only controls exhibited a similar response to the biochar only controls with maximum as v adsorption capacities of 1 6 mg g 1 for all cases results for these controls demonstrate that neither biochar alone nor magnetite alone nor physical mixtures of biochar and magnetite are effective for as v sorption under our experimental conditions 3 2 sorption kinetics of as results of the batch kinetic study showed rapid sorption of as onto zvi biochar complexes fig 2 a and b the as removed after 48 h for the 0 05 g and 0 2 g loading treatments was 59 4 and 69 1 for zvi ro and 24 6 and 57 8 for the zvi sg respectively by contrast controls consisting of biochar alone magnetite alone and physical mixtures of biochar and magnetite removed only 4 11 of as v from the solution after 48 h data not shown only a weak linear relationship was found between the amount of zvi and the as sorption capacity r2 0 81 for zvi ro vs 0 65 for zvi sg as sorption occurred rapidly during the first 4 h and more slowly thereafter reaching equilibrium after about 48 h previously such kinetics have been attributed to rapid initial formation of outer sphere complexes followed by slower formation of inner sphere complexes essington 2004 higher loading of sorbent reduced the as sorption intensity mg g 1 for both zvi ro and zvi sg complexes this loading effect has previously been attributed to the formation of fe oxides or fe ooh layers over zvi surfaces bang et al 2005b the loading effect also could be partially explained by dilution as as is adsorbed the concentration of as in the solution decreases hence there is less adsorption of as per gram of zvi however dilution cannot explain all of the loading effect in our study for example after 48 h the zvi ro 0 2 g adsorbed only 9 7 more of the total as than the zvi ro 0 05 g despite having 4 times as much zvi biochar in the system both of these systems still had significant amounts of as remaining in the aqueous phase after 48 h 40 6 and 30 9 of the original concentrations respectively the as sorption kinetics data were well described fig 2a and b by the pseudo 2nd order kinetic model aksu 2001 the correlation coefficients assessed by plotting t q t vs t where q t as sorbed at time t mg g 1 for the linear form of the model are excellent r2 0 91 table 1 also the calculated q e sorption of as at equilibrium in mg g 1 values agree very well with the experimental q e 48 h equilibration and the langmuir q max results table 1 we also evaluated the rate parameter for intra particle diffusion using the equation q t k int t 1 2 c and determined that the multilinear plots did not pass through the origin suggesting that intra particle diffusion was not the rate controlling step önal et al 2007 previous research has suggested that relatively fast surface adsorption and relatively slow intra particle diffusion contributed to the adsorption of as on α feooh however when zvi is present the co precipitation of as with feooh may take place simultaneously yan et al 2012 langmuir et al 2006 eljamal et al 2011 3 3 sorption of as in the column study results of the column study showed that zvi biochar complexes are effective for removing some but not all as from drinking water in a leaching column the cumulative as removal decreases with time for all zvi biochar and control columns however the zvi biochar columns were substantially more effective for removing as than the control columns fig 3 a and b the zvi ro sorbed 44 8 of the added as at the end of the 16 leaching events whereas the zvi sg sorbed 36 3 of the added as moreover the cumulative as removal for zvi ro decreased from 81 8 to 44 8 over the course of 16 leaching events with 50 μg as additions per event whereas the cumulative as removal for zvi sg decreased from 50 97 to 36 3 supplemental fig s2 the as concentrations were much lower in leachate from the zvi biochar columns compare with leachate from the biochar only columns fig 3a the concentration of as in leachates from the zvi ro and zvi sg columns reached 0 76 and 0 74 mg l 1 respectively after 16 leaching events 800 ml whereas as concentrations in leachate from the pristine ro and sg biochar columns reached 0 9 mg l 1 after the 2nd leaching event we also measured fe concentrations in the column study leachates for both the 24 h pre equilibration period and for leachates when as solution was added to the columns the data is not shown because we found only very small amounts of fe in the leachates for control columns the ro and sg biochars initially removed only 12 5 and 10 6 of as and the removal decreased to 2 72 and 2 2 respectively at the end of 16 leaching events the ro magnetite sg magnetite and magnetite only columns data not shown showed a similar response to biochar control columns suggesting the presence of raw magnetite ore by itself or physically mixed with the biochars was not effective for as removal from water in the columns overall after addition of 800 μg of as in 16 column leaching events 1 g of zvi ro removed 358 5 μg of as 44 8 efficient and 1 g of zvi sg removed 290 98 μg of as 36 3 efficient whereas the ro and sg controls biochar only removed only 20 6 and 16 13 μg of as respectively this result suggests that zvi biochar complexes increased as sorption 15 fold compare with control biochars strong linear correlations between leaching volume ml and as sorbed μg were found for zvi ro and zvi sg fig 3b r2 0 99 even after 16 leaching events whereas the linear relationship started to collapse after 14 leaching events for both control biochars suggesting that the controls were starting to release some of the previously sorbed as 3 4 sem eds analysis the sem eds analysis was done for samples of the zvi ro and zvi sg complexes fig 4 a and b respectively recovered after the 48 h batch equilibration study to investigate the distribution of c o fe si and as the light gray color on the right side of the zvi ro sem image point 1 in fig 4a indicates an area of high electron density and the eds analysis of this region indicates 70 fe 23 o and 6 c edx data are given as atom with negligible as we infer that light gray region represented by point 1 is a residual zvi particle perhaps with a surface oxyhydroxide coating the stoichiometry of point 1 may be contrasted with that of point 2 which has 51 o 26 fe 16 7 c and 2 76 as the stoichiometry of point 2 is consistent with an feooh phase which must have been neo formed as zvi was being oxidized the light gray electron dense region represented by point 2 appears to be crust or surface coating that formed on top of a dark low electron density porous particle most likely a particle of biochar evident at the bottom center of the sem micrograph point 3 in the upper left corner of the sem in fig 4a has a stoichiometry of 50 o 18 6 si 8 7 fe and 11 8 c which suggests that it is a mixture of silicate phases possibly quartz and or fayalite while as is diffusely present on all surfaces it is clearly concentrated in the newly formed feooh phase point 2 and is not significantly associated with the zvi or silicate rich phases fig 4b shows a similar sem eds analysis for a sample of the zvi sg complexes recovered from the batch equilibration experiment point 1 in fig 4b has a stoichiometry 54 8 fe and 40 8 o which is roughly equivalent with wustite feo and contains negligible as while points 2 50 9 o and 31 3 fe and 3 56 5 o and 28 0 fe have stoichiometry s more consistent with feooh and contain 2 6 and 3 9 as respectively thus the sem eds data for both zvi ro and zvi sg indicate that as is selectively adsorbed in the newly formed feooh phase and not on zvi feo or fe si phases 3 5 xrd analysis xrd analysis of the original zvi ro and zvi sg biochar complexes show only small residual magnetite peaks and prominent α fe zvi peaks indicating that much of the fe in the magnetite was reduce to zvi during pyrolysis fig 5 the xrd pattern for the original zvi sg biochar also has small peaks for wustite feo while the xrd peaks for the original zvi sg biochar has peaks for both fayalite fe2 2 sio4 and wustite feo there was no evidence of either fayalite or wustite in the xrd patterns of the magnetite ore hence these phases must have formed during pyrolysis the 44 9 2θ α fe peak for the zvi sg biochar is about half as intense as the 44 9 2θ peak in the xrd pattern for the zvi ro biochar this result indicates that a greater fraction of the magnetite fe was recrystallized as fayalite and wustite relative to α fe during pyrolysis of the high ash switchgrass whereas a greater fraction of the magnetite fe was recrystallized as α fe during pyrolysis of the low ash red oak biomass thus the results show that feedstock properties influence the fe mineralogy and the production of zvi during the co pyrolysis of biomass feedstocks with magnetite iron ore much of the α fe in the zvi biochar complexes was transformed into other phases during the batch equilibration and column leaching studies as evidenced by the decrease in intensity of the 44 9 2θ α fe xrd peaks fig 5 the xrd pattern for samples collected from the zvi ro biochar columns after leaching show prominent peaks for goethite α feooh akaganeite β feooh wustite and magnetite while the xrd patterns for the zvi ro biochar samples collected from the batch equilibrium study indicate the presence of goethite and lepidocrocite γ feooh wustite and magnetite for the zvi sg biochar xrd patterns for samples from the column study show peaks for goethite fayalite wustite and magnetite while xrd patterns for samples from the batch study show peaks for lepidocrocite fayalite wustite and magnetite the results indicate that the iron oxyhydroxide phases formed during the column leaching and batch equilibration studies were influenced by both feedstock and conditions during the oxidation reactions specifically the preferential formation of goethite in the column study and lepidocrocite in the batch equilibration study might be due to more oxidizing conditions that prevailed in the columns carlson and schwertmann 1990 which increased the ph of the column leachates to more than 7 5 which is favorable for the formation of goethite but not lepidocrocite boland et al 2014 a more oxidizing environment in the column relative to the batch study is also supported by greater magnetite and wustite peak intensities for zvi ro and zvi sg samples collected from the batch study relative to the column study we also observed that the 26 644 2θ quartz peak is more intense for samples from the column experiments than the batch study however this is attributed to incomplete separation of the biochar from the quartz sand used in the column experiment thus the xrd evidence fig 5 is consistent with sem eds analysis fig 4 in indicating that zvi was partially oxidized primarily forming goethite akaganeite and lepidocrocite and to a lesser extent wustite and magnetite during the batch equilibration and column leaching studies isomorphous substitution of elements with ionic radii different from that of fe3 in the crystal structures of iron oxyhydroxides is evidenced by shifts in hkl lattice spacings relative to lattice spacings of pristine mineral phases schulze and schwertmann 1987 schwertmann and wolska 1990 here we observed d values of 4 173 2 44 and 2 182 for the 110 111 and 140 hkl lattices spacings respectively in goethite for samples of zvi ro and zvi sg complexes recovered from the column experiment these lattice spacings may be compared with 4 183 2 450 and 2 19 respectively for synthetic goethite anthony et al 1997 similarly we observed d values of 6 25 3 28 and 1 93 for the 020 021 and 002 hkl lattices spacings of lepidocrocite in the zvi ro and zvi sg complexes recovered from the batch equilibration study which may be compared with 6 26 3 29 and 1 937 for synthetic lepidocrocite anthony et al 1997 and we observed d values of 7 431 2 53 and 2 282 for the 110 211 and 301 hkl lattice spacings of akaganeite in the zvi ro complexes recovered from the column study which may be compared with 7 467 2 55 and 2 295 for synthetic akaganeite anthony et al 1997 these observed shifts to shorter lattice spacings indicate possible isomorphous substitution of trivalent as as3 r 0 58 å for trivalent fe fe3 r 0 64 å in the crystal structure of the fe oxyhydroxides isomorphous substitution of al for fe in lepidocrocite and goethite is commonly observed schulze and schwertmann 1987 schwertmann and wolska 1990 isomorphous substitution of as3 for fe3 in the various feooh phases is supported by the sem eds data showing up to 3 atom as selectively associated with the feooh minerals fig 4 and by the xps as 3d data fig 6 showing a dominance of as3 in the adsorbed phases the xrd peak shifts observed here are very small and this study was not specifically designed to study isomorphous substitution hence more research is needed to confirm this finding 3 6 xps analysis the xps as 3d spectra for zvi biochar samples recovered from the batch and column experiments are presented in fig 6 the as 3d spectra indicate the presence of both trivalent and pentavalent forms of as however higher peak intensities for the trivalent form is evident for all the zvi biochars recovered from the batch and column experiments moreover the as 3d peak is shifted to the lower binding energy 43 ev instead of 44 8 ev for the trivalent as suggesting the possible association of trivalent as with fe o day et al 2004 the synthetic drinking water used in both the column and batch studies contained only as5 hence the presence of as3 in the zvi biochar samples indicates that some of the as5 was reduced during both the column and batch experiments 4 discussion 4 1 overall findings and proposed mechanism the xrd results clearly indicate that the zvi formed during pyrolysis of magnetite mixed with ro and sg biomass was partially oxidized during the batch equilibration and column leaching experiments forming various feooh phases goethite lepidocrocite and akaganeite and to a lesser extent magnetite and wustite the sem eds data shows that as is associated with mineral phases having a 2 1 o fe stoichiometry which we infer to be the various feooh phases that formed during the batch equilibration and column leaching experiments we added only arsenate as5 during the batch and column experiments yet the xps data clearly shows that arsenite as3 is the primary form of as associated with zvi biochar samples recovered from the batch and column experiments furthermore the small shifts in lattice spacing s for goethite and lepidocrocite in samples recovered from the batch and column experiments relative to lattice spacing s of pristine synthetic samples of these minerals is consistent with isomorphous substitution of as3 into the structure of the feooh minerals thus we infer a coupled redox reaction by which as5 is reduced to as3 while fe is oxidized first to fe2 and then fe3 furthermore we infer the co precipitation of fe3 and as3 with the formation of various fe as ooh phases fig 7 pathway 1 although not definitive evidence the sem micrograph in fig 4a shows what appears to be a surface coating of fe as ooh on top of a biochar particle and a separate residual fe particle with perhaps a thin oxyhydroxide surface coating 2 7 o fe stoichiometry having negligible as this evidence suggests that as zvi particles were dissolved by corrosion reactions the various fe as ooh phases were neo formed on adjacent biochar surfaces the biochar which is a semiconductor may have facilitated electron transfer from the zvi to o2 or as5 ions and thereby promoted the precipitation reaction the adsorption of as by the zvi biochar complexes was much less efficient during the column leaching experiment relative to the batch equilibrium or kinetics experiments only 36 3 44 8 of added as was removed from the contaminated drinking water leaching through the columns before leaching began the columns were saturated with milli q water and pre equilibrated for 24 h this pre equilibration would have allowed at least some of the zvi in the zvi biochar complexes to be oxidized forming feooh phases before the columns were ever exposed to the simulated drinking water containing as furthermore the column study included 16 leaching events with a 20 h interval between events this additional time and exposure to water and o2 during the leaching process would have further promoted oxidation of zvi to feooh because substantial more feooh was present in the columns than the samples use for the batch equilibrium or kinetic studies it is likely that a greater fraction of the as retained in the column study was retained by surface adsorption on already formed feooh followed by intra particle diffusion as reported in other studies dixit and hering 2003 badruzzaman et al 2004 while in the batch studies a greater fraction of the as was retained by co precipitation of fe as ooh our results suggest that both surface adsorption followed by intra particle diffusion and co precipitation of as3 with fe3 during the neo formation of fe as ooh mineral phases may occur when as is present in solution as zvi corrodes this finding may be contrasted with previous literature which has primarily reported adsorption of haso4 2 on surfaces of iron oxyhydroxides followed by intra particle diffusion dixit and hering 2003 badruzzaman et al 2004 reported that intra particle diffusion was the dominant adsorption mechanism explaining as5 adsorption kinetics on granular ferric hydroxide in another study an fe bearing adsorbent was used to remove as5 from natural ground water and again intra particle diffusion was suggested as the primary adsorption process ciopec et al 2014 also borah et al 2008 indicated intra particle diffusion for as5 adsorption on surface modified carbon black although the authors acknowledged that the intra particle diffusion was not the rate determining step we infer that the co precipitation mechanism fig 7 pathway 1 was dominant in our batch equilibrium and batch kinetic studies because fresh zvi biochars were added directly to as cdw while in the column study we infer that both co precipitation and surface adsorption and intra particle diffusion mechanisms fig 7 pathway 2 were likely occurring because the zvi biochars had previously been exposed to di water for 24 h before the as cdw was introduced the initial rapid reaction phase observed in the batch kinetic study is attributed to the presence of smaller zvi particles which dissolves rapidly leading to rapid formation of fe as ooh precipitate later the supply of fe2 in solution may have been limiting as larger zvi particles dissolved more slowly in the column study because of the 24 h pre equilibration treatments fine zvi particles may have already dissolved and hence the supply of fe2 and e may have limited the co precipitation reaction the batch adsorption and kinetics experiments figs 1 and 2 table 1 show clear evidence for the effect of zvi biochar type and loading on the efficiency q max of the zvi biochar complexes for adsorption of as the effect of zvi biochar type here zvi ro vs zvi sg is attributed to the relative amounts of zvi formed during pyrolysis the original zvi ro has more zvi than the zvi sg because some of the magnetite fe formed fayalite and wustite rather than zvi when the high ash switchgrass biomass was pyrolyzed the zvi biochar loading effect is attributed to the relative supplies of as and fe in the systems during the reactions the higher loading 0 2 g zvi biochar was less efficient for adsorbing as because the supply of as was limiting while the lower loading 0 05 g zvi biochar was more efficient because of a higher as fe ratio in the system supplemental fig s2 4 2 environmental implications the efficiency of zvi for removal of as from water is well established and zvi has been used in practice for removal of as from contaminated drinking water for at last two decades zhou et al 2014 zhu et al 2009 wang et al 2017 bang et al 2005b eljamal et al 2011 wu et al 2017 lien and wilkin 2005 however a better understanding of the mechanism of as sorption by iron oxyhydroxide phases in the presence of zvi particles may improve strategies the remediation of as contaminated water surface ground drinking our data suggest that the coupled oxidation of fe with the reduction of as5 and the co precipitation of as3 with fe3 leading to neo formation of fe as ooh mineral phases is a rapid and efficient mechanism for removing as from water while surfaces adsorption of as onto preexisting feooh minerals and intra particle diffusion will be slower and less efficient thus the design of systems that optimize conditions for the co precipitation reaction are expected to be more efficient at removal of as from contaminated water a second key finding of our research is that zvi can be made cheaply and rapidly by co pyrolyzing biomass and magnetite at high temperatures this method of producing zvi is potentially less expensive than producing fe by smelting iron ore and subsequently grinding the iron metal to produce fine particles of zvi zvi biochar complexes can be produced by mixing low cost iron ore with low cost biomass and then pyrolyzing the mixture at high temperature 900 c our data demonstrates that use of a low ash biomass such as hardwood sawdust will enhance formation of zvi and the efficacy of the zvi biochar for removing as form water furthermore zvi biochar complexes may be useful for removing various organic contaminants from water in addition to as biochar is known to adsorb various organic compounds and the zvi biochar complexes should be effective for reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated organic compounds ahmad et al 2014 dutta et al 2017 komnitsas and zaharaki 2016 li et al 2017 rajapaksha et al 2016 silvani et al 2017 one area of concern is that the efficacy of zvi biochar complexes to remove as and other contaminants from water is finite for any practical applications the zvi biochar should be replaced on a regular basis to maintain system efficacy there is thus a risk that systems will not be maintained and that people or animals will be poisoned by drinking water from poorly maintained systems furthermore the exhausted zvi biochar complexes will be a hazardous waste contaminated with as and must be disposed of properly further engineering research on the design of water filtration systems is needed to produce more effective zvi biochar systems for remediation of as contaminated water resources 5 conclusions 1 zero valent iron zvi biochar complexes produced by high temperature pyrolysis of low ash biomass feedstocks and magnetite are effective for removing as5 from contaminated drinking water in the studied ph range ph 7 7 5 and in presence of competing ions 2 as is removed from water by two mechanisms in the presence of zvi a simultaneous reduction of as5 to as3 and oxidation of fe0 to fe3 and the co precipitation of as3 and fe3 leading to the formation of fe as ooh onto biochar surfaces and b adsorption of as on preexisting feooh mineral surfaces followed by intra particle diffusion 3 the co precipitation batch sorption and kinetics study here mechanism is more rapid than surface adsorption and intra particle diffusion mechanism 4 as is dominantly sorbed by feooh minerals goethite akaganeite and lepidocrocite and only weakly sorbed by wustite fayalite and zvi in zvi biochars 5 the production of zvi biochar using a high ash biomass here sg leads to greater formation of fayalite and wustite at the expense of zvi and hence biochar zvi complexes that are less effective for removal of as than using a low ash biomass feedstock here ro 6 as sorption intensity decreases with increasing loading of zvi biochars acknowledgements we thank warren straszheim and dapeng jing of materials analysis and research laboratory

sorption ion exchange and membrane separation have been employed for removal of as from contaminated drinking water cdw however there is a critical need for low cost economically viable biochar

contamination of public drinking water has adversely affected the health of at least 50 million people in the bengal delta plain bangladesh and west bengal india and in bihar assam chhattisgarh in india acharya 2002 chakraborti et al 2003 jain 2002 shrivastava et al 2015 arsenic concentrations in groundwater of the bengal delta plain and the ganges alluvial deposits can reach 2000 μg l 1 tondel et al 1999 erickson 2003 whereas the standard provisional guideline of both the world health organization who and united states environmental protection agency usepa for drinking water is 10 μg l 1 different removal procedures such as precipitation sorption ion exchange and membrane separation have been employed for removal of as from drinking water however sorption of as has been found to be the most effective method tuutijarvi et al 2009 mohan et al 2007 wang et al 2015a several studies have demonstrated the sorption of as onto metal oxyhydroxides surfaces and clay minerals containing fe mn al cu and co mandal and suzuki 2002 hematite an abundant and natural fe mineral has also been showed to be a good agent for sorbing as gimenez et al 2007 however auffan et al 2008 showed that synthesized hematite has better as sorption ability than natural hematite because of higher surface area and purity ramirez muniz et al 2012 used thermal treatment to activate hematite to increase its ability to sorb aqueous as in an another study dixit and hering 2003 investigated as mobility and diagenesis of fe oxide minerals by comparing as v and as iii sorption onto amorphous fe oxyhydroxide goethite and magnetite and found that surface complexation reduced as v mobility at near neutral ph conditions in soil as adsorption has been found to increase with increasing fe oh 3 concentration feng et al 2013 couture et al 2013 found strong sorption of arsenate arsenite and thioarsenates onto ferrihydrite although arsenate and arsenite were sorbed to a greater extent than thioarsenates goethite α feo oh is an effective as sorbent with 98 61 removal efficiency and an effluent concentration of 0 005 mg l 1 garrido hoyos and romero velazquez 2016 which is within the who guideline for drinking water zero valent iron zvi has been utilized for the removal of both as iii and as v from aqueous solutions for example zvi in a sand matrix reduced as iii concentrations form 500 μg l 1 to 50 μg l 1 by partial oxidation to as v and precipitation with the forming hydrous ferric oxides leupin and hug 2005 in another batch sorption study lien and wilkin 2005 reported that zvi removed arsenite from simulated groundwater containing 50 mg l 1 as in two step process initially fast and then slow removal of as from solution and a 7 5 mg as g 1 fe as removal capacity bang et al 2005a demonstrated that oxic corrosion of 1 g l 1 zvi to metal hydroxides increases the adsorption of as v up to 99 8 at ph 6 biochar a carbonaceous material has drawn substantial interest due to its ability to sequester carbon lehmann 2007 laird 2008 improve various soil functions chen et al 2012 hale et al 2011 glaser et al 2002 kookana et al 2011 bakshi et al 2014 and reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions spokas 2013 mukherjee and lal 2013 also several studies have shown the potential of biochar to reduce the of mobility and bioavailability of toxic heavy metals bakshi et al 2014 ahmad et al 2014 uchimiya et al 2010 however the sorption of negatively charged arsenate and arsenite onto biochar surfaces is restricted due to the predominance of net negative charge on most biochar surfaces mukherjee et al 2011 yao et al 2012 beesley and marmiroli 2011 several studies have reported that various modifications of biochar surfaces enhance as sorption borah et al 2008 demonstrated that pretreated of biochar with h2so4 increased as v sorption and that as sorption followed the pseudo second order kinetics model hu et al 2015 found that fe impregnated biochar produced by adding fe no3 3 to biochar had an as sorption capacity of 2 16 mg g 1 from aqueous solution whereas untreated biochar had no or little as sorption capacity wang et al 2015b reported that co precipitation of fe and mn is an effective way to prepare fe mn impregnated biochar for arsenate removal sorption capacity of 3 44 mg kg 1 vs 0 50 mg kg 1 for controls wang et al 2015a reported that magnetic biochar prepared from pinewood and natural hematite removed as from aqueous solutions and reported a maximum sorption capacity of 429 mg kg 1 chen et al 2011 found that fe oxide biochar composites produced by pyrolysis of fecl3 salt with biomass greatly enhanced as sorption similar observation was found by zhang et al 2013 however they prepared there composites by precipitation of fe2 fe3 onto biochar surface zvi biochar complexes have been evaluated for removal of as from water in several previous studies in the presence of dispersing and soldering agent chitosan biochar supported zvi has been shown to sorb as on the fe particles with efficacy increasing 23 95 sorbed with increasing fe content zhou et al 2014 support of nanoscale zvi on activated carbon increased sorption of both as iii and as v the maximum sorption capacities with a 72 h of equilibrium time were 18 2 and 12 0 mg g 1 respectively zhu et al 2009 in these studies the zvi and biochar were produced separately and then physically mixed together which may make zvi biochar complexes cost prohibitive for practical applications recently however lawrinenko et al 2017 showed that zvi biochar complexes could be produced by pyrolyzing mixtures of fecl3 or magnetite and biomass feedstocks at high temperatures 900 c the authors observed the formation of zvi with low ash biomass feedstocks and formation of fayalite and fe phosphates and phosphides in presence of high ash feedstocks i e high si and p content of the biomass the process used by lawrinenko et al 2017 has the potential to greatly reduce the cost of producing zvi biochar complexes relative to producing biochar and zvi separately and combining them in some way to form zvi biochar complexes in prior studies zvi and biochars have been produced separately and then physically mixed together or fe3 has been added to biochars and then chemically reduced these production process significantly increase the cost of producing zvi biochar complexes therefore the main objectives of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of low cost zvi biochar complexes produced by co pyrolysis of high and low ash biomass feedstocks in the presence of magnetite furthermore no prior studies have identifying mechanisms of as sorption by zvi biochar complexes therefore our second objective was to investigate mechanisms of as sorption by zvi biochar complexes we hypothesize that zvi biochar complexes are highly effective for removal of as5 from cdw because zvi provides electrons for reduction of as5 to as3 and as3 is co precipitated with fe3 forming secondary fe as oxyhydroxides on biochar surfaces 2 material and methods 2 1 reagents analytical grade chemicals and 18 2 mῳ milli q water nanopure water barnstead were used in this study

the zvi biochar complexes was 7 h the zvi ro and zvi sg biochars were grounded and sieved through 0 5 mm sieve in a glove box under n2 atmosphere anaerobic condition and stored in a sealed container for further analysis xrd analysis of the sieved zvi ro or zvi sg biochars confirmed the presence of zvi peak at 44 9 2θ controls consisting of physical mixtures of biochar and magnetite were also prepared to produce the biochar magnetite ro magnetite or sg magnetite controls the magnetite suspension prepared as previously mentioned was mixed thoroughly with the sieved biochar target biochar to

analytical grade chemicals of the above ions into six separate carboys arsenic was added to achieve 1 5 10 15 20 and 25 mg l 1 and the carboys filled with milli q water to the mark of 20 l the ph of the simulated drinking water was adjusted to 7 7 2 to remove the dissolved oxygen the flasks were purged with n2 at the constant rate of 400 ml min 1 for 30 min prior to any experiment 2 4 batch equilibrium sorption study as sorption by the zvi biochar complexes was evaluated using a batch equilibration method about 0 05 g of zvi biochar complexes both zvi ro and zvi sg was placed in 60 ml nalgene bottles with 50 ml of simulated drinking water of various as initial concentrations 0 1 5 10 15 20 and 25 mg l 1 after shaking in a reciprocating shaker for 48 h the suspensions were filtered through whatman 42 filter paper and the filtrates were collected in 20 ml scintillation vials for analysis using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes blank samples with only the as solution for each sampling time were used to account for any as sorbed onto the nalgene bottles and filter paper control experiments with untreated biochars only magnetite only and physical mixtures of biochar and magnetite were also carried out the amount of as sorbed onto sorbents were calculated by the difference in as concentration between the initial and final solutions and the sorption isotherm data were fitted using langmuir isotherm model 2 5 batch sorption kinetic study a batch kinetic study was done by adding various amounts of 4 sorbents 0 05 0 1 and 0 2 g biochar

agitated for 0 4 24 and 48 h at room temperature 21 5 c at each sampling time the suspensions were filtered through whatman 42 filter paper and the filtrates were collected in 20 ml scintillation vials for analysis by icp oes blank sample with only as solution were prepared and analyzed for each sampling time to account for any as sorption onto the nalgene bottles the amount of as sorbed onto sorbents were calculated by the difference in as concentration between initial and final solution and the kinetic data were fitted using the pseudo 2nd order kinetic model 2 6 column leaching experiment a column leaching experiment was carried out to assess the efficacy of the zvi biochar complexes under conditions relevant for drinking water decontamination materials used to build the columns consisted of pvc tubes 22 9 cm length 3 8 cm diameter with end caps fine sand 40 mesh purchased from fisher scientific glass beads particle size 0 5 mm and glass microfiber filter paper whatman pore size 0 7 μm in brief the columns were mounted vertically and the following sequence of the materials were added filter paper 90 g fine sand filter paper 1 g sorbent biochar magnetite biochar magnetite or zvi biochar complexes filter paper 50 g fine sand 160 g glass beads a valve was inserted at the bottom of each column to control leaching rate the top of each column was covered with plastic cover to prevent contamination between leaching events before leaching all the columns were saturated with milli q water for 24 h the pore volume of saturated columns was calculated by the weight difference between before and after water saturation the columns were leached at a fixed time interval 20 h for each leaching event an aliquot of 50 ml of 1 mg l 1 as contaminated drinking water was added manually to the top of each column the leachate was collected in 60 ml nalgene bottles and stored at 4 c before analysis using icp oes 2 7 characterizations and analysis the ph of the leachates was measured using a ph meter orion star a215 elemental c h n and s content of sorbents were analyzed using a c n combustion analyzer vario microcube elementar analysensysteme gmbh after samples were ground in a ball mill inorganic elemental composition of sorbents was determined by dry ashing the biochar samples and then solubilizing the ash by closed vessel digestion hossner 1996

isotherm the batch equilibration study indicated substantial sorption of as onto zvi biochar complexes the relationship between as equilibrium 48 h concentration in solution mg l 1 and as sorbed mg g 1 on the zvi biochar complexes was well described r2 0 98 table 1 by the langmuir isotherm model fig 1 a and b the amount of as sorbed from the highest concentration solution q e experimental table 1 and the sorption maximum as predicted by the langmuir isotherm model were in close agreement table 1 the results indicate that the sorption maximum was greater for the zvi ro than for the zvi sg and that sorption maximum increased with decreasing amount of zvi biochar complex in the solution the maximum adsorption capacities of as v found on zvi ro 15 58 mg g 1 zvi biochar complex equivalent to 26 12 mg g 1 fe and zvi sg 7 92 mg g 1 zvi biochar complex equivalent to 14 21 mg g 1 fe for our experimental conditions are higher than reported previously for most as sorption on zvi studies thirunavukkarasu et al 2003 hristovski et al 2009 sun et al 2006 lin and wu 2001 but lower than reported by zhu et al 2009 and wang et al 2017 possibly due to the higher as fe ratios used in the later studies which facilitates higher as sorption capacities by contrast the control experiments with ro and sg biochars no zvi yielded maximum as v adsorption capacities of 1 42 and 1 15 mg g 1 respectively data not shown the ro magnetite and sg magnetite and magnetite only controls exhibited a similar response to the biochar only controls with maximum as v adsorption capacities of 1 6 mg g 1 for all cases results for these controls demonstrate that neither biochar alone nor magnetite alone nor physical mixtures of biochar and magnetite are effective for as v sorption under our experimental conditions 3 2 sorption kinetics of as results of the batch kinetic study showed rapid sorption of as onto zvi biochar complexes fig 2 a and b the as removed after 48 h for the 0 05 g and 0 2 g loading treatments was 59 4 and 69 1 for zvi ro and 24 6 and 57 8 for the zvi sg respectively by contrast controls consisting of biochar alone magnetite alone and physical mixtures of biochar and magnetite removed only 4 11 of as v from the solution after 48 h data not shown only a weak linear relationship was found between the amount of zvi and the as sorption capacity r2 0 81 for zvi ro vs 0 65 for zvi sg as sorption occurred rapidly during the first 4 h and more slowly thereafter reaching equilibrium after about 48 h previously such kinetics have been attributed to rapid initial formation of outer sphere complexes followed by slower formation of inner sphere complexes essington 2004 higher loading of sorbent reduced the as sorption intensity mg g 1 for both zvi ro and zvi sg complexes this loading effect has previously been attributed to the formation of fe oxides or fe ooh layers over zvi surfaces bang et al 2005b the loading effect also could be partially explained by dilution as as is adsorbed the concentration of as in the solution decreases hence there is less adsorption of as per gram of zvi however dilution cannot explain all of the loading effect in our study for example after 48 h the zvi ro 0 2 g adsorbed only 9 7 more of the total as than the zvi ro 0 05 g despite having 4 times as much zvi biochar in the system both of these systems still had significant amounts of as remaining in the aqueous phase after 48 h 40 6 and 30 9 of the original concentrations respectively the as sorption kinetics data were well described fig 2a and b by the pseudo 2nd order kinetic model aksu 2001 the correlation coefficients assessed by plotting t q t vs t where q t as sorbed at time t mg g 1 for the linear form of the model are excellent r2 0 91 table 1 also the calculated q e sorption of as at equilibrium in mg g 1 values agree very well with the experimental q e 48 h equilibration and the langmuir q max results table 1 we also evaluated the rate parameter for intra particle diffusion using the equation q t k int t 1 2 c and determined that the multilinear plots did not pass through the origin suggesting that intra particle diffusion was not the rate controlling step önal et al 2007 previous research has suggested that relatively fast surface adsorption and relatively slow intra particle diffusion contributed to the adsorption of as on α feooh however when zvi is present the co precipitation of as with feooh may take place simultaneously yan et al 2012 langmuir et al 2006 eljamal et al 2011 3 3 sorption of as in the column study results of the column study showed that zvi biochar complexes are effective for removing some but not all as from drinking water in a leaching column the cumulative as removal decreases with time for all zvi biochar and control columns however the zvi biochar columns were substantially more effective for removing as than the control columns fig 3 a and b the zvi ro sorbed 44 8 of the added as at the end of the 16 leaching events whereas the zvi sg sorbed 36 3 of the added as moreover the cumulative as removal for zvi ro decreased from 81 8 to 44 8 over the course of 16 leaching events with 50 μg as additions per event whereas the cumulative as removal for zvi sg decreased from 50 97 to 36 3 supplemental fig s2 the as concentrations were much lower in leachate from the zvi biochar columns compare with leachate from the biochar only columns fig 3a the concentration of as in leachates from the zvi ro and zvi sg columns reached 0 76 and 0 74 mg l 1 respectively after 16 leaching events 800 ml whereas as concentrations in leachate from the pristine ro and sg biochar columns reached 0 9 mg l 1 after the 2nd leaching event we also measured fe concentrations in the column study leachates for both the 24 h pre equilibration period and for leachates when as solution was added to the columns the data is not shown because we found only very small amounts of fe in the leachates for control columns the ro and sg biochars initially removed only 12 5 and 10 6 of as and the removal decreased to 2 72 and 2 2 respectively at the end of 16 leaching events the ro magnetite sg magnetite and magnetite only columns data not shown showed a similar response to biochar control columns suggesting the presence of raw magnetite ore by itself or physically mixed with the biochars was not effective for as removal from water in the columns overall after addition of 800 μg of as in 16 column leaching events 1 g of zvi ro removed 358 5 μg of as 44 8 efficient and 1 g of zvi sg removed 290 98 μg of as 36 3 efficient whereas the ro and sg controls biochar only removed only 20 6 and 16 13 μg of as respectively this result suggests that zvi biochar complexes increased as sorption 15 fold compare with control biochars strong linear correlations between leaching volume ml and as sorbed μg were found for zvi ro and zvi sg fig 3b r2 0 99 even after 16 leaching events whereas the linear relationship started to collapse after 14 leaching events for both control biochars suggesting that the controls were starting to release some of the previously sorbed as 3 4 sem eds analysis the sem eds analysis was done for samples of the zvi ro and zvi sg complexes fig 4 a and b respectively recovered after the 48 h batch equilibration study to investigate the distribution of c o fe si and as the light gray color on the right side of the zvi ro sem image point 1 in fig 4a indicates an area of high electron density and the eds analysis of this region indicates 70 fe 23 o and 6 c edx data are given as atom with negligible as we infer that light gray region represented by point 1 is a residual zvi particle perhaps with a surface oxyhydroxide coating the stoichiometry of point 1 may be contrasted with that of point 2 which has 51 o 26 fe 16 7 c and 2 76 as the stoichiometry of point 2 is consistent with an feooh phase which must have been neo formed as zvi was being oxidized the light gray electron dense region represented by point 2 appears to be crust or surface coating that formed on top of a dark low electron density porous particle most likely a particle of biochar evident at the bottom center of the sem micrograph point 3 in the upper left corner of the sem in fig 4a has a stoichiometry of 50 o 18 6 si 8 7 fe and 11 8 c which suggests that it is a mixture of silicate phases possibly quartz and or fayalite while as is diffusely present on all surfaces it is clearly concentrated in the newly formed feooh phase point 2 and is not significantly associated with the zvi or silicate rich phases fig 4b shows a similar sem eds analysis for a sample of the zvi sg complexes recovered from the batch equilibration experiment point 1 in fig 4b has a stoichiometry 54 8 fe and 40 8 o which is roughly equivalent with wustite feo and contains negligible as while points 2 50 9 o and 31 3 fe and 3 56 5 o and 28 0 fe have stoichiometry s more consistent with feooh and contain 2 6 and 3 9 as respectively thus the sem eds data for both zvi ro and zvi sg indicate that as is selectively adsorbed in the newly formed feooh phase and not on zvi feo or fe si phases 3 5 xrd analysis xrd analysis of the original zvi ro and zvi sg biochar complexes show only small residual magnetite peaks and prominent α fe zvi peaks indicating that much of the fe in the magnetite was reduce to zvi during pyrolysis fig 5 the xrd pattern for the original zvi sg biochar also has small peaks for wustite feo while the xrd peaks for the original zvi sg biochar has peaks for both fayalite fe2 2 sio4 and wustite feo there was no evidence of either fayalite or wustite in the xrd patterns of the magnetite ore hence these phases must have formed during pyrolysis the 44 9 2θ α fe peak for the zvi sg biochar is about half as intense as the 44 9 2θ peak in the xrd pattern for the zvi ro biochar this result indicates that a greater fraction of the magnetite fe was recrystallized as fayalite and wustite relative to α fe during pyrolysis of the high ash switchgrass whereas a greater fraction of the magnetite fe was recrystallized as α fe during pyrolysis of the low ash red oak biomass thus the results show that feedstock properties influence the fe mineralogy and the production of zvi during the co pyrolysis of biomass feedstocks with magnetite iron ore much of the α fe in the zvi biochar complexes was transformed into other phases during the batch equilibration and column leaching studies as evidenced by the decrease in intensity of the 44 9 2θ α fe xrd peaks fig 5 the xrd pattern for samples collected from the zvi ro biochar columns after leaching show prominent peaks for goethite α feooh akaganeite β feooh wustite and magnetite while the xrd patterns for the zvi ro biochar samples collected from the batch equilibrium study indicate the presence of goethite and lepidocrocite γ feooh wustite and magnetite for the zvi sg biochar xrd patterns for samples from the column study show peaks for goethite fayalite wustite and magnetite while xrd patterns for samples from the batch study show peaks for lepidocrocite fayalite wustite and magnetite the results indicate that the iron oxyhydroxide phases formed during the column leaching and batch equilibration studies were influenced by both feedstock and conditions during the oxidation reactions specifically the preferential formation of goethite in the column study and lepidocrocite in the batch equilibration study might be due to more oxidizing conditions that prevailed in the columns carlson and schwertmann 1990 which increased the ph of the column leachates to more than 7 5 which is favorable for the formation of goethite but not lepidocrocite boland et al 2014 a more oxidizing environment in the column relative to the batch study is also supported by greater magnetite and wustite peak intensities for zvi ro and zvi sg samples collected from the batch study relative to the column study we also observed that the 26 644 2θ quartz peak is more intense for samples from the column experiments than the batch study however this is attributed to incomplete separation of the biochar from the quartz sand used in the column experiment thus the xrd evidence fig 5 is consistent with sem eds analysis fig 4 in indicating that zvi was partially oxidized primarily forming goethite akaganeite and lepidocrocite and to a lesser extent wustite and magnetite during the batch equilibration and column leaching studies isomorphous substitution of elements with ionic radii different from that of fe3 in the crystal structures of iron oxyhydroxides is evidenced by shifts in hkl lattice spacings relative to lattice spacings of pristine mineral phases schulze and schwertmann 1987 schwertmann and wolska 1990 here we observed d values of 4 173 2 44 and 2 182 for the 110 111 and 140 hkl lattices spacings respectively in goethite for samples of zvi ro and zvi sg complexes recovered from the column experiment these lattice spacings may be compared with 4 183 2 450 and 2 19 respectively for synthetic goethite anthony et al 1997 similarly we observed d values of 6 25 3 28 and 1 93 for the 020 021 and 002 hkl lattices spacings of lepidocrocite in the zvi ro and zvi sg complexes recovered from the batch equilibration study which may be compared with 6 26 3 29 and 1 937 for synthetic lepidocrocite anthony et al 1997 and we observed d values of 7 431 2 53 and 2 282 for the 110 211 and 301 hkl lattice spacings of akaganeite in the zvi ro complexes recovered from the column study which may be compared with 7 467 2 55 and 2 295 for synthetic akaganeite anthony et al 1997 these observed shifts to shorter lattice spacings indicate possible isomorphous substitution of trivalent as as3 r 0 58 å for trivalent fe fe3 r 0 64 å in the crystal structure of the fe oxyhydroxides isomorphous substitution of al for fe in lepidocrocite and goethite is commonly observed schulze and schwertmann 1987 schwertmann and wolska 1990 isomorphous substitution of as3 for fe3 in the various feooh phases is supported by the sem eds data showing up to 3 atom as selectively associated with the feooh minerals fig 4 and by the xps as 3d data fig 6 showing a dominance of as3 in the adsorbed phases the xrd peak shifts observed here are very small and this study was not specifically designed to study isomorphous substitution hence more research is needed to confirm this finding 3 6 xps analysis the xps as 3d spectra for zvi biochar samples recovered from the batch and column experiments are presented in fig 6 the as 3d spectra indicate the presence of both trivalent and pentavalent forms of as however higher peak intensities for the trivalent form is evident for all the zvi biochars recovered from the batch and column experiments moreover the as 3d peak is shifted to the lower binding energy 43 ev instead of 44 8 ev for the trivalent as suggesting the possible association of trivalent as with fe o day et al 2004 the synthetic drinking water used in both the column and batch studies contained only as5 hence the presence of as3 in the zvi biochar samples indicates that some of the as5 was reduced during both the column and batch experiments 4 discussion 4 1 overall findings and proposed mechanism the xrd results clearly indicate that the zvi formed during pyrolysis of magnetite mixed with ro and sg biomass was partially oxidized during the batch equilibration and column leaching experiments forming various feooh phases goethite lepidocrocite and akaganeite and to a lesser extent magnetite and wustite the sem eds data shows that as is associated with mineral phases having a 2 1 o fe stoichiometry which we infer to be the various feooh phases that formed during the batch equilibration and column leaching experiments we added only arsenate as5 during the batch and column experiments yet the xps data clearly shows that arsenite as3 is the primary form of as associated with zvi biochar samples recovered from the batch and column experiments furthermore the small shifts in lattice spacing s for goethite and lepidocrocite in samples recovered from the batch and column experiments relative to lattice spacing s of pristine synthetic samples of these minerals is consistent with isomorphous substitution of as3 into the structure of the feooh minerals thus we infer a coupled redox reaction by which as5 is reduced to as3 while fe is oxidized first to fe2 and then fe3 furthermore we infer the co precipitation of fe3 and as3 with the formation of various fe as ooh phases fig 7 pathway 1 although not definitive evidence the sem micrograph in fig 4a shows what appears to be a surface coating of fe as ooh on top of a biochar particle and a separate residual fe particle with perhaps a thin oxyhydroxide surface coating 2 7 o fe stoichiometry having negligible as this evidence suggests that as zvi particles were dissolved by corrosion reactions the various fe as ooh phases were neo formed on adjacent biochar surfaces the biochar which is a semiconductor may have facilitated electron transfer from the zvi to o2 or as5 ions and thereby promoted the precipitation reaction the adsorption of as by the zvi biochar complexes was much less efficient during the column leaching experiment relative to the batch equilibrium or kinetics experiments only 36 3 44 8 of added as was removed from the contaminated drinking water leaching through the columns before leaching began the columns were saturated with milli q water and pre equilibrated for 24 h this pre equilibration would have allowed at least some of the zvi in the zvi biochar complexes to be oxidized forming feooh phases before the columns were ever exposed to the simulated drinking water containing as furthermore the column study included 16 leaching events with a 20 h interval between events this additional time and exposure to water and o2 during the leaching process would have further promoted oxidation of zvi to feooh because substantial more feooh was present in the columns than the samples use for the batch equilibrium or kinetic studies it is likely that a greater fraction of the as retained in the column study was retained by surface adsorption on already formed feooh followed by intra particle diffusion as reported in other studies dixit and hering 2003 badruzzaman et al 2004 while in the batch studies a greater fraction of the as was retained by co precipitation of fe as ooh our results suggest that both surface adsorption followed by intra particle diffusion and co precipitation of as3 with fe3 during the neo formation of fe as ooh mineral phases may occur when as is present in solution as zvi corrodes this finding may be contrasted with previous literature which has primarily reported adsorption of haso4 2 on surfaces of iron oxyhydroxides followed by intra particle diffusion dixit and hering 2003 badruzzaman et al 2004 reported that intra particle diffusion was the dominant adsorption mechanism explaining as5 adsorption kinetics on granular ferric hydroxide in another study an fe bearing adsorbent was used to remove as5 from natural ground water and again intra particle diffusion was suggested as the primary adsorption process ciopec et al 2014 also borah et al 2008 indicated intra particle diffusion for as5 adsorption on surface modified carbon black although the authors acknowledged that the intra particle diffusion was not the rate determining step we infer that the co precipitation mechanism fig 7 pathway 1 was dominant in our batch equilibrium and batch kinetic studies because fresh zvi biochars were added directly to as cdw while in the column study we infer that both co precipitation and surface adsorption and intra particle diffusion mechanisms fig 7 pathway 2 were likely occurring because the zvi biochars had previously been exposed to di water for 24 h before the as cdw was introduced the initial rapid reaction phase observed in the batch kinetic study is attributed to the presence of smaller zvi particles which dissolves rapidly leading to rapid formation of fe as ooh precipitate later the supply of fe2 in solution may have been limiting as larger zvi particles dissolved more slowly in the column study because of the 24 h pre equilibration treatments fine zvi particles may have already dissolved and hence the supply of fe2 and e may have limited the co precipitation reaction the batch adsorption and kinetics experiments figs 1 and 2 table 1 show clear evidence for the effect of zvi biochar type and loading on the efficiency q max of the zvi biochar complexes for adsorption of as the effect of zvi biochar type here zvi ro vs zvi sg is attributed to the relative amounts of zvi formed during pyrolysis the original zvi ro has more zvi than the zvi sg because some of the magnetite fe formed fayalite and wustite rather than zvi when the high ash switchgrass biomass was pyrolyzed the zvi biochar loading effect is attributed to the relative supplies of as and fe in the systems during the reactions the higher loading 0 2 g zvi biochar was less efficient for adsorbing as because the supply of as was limiting while the lower loading 0 05 g zvi biochar was more efficient because of a higher as fe ratio in the system supplemental fig s2 4 2 environmental implications the efficiency of zvi for removal of as from water is well established and zvi has been used in practice for removal of as from contaminated drinking water for at last two decades zhou et al 2014 zhu et al 2009 wang et al 2017 bang et al 2005b eljamal et al 2011 wu et al 2017 lien and wilkin 2005 however a better understanding of the mechanism of as sorption by iron oxyhydroxide phases in the presence of zvi particles may improve strategies the remediation of as contaminated water surface ground drinking our data suggest that the coupled oxidation of fe with the reduction of as5 and the co precipitation of as3 with fe3 leading to neo formation of fe as ooh mineral phases is a rapid and efficient mechanism for removing as from water while surfaces adsorption of as onto preexisting feooh minerals and intra particle diffusion will be slower and less efficient thus the design of systems that optimize conditions for the co precipitation reaction are expected to be more efficient at removal of as from contaminated water a second key finding of our research is that zvi can be made cheaply and rapidly by co pyrolyzing biomass and magnetite at high temperatures this method of producing zvi is potentially less expensive than producing fe by smelting iron ore and subsequently grinding the iron metal to produce fine particles of zvi zvi biochar complexes can be produced by mixing low cost iron ore with low cost biomass and then pyrolyzing the mixture at high temperature 900 c our data demonstrates that use of a low ash biomass such as hardwood sawdust will enhance formation of zvi and the efficacy of the zvi biochar for removing as form water furthermore zvi biochar complexes may be useful for removing various organic contaminants from water in addition to as biochar is known to adsorb various organic compounds and the zvi biochar complexes should be effective for reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated organic compounds ahmad et al 2014 dutta et al 2017 komnitsas and zaharaki 2016 li et al 2017 rajapaksha et al 2016 silvani et al 2017 one area of concern is that the efficacy of zvi biochar complexes to remove as and other contaminants from water is finite for any practical applications the zvi biochar should be replaced on a regular basis to maintain system efficacy there is thus a risk that systems will not be maintained and that people or animals will be poisoned by drinking water from poorly maintained systems furthermore the exhausted zvi biochar complexes will be a hazardous waste contaminated with as and must be disposed of properly further engineering research on the design of water filtration systems is needed to produce more effective zvi biochar systems for remediation of as contaminated water resources 5 conclusions 1 zero valent iron zvi biochar complexes produced by high temperature pyrolysis of low ash biomass feedstocks and magnetite are effective for removing as5 from contaminated drinking water in the studied ph range ph 7 7 5 and in presence of competing ions 2 as is removed from water by two mechanisms in the presence of zvi a simultaneous reduction of as5 to as3 and oxidation of fe0 to fe3 and the co precipitation of as3 and fe3 leading to the formation of fe as ooh onto biochar surfaces and b adsorption of as on preexisting feooh mineral surfaces followed by intra particle diffusion 3 the co precipitation batch sorption and kinetics study here mechanism is more rapid than surface adsorption and intra particle diffusion mechanism 4 as is dominantly sorbed by feooh minerals goethite akaganeite and lepidocrocite and only weakly sorbed by wustite fayalite and zvi in zvi biochars 5 the production of zvi biochar using a high ash biomass here sg leads to greater formation of fayalite and wustite at the expense of zvi and hence biochar zvi complexes that are less effective for removal of as than using a low ash biomass feedstock here ro 6 as sorption intensity decreases with increasing loading of zvi biochars acknowledgements we thank warren straszheim and dapeng jing of materials analysis and research laboratory

19628,this study presents an approach for developing inactivating materials to achieve an initial rapid and a long term equilibrium p immobilization to control eutrophication based on drinking water treatment residue dwtr which is a byproduct of potable water production by taking advantage of the long term equilibrium p adsorption by dwtr the la chemical properties and the previous success of using la modified bentonite clay phoslock we used dwtr as a la carrier with different ratios to develop the specific materials the la loading mechanisms the potentially toxic effect of la modified dwtr on snail bellamya aeruginosa within 120 d and the short and long term within 80 d p immobilization characteristics of the modified dwtr were investigated to understand the performance of the developed materials the results showed that la loading into dwtr was based on ligand exchanges and the formation of new particles dwtr loaded with 5 la had no toxicity against the snail most importantly the loading of 5 la to dwtr substantially enhanced the rapid immobilization capacity of dwtr achieving an initial rapid and a long term equilibrium p adsorption in aqueous solutions this study promotes the beneficial recycling of dwtr and results in a win win situation for lake restoration graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water treatment residue adsorption phosphorus eutrophication 1 introduction the geo engineering of lakes using p inactivating materials to control eutrophication has received broad attention from scientists an understanding of the reliability of the technique under various conditions is essential for this beneficial application lürling et al 2016 to date the reliability was mainly investigated by focusing on two aspects one is the side effect spears et al 2016 mucci et al 2017 especially with regard to metal pollution risks and potential toxic effects on organisms e g benthic animals wang and jiang 2016 the other aspect is the control effectiveness lürling et al 2016 to achieve effective control improved methods and techniques were often used to reduce the potential uncertainties one of these uncertainties is the presence of algal blooms accordingly the technique of flocculation and immobilization was developed to control algal blooms and the successful application of this method at the field scale has been reported using modified local soil wang et al 2016a and the combination of polyaluminium chloride and la modified bentonite clay phoslock lürling and van oosterhout 2013 and of iron chloride and phoslock waajen et al 2017a another typical uncertainty is related to the various potential p sources that release p slowly e g during plant senescence into water column inducing undesirable restoration effects wang et al 2016b therefore inactivating materials was recommended for application in single large doses or in repeated doses kleeberg et al 2013 meis et al 2013 however single large doses increased the potentially unfavorable effect on the surroundings gołdyn et al 2014 and inactivating materials dosed in repetition increased the cost of lake geo engineering therefore the development of new inactivating materials with a high p adsorption capacity that allows for reducing the dosage and repeated applications remains the focus of many studies douglas et al 2016 funes et al 2016 fan et al 2017 in this study a method of initial rapid and long term equilibrium p adsorption for the development of new inactivating materials was developed for lake geo engineering drinking water treatment residue dwtr is an inevitable and non hazardous byproduct generated in large amounts during potable water production okuda et al 2014 the residue has long been dumped in landfills but the cost and available land needed for the disposal will likely increase due to the increased production wang and jiang 2016 accordingly the productive reuse of dwtr has attracted worldwide interest in recent decades keeley et al 2016 and dwtr has been commonly recycled in environmental remediation ippolito et al 2011 the recycling process is often based on the adsorption capacity of dwtr due to the amorphous al fe and organic components in dwtr resulting from the utilization of al fe coagulants in water purification ippolito et al 2011 dwtr is an effective adsorbent of many contaminants e g p makris et al 2005 toxic metals lin et al 2017b and toxic organic pollutants punamiya et al 2013 in particular dwtr exhibited high performance for p adsorption makris et al 2005 the p adsorption characteristics of dwtr have been investigated comprehensively to improve the recycling process the p adsorption by dwtr occurs mainly by ligand exchanges yang et al 2006 and the adsorbed p is dominated by fe and al bound forms ippolito et al 2011 and exhibits high stability under various conditions e g the existence of organic matter boyer et al 2011 and various redox conditions oliver et al 2011 interestingly a specific characteristic of p adsorption by dwtr is a long term equilibrium and the processes can be maintained for 80 d makris et al 2005 the specific characteristics are closely related to dwtr porosity makris et al 2005 which also results in a stable p adsorption a previous study found that the 1 d p adsorption contents by dwtr only accounted for 23 8 of the 48 d adsorption with agitation in kh2po4 solution prepared with deionized water wang et al 2016b the p adsorption by dwtr was often described as initial rapid and long term equilibrium but the initial rapid adsorption was relative makris et al 2005 compared to other materials e g al and fe salts dwtr advantage for p pollution control is the long term immobilization 150 d wang et al 2016b in recent years la has been widely applied to develop materials with high adsorption capacity dong and wang 2016 typically la has been commonly used for the development of p adsorbents douglas et al 2016 because the p precipitation by la is more effective over a wide ph range 4 5 8 5 and the la p complex is the least soluble among the rare earth p complexes and can form at low concentrations firsching and brune 1991 firsching and kell 1993 phoslock which uses bentonite clay as a la carrier is being increasingly used to control lake eutrophication douglas 2002 copetti et al 2016 with regard to the adsorption kinetics many studies have indicated a rapid p adsorption by phoslock especially under agitation haghseresht et al 2009 lürling et al 2014 the 1 d p adsorption contents by phoslock were found to account for 86 4 of the 48 d adsorption with agitation in kh2po4 solution wang et al 2016b in consideration of dwtr p adsorption characteristics la chemical properties and the successful experiences of the use of phoslock in this study we used dwtr as a la carrier to develop p inactivating materials with the characteristics of an initial rapid and a long term equilibrium p adsorption for lake geo engineering for a comprehensive understanding of the performance of the la modified dwtr we first determined la loading mechanisms on dwtr by using scanning electron microscopy sem x ray fluorescence xrf x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and specific surface area ssa and porosity analysis the potential effects of the materials on the snail species bellamya aeruginosa b aeruginosa were assessed as a common benthic animal in freshwater ecosystems b aeruginosa has been recommended as a model species for sediment toxicity assessment and has been widely applied to evaluate the environmental risks of different pollutants han et al 2010 ma et al 2010 finally the short and long term p immobilization by the modified dwtr were investigated in aqueous solutions and lake sediments the successful development of inactivating materials based on dwtr is beneficial from an environmental and economic standpoint resulting in win win techniques and promoting circular economy 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation dewatered dwtr was collected from beijing city no 9 waterworks in china lake water sediment plants houttuynia cordata h cordata and snails b aeruginosa were collected from lake xuanwu china surface sediments 32 04 n 118 48 e were sampled at a depth of 0 5 cm via a caliber core sampler φ110 mm length 500 mm rigo co japan lake water was sampled at a depth of approximately 0 5 m using a 1 m long and 10 cm diameter plexiglass tube 2 2 dwtr modification prior to the modification dwtr was heated at 500 c under a nitrogen atmosphere for 4 h the heat treated dwtr was mixed and agitated with deionized water at a concentration of 200 g l 1 at ph 1 for 24 h at 25 c and subsequently the ph of the mixtures was adjusted to 9 the la solutions prepared by lacl3 using deionized water with ph 9 were added to the dwtr mixtures to achieve a dwtr concentration of 100 g l 1 the ph adjustment for the dwtr mixtures and la solutions was repeated five times in 4 h and one time after standing overnight approximately 16 h to obtain a relatively stable ph using 1 3 m naoh and hcl solutions the la and dwtr mixtures were agitated at 60 c for 5 h and subsequently aged for 24 h at 25 c finally the solids in the mixtures were separated washed three times with deionized water and oven dried to obtain the la modified dwtr la weight ratios of 0 1 2 5 5 10 and 20 were used for the modification and are referred to as la0 dwtr la1 dwtr la2 5 dwtr la5 dwtr la10 dwtr and la20 dwtr respectively in this study heat treatment was used to decrease the aliphaticity of dwtr wang et al 2016c because the aliphatic compounds may occupy the adsorption sites of la a subsequent acid treatment was used to activate the aged al and fe in dwtr caused by heat treatment wang et al 2011 the method for la loading was based on a study of developing la al pillared montmorillonite tian et al 2009 the n2 sorption desorption the main structures and the chemical compositions were characterized by ssa and porosity analysis nova4200e quantachrome usa sem sx650 hitachi japan and xrf arl 9800 switzerland respectively the chemical states of al2p fe2p c1s and la3d in dwtr were determined by xps escalab 250 thermo fisher scientific usa the total contents of fe al la ca na k and mg in the materials were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry or mass spectrometry agilent 7700x usa the ph values of dwtr before and after modification were also measured 2 3 bellamya aeruginosa culture test the sampled b aeruginosa in growth stages were firstly cultured in filtered lake water filtered through 0 45 μm glass fiber filters at room temperature 20 25 c in a plexiglass culture box under natural light and were provided with the sampled h cordata approximately 10 mg plant d 1 for each snail for food ma et al 2010 the lake water was aerated continuously and renewed every 3 d after 60 d snails in similar size were selected for the test approximately 11 5 mm a plexiglass culture box containing 48 sub boxes was prepared the culture test included 8 groups namely a blank group control and groups with the addition of raw dwtr and la0 la20 dwtr respectively each group had 6 sub boxes replications except for control group 25 g material 500 ml lake water and 6 snails with the ratio 1 1 for female and male fig s1 were added to each sub box the culture parameters were similar to the test for the b aeruginosa prescreening snail growth was determined every 30 d based on the height fig s1 overlying water properties were measured every week after 120 d snails were sampled for analysis in addition to measuring snail height enzymatic activities in snail liver including glutathione reductase gr catalase cat malondialdehyde mda and superoxide dismutase sod were determined by using ultraviolet colorimetry ammonium molybdate 2 thiobarbituric acid and hydroxylamine methods respectively nanjing jiancheng bioengineering institute china the total contents of fe al la ca na k and mg were determined in the soft tissues of b aeruginosa the tissues were collected after snails were cultured in deionized water for 72 h han et al 2010 ammonium n nh4 n nitrate n no3 n nitrite n no2 n and p in the solutions were measured by a smartchem discrete autoanalyzer smartchem 200 ams westco italy the ph ph 10 sartorius germany and total organic carbon toc torch teledyne tekmar usa were also determined 2 4 p immobilization test the p immobilization by la modified dwtr was determined in aqueous solutions and lake sediments the p immobilization in aqueous solutions was based on kh2po4 and the plant residues in the test using kh2po4 inactivating materials were mixed in conical flasks with solutions containing 10 mg p l 1 at a concentration of 0 5 g l 1 in the test using plant residues inactivating materials were mixed in conical flasks with 500 ml of lake water containing the plant the material doses accounted for 10 of the fresh plant weight and the plant residues were cut into pieces approximately 1 cm long the adsorption tests were statically incubated at 25 c in the dark and were sampled at certain intervals within 60 80 d for p analysis all tests were run in triplicate the p concentrations adopted herein were to ensure the observation of the initial rapid and long term equilibrium p adsorption by the materials in addition during the test with the plant residues inactivating materials were sampled for ssa and porosity analysis total p in plant residues wang et al 2016b and toc in lake water were also measured for p immobilization in lake sediments fresh sediments of 250 g were completely mixed in beakers with materials and then the mixtures were incubated at 15 c in the dark during incubation deionized water was added resulting in 3 5 mm of water overlay in the beakers the added materials accounted for 0 control group 5 10 and 20 of the sediments in dry weight samples were collected on the

in lake sediment christophoridis and fytianos 2006 in this study correlation analysis and one way analysis of variance anova were performed using spss version 18 0 the detailed materials and methods section 2 1 2 5 are presented in supporting information 3 results 3 1 characteristics of la modified dwtr the n2 gas sorption desorption characteristics of dwtr before and after modification are shown in fig 1 a compared with raw dwtr the n2 gas sorption capacity of la0 dwtr was substantially higher after la modification the gas sorption increased but as la loading ratios increased no clear trend was observed accordingly density functional theory dft model was used to calculate the pore size distributions compared to raw dwtr la0 dwtr had larger volumes with pore radius 1 00 and 2 17 10 0 nm and smaller volumes with pore radius 1 73 2 17 nm after la modification the volumes with pore radius 2 50 5 40 nm decreased substantially whereas the volumes with pore radius 2 17 and 5 40 18 0 nm increased as la loading ratios increased the variations of pore volumes based on radius were divided into four classes radius 1 00 1 00 3 40 3 40 5 40 and 5 40 18 0 nm these findings suggested that the effect of la modification on pore size distribution of dwtr was irregular as loading ratios increased but la occupied some mesopores at radius 2 50 5 40 nm and generally the volumes for different pore sizes increased especially the radius 5 40 nm in addition the ssa and total pore volumes tpv were higher for la0 dwtr than raw dwtr as la loading ratios increased the ssa and tpv of dwtr increased with the exception of the tpv of la1 dwtr which slightly decreased compared to la0 dwtr the elemental distributions in dwtr before and after la modification are shown in table 1 and table s2 compared to raw dwtr la0 dwtr had relatively higher total contents of fe al ca na k and mg p 0 01 which may be due to the concentration effect caused by heat treatment as la loading ratios increased total metal contents decreased in the modified dwtr whereas total la content increased and had a range of 9 78 175 mg g 1 p 0 01 the xrf results showed similar trends for metal distributions however la proportions in the modified dwtr as determined by xrf 7 25 39 2 were substantially higher than total la the differences may be caused by the fact that xrf is more suited for analyzing the elemental distributions on a solid surface accordingly the loaded la was mainly on dwtr surface this finding was supported by the sem results fig 1b and fig s2 which indicated a rougher surface and more particles on dwtr surface as la loading ratios increased the chemical species of al2p fe2p c1s and la3d on dwtr before and after modification are shown in fig 2 and figs s3 s6 affiliations of peaks associated with different chemicals species were based on previous reports wang et al 2016c and the link of http srdata nist gov xps selenergytype aspx in general the dominant chemical species of al fe and la in the materials included oxide and hydroxide groups compared to raw dwtr al and fe oxides in la0 dwtr had smaller proportions which may have been caused by the acid treatment after heat treatment as la loading ratios increased al and fe oxides in la1 and la2 5 dwtr increased and tended to decrease for la5 la20 dwtr in contrast la hydroxides gradually increased as la loading ratios increased with regard to c in dwtr the species included aromatic c c c c h 284 5 284 8 ev c o aromatic c 285 3 286 1 ev c o ketone c 287 0 287 5 ev c in carboxylate group 288 3 288 5 and c in carbonate group 289 2 289 9 ev compared with raw dwtr la0 dwtr contained relatively high proportions of c in aromatic c c c c h and c o aromatic c after dwtr modification a decrease in aromatic c c c c h 284 5 284 8 ev and carboxylate 288 3 288 5 groups and an increase in c o aromatic c 285 3 286 1 ev groups were clearly observed as la loading ratios increased these results suggested that la modification induced the changes in al fe c and la species in dwtr 3 2 response of b aeruginosa to la modified dwtr the physiological and biochemical responses of b aeruginosa to la modified dwtr are shown in fig 3 and fig s7 the snail heights increased with incubation time fig 3a and fig s7 but the snails grew faster in the control than in other groups with materials the growth heights decreased as la loading ratios increased at different incubation times especially in the groups with la10 and la20 dwtr p 0 01 the variations in enzymatic activity in snail livers fig 3b showed that compared to the control gr increased p 0 01 while cat decreased p 0 01 whereas the cr and cat contents were similar in the groups with materials the mda and sod also showed a similar change the two enzymatic activities in la10 and la20 dwtr p 0 01 groups tended to have higher values than in other groups further analysis table 2 showed that after the addition of materials total contents of fe al and la increased p 0 01 or 0 05 in most times in snails soft tissue the fe and al contents in different dwtr groups did not exhibit any regular changes but the la contents clearly increased as la loading ratios increased from la5 to la20 dwtr groups p 0 01 interestingly the p contents in soft tissues decreased after materials addition p 0 01 or 0 05 and the rate of decrease increased as la loading ratios increased the changes in total contents of ca na k and mg were mainly within 10 and also irregular in addition the mortalities of the animals in different groups were within 5 after the test the changes in overlying properties are shown in fig s8 and the detailed descriptions are provided in supporting information in order to explore the potential relationships between the snail responses and the environmental conditions a linear correlation analysis was performed fig 3c f after materials addition the increased ph of overlying water p 0 01 and the increased la in soft tissues p 0 01 as well as the decreased p in soft tissues p 0 05 and the decreased no3 n in overlying water p 0 01 inhibited the snails growth the decreased no3 n and p in overlying water following materials addition caused increases in gr p 0 01 and cat p 0 01 the decreased toc p 0 05 and the increased nh4 n p 0 01 in overlying water induced an increase in mda and the increased nh4 n in overlying water p 0 05 and the increased la in soft tissues p 0 05 increased sod in the liver 3 3 p immobilization capacity of la modified dwtr 3 3 1 p immobilization in aqueous solution the removal of p from aqueous solution based on kh2po4 is shown in fig 4 a as the incubation time increased to 80 d the p concentrations gradually decreased from 10 0 to 2 88 mg l 1 by raw dwtr and a similar decrease was observed for la0 dwtr in contrast la modification substantially enhanced the initial adsorption by dwtr and the enhancement increased with increases in la loading ratios according to the pseudo second order equation table s5 the initial p adsorption rate by raw and la0 dwtr were 2 42 and 2 87 mg g 1 d 1 whereas the rates substantially increased as la loading ratios increased and the rate for la5 dwtr was 18 1 mg g 1 d 1 the estimated maximum p rapid adsorption capacities 24 h by langmuir model also clearly increased for the modified dwtr fig s9 and ranged from 5 56 to 6 81 raw and la0 dwtr to 12 7 mg g 1 la5 dwtr interestingly the enhanced p removal by la1 and la2 5 dwtr decreased over time the p removal was even lower for la1 dwtr than raw dwtr on the 80th d however an increased p removal occurred in la5 dwtr p 0 01 and the final concentration was 0 200 mg l 1 therefore the la loading enhanced the rapid p adsorption by dwtr but tended to reduce the long term equilibrium p adsorption the removal of p from aqueous solution based on plant residues is shown in fig 4b the release of p from plant residues occurred during the first 22 d and then the concentration 9 4 mg l 1 slightly decreased possibly caused by microbial activity after materials addition the p concentrations clearly decreased the p was gradually removed by raw dwtr and on the 32nd d the concentrations were stable within 0 240 0 270 mg l 1 however la modification substantially enhanced p removal and most of p immobilization occurred during the first 7 d the enhanced p removal increased with increases in la loading ratios p 0 01 in particular the concentrations quickly reduced to 0 0333 mg l 1 by la5 dwtr the results suggested an enhanced p removal by dwtr as a result of la modification in addition the total p of h cordata was 8 8 mg g 1 in dry weight and the toc contents in the solutions of this test were 75 180 mg l 1 at the starting and ending times the toc contents were markedly higher than in raw lake water fig s8 indicating the release of organic matter from plant residues the results of n2 gas sorption desorption by raw and la5 dwtr during the test using plant residues are shown fig 4c and d after the immobilization test the n2 gas adsorption decreased in raw and la5 dwtr fig 4c the dft model was applied to analyze the pore size distributions fig 4d for raw dwtr the mesopores with an approximate radius of 2 nm decreased during the first 10 d whereas the micropores radius 0 9 nm decreased during the entire 60 d test the changes in the volumes of the mesopores and micropores in la5 dwtr mainly occurred during the first 10 d interestingly the mesopores with a radius of 1 18 nm decreased but the micropores increased after p immobilization moreover decreases in the tpv and ssa were observed for raw and la5 dwtr during the immobilization test whereas the decreases in la5 dwtr mainly occurred during the first 10 d 3 3 2 p immobilization in lake sediment the p distributions in lake sediments before and after dwtr modification are shown in fig 5 and fig s10 substantial effects were observed for the distributions of mobile p nh4cl p and bd p naoh ip and hcl p p 0 01 for most times accordingly the three p forms are discussed the p distributions in sediments with materials were similar for the 2 d and 60 d incubation times indicating that the immobilization mainly occurred within 2 d the mobile p in sediment substantially decreased after material addition and the decrease rate increased with increasing dosages furthermore la modification enhanced the mobile p immobilization efficacies in sediments and the enhancement increased with increasing la loading ratios the efficacy of la5 dwtr at a dose of 0 05 8 0 15 was similar to the efficacy of raw and la0 dwtr at a dose of 0 2 5 0 9 0 fig 5d further comparisons suggested that naoh ip increased in sediments with raw and la0 dwtr as doses increased whereas naoh ip decreased in sediments with the modified dwtr as la loading ratios increased even in sediments with la5 dwtr naoh ip 35 45 were similar to those in sediment without any amendments 30 43 interestingly although hcl p exhibited few changes in sediments with raw and la0 dwtr this p form increased as la loading ratios and doses increased in particular hcl p increased from 6 0 9 0 to 30 42 in sediments with la5 dwtr as the doses increased from 0 to 0 2 therefore the higher the la loading in dwtr the higher the amount of hcl p is that is transformed from the mobile form in the amended sediment 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between la loading mechanisms and adsorption characteristics an understanding of la loading mechanisms is required to investigate the changes in dwtr adsorption characteristics on the one hand the increases in al and fe oxides and c o aromatic c 285 3 286 1 ev groups in dwtr and the decrease in aromatic c c c c h 284 5 284 8 ev and carboxylate after la loading fig 2 and fig s3 s6 indicated the potential ligand exchanges of la with the al fe hydroxides and the carboxylate phenol groups equations 1 3 on the other hand la loading resulted in more particles on dwtr surface fig 1b considering the increase in la proportions on the surface table 1 the surface roughness fig 1b and the increased la hydroxides as the loading ratios increased fig 2 the particles were likely dominated by la hydroxides in addition electrostatic adsorption may have also contributed to la loading in dwtr because the isoelectric point of dwtr was commonly at neutral ph values wang et al 2016c whereas the la modification was performed at ph 9 image 2 image 3 image 4 the dwtr adsorption capacity was closely related to the contents of fe al and organic c and the relatively higher values of tpv ssa and pore volumes of la0 dwtr for a certain pore radius 1 00 and 2 17 10 0 nm compared to raw dwtr were mainly caused by the oxygen limited heat treatment wang et al 2016c accordingly la loading reduced the adsorption capacity of dwtr by occupying the adsorption sites equations 1 3 the dilution effect caused by la loading may have also reduced the adsorption capacity because the total fe and al contents in dwtr decreased after la loading table 1 in contrast the modification promoted the formation of new surfaces particles increasing the adsorption capacity of dwtr these two contradicting effects induced the changes in pore size distributions at radius 5 40 nm under different la loading ratios whereas the gradually increased volumes at radius 5 40 18 0 nm with increasing loading ratios indicated that the modification was beneficial to the formation of mesopores with relatively high radius in addition the la loading ratios accounted for 1 2 5 5 0 10 and 20 of total dwtr whereas the total la contents table 1 for la1 la20 dwtr were 0 978 2 58 5 47 7 94 and 17 5 respectively these results suggested that the la loading efficiencies decreased in la10 and la20 dwtr to reduce waste la loading ratios of 5 0 are recommended for dwtr modification 4 2 the ecotoxicity of dwtr before and after modification the assessment of environmental risks is essential to select appropriate inactivating materials for lake geo engineering lürling et al 2016 and the responses of benthic animals to material additions have often been the focuses of scientists copetti et al 2016 wang and jiang 2016 most studies have focused on the changes in the benthic communities waajen et al 2017a yin et al 2018 and the toxicological effects on various macrobenthos e g crayfish mussels fingernail clams and chironomids clearwater et al 2014 van oosterhout et al 2014 álvarez manzaneda et al 2017 accordingly biological test was conducted to determine the potential toxicity of the modified dwtr the potential toxic effect was assessed based on snail mortalities growth and enzymatic activities gr cat mda and sod in the liver gr maintains the activities of sulfhydryl and cat prevents damages caused by hydroxyl radicals hou et al 2014 the mda accumulation is an indication of oxidative stress and sod catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen as well as the conversion of h2o2 to 2h2o by glutathione peroxidase or to o2 and h2o by catalase hou et al 2014 based on the changes in enzymatic activities in livers and the inhibited snail growth fig 1 and fig s7 the material addition had potentially unfavorable effects on the animals although the little toxic effect of the modified dwtr was confirmed by the limited snail mortalities in the groups with materials potentially unfavorable effects were further found to be related to the decreased nutrients levels toc no3 n and p in overlying water and p in snails soft tissues and to the increased ph and nh4 n in overlying water and la in soft tissues the decrease in the toc and p in overlying water may be attributed to the adsorption by the modified dwtr which released hydroxyl ions wang and jiang 2016 and increased the ph of overlying water these changes were not taken into consideration to evaluate the safety of the materials because they were the results of pollution control nevertheless the increased nh4 n in overlying water in la10 and la20 dwtr groups fig s8 suggested a potential inhibition of nitrification a similar phenomenon was reported for phoslock in lake sediments lin et al 2017a and the reason may be that the p inactivating materials suppressed ammonia oxidizers by changing the surrounding conditions lin et al 2017a in fact soil nitrifiers have been found to be sensitive to la chu et al 2001 furthermore the increased la accumulation in snails soft tissues after materials addition indicated the la availability to the snails interestingly as la loading ratios increased from 0 to 2 5 table 2 the accumulated la showed a decreasing trend from 0 278 to 0 191 mg g 1 even as ratio increased from 5 to 20 the accumulated la increased from 0 355 to 0 486 mg g 1 p 0 01 this suggested the limited bioavailability of la loaded into dwtr and may be related to the weak alkaline condition and the presence of toc in overlying water copetti et al 2016 and also to that the loaded la in dwtr was in a relatively stable form e g binding with al fe and organic matter fig 2 considering that in la10 and la20 dwtr groups the inhibition of snails growth as well as the increases in mda and sod in livers nh4 n in overlying water and la in the soft tissues were relatively obvious la loading ratios 5 of total dwtr are recommended the same ratio range is recommended for an effective la loading in dwtr because it avoids wasting la during the modification the proportion of la in phoslock is also approximately 5 copetti et al 2016 similarly induced la accumulations in organisms were observed for phoslock e g crayfish fish and macrophytes van oosterhout et al 2014 waajen et al 2017b and la salts e g b aeruginosa yang et al 1999 copetti et al 2016 have comprehensively summarized ecotoxicological studies for la salts and la in phoslock and found a large range of ecotoxicological responses across a wide range of taxa a preliminary quality criterion for la in sediments is 36 9 mg kg 1 herrmann et al 2016 however there were no indications of long term negative effects on phoslock treated ecosystems copetti et al 2016 these reports indirectly demonstrated that the recommended la loading ratios 5 for dwtr are applicable natural ecosystems are complex and more detailed investigations on the safety of la modified dwtr are required wang et al 2016d 4 3 characteristics of p immobilization according to the recommendation in section 4 1 and 4 2 la loading ratios 5 in dwtr were selected for the p immobilization tests the results of the tests in aqueous solution suggested a substantially increased rapid p adsorption by la modified dwtr at different ratios fig 4 interestingly a reduced long term p adsorption was observed for dwtr after la modification especially for la1 dwtr in the adsorption tests with kh2po4 the reason may be that la occupied some adsorption sites related to long term p adsorption in dwtr which was further confirmed by the determined la loading mechanisms equation 1 an inhibited long term p adsorption was not observed for la modified dwtr in the test with plant residues this occurred because p loading was higher for the kh2po4 20 mg g 1 than the plant residues 8 8 mg g 1 see section 2 4 a higher p loading avoids the rapid adsorption of most of the p in addition the p in aqueous solution was not reduced to an oligotrophic state in most cases especially in the test with kh2po4 this was attributed to the insufficient doses of the materials as was described in section 2 5 the relatively high p concentrations applied in the tests were to ensure that the adsorption characteristics could be observed however a long term equilibrium p adsorption was observed especially for la5 dwtr indicating that the successfully developed adsorbent achieved an initial rapid and a long term equilibrium p adsorption inactivating materials raw and la5 dwtr from the test using plant residues were selected for ssa and porosity analysis because they can provide information on the responses of pore size distributions to p adsorption under the effect of organic matter released from h cordata the results showed fig 4 that p immobilization by raw dwtr and la5 dwtr within 10 d were mainly associated with the decrease in mesopores and ssa whereas the immobilization by raw dwtr during 10 60 d were associated with the decrease in micropores and ssa these facts indicated that p immobilization by dwtr occurred first by the occupation of mesopores and ssa following by the occupation of micropores and ssa accordingly the substantial increase in mesopores and ssa of la5 dwtr compared to raw dwtr was the reason for the increased rapid p immobilization the p immobilized by la5 dwtr occupied mesopores which may have resulted in the formation of new micropores fig 4 furthermore the stable pore size distributions of la5 dwtr and the presence of organic matter in solution during the remaining time after 10 d adsorption for most of p released from plant residues suggested that organic matter which often has a relatively higher molecular weight than reactive p e g phosphates had difficulty to diffuse into mesopores and micropores indicating the stable long term p immobilization capacity of la5 dwtr another important finding related to p immobilization in lake sediment was that the la loading induced increases in hcl p transformed from mobile p in the amended sediment a similar effect of phoslock on p distributions was observed in sediments dithmer et al 2016 and many studies have demonstrated the high stability of la bound p in sediments copetti et al 2016 furthermore mobile p immobilization mainly occurred within 2 d fig 5 suggesting that the immobilization in sediment was dominated by the rapid adsorption capacity of the modified dwtr this explains why the immobilization efficiencies increased with increases in la loading ratio without observing a reduced long term p immobilization as in the adsorption test with kh2po4 the substantially enhanced p immobilization efficiencies in sediment also indicated that la modification can reduce the material dosage to inhibit the release of p from sediment to water column the dosage for p pollution control in lake restoration should be based on the rapid adsorption capacity of the modified dwtr for the mobile p in sediment and the long term immobilization capacities were for other potential p sources especially from overlying water based on the results of the biological test and the p immobilization capacity of la modified dwtr in aqueous solutions and lake sediments a la loading ratio of 5 is the most appropriate amount for dwtr modification to control eutrophication la5 dwtr notably the long term immobilization was a relative capacity of the modified dwtr and served to enhance the effectiveness of eutrophication control thereby reducing the potential uncertainties of lake geo engineering 5 conclusions this study presented a method to develop inactivating materials to achieve an initial rapid and long term equilibrium p immobilization based on dwtr for lake geo engineering the conclusions are 1 la loading into dwtr was based on ligand exchanges of la with al fe hydroxides and aromatic c c c c h and carboxylate groups as well as on the formation of new particles resulting in the changes in pore size distributions 2 a ratio 5 for la loading into dwtr ensured the safety of the developed materials for b aeruginosa and avoided using excessive amounts of la during the modification 3 the la modification substantially enhanced the rapid immobilization capacity of dwtr especially at a loading ratio of 5 the initial p adsorption rate increased from 2 42 to 2 87 18 1 mg g 1 d 1 for dwtr after loading 5 la calculated by the pseudo second order equation an initial rapid and a long term equilibrium immobilization were achieved for p removal from aqueous solutions whereas the mobile p immobilization in lake sediments was regulated by the rapid immobilization capacity the results indicate that la5 dwtr is a promising material for lake geo engineering acknowledgements this work was supported by grants from national natural

19628,this study presents an approach for developing inactivating materials to achieve an initial rapid and a long term equilibrium p immobilization to control eutrophication based on drinking water treatment residue dwtr which is a byproduct of potable water production by taking advantage of the long term equilibrium p adsorption by dwtr the la chemical properties and the previous success of using la modified bentonite clay phoslock we used dwtr as a la carrier with different ratios to develop the specific materials the la loading mechanisms the potentially toxic effect of la modified dwtr on snail bellamya aeruginosa within 120 d and the short and long term within 80 d p immobilization characteristics of the modified dwtr were investigated to understand the performance of the developed materials the results showed that la loading into dwtr was based on ligand exchanges and the formation of new particles dwtr loaded with 5 la had no toxicity against the snail most importantly the loading of 5 la to dwtr substantially enhanced the rapid immobilization capacity of dwtr achieving an initial rapid and a long term equilibrium p adsorption in aqueous solutions this study promotes the beneficial recycling of dwtr and results in a win win situation for lake restoration graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water treatment residue adsorption phosphorus eutrophication 1 introduction the geo engineering of lakes using p inactivating materials to control eutrophication has received broad attention from scientists an understanding of the reliability of the technique under various conditions is essential for this beneficial application lürling et al 2016 to date the reliability was mainly investigated by focusing on two aspects one is the side effect spears et al 2016 mucci et al 2017 especially with regard to metal pollution risks and potential toxic effects on organisms e g benthic animals wang and jiang 2016 the other aspect is the control effectiveness lürling et al 2016 to achieve effective control improved methods and techniques were often used to reduce the potential uncertainties one of these uncertainties is the presence of algal blooms accordingly the technique of flocculation and immobilization was developed to control algal blooms and the successful application of this method at the field scale has been reported using modified local soil wang et al 2016a and the combination of polyaluminium chloride and la modified bentonite clay phoslock lürling and van oosterhout 2013 and of iron chloride and phoslock waajen et al 2017a another typical uncertainty is related to the various potential p sources that release p slowly e g during plant senescence into water column inducing undesirable restoration effects wang et al 2016b therefore inactivating materials was recommended for application in single large doses or in repeated doses kleeberg et al 2013 meis et al 2013 however single large doses increased the potentially unfavorable effect on the surroundings gołdyn et al 2014 and inactivating materials dosed in repetition increased the cost of lake geo engineering therefore the development of new inactivating materials with a high p adsorption capacity that allows for reducing the dosage and repeated applications remains the focus of many studies douglas et al 2016 funes et al 2016 fan et al 2017 in this study a method of initial rapid and long term equilibrium p adsorption for the development of new inactivating materials was developed for lake geo engineering drinking water treatment residue dwtr is an inevitable and non hazardous byproduct generated in large amounts during potable water production okuda et al 2014 the residue has long been dumped in landfills but the cost and available land needed for the disposal will likely increase due to the increased production wang and jiang 2016 accordingly the productive reuse of dwtr has attracted worldwide interest in recent decades keeley et al 2016 and dwtr has been commonly recycled in environmental remediation ippolito et al 2011 the recycling process is often based on the adsorption capacity of dwtr due to the amorphous al fe and organic components in dwtr resulting from the utilization of al fe coagulants in water purification ippolito et al 2011 dwtr is an effective adsorbent of many contaminants e g p makris et al 2005 toxic metals lin et al 2017b and toxic organic pollutants punamiya et al 2013 in particular dwtr exhibited high performance for p adsorption makris et al 2005 the p adsorption characteristics of dwtr have been investigated comprehensively to improve the recycling process the p adsorption by dwtr occurs mainly by ligand exchanges yang et al 2006 and the adsorbed p is dominated by fe and al bound forms ippolito et al 2011 and exhibits high stability under various conditions e g the existence of organic matter boyer et al 2011 and various redox conditions oliver et al 2011 interestingly a specific characteristic of p adsorption by dwtr is a long term equilibrium and the processes can be maintained for 80 d makris et al 2005 the specific characteristics are closely related to dwtr porosity makris et al 2005 which also results in a stable p adsorption a previous study found that the 1 d p adsorption contents by dwtr only accounted for 23 8 of the 48 d adsorption with agitation in kh2po4 solution prepared with deionized water wang et al 2016b the p adsorption by dwtr was often described as initial rapid and long term equilibrium but the initial rapid adsorption was relative makris et al 2005 compared to other materials e g al and fe salts dwtr advantage for p pollution control is the long term immobilization 150 d wang et al 2016b in recent years la has been widely applied to develop materials with high adsorption capacity dong and wang 2016 typically la has been commonly used for the development of p adsorbents douglas et al 2016 because the p precipitation by la is more effective over a wide ph range 4 5 8 5 and the la p complex is the least soluble among the rare earth p complexes and can form at low concentrations firsching and brune 1991 firsching and kell 1993 phoslock which uses bentonite clay as a la carrier is being increasingly used to control lake eutrophication douglas 2002 copetti et al 2016 with regard to the adsorption kinetics many studies have indicated a rapid p adsorption by phoslock especially under agitation haghseresht et al 2009 lürling et al 2014 the 1 d p adsorption contents by phoslock were found to account for 86 4 of the 48 d adsorption with agitation in kh2po4 solution wang et al 2016b in consideration of dwtr p adsorption characteristics la chemical properties and the successful experiences of the use of phoslock in this study we used dwtr as a la carrier to develop p inactivating materials with the characteristics of an initial rapid and a long term equilibrium p adsorption for lake geo engineering for a comprehensive understanding of the performance of the la modified dwtr we first determined la loading mechanisms on dwtr by using scanning electron microscopy sem x ray fluorescence xrf x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and specific surface area ssa and porosity analysis the potential effects of the materials on the snail species bellamya aeruginosa b aeruginosa were assessed as a common benthic animal in freshwater ecosystems b aeruginosa has been recommended as a model species for sediment toxicity assessment and has been widely applied to evaluate the environmental risks of different pollutants han et al 2010 ma et al 2010 finally the short and long term p immobilization by the modified dwtr were investigated in aqueous solutions and lake sediments the successful development of inactivating materials based on dwtr is beneficial from an environmental and economic standpoint resulting in win win techniques and promoting circular economy 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation dewatered dwtr was collected from beijing city no 9 waterworks in china lake water sediment plants houttuynia cordata h cordata and snails b aeruginosa were collected from lake xuanwu china surface sediments 32 04 n 118 48 e were sampled at a depth of 0 5 cm via a caliber core sampler φ110 mm length 500 mm rigo co japan lake water was sampled at a depth of approximately 0 5 m using a 1 m long and 10 cm diameter plexiglass tube 2 2 dwtr modification prior to the modification dwtr was heated at 500 c under a nitrogen atmosphere for 4 h the heat treated dwtr was mixed and agitated with deionized water at a concentration of 200 g l 1 at ph 1 for 24 h at 25 c and subsequently the ph of the mixtures was adjusted to 9 the la solutions prepared by lacl3 using deionized water with ph 9 were added to the dwtr mixtures to achieve a dwtr concentration of 100 g l 1 the ph adjustment for the dwtr mixtures and la solutions was repeated five times in 4 h and one time after standing overnight approximately 16 h to obtain a relatively stable ph using 1 3 m naoh and hcl solutions the la and dwtr mixtures were agitated at 60 c for 5 h and subsequently aged for 24 h at 25 c finally the solids in the mixtures were separated washed three times with deionized water and oven dried to obtain the la modified dwtr la weight ratios of 0 1 2 5 5 10 and 20 were used for the modification and are referred to as la0 dwtr la1 dwtr la2 5 dwtr la5 dwtr la10 dwtr and la20 dwtr respectively in this study heat treatment was used to decrease the aliphaticity of dwtr wang et al 2016c because the aliphatic compounds may occupy the adsorption sites of la a subsequent acid treatment was used to activate the aged al and fe in dwtr caused by heat treatment wang et al 2011 the method for la loading was based on a study of developing la al pillared montmorillonite tian et al 2009 the n2 sorption desorption the main structures and the chemical compositions were characterized by ssa and porosity analysis nova4200e quantachrome usa sem sx650 hitachi japan and xrf arl 9800 switzerland respectively the chemical states of al2p fe2p c1s and la3d in dwtr were determined by xps escalab 250 thermo fisher scientific usa the total contents of fe al la ca na k and mg in the materials were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry or mass spectrometry agilent 7700x usa the ph values of dwtr before and after modification were also measured 2 3 bellamya aeruginosa culture test the sampled b aeruginosa in growth stages were firstly cultured in filtered lake water filtered through 0 45 μm glass fiber filters at room temperature 20 25 c in a plexiglass culture box under natural light and were provided with the sampled h

approximately 11 5 mm a plexiglass culture box containing 48 sub boxes was prepared the culture test included 8 groups namely a blank group control and groups with the addition of raw dwtr and la0 la20 dwtr respectively each group had 6 sub boxes replications except for control group 25 g material 500 ml lake water and 6 snails with the ratio 1 1 for female and male fig s1 were added to each sub box the culture parameters were similar to the test for the b aeruginosa prescreening snail growth was determined every 30 d based on the height fig s1 overlying water properties were measured every week after 120 d snails were sampled for analysis in addition to measuring snail height enzymatic activities in snail liver including glutathione reductase gr catalase cat malondialdehyde mda and superoxide dismutase sod were determined by using ultraviolet colorimetry ammonium molybdate 2 thiobarbituric acid and hydroxylamine methods respectively nanjing jiancheng bioengineering institute

ammonium n nh4 n nitrate n no3 n nitrite n no2 n and p in the solutions were measured by a smartchem discrete autoanalyzer smartchem 200 ams westco italy the ph ph 10 sartorius germany and total organic carbon toc torch teledyne tekmar usa were also determined 2 4 p immobilization test the p immobilization by la modified dwtr was determined in aqueous solutions and lake sediments the p immobilization in aqueous solutions was based on kh2po4 and the plant residues in the test using kh2po4 inactivating materials were mixed in conical flasks with solutions containing 10 mg p l 1 at a concentration of 0 5 g l 1 in the test using plant residues inactivating materials were mixed in conical flasks with 500 ml of lake water containing the plant the material doses accounted for 10 of the fresh plant weight and the plant residues were cut into pieces approximately 1 cm long the adsorption tests were statically incubated at 25 c in the dark and were sampled at certain intervals within 60 80 d for p analysis all tests were run in triplicate the p concentrations adopted herein were to ensure the observation of the initial rapid and long term equilibrium p adsorption by the materials in addition during the test with the plant residues inactivating materials were sampled for ssa and porosity analysis total p in plant residues wang et al 2016b and toc in lake water were also measured for p immobilization in lake sediments fresh sediments of 250 g were completely mixed in beakers with materials and then the mixtures were incubated at 15 c in the dark during incubation deionized water was added resulting in 3 5 mm of water overlay in the beakers the added materials accounted for 0 control group 5 10 and 20 of the sediments in dry weight samples were collected on the

section 2 1 2 5 are presented in supporting information 3 results 3 1 characteristics of la modified dwtr the n2 gas sorption desorption characteristics of dwtr before and after modification are shown in fig 1 a compared with raw dwtr the n2 gas sorption capacity of la0 dwtr was substantially higher after la modification the gas sorption increased but as la loading ratios increased no clear trend was observed accordingly density functional theory dft model was used to calculate the pore size distributions compared to raw dwtr la0 dwtr had larger volumes with pore radius 1 00 and 2 17 10 0 nm and smaller volumes with pore radius 1 73 2 17 nm after la modification the volumes with pore radius 2 50 5 40 nm decreased substantially whereas the volumes with pore radius 2 17 and 5 40 18 0 nm increased as la loading ratios increased the variations of pore volumes based on radius were divided into four classes radius 1 00 1 00 3 40 3 40 5 40 and 5 40 18 0 nm these findings suggested that the effect of la modification on pore size distribution of dwtr was irregular as loading ratios increased but la occupied some mesopores at radius 2 50 5 40 nm and generally the volumes for different pore sizes increased especially the radius 5 40 nm in addition the ssa and total pore volumes tpv were higher for la0 dwtr than raw dwtr as la loading ratios increased the ssa and tpv of dwtr increased with the exception of the tpv of la1 dwtr which slightly decreased compared to la0 dwtr the elemental distributions in dwtr before and after la modification are shown in table 1 and table s2 compared to raw dwtr la0 dwtr had relatively higher total contents of fe al ca na k and mg p 0 01 which may be due to the concentration effect caused by heat treatment as la loading ratios increased total metal contents decreased in the modified dwtr whereas total la content increased and had a range of 9 78 175 mg g 1 p 0 01 the xrf results showed similar trends for metal distributions however la proportions in the modified dwtr as determined by xrf 7 25 39 2 were substantially higher than total la the differences may be caused by the fact that xrf is more suited for analyzing the elemental distributions on a solid surface accordingly the loaded la was mainly on dwtr surface this finding was supported by the sem results fig 1b and fig s2 which indicated a rougher surface and more particles on dwtr surface as la loading ratios increased the chemical species of al2p fe2p c1s and la3d on dwtr before and after modification are shown in fig 2 and figs s3 s6 affiliations of peaks associated with different chemicals species were based on previous reports wang et al 2016c and the link of http srdata nist gov xps selenergytype aspx in general the dominant chemical species of al fe and la in the materials included oxide and hydroxide groups compared to raw dwtr al and fe oxides in la0 dwtr had smaller proportions which may have been caused by the acid treatment after heat treatment as la loading ratios increased al and fe oxides in la1 and la2 5 dwtr increased and tended to decrease for la5 la20 dwtr in contrast la hydroxides gradually increased as la loading ratios increased with regard to c in dwtr the species included aromatic c c c c h 284 5 284 8 ev c o aromatic c 285 3 286 1 ev c o ketone c 287 0 287 5 ev c in carboxylate group 288 3 288 5 and c in carbonate group 289 2 289 9 ev compared with raw dwtr la0 dwtr contained relatively high proportions of c in aromatic c c c c h and c o aromatic c after dwtr modification a decrease in aromatic c c c c h 284 5 284 8 ev and carboxylate 288 3 288 5 groups and an increase in c o aromatic c 285 3 286 1 ev groups were clearly observed as la loading ratios increased these results suggested that la modification induced the changes in al fe c and la species in dwtr 3 2 response of b aeruginosa to la modified dwtr the physiological and biochemical responses of b aeruginosa to la modified dwtr are shown in fig 3 and fig s7 the snail heights increased with incubation time fig 3a and fig s7 but the snails grew faster in the control than in other groups with materials the growth heights decreased as la loading ratios increased at different incubation times especially in the groups with la10 and la20 dwtr p 0 01 the variations in enzymatic activity in snail livers fig 3b showed that compared to the control gr increased p 0 01 while cat decreased p 0 01 whereas the cr and cat contents were similar in the groups with materials the mda and sod also showed a similar change the two enzymatic activities in la10 and la20 dwtr p 0 01 groups tended to have higher values than in other groups further analysis table 2 showed that after the addition of materials total contents of fe al and la increased p 0 01 or 0 05 in most times in snails soft tissue the fe and al contents in different dwtr groups did not exhibit any regular changes but the la contents clearly increased as la loading ratios increased from la5 to la20 dwtr groups p 0 01 interestingly the p contents in soft tissues decreased after materials addition p 0 01 or 0 05 and the rate of decrease increased as la loading ratios increased the changes in total contents of ca na k and mg were mainly within 10 and also irregular in addition the mortalities of the animals in different groups were within 5 after the test the changes in overlying properties are shown in fig s8 and the detailed descriptions are provided in supporting information in order to explore the potential relationships between the snail responses and the environmental conditions a linear correlation analysis was performed fig 3c f after materials addition the increased ph of overlying water p 0 01 and the increased la in soft tissues p 0 01 as well as the decreased p in soft tissues p 0 05 and the decreased no3 n in overlying water p 0 01 inhibited the snails growth the decreased no3 n and p in overlying water following materials addition caused increases in gr p 0 01 and cat p 0 01 the decreased toc p 0 05 and the increased nh4 n p 0 01 in overlying water induced an increase in mda and the increased nh4 n in overlying water p 0 05 and the increased la in soft tissues p 0 05 increased sod in the liver 3 3 p immobilization capacity of la modified dwtr 3 3 1 p immobilization in aqueous solution the removal of p from aqueous solution based on kh2po4 is shown in fig 4 a as the incubation time increased to 80 d the p concentrations gradually decreased from 10 0 to 2 88 mg l 1 by raw dwtr and a similar decrease was observed for la0 dwtr in contrast la modification substantially enhanced the initial adsorption by dwtr and the enhancement increased with increases in la loading ratios according to the pseudo second order equation table s5 the initial p adsorption rate by raw and la0 dwtr were 2 42 and 2 87 mg g 1 d 1 whereas the rates substantially increased as la loading ratios increased and the rate for la5 dwtr was 18 1 mg g 1 d 1 the estimated maximum p rapid adsorption capacities 24 h by langmuir model also clearly increased for the modified dwtr fig s9 and ranged from 5 56 to 6 81 raw and la0 dwtr to 12 7 mg g 1 la5 dwtr interestingly the enhanced p removal by la1 and la2 5 dwtr decreased over time the p removal was even lower for la1 dwtr than raw dwtr on the 80th d however an increased p removal occurred in la5 dwtr p 0 01 and the final concentration was 0 200 mg l 1 therefore the la loading enhanced the rapid p adsorption by dwtr but tended to reduce the long term equilibrium p adsorption the removal of p from aqueous solution based on plant residues is shown in fig 4b the release of p from plant residues occurred during the first 22 d and then the concentration 9 4 mg l 1 slightly decreased possibly caused by microbial activity after materials addition the p concentrations clearly decreased the p was gradually removed by raw dwtr and on the 32nd d the concentrations were stable within 0 240 0 270 mg l 1 however la modification substantially enhanced p removal and most of p immobilization occurred during the first 7 d the enhanced p removal increased with increases in la loading ratios p 0 01 in particular the concentrations quickly reduced to 0 0333 mg l 1 by la5 dwtr the results suggested an enhanced p removal by dwtr as a result of la modification in addition the total p of h cordata was 8 8 mg g 1 in dry weight and the toc contents in the solutions of this test were 75 180 mg l 1 at the starting and ending times the toc contents were markedly higher than in raw lake water fig s8 indicating the release of organic matter from plant residues the results of n2 gas sorption desorption by raw and la5 dwtr during the test using plant residues are shown fig 4c and d after the immobilization test the n2 gas adsorption decreased in raw and la5 dwtr fig 4c the dft model was applied to analyze the pore size distributions fig 4d for raw dwtr the mesopores with an approximate radius of 2 nm decreased during the first 10 d whereas the micropores radius 0 9 nm decreased during the entire 60 d test the changes in the volumes of the mesopores and micropores in la5 dwtr mainly occurred during the first 10 d interestingly the mesopores with a radius of 1 18 nm decreased but the micropores increased after p immobilization moreover decreases in the tpv and ssa were observed for raw and la5 dwtr during the immobilization test whereas the decreases in la5 dwtr mainly occurred during the first 10 d 3 3 2 p immobilization in lake sediment the p distributions in lake sediments before and after dwtr modification are shown in fig 5 and fig s10 substantial effects were observed for the distributions of mobile p nh4cl p and bd p naoh ip and hcl p p 0 01 for most times accordingly the three p forms are discussed the p distributions in sediments with materials were similar for the 2 d and 60 d incubation times indicating that the immobilization mainly occurred within 2 d the mobile p in sediment substantially decreased after material addition and the decrease rate increased with increasing dosages furthermore la modification enhanced the mobile p immobilization efficacies in sediments and the enhancement increased with increasing la loading ratios the efficacy of la5 dwtr at a dose of 0 05 8 0 15 was similar to the efficacy of raw and la0 dwtr at a dose of 0 2 5 0 9 0 fig 5d further comparisons suggested that naoh ip increased in sediments with raw and la0 dwtr as doses increased whereas naoh ip decreased in sediments with the modified dwtr as la loading ratios increased even in sediments with la5 dwtr naoh ip 35 45 were similar to those in sediment without any amendments 30 43 interestingly although hcl p exhibited few changes in sediments with raw and la0 dwtr this p form increased as la loading ratios and doses increased in particular hcl p increased from 6 0 9 0 to 30 42 in sediments with la5 dwtr as the doses increased from 0 to 0 2 therefore the higher the la loading in dwtr the higher the amount of hcl p is that is transformed from the mobile form in the amended sediment 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between la loading mechanisms and adsorption characteristics an understanding of la loading mechanisms is required to investigate the changes in dwtr adsorption characteristics on the one hand the increases in al and fe oxides and c o aromatic c 285 3 286 1 ev groups in dwtr and the decrease in aromatic c c c c h 284 5 284 8 ev and carboxylate after la loading fig 2 and fig s3 s6 indicated the potential ligand exchanges of la with the al fe hydroxides and the carboxylate phenol groups equations 1 3 on the other hand la loading resulted in more particles on dwtr surface fig 1b considering the increase in la proportions on the surface table 1 the surface roughness fig 1b and the increased la hydroxides as the loading ratios increased fig 2 the particles were likely dominated by la hydroxides in addition electrostatic adsorption may have also contributed to la loading in dwtr because the isoelectric point of dwtr was commonly at neutral ph values wang et al 2016c whereas the la modification was performed at ph 9 image 2 image 3 image 4 the dwtr adsorption capacity was closely related to the contents of fe al and organic c and the relatively higher values of tpv ssa and pore volumes of la0 dwtr for a certain pore radius 1 00 and 2 17 10 0 nm compared to raw dwtr were mainly caused by the oxygen limited heat treatment wang et al 2016c accordingly la loading reduced the adsorption capacity of dwtr by occupying the adsorption sites equations 1 3 the dilution effect caused by la loading may have also reduced the adsorption capacity because the total fe and al contents in dwtr decreased after la loading table 1 in contrast the modification promoted the formation of new surfaces particles increasing the adsorption capacity of dwtr these two contradicting effects induced the changes in pore size distributions at radius 5 40 nm under different la loading ratios whereas the gradually increased volumes at radius 5 40 18 0 nm with increasing loading ratios indicated that the modification was beneficial to the formation of mesopores with relatively high radius in addition the la loading ratios accounted for 1 2 5 5 0 10 and 20 of total dwtr whereas the total la contents table 1 for la1 la20 dwtr were 0 978 2 58 5 47 7 94 and 17 5 respectively these results suggested that the la loading efficiencies decreased in la10 and la20 dwtr to reduce waste la loading ratios of 5 0 are recommended for dwtr modification 4 2 the ecotoxicity of dwtr before and after modification the assessment of environmental risks is essential to select appropriate inactivating materials for lake geo engineering lürling et al 2016 and the responses of benthic animals to material additions have often been the focuses of scientists copetti et al 2016 wang and jiang 2016 most studies have focused on the changes in the benthic communities waajen et al 2017a yin et al 2018 and the toxicological effects on various macrobenthos e g crayfish mussels fingernail clams and chironomids clearwater et al 2014 van oosterhout et al 2014 álvarez manzaneda et al 2017 accordingly biological test was conducted to determine the potential toxicity of the modified dwtr the potential toxic effect was assessed based on snail mortalities growth and enzymatic activities gr cat mda and sod in the liver gr maintains the activities of sulfhydryl and cat prevents damages caused by hydroxyl radicals hou et al 2014 the mda accumulation is an indication of oxidative stress and sod catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen as well as the conversion of h2o2 to 2h2o by glutathione peroxidase or to o2 and h2o by catalase hou et al 2014 based on the changes in enzymatic activities in livers and the inhibited snail growth fig 1 and fig s7 the material addition had potentially unfavorable effects on the animals although the little toxic effect of the modified dwtr was confirmed by the limited snail mortalities in the groups with materials potentially unfavorable effects were further found to be related to the decreased nutrients levels toc no3 n and p in overlying water and p in snails soft tissues and to the increased ph and nh4 n in overlying water and la in soft tissues the decrease in the toc and p in overlying water may be attributed to the adsorption by the modified dwtr which released hydroxyl ions wang and jiang 2016 and increased the ph of overlying water these changes were not taken into consideration to evaluate the safety of the materials because they were the results of pollution control nevertheless the increased nh4 n in overlying water in la10 and la20 dwtr groups fig s8 suggested a potential inhibition of nitrification a similar phenomenon was reported for phoslock in lake sediments lin et al 2017a and the reason may be that the p inactivating materials suppressed ammonia oxidizers by changing the surrounding conditions lin et al 2017a in fact soil nitrifiers have been found to be sensitive to la chu et al 2001 furthermore the increased la accumulation in snails soft tissues after materials addition indicated the la availability to the snails interestingly as la loading ratios increased from 0 to 2 5 table 2 the accumulated la showed a decreasing trend from 0 278 to 0 191 mg g 1 even as ratio increased from 5 to 20 the accumulated la increased from 0 355 to 0 486 mg g 1 p 0 01 this suggested the limited bioavailability of la loaded into dwtr and may be related to the weak alkaline condition and the presence of toc in overlying water copetti et al 2016 and also to that the loaded la in dwtr was in a relatively stable form e g binding with al fe and organic matter fig 2 considering that in la10 and la20 dwtr groups the inhibition of snails growth as well as the increases in mda and sod in livers nh4 n in overlying water and la in the soft tissues were relatively obvious la loading ratios 5 of total dwtr are recommended the same ratio range is recommended for an effective la loading in dwtr because it avoids wasting la during the modification the proportion of la in phoslock is also approximately 5 copetti et al 2016 similarly induced la accumulations in organisms were observed for phoslock e g crayfish fish and macrophytes van oosterhout et al 2014 waajen et al 2017b and la salts e g b aeruginosa yang et al 1999 copetti et al 2016 have comprehensively summarized ecotoxicological studies for la salts and la in phoslock and found a large range of ecotoxicological responses across a wide range of taxa a preliminary quality criterion for la in sediments is 36 9 mg kg 1 herrmann et al 2016 however there were no indications of long term negative effects on phoslock treated ecosystems copetti et al 2016 these reports indirectly demonstrated that the recommended la loading ratios 5 for dwtr are applicable natural ecosystems are complex and more detailed investigations on the safety of la modified dwtr are required wang et al 2016d 4 3 characteristics of p immobilization according to the recommendation in section 4 1 and 4 2 la loading ratios 5 in dwtr were selected for the p immobilization tests the results of the tests in aqueous solution suggested a substantially increased rapid p adsorption by la modified dwtr at different ratios fig 4 interestingly a reduced long term p adsorption was observed for dwtr after la modification especially for la1 dwtr in the adsorption tests with kh2po4 the reason may be that la occupied some adsorption sites related to long term p adsorption in dwtr which was further confirmed by the determined la loading mechanisms equation 1 an inhibited long term p adsorption was not observed for la modified dwtr in the test with plant residues this occurred because p loading was higher for the kh2po4 20 mg g 1 than the plant residues 8 8 mg g 1 see section 2 4 a higher p loading avoids the rapid adsorption of most of the p in addition the p in aqueous solution was not reduced to an oligotrophic state in most cases especially in the test with kh2po4 this was attributed to the insufficient doses of the materials as was described in section 2 5 the relatively high p concentrations applied in the tests were to ensure that the adsorption characteristics could be observed however a long term equilibrium p adsorption was observed especially for la5 dwtr indicating that the successfully developed adsorbent achieved an initial rapid and a long term equilibrium p adsorption inactivating materials raw and la5 dwtr from the test using plant residues were selected for ssa and porosity analysis because they can provide information on the responses of pore size distributions to p adsorption under the effect of organic matter released from h cordata the results showed fig 4 that p immobilization by raw dwtr and la5 dwtr within 10 d were mainly associated with the decrease in mesopores and ssa whereas the immobilization by raw dwtr during 10 60 d were associated with the decrease in micropores and ssa these facts indicated that p immobilization by dwtr occurred first by the occupation of mesopores and ssa following by the occupation of micropores and ssa accordingly the substantial increase in mesopores and ssa of la5 dwtr compared to raw dwtr was the reason for the increased rapid p immobilization the p immobilized by la5 dwtr occupied mesopores which may have resulted in the formation of new micropores fig 4 furthermore the stable pore size distributions of la5 dwtr and the presence of organic matter in solution during the remaining time after 10 d adsorption for most of p released from plant residues suggested that organic matter which often has a relatively higher molecular weight than reactive p e g phosphates had difficulty to diffuse into mesopores and micropores indicating the stable long term p immobilization capacity of la5 dwtr another important finding related to p immobilization in lake sediment was that the la loading induced increases in hcl p transformed from mobile p in the amended sediment a similar effect of phoslock on p distributions was observed in sediments dithmer et al 2016 and many studies have demonstrated the high stability of la bound p in sediments copetti et al 2016 furthermore mobile p immobilization mainly occurred within 2 d fig 5 suggesting that the immobilization in sediment was dominated by the rapid adsorption capacity of the modified dwtr this explains why the immobilization efficiencies increased with increases in la loading ratio without observing a reduced long term p immobilization as in the adsorption test with kh2po4 the substantially enhanced p immobilization efficiencies in sediment also indicated that la modification can reduce the material dosage to inhibit the release of p from sediment to water column the dosage for p pollution control in lake restoration should be based on the rapid adsorption capacity of the modified dwtr for the mobile p in sediment and the long term immobilization capacities were for other potential p sources especially from overlying water based on the results of the biological test and the p immobilization capacity of la modified dwtr in aqueous solutions and lake sediments a la loading ratio of 5 is the most appropriate amount for dwtr modification to control eutrophication la5 dwtr notably the long term immobilization was a relative capacity of the modified dwtr and served to enhance the effectiveness of eutrophication control thereby reducing the potential uncertainties of lake geo engineering 5 conclusions this study presented a method to develop inactivating materials to achieve an initial rapid and long term equilibrium p immobilization based on dwtr for lake geo engineering the conclusions are 1 la loading into dwtr was based on ligand exchanges of la with al fe hydroxides and aromatic c c c c h and carboxylate groups as well as on the formation of new particles resulting in the changes in pore size distributions 2 a ratio 5 for la loading into dwtr ensured the safety of the developed materials for b aeruginosa and avoided using excessive amounts of la during the modification 3 the la modification substantially enhanced the rapid immobilization capacity of dwtr especially at a loading ratio of 5 the initial p adsorption rate increased from 2 42 to 2 87 18 1 mg g 1 d 1 for dwtr after loading 5 la calculated by the pseudo second order equation an initial rapid and a long term equilibrium immobilization were achieved for p removal from aqueous solutions whereas the mobile p immobilization in lake sediments was regulated by the rapid immobilization capacity the results indicate that la5 dwtr is a promising material for lake geo engineering acknowledgements this work was supported by grants from national natural

19629,quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr is now commonly used to detect fecal indicator bacteria fib as well as pathogens in water samples however dna loss during sample processing can cause underestimation of target genes in this study we created a sample process control strain spc by genetically engineering a non pathogenic gram negative bacterium pseudogulbenkiania sp strain nh8b the spc strain named nh8b 1d2 has a kanamycin resistance gene inserted to one of the 23s rrna genes to specifically quantify the spc strain a new taqman qpcr assay was developed to obtain the relationship between the dna recovery efficiencies of various pathogens and those of the spc strain known amount of e coli o157 h7 salmonella typhimurium campylobacter jejuni or listeria monocytogenes cells were co spiked with the spc strain to environmental water samples the dna recovery efficiencies were calculated by comparing the quantity of bacterial cells inoculated to water samples prior to filtration and dna extraction and those measured by qpcr we then obtained the ratios in the recovery efficiencies between pathogens and spc strain rr path spc the rr path spc values obtained using oono pond water collected in japan were used as a pathogen specific constant to estimate the accurate concentrations of pathogens in water samples collected from mississippi river in minnesota estimated pathogen concentrations were not significantly different from the inoculated pathogen concentration suggesting our normalization approach is useful to estimate the accurate concentrations of pathogens in environmental water samples the qpcr assay targeting the spc strains and fib were incorporated into the microfluidic qpcr chip format pbq chip ver 2 therefore we can simultaneously quantify multiple pathogens fib and the spc strain in high throughput from many water samples this new tool can be useful for water quality monitoring and risk assessment graphical abstract image 1 keywords quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr sample process control spc microfluidic qpcr pathogens fecal indicator bacteria fib water quality 1 introduction various bacterial viral and protozoan pathogens can cause human diseases occurrences of pathogens in food water and other environmental matrices are potential threats to human health to prevent disease outbreaks levels of pathogen contamination and their potential risks to human health should be properly assessed ishii et al 2014b currently fecal indicator bacteria fib such as escherichia coli and enterococci are used to monitor levels of fecal contamination in a water sample however recent technology advancement allows us to directly quantify multiple pathogens ishii et al 2013 2014a kronlein et al 2014 molecular tools such as polymerase chain reaction pcr and its derivative quantitative pcr qpcr have been frequently used to directly quantify pathogenic bacteria in various samples while various methods have been developed to simultaneously detect multiple pathogens kronlein et al 2014 microfluidic qpcr mfqpcr based approach is promising because it can provide quantitative information of multiple pathogens for many samples in a timely manner ishii et al 2013 2014a in mfqpcr chip different qpcrs can be run simultaneously in nanoliter 10 12 liter volume chambers that are present in high densities on a chip quantitative information obtained by mfqpcr approach can be used for risk assessment ishii et al 2014b while pcr based approaches including mfqpcr are generally sensitive to detect target molecules present at low concentrations the reaction can be inhibited by pcr inhibitors such as humic substances tsai and olson 1992 with the presence of pcr inhibitors inaccurate quantitative results can be obtained by qpcr opel et al 2010 in addition microbial cell could be lost during cell concentration processes such as membrane filtration centrifugation and other techniques furthermore some portion of dna could be lost during the dna extraction and purification procedure previously reported dna recovery efficiencies ranged from 2 5 stoeckel et al 2009 to 66 lebuhn et al 2004 dna extraction methods can greatly influence the recovery efficiencies demeke and jenkins 2010 even when identical dna extraction method is used dna recovery efficiencies could vary by samples e g 0 2 28 stoeckel et al 2009 therefore dna recovery efficiency of target bacteria needs to be calculated and normalized to obtain accurate quantitative data one approach to obtain dna recovery efficiencies is to use a sample process control spc a known amount of spc is added to the samples before sample processing e g water filtration and dna extraction after dna extraction the quantity of the spc is quantified by spc specific qpcr by comparing the quantity of spc inoculated and the quantity of spc measured by qpcr we can calculate the dna recovery efficiency the dna recovery efficiency values can be used to estimate the true concentrations of the target dna molecules e g pathogen marker genes ideally spc should 1 be absent when no spc is spiked 2 be concentrated similar to the target cells 3 be lysed in similar manner to the target cells and 4 contain dna that is extracted and quantified with similar efficiency to that of the target cells stoeckel et al 2009 in addition spc should not interfere with the quantification of target microorganisms previously stoeckel et al 2009 used a plant pathogen pantoea stewartii as a spc strain however background population of pantoea stewartii may cause inaccurate dna recovery efficiency stoeckel et al 2009 also used e coli carrying plasmid borne target gene there is no background population of this genetically engineered e coli strain however number of plasmids per cell can change with the physiological state of the cells in addition dna extraction efficiencies can be different between genomic dna and plasmid dna kobayashi et al 2013 used a genetically engineered e coli strain that has kanamycin resistant gene in its β galactosidase gene lacz as a spc strain they designed spc specific qpcr assay targeting a junction region between lacz and kanamycin resistance gene because their gene modification was made on the e coli chromosome target gene molecule is present per genome per cell however if this strain is spiked to environmental water samples levels of e coli cannot be reliably obtained because e coli is used as a fib usepa 2012 quantity of e coli needs to be measured to assess fecal contamination in the water environments therefore spc needs to be developed using non fib microorganisms the objectives of this study were i to develop a stable spc strain that is not naturally present in the environment ii to design qpcr assay to specifically quantify spc marker gene which does not interfere quantification of fib iii to include this assay to the mfqpcr chip for simultaneous multipathogen quantification and iv to apply this spc approach to estimate the true concentrations of pathogens in environmental water samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacteria strains the bacterial strains including escherichia coli o157 h7 strain sakai rimd 0509952 salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium jcm 1652t campylobacter jejuni jcm 2013t and listeria monocytogenes serovar 1 2a jcm 7671 were obtained from research institute for microbial disease rimd at osaka university osaka japan and the japan collection of microorganisms jcm tsukuba japan they were grown in specific media recommended by the culture collection centers at 37 c pseudogulbenkiania sp strain nh8b was previously isolated from a rice paddy soil in niigata japan tago et al 2011 this bacterium belongs to proteobacteria similar to many human pathogens but this strain itself is not considered as a human pathogen complete genome of this strain was previously identified ishii et al 2011 pseudogulbenkiania subflava strain bp 5t lmg 24211t and pseudogulbenkiania sp strain 2002 atcc baa 1479 were obtained from belgian coordinated collections of microorganisms bccm and american type culture collection atcc respectively they were grown in r2a broth medium teknova at 30 c 2 2 generation of genetically engineered pseudogulbenkiania sp strains genetically engineered pseudogulbenkiania sp strains were prepared using transposon mutagenesis as described previously ishii et al 2016 in brief a plasmid prl27 which contains a hyperactive tn5 transposase gene and aph gene that encodes for kanamycin resistance gene as well as r6k dna replication origin orir6k larsen et al 2002 was introduced to the cells of pseudogulbenkiania sp strain nh8b by conjugation using e coli wm3064 as a donor for prl27 saltikov and newman 2003 because orir6k requires π protein encoded by pir gene prl27 are not stable in a host that lacks pir e g nh8b strain therefore pseudogulbenkiania sp nh8b mutant strains obtained by this conjugation experiment should have insertion of tn5rl27 in their genome these mutant strains were able to grow in r2a supplemented with 100 μg ml kanamycin while nh8b wild type could not to identify the tn5rl27 insertion sites we performed self ligation followed by transformation in brief genomic dna from the pseudogulbenkiania sp mutant strains were digested with nco i takarabio and self ligated using dna ligation kit ver 1 takarabio according to the manufacturer s instruction the self ligated plasmid was transformed into oneshot pir1 competent e coli thermo fisher scientific which possesses pir to support the replication of plasmid with orir6k from colonies growing on lb agar medium supplemented with kanamycin 100 μg ml plasmid dna was extracted using qiaprep spin mini kit qiagen the sequence outward of the tn5rl27 on the plasmid was identified by pcr followed by sequencing as described elsewhere larsen et al 2002 we selected one strain nh8b 1d2 as a process control strain this strain had a tn5rl27 insertion in one of its 23s ribosomal rna gene rrn the nh8b wild type strain has eight rrn operons ishii et al 2011 therefore insertion of tn5rl27 into one of eight rrn operons likely does not cause serious impact on the growth of strain nh8b 1d2 in addition targeting 23s rrna gene is of advantage when designing taxon specific primers strain nh8b 1d2 was grown in r2a medium supplemented with 100 μg l kanamycin at 30 c for 16 20 h until it reached late exponentially phase to early stationary phase od600 values ranging from 1 0 to 1 4 2 3 water samples for model generation surface water samples ca 40 l were collected from oono pond lat 43 0743 long 141 3419 hokkaido university sapporo japan by using a surface disinfected plastic bucket in april 2013 for model validation surface water samples

characteristics of the water samples are shown in supplementary table s1 pathogens e coli o157 h7 strain sakai salmonella typhimurium jcm 1652t c jejuni jcm 2013t and l monocytogenes jcm 7671 and the process control strain grown in appropriate media were quantified by optical density at 600 nm od600 as well as microscopic cell counts as described previously ishii et al 2013 in brief od600 values of late exponential to early stationary phase cells were measured concentrations of serially diluted and dapi stained cells were measured by fluorescence microscopy to obtain strain specific relationship between od600 and cell concentrations once this relationship was established od600 values could be used to estimate cell concentrations freshly prepared cells were serially diluted to 107 106 105 104 103 102 and 101 cells ml with pbs buffer each of the four pathogens and strain nh8b 1d2 were co spiked to the pond water 5 l at concentration of each bacterium ranging from 10 to 107 cells per liter of pond water as a negative control 5l of pond water without inoculation of bacteria was also prepared 2 4 dna extraction spiked pond water 5 l was filtered through 0 22 μm pore polyethersulfone membrane filter millipore as previously described in detail ishii et al 2014b after filtration the membrane was cut intro eight pieces and placed in a 50 ml plastic centrifuge tube the membrane pieces were vigorously shaken in 20 ml phosphate buffered saline ph 7 2 containing 0 1 gelatin hamilton et al 2010 this process allows microbial cells to detach from the membrane the cell suspension was pelleted by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 15 min the pellet was re suspended with 1 ml pbs all cell suspension was transferred to a new 1 5 ml microcentrifuge tube and pelleted by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 5 min dna was extracted from the cell pellet by using powersoil dna isolation kit mobio according to the manufacturer s instruction the dna samples were used for conventional qpcr and the mfqpcr water filtration and dna extraction was done in duplicates 2 5 qpcr assays to detect spc strain we designed new assays to specifically quantify strain nh8b 1d2 by using primer express ver 3 0 software thermo scientific the primers and probes were designed in the junction regions between the 23s rrna gene and tn5rl27 sequences fig 1 the taqman probes were labeled with 6 carboyfluorescein 6 fam at the 5 end and quencher with the minor grove binder mgb at the 3 end primer and probe sequences are shown in table 1 the plasmid containing tn5rl27 and part of the 23s rrna gene sequence obtained by self ligation as described in section 2 2 was used as a standard dna for the qpcr assay plasmids were linearized by nco i and purified using a fastgene gel pcr extraction kit nippongene dna concentrations were measured using picogreen dsdna quantification reagent thermo scientific serial dilutions 100 to 106 copies μl of the plasmid dna were used to construct the standard curve for qpcr 2 6 conventional qpcr conventional qpcr was performed using steponeplus real time pcr system thermo scientific the reaction mixture 10 μl contained 1 faststart universal probe master mix with rox roche 900 nm each forward and reverse primer 250 nm probe and 1 μl of the dna template pcr was performed in duplicate under the following conditions 95 c for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 c for 10 s and 60 c for 30 s rox was used as a passive reference dye 2 7 microfluidic qpcr microfluidic qpcr mfqpcr was performed to simultaneously quantify multiple waterborne pathogens fecal indicator bacteria and the process control strain i e strain nh8b 1d2 we improved the mfqpcr platform from our previous one ishii et al 2013 by adding and replacing several

probes were labeled with 6 fluorescein amidite 6 fam at their 5 ends two different quenchers were used depending on the length of the probes short probes 20 bp were labeled with a nonfluorescent quencher nfq with a minor grove binder mgb at their 3 ends synthesized by applied biosystems long probes 20 bp were labeled with iowa black fluorescent quencher at their 3 ends and an internal zen quencher that was inserted between the 9th and 10th bases from their 5 ends synthesized by integrated dna technologies for each assay linearized plasmid dna solution was prepared as described previously ishii et al 2013 prior to the mfqpcr a specific target amplification sta reaction was performed to increase the amount of dna template as described previously ishii et al 2013 the sta reaction is a 14 cycle multiplex pcr with all primers used for the mfqpcr both dna samples and the standard plasmid mixture 2 100 to 2 105 copies μl were subjected to the sta reaction the sta reaction mixture 10 μl contained 1 taqman preamp master mix thermo scientific 50 nm each primer and 2 5 μl of the dna template the reaction was performed using a veriti 96 well thermal cycler thermo scientific with the following conditions 95 c for 10 min followed by 14 cycles at 95 c for 15 s and 60 c for 4 min after the sta reaction the products 10 μl were diluted five fold by adding 40 μl of te buffer 10 mm tris hcl and 0 1 mm edta ph 8 and used for the mfqpcr the mfqpcr was performed in duplicate using biomark hd reader fluidigm with a dynamic array 48 48 chip fluidigm as described previously 2 8 data analysis the number of pcr cycle that reached to the threshold fluorescence intensity was defined as threshold cycle ct the ct value was determined by using stepone software version 2 3 thermo scientific and real time pcr analysis software version 4 1 3 fluidigm for conventional qpcr and mfqpcr respectively standard curves were generated by plotting ct values in the y axis and the quantity of the standard dna log copies μl in the x axis the linear regression line was generated as the standard curve for each assay the pcr amplification efficiency was calculated from the slope of the regression line as described elsewhere bustin et al 2009 the goodness of fit adjusted r2 value was also calculated for each standard curve the bacteria recovery efficiencies r were calculated based on the quantity of target gene measured by conventional qpcr or mfqpcr divided by the quantity of target cells inoculated eq 1 1 r q m q i 100 where q m is the concentration of targeted bacteria measured by conventional qpcr or mfqpcr and q i is the concentration of the targeted bacteria inoculated to the environmental water samples the unit of q m and q i is cells l and the unit of r is percentage we converted gene copies l to cells l by assuming that single genome is present per cell in late exponential to early stationary phase bacteria all assays used to obtain q m and q i targeted singe copy genes by using eq 1 the recovery efficiency for each pathogen and spc r path and r spc respectively was calculated average dna recovery efficiencies obtained in this study was named as r path and r spc for each pathogen and spc respectively the ratio in the recovery efficiencies rr path spc were calculated using eq 2 for each pathogen 2 rr path spc r path r spc surface water samples collected from oono pond was used to obtain rr path spc for each pathogen when considering the rr path spc value as a specific constant for each pathogen we can estimate the recovery efficiencies of pathogens in environmental samples without knowing the original concentrations of target pathogens by using eq 3 3 r ˆ path rr path spc r spc where r ˆ path is an estimated recovery efficiency of pathogens and r spc is a sample specific recovery efficiency of spc calculated using eq 1 that means the known amount of spc strain needs to be spiked to each sample to calculate r ˆ path with the r ˆ path values we can estimate the true concentrations of pathogens in the original water samples by using eq 4 4 q ˆ path q path m r ˆ path 100 where q ˆ path is an estimated true concentration of target pathogen and q path m is the concentration of the pathogen measured by conventional qpcr or mfqpcr to examine if same rr path spc values can be used for samples other than water collected from oono pond we tested eqs 3 and 4 with mississippi river water samples spiked with known concentrations of pathogens i e model validation pairwise comparison t test analysis of variance anova and tukey s honest significant difference hsd test were performed at α 0 05 to analyze the statistical significance between predicted and actual pathogen concentrations bonferroni correlation was used to compare the ratio of r path to r spc among different pathogen concentrations all statistical analysis was done using r version 3 3 1 3 results 3 1 generation of the spc strain nh8b 1d2 in this study we generated kanamycin resistant pseudogulbenkiania sp strains by transposon mutagenesis one such strain nh8b 1d2 had a tn5rl27 insertion in one of the eight 23 rrna genes locus tag nh8b 3960 of pseudogulbenkiania sp strain nh8b to specifically detect this mutant strain we designed a new taqman qpcr assay in the junction regions between the 23s rrna gene locus tag nh8b 3960 and tn5rl27 sequences fig 1 the assay targeting nh8b 3960 tn5rl27 produced 61 bp amplicon only from nh8b 1d2 strain and not from other pseudogulbenkiania sp strains tested including strain nh8b wild type data not shown the linear dynamic range of the standard curve of nh8b 3960 tn5rl27 was broad ranging from 2 to 2 106 copies μl with goodness of fit adjusted r2 value of 0 997 the pcr amplification efficiency was 98 4 which is within optimal range 90 110 bustin et al 2009 3 2 the modified mfqpcr chip pbq chip ver 2 the nh8b 3960 tn5rl27 assay also performed well in the mfqpcr format with a broad dynamic range 2 2 106 copies μl adjusted r2 value of 0 998 and the pcr amplification efficiency of 100 6 table 1 the modified mfqpcr chip for simultaneous pathogenic bacteria quantification pbq pbq chip ver 2 included assays to detect pathogens fib and spc we used previously validated taqman assays in the pbq chip ver 2 during the update process we also included assays to quantify campylobacter spp lund et al 2004 campylobacter jejuni campylobacter coli and campylobacter upsaliensis bonjoch et al 2010 however these assays produced signals from no template controls i e assays run without dna template and therefore were removed from the final assay list to include in the mfqpcr platform pbq chip ver 2 include 24 assays all of which showed good quantitative performance table 1 3 3 dna recovery efficiencies of pathogens and spc the dna recovery efficiencies of pathogens and spc were calculated based on the pbq chip ver 2 results of the spike experiments done with oono pond water samples table 2 while dna recovery efficiencies of salmonella typhimurium and spc strain nh8b 1d2 were not significantly different p 0 05 pairwise comparison t test and ranged between 48 5 and 52 8 those of listeria monocytogenes and e coli o157 h7 were relatively low 15 6 25 3 and those of campylobacter jejuni were relatively high 114 the low dna recovery efficiencies indicate the loss of dna during sample processing e g filtration centrifugation dna extraction or the occurrence of pcr inhibition during the qpcr and mfqpcr processes there were significant correlations p 0 05 between the dna recovery efficiencies of pathogens and those of spc fig s1 3 4 estimating the true concentrations of pathogens in environmental samples the rr path spc were calculated using r path and r spc values which are the average values of r path and r spc obtained from multiple experiments i e multiple water filtrations and dna extractions done with different concentrations of pathogens table 2 because we did not observe significant differences in the ratio of r path to r spc among different pathogen concentrations p values larger than 0 05 m by bonferroni correlation where m is the number of concentrations tested we considered it was valid to treat rr path spc values as a specific constant for each pathogen the r ˆ path values were calculated using eq 3 for each pathogen and q ˆ path values were estimated using eq 4 to examine if eqs 3 and 4 can be used to estimate the true concentrations of pathogens in samples other than water collected from oono pond we used mississippi river water samples spiked with known concentrations of pathogens to calculate q path m q ˆ path and q path i values when normalization was not performed there were significant differences between measured q path m and inoculated q path i pathogen concentrations p 0 05 based on the tukey s hsd test fig 2 however when normalization was performed using the rr path spc values obtained in this study no difference was observed between normalized q ˆ path and inoculated q path i pathogen concentrations p values ranging from 0 08 to 0 99 based on the tukey s hsd test indicating that the rr path spc values obtained in this study could be used for samples other than oono pond water samples 4 discussion the qpcr based method can provide quantitative information of target microorganisms in a timely manner therefore its use for water quality monitoring is expected to be expanded upon in the future noble et al 2010 usepa has recommended a qpcr approach targeting enterococcus to monitor recreational water quality in 2012 usepa 2012 in addition high throughput format of the qpcr assays such as mfqpcr has a great potential for future water quality monitoring ahmed et al 2018 ishii et al 2014b zhang et al 2016 the limitations of the qpcr based approaches include 1 the detection of dead cells and 2 potentially underestimated quantification caused by pcr inhibition or loss of dna during sample processing the first issue can be overcome by excluding signals from deal cells by using propidium monoazide bae and wuertz 2009 kobayashi et al 2013 nocker et al 2007 pan and breidt 2007 whereas the latter issue needs to be overcome by using spc previously reported spc strains do not fully satisfy the criteria of spc we also previously used pseudogubenkiania sp nh8b wild type strain as a spc ishii et al 2013 2014a however this strain was also detected in non spiked samples ishii et al 2016 and therefore does not meet the criteria of spc either in this study the strain nh8b 1d2 was generated by inserting tn5rl27 fragment into one of the 23s rrna gene of pseudogulbenkiania sp strain nh8b because the tn5rl27 fragment was inserted into the chromosome the inserted fragment can be stably maintained with one copy per genome the genus pseudogulbenkiania belongs to proteobacteria similar to many human pathogens and therefore has similar cellular structure to most gram negative pathogens the sensitive and specific qpcr assay was also developed to quantify nh8b 1d2 strain by targeting the junction regions between the 23s rrna gene locus tag nh8b 3960 and tn5rl27 sequences no signal was detected from non spiked samples therefore strain nh8b 1d2 was a good candidate as a spc the dna recovery efficiencies were highly similar between spc and salmonella typhimurium but slightly different between spc and three other target pathogens i e e coli o157 h7 listeria monocytogenes and campylobacter jejuni this is probably due to the difference in their cell size and shape another potential reason for the different dna recovery efficiencies among bacteria is the variation in cell surface free energy which could cause distinct adhesion capabilities of bacteria to filter membranes for example salmonella had 49 5 0 9 mj m2 surface free energy which is significantly different from those of e coli 65 1 0 5 mj m2 zhang et al 2015 while dna recovery efficiencies were different among bacterial species the ratio of r path to r spc were constant among multiple samples which led us to propose a new concept to estimate true concentrations of pathogens we used the mean ratio in the recovery efficiencies between pathogens and spc strain i e rr path spc as a pathogen specific constant to estimate true concentrations of target pathogens by using eqs 3 and 4 this concept is new and has not been performed with previously developed spc strains d agostino et al 2011 diez valcarce et al 2011 hennechart collette et al 2015 kobayashi et al 2013 stoeckel et al 2009 the estimated true pathogen concentrations q ˆ path were not different from the actual inoculated concentrations of pathogens q path i in two types of water samples i e pond water in japan and river water in the u s supporting the validity of our approach these experiments were done with the same protocol but by different researchers in two laboratories i e hokkaido university and the university of minnesota suggesting that our approach can be applicable to various laboratory settings it is important to note that we used the same water filtration and dna extraction protocol for all water samples tested in this study the rr path spc values may become different when using different filtration and extraction procedures in this study we estimated the true concentrations of e coli o157 h7 salmonella typhimurium c jejuni and l monocytogenes as proof of concepts these pathogens represent both gram negative and positive bacteria and are relatively frequently detected in water and food samples anonymous 2009 ishii et al 2014b zhao et al 2001 when estimating true concentrations of other pathogens rr path spc values need to be obtained for each pathogen which should be done in the future the qpcr assay for the spc strain was included in the pbq chip ver 2 by using this chip various pathogens fib and spc can be quantified for many samples up to 192 samples in relatively short time 5 h by using the quantitative data obtained by pbq chip ver 2 as well as eqs 3 and 4 it is possible to estimate the true concentrations of pathogens in various environmental water samples without normalizing pathogen concentrations by using spc we may underestimate pathogen concentrations and potentially cause undesired public health outcomes therefore the direct multi pathogen quantification and normalization method reported here is one of the promising approaches for future water quality monitoring and risk assessment 5 conclusions the qpcr based water quality monitoring and risk assessment is becoming more common this study shows one promising approach to provide accurate quantitative data of multiple pathogens and fib in water samples the following conclusions are presented in this study a sample process control strain was created by genetically engineering the genome of pseudogulbenkiania sp strain nh8b the spc strain was specifically quantified by a newly designed taqman qpcr assay by using the ratio in the recovery efficiencies between pathogens and spc strain as a pathogen specific constant we can estimate the true concentrations of target pathogens in environmental water samples multiple waterborne pathogens fecal indicator bacteria and the spc strains can be simultaneously quantified for up to 192 samples by using pbq chip ver 2 conflicts of

19629,quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr is now commonly used to detect fecal indicator bacteria fib as well as pathogens in water samples however dna loss during sample processing can cause underestimation of target genes in this study we created a sample process control strain spc by genetically engineering a non pathogenic gram negative bacterium pseudogulbenkiania sp strain nh8b the spc strain named nh8b 1d2 has a kanamycin resistance gene inserted to one of the 23s rrna genes to specifically quantify the spc strain a new taqman qpcr assay was developed to obtain the relationship between the dna recovery efficiencies of various pathogens and those of the spc strain known amount of e coli o157 h7 salmonella typhimurium campylobacter jejuni or listeria monocytogenes cells were co spiked with the spc strain to environmental water samples the dna recovery efficiencies were calculated by comparing the quantity of bacterial cells inoculated to water samples prior to filtration and dna extraction and those measured by qpcr we then obtained the ratios in the recovery efficiencies between pathogens and spc strain rr path spc the rr path spc values obtained using oono pond water collected in japan were used as a pathogen specific constant to estimate the accurate concentrations of pathogens in water samples collected from mississippi river in minnesota estimated pathogen concentrations were not significantly different from the inoculated pathogen concentration suggesting our normalization approach is useful to estimate the accurate concentrations of pathogens in environmental water samples the qpcr assay targeting the spc strains and fib were incorporated into the microfluidic qpcr chip format pbq chip ver 2 therefore we can simultaneously quantify multiple pathogens fib and the spc strain in high throughput from many water samples this new tool can be useful for water quality monitoring and risk assessment graphical abstract image 1 keywords quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr sample process control spc microfluidic qpcr pathogens fecal indicator bacteria fib water quality 1 introduction various bacterial viral and protozoan pathogens can cause human diseases occurrences of pathogens in food water and other environmental matrices are potential threats to human health to prevent disease outbreaks levels of pathogen contamination and their potential risks to human health should be properly assessed ishii et al 2014b currently fecal indicator bacteria fib such as escherichia coli and enterococci are used to monitor levels of fecal contamination in a water sample however recent technology advancement allows us to directly quantify multiple pathogens ishii et al 2013 2014a kronlein et al 2014 molecular tools such as polymerase chain reaction pcr and its derivative quantitative pcr qpcr have been frequently used to directly quantify pathogenic bacteria in various samples while various methods have been developed to simultaneously detect multiple pathogens kronlein et al 2014 microfluidic qpcr mfqpcr based approach is promising because it can provide quantitative information of multiple pathogens for many samples in a timely manner ishii et al 2013 2014a in mfqpcr chip different qpcrs can be run simultaneously in nanoliter 10 12 liter volume chambers that are present in high densities on a chip quantitative information obtained by mfqpcr approach can be used for risk assessment ishii et al 2014b while pcr based approaches including mfqpcr are generally sensitive to detect target molecules present at low concentrations the reaction can be inhibited by pcr inhibitors such as humic substances tsai and olson 1992 with the presence of pcr inhibitors inaccurate quantitative results can be obtained by qpcr opel et al 2010 in addition microbial cell could be lost during cell concentration processes such as membrane filtration centrifugation and other techniques furthermore some portion of dna could be lost during the dna extraction and purification procedure previously reported dna recovery efficiencies ranged from 2 5 stoeckel et al 2009 to 66 lebuhn et al 2004 dna extraction methods can greatly influence the recovery efficiencies demeke and jenkins 2010 even when identical dna extraction method is used dna recovery efficiencies could vary by samples e g 0 2 28 stoeckel et al 2009 therefore dna recovery efficiency of target bacteria needs to be calculated and normalized to obtain accurate quantitative data one approach to obtain dna recovery efficiencies is to use a sample process control spc a known amount of spc is added to the samples before sample processing e g water filtration and dna extraction after dna extraction the quantity of the spc is quantified by spc specific qpcr by comparing the quantity of spc inoculated and the quantity of spc measured by qpcr we can calculate the dna recovery efficiency the dna recovery efficiency values can be used to estimate the true concentrations of the target dna molecules e g pathogen marker genes ideally spc should 1 be absent when no spc is spiked 2 be concentrated similar to the target cells 3 be lysed in similar manner to the target cells and 4 contain dna that is extracted and quantified with similar efficiency to that of the target cells stoeckel et al 2009 in addition spc should not interfere with the quantification of target microorganisms previously stoeckel et al 2009 used a plant pathogen pantoea stewartii as a spc strain however background population of pantoea stewartii may cause inaccurate dna recovery efficiency stoeckel et al 2009 also used e coli carrying plasmid borne target gene there is no background population of this genetically engineered e coli strain however number of plasmids per cell can change with the physiological state of the cells in addition dna extraction efficiencies can be different between genomic dna and plasmid dna kobayashi et al 2013 used a genetically engineered e coli strain that has kanamycin resistant gene in its β galactosidase gene lacz as a spc strain they designed spc specific qpcr assay targeting a junction region between lacz and kanamycin resistance gene because their gene modification was made on the e coli chromosome target gene molecule is present per genome per cell however if this strain is spiked to environmental water samples levels of e coli cannot be reliably obtained because e coli is used as a fib usepa 2012 quantity of e coli needs to be measured to assess fecal contamination in the water environments therefore spc needs to be developed using non fib microorganisms the objectives of this study were i to develop a stable spc strain that is not naturally present in the environment ii to design qpcr assay to specifically quantify spc marker gene which does not interfere quantification of fib iii to include this assay to the mfqpcr chip for simultaneous multipathogen quantification and iv to apply this spc approach to estimate the true concentrations of pathogens in environmental water samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacteria strains the bacterial strains including escherichia coli o157 h7 strain sakai rimd 0509952 salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium jcm 1652t campylobacter jejuni jcm 2013t and listeria monocytogenes serovar 1 2a jcm 7671 were obtained from research institute for microbial disease rimd at osaka university osaka japan and the japan collection of microorganisms jcm tsukuba japan they were grown in specific media recommended by the culture collection centers at 37 c pseudogulbenkiania sp strain nh8b was previously isolated from a rice paddy soil in niigata japan tago et al 2011 this bacterium belongs to proteobacteria similar to many human pathogens but this strain itself is not considered as a human pathogen complete genome of this strain was previously identified ishii et al 2011 pseudogulbenkiania subflava strain bp 5t lmg 24211t and pseudogulbenkiania sp strain 2002 atcc baa 1479 were obtained from belgian coordinated collections of microorganisms bccm and american type culture collection atcc respectively they were grown in r2a broth medium teknova at 30 c 2 2 generation of genetically engineered pseudogulbenkiania sp strains genetically engineered pseudogulbenkiania sp strains were prepared using transposon mutagenesis as described previously ishii et al 2016 in brief a plasmid prl27 which contains a hyperactive tn5 transposase gene and aph gene that encodes for kanamycin resistance gene as well as r6k dna replication origin orir6k larsen et al 2002 was introduced to the cells of pseudogulbenkiania sp strain nh8b by conjugation using e coli wm3064 as a donor for prl27 saltikov and newman 2003 because orir6k requires π protein encoded by pir gene prl27 are not stable in a host that lacks pir e g nh8b strain therefore pseudogulbenkiania sp nh8b mutant strains obtained by this conjugation experiment should have insertion of tn5rl27 in their genome these mutant strains were able to grow in r2a supplemented with 100 μg ml kanamycin while nh8b wild type could not to identify the tn5rl27 insertion sites we performed self ligation followed by transformation in brief genomic dna from the pseudogulbenkiania sp mutant strains were digested with nco i takarabio and self ligated using dna ligation kit ver 1 takarabio according to the manufacturer s instruction the self ligated plasmid was transformed into oneshot pir1 competent e coli thermo fisher scientific which possesses pir to support the replication of plasmid with orir6k from colonies growing on lb agar medium supplemented with kanamycin 100 μg ml plasmid dna was extracted using qiaprep spin mini kit qiagen the sequence outward of the tn5rl27 on the plasmid was identified by pcr followed by sequencing as described elsewhere larsen et al 2002 we selected one strain nh8b 1d2 as a process control strain this strain had a tn5rl27 insertion in one of its 23s ribosomal rna gene rrn the nh8b wild type strain has eight rrn operons ishii et al 2011 therefore insertion of tn5rl27 into one of eight rrn operons likely does not cause serious impact on the growth of strain nh8b 1d2 in addition targeting 23s rrna gene is of advantage when designing taxon specific primers strain nh8b 1d2 was grown in r2a medium supplemented with 100 μg l kanamycin at 30 c for 16 20 h until it reached late exponentially phase to early stationary phase od600 values ranging from 1 0 to 1 4 2 3 water samples for model generation surface water samples ca 40 l were collected from oono pond lat 43 0743 long 141 3419 hokkaido university sapporo japan by using a surface disinfected plastic bucket in april 2013 for model validation surface water samples were collected from mississippi river at the st anthony falls laboratory lat 44 9824 long 93 2549 university of minnesota minneapolis mn usa in february and march 2016 the physicochemical characteristics of the water samples are shown in supplementary table s1 pathogens e coli o157 h7 strain sakai salmonella typhimurium jcm 1652t c jejuni jcm 2013t and l monocytogenes jcm 7671 and the process control strain grown in appropriate media were quantified by optical density at 600 nm od600 as well as microscopic cell counts as described previously ishii et al 2013 in brief od600 values of late exponential to early stationary phase cells were measured concentrations of serially diluted and dapi stained cells were measured by fluorescence microscopy to obtain strain specific relationship between od600 and cell concentrations once this relationship was established od600 values could be used to estimate cell concentrations freshly prepared cells were serially diluted to 107 106 105 104 103 102 and 101 cells ml with pbs buffer each of the four pathogens and strain nh8b 1d2 were co spiked to the pond water 5 l at concentration of each bacterium ranging from 10 to 107 cells per liter of pond water as a negative control 5l of pond water without inoculation of bacteria was also prepared 2 4 dna extraction spiked pond water 5 l was filtered through 0 22 μm pore polyethersulfone membrane filter millipore as previously described in detail ishii et al 2014b after filtration the membrane was cut intro eight pieces and placed in a 50 ml plastic centrifuge tube the membrane pieces were vigorously shaken in 20 ml phosphate buffered saline ph 7 2 containing 0 1 gelatin hamilton et al 2010 this process allows microbial cells to detach from the membrane the cell suspension was pelleted by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 15 min the pellet was re suspended with 1 ml pbs all cell suspension was transferred to a new 1 5 ml microcentrifuge tube and pelleted by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 5 min dna was extracted from the cell pellet by using powersoil dna isolation kit mobio according to the manufacturer s instruction the dna samples were used for conventional qpcr and the mfqpcr water filtration and dna extraction was done in duplicates 2 5 qpcr assays to detect spc strain we designed new assays to specifically quantify strain nh8b 1d2 by using primer express ver 3 0 software thermo scientific the primers and probes were designed in the junction regions between the 23s rrna gene and tn5rl27 sequences fig 1 the taqman probes were labeled with 6 carboyfluorescein 6 fam at the 5 end and quencher with the minor grove binder mgb at the 3 end primer and probe sequences are shown in table 1 the plasmid containing tn5rl27 and part of the 23s rrna gene sequence obtained by self ligation as described in section 2 2 was used as a standard dna for the qpcr assay plasmids were linearized by nco i and purified using a fastgene gel pcr extraction kit nippongene dna concentrations were measured using picogreen dsdna quantification reagent thermo scientific serial dilutions 100 to 106 copies μl of the plasmid dna were used to construct the standard curve for qpcr 2 6 conventional qpcr conventional qpcr was performed using steponeplus real time pcr system thermo scientific the reaction mixture 10 μl contained 1 faststart universal probe master mix with rox roche 900 nm each forward and reverse primer 250 nm probe and 1 μl of the dna template pcr was performed in duplicate under the following conditions 95 c for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 c for 10 s and 60 c for 30 s rox was used as a passive reference dye 2 7 microfluidic qpcr microfluidic qpcr mfqpcr was performed to simultaneously quantify multiple waterborne pathogens fecal indicator bacteria and the process control strain i e strain nh8b 1d2 we improved the mfqpcr platform from our previous one ishii et al 2013 by adding and replacing several assays the updated version namely simultaneous pathogenic bacteria quantification pbq chip ver 2 contained 24 assays table 1 newly added assays included enterococcus specific 23s rrna gene haugland et al 2005 ludwig and schleifer 2000 inva targeting salmonella spp gonzález escalona et al 2009 bipa targeting campylobacter lari bonjoch et al 2010 clostridium perfringens specific 16s rrna gene wise and siragusa 2005 mip targeting legionella pnemophila behets et al 2007 toxr targeting vibrio cholerae liu et al 2012 and nh8b 3960 tn5rl27 targeting strain nh8b 1d2 designed in this study all taqman probes were labeled with 6 fluorescein amidite 6 fam at their 5 ends two different quenchers were used depending on the length of the probes short probes 20 bp were labeled with a nonfluorescent quencher nfq with a minor grove binder mgb at their 3 ends synthesized by applied biosystems long probes 20 bp were labeled with iowa black fluorescent quencher at their 3 ends and an internal zen quencher that was inserted between the 9th and 10th bases from their 5 ends synthesized by integrated dna technologies for each assay linearized plasmid dna solution was prepared as described previously ishii et al 2013 prior to the mfqpcr a specific target amplification sta reaction was performed to increase the amount of dna template as described previously ishii et al 2013 the sta reaction is a 14 cycle multiplex pcr with all primers used for the mfqpcr both dna samples and the standard plasmid mixture 2 100 to 2 105 copies μl were subjected to the sta reaction the sta reaction mixture 10 μl contained 1 taqman preamp master mix thermo scientific 50 nm each primer and 2 5 μl of the dna template the reaction was performed using a veriti 96 well thermal cycler thermo scientific with the following conditions 95 c for 10 min followed by 14 cycles at 95 c for 15 s and 60 c for 4 min after the sta reaction the products 10 μl were diluted five fold by adding 40 μl of te buffer 10 mm tris hcl and 0 1 mm edta ph 8 and used for the mfqpcr the mfqpcr was performed in duplicate using biomark hd reader fluidigm with a dynamic array 48 48 chip fluidigm as described previously 2 8 data analysis the number of pcr cycle that reached to the threshold fluorescence intensity was defined as threshold cycle ct the ct value was determined by using stepone software version 2 3 thermo scientific and real time pcr analysis software version 4 1 3 fluidigm for conventional qpcr and mfqpcr respectively standard curves were generated by plotting ct values in the y axis and the quantity of the standard dna log copies μl in the x axis the linear regression line was generated as the standard curve for each assay the pcr amplification efficiency was calculated from the slope of the regression line as described elsewhere bustin et al 2009 the goodness of fit adjusted r2 value was also calculated for each standard curve the bacteria recovery efficiencies r were calculated based on the quantity of target gene measured by conventional qpcr or mfqpcr divided by the quantity of target cells inoculated eq 1 1 r q m q i 100 where q m is the concentration of targeted bacteria measured by conventional qpcr or mfqpcr and q i is the concentration of the targeted bacteria inoculated to the environmental water samples the unit of q m and q i is cells l and the unit of r is percentage we converted gene copies l to cells l by assuming that single genome is present per cell in late exponential to early stationary phase bacteria all assays used to obtain q m and q i targeted singe copy genes by using eq 1 the recovery efficiency for each pathogen and spc r path and r spc respectively was calculated average dna recovery efficiencies obtained in this study was named as r path and r spc for each pathogen and spc respectively the ratio in the recovery efficiencies rr path spc were calculated using eq 2 for each pathogen 2 rr path spc r path r spc surface water samples collected from oono pond was used to obtain rr path spc for each pathogen when considering the rr path spc value as a specific constant for each pathogen we can estimate the recovery efficiencies of pathogens in environmental samples without knowing the original concentrations of target pathogens by using eq 3 3 r ˆ path rr path spc r spc where r ˆ path is an estimated recovery efficiency of pathogens and r spc is a sample specific recovery efficiency of spc calculated using eq 1 that means the known amount of spc strain needs to be spiked to each sample to calculate r ˆ path with the r ˆ path values we can estimate the true concentrations of pathogens in the original water samples by using eq 4 4 q ˆ path q path m r ˆ path 100 where q ˆ path is an estimated true concentration of target pathogen and q path m is the concentration of the pathogen measured by conventional qpcr or mfqpcr to examine if same rr path spc values can be used for samples other than water collected from oono pond we tested eqs 3 and 4 with mississippi river water samples spiked with known concentrations of pathogens i e model validation pairwise comparison t test analysis of variance anova and tukey s honest significant difference hsd test were performed at α 0 05 to analyze the statistical significance between predicted and actual pathogen concentrations bonferroni correlation was used to compare the ratio of r path to r spc among different pathogen concentrations all statistical analysis was done using r version 3 3 1 3 results 3 1 generation of the spc strain nh8b 1d2 in this study we generated kanamycin resistant pseudogulbenkiania sp strains by transposon mutagenesis one such strain nh8b 1d2 had a tn5rl27 insertion in one of the eight 23 rrna genes locus tag nh8b 3960 of pseudogulbenkiania sp strain nh8b to specifically detect this mutant strain we designed a new taqman qpcr assay in the junction regions between the 23s rrna gene locus tag nh8b 3960 and tn5rl27 sequences fig 1 the assay targeting nh8b 3960 tn5rl27 produced 61 bp amplicon only from nh8b 1d2 strain and not from other pseudogulbenkiania sp strains tested including strain nh8b wild type data not shown the linear dynamic range of the standard curve of nh8b 3960 tn5rl27 was broad ranging from 2 to 2 106 copies μl with goodness of fit adjusted r2 value of 0 997 the pcr amplification efficiency was 98 4 which is within optimal range 90 110 bustin et al 2009 3 2 the modified mfqpcr chip pbq chip ver 2 the nh8b 3960 tn5rl27 assay also performed well in the mfqpcr format with a broad dynamic range 2 2 106 copies μl adjusted r2 value of 0 998 and the pcr amplification efficiency of 100 6 table 1 the modified mfqpcr chip for simultaneous pathogenic bacteria quantification pbq pbq chip ver 2 included assays to detect pathogens fib and spc we used previously validated taqman assays in the pbq chip ver 2 during the update process we also included assays to quantify campylobacter spp lund et al 2004 campylobacter jejuni campylobacter coli and campylobacter upsaliensis bonjoch et al 2010 however these assays produced signals from no template controls i e assays run without dna template and therefore were removed from the final assay list to include in the mfqpcr platform pbq chip ver 2 include 24 assays all of which showed good quantitative performance table 1 3 3 dna recovery efficiencies of pathogens and spc the dna recovery efficiencies of pathogens and spc were calculated based on the pbq chip ver 2 results of the spike experiments done with oono pond water samples table 2 while dna recovery efficiencies of salmonella typhimurium and spc strain nh8b 1d2 were not significantly different p 0 05 pairwise comparison t test and ranged between 48 5 and 52 8 those of listeria monocytogenes and e coli o157 h7 were relatively low 15 6 25 3 and those of campylobacter jejuni were relatively high 114 the low dna recovery efficiencies indicate the loss of dna during sample processing e g filtration centrifugation dna extraction or the occurrence of pcr inhibition during the qpcr and mfqpcr processes there were significant correlations p 0 05 between the dna recovery efficiencies of pathogens and those of spc fig s1 3 4 estimating the true concentrations of pathogens in environmental samples the rr path spc were calculated using r path and r spc values which are the average values of r path and r spc obtained from multiple experiments i e multiple water filtrations and dna extractions done with different concentrations of pathogens table 2 because we did not observe significant differences in the ratio of r path to r spc among different pathogen concentrations p values larger than 0 05 m by bonferroni correlation where m is the number of concentrations tested we considered it was valid to treat rr path spc values as a specific constant for each pathogen the r ˆ path values were calculated using eq 3 for each pathogen and q ˆ path values were estimated using eq 4 to examine if eqs 3 and 4 can be used to estimate the true concentrations of pathogens in samples other than water collected from oono pond we used mississippi river water samples spiked with known concentrations of pathogens to calculate q path m q ˆ path and q path i values when normalization was not performed there were significant differences between measured q path m and inoculated q path i pathogen concentrations p 0 05 based on the tukey s hsd test fig 2 however when normalization was performed using the rr path spc values obtained in this study no difference was observed between normalized q ˆ path and inoculated q path i pathogen concentrations p values ranging from 0 08 to 0 99 based on the tukey s hsd test indicating that the rr path spc values obtained in this study could be used for samples other than oono pond water samples 4 discussion the qpcr based method can provide quantitative information of target microorganisms in a timely manner therefore its use for water quality monitoring is expected to be expanded upon in the future noble et al 2010 usepa has recommended a qpcr approach targeting enterococcus to monitor recreational water quality in 2012 usepa 2012 in addition high throughput format of the qpcr assays such as mfqpcr has a great potential for future water quality monitoring ahmed et al 2018 ishii et al 2014b zhang et al 2016 the limitations of the qpcr based approaches include 1 the detection of dead cells and 2 potentially underestimated quantification caused by pcr inhibition or loss of dna during sample processing the first issue can be overcome by excluding signals from deal cells by using propidium monoazide bae and wuertz 2009 kobayashi et al 2013 nocker et al 2007 pan and breidt 2007 whereas the latter issue needs to be overcome by using spc previously reported spc strains do not fully satisfy the criteria of spc we also previously used pseudogubenkiania sp nh8b wild type strain as a spc ishii et al 2013 2014a however this strain was also detected in non spiked samples ishii et al 2016 and therefore does not meet the criteria of spc either in this study the strain nh8b 1d2 was generated by inserting tn5rl27 fragment into one of the 23s rrna gene of pseudogulbenkiania sp strain nh8b because the tn5rl27 fragment was inserted into the chromosome the inserted fragment can be stably maintained with one copy per genome the genus pseudogulbenkiania belongs to proteobacteria similar to many human pathogens and therefore has similar cellular structure to most gram negative pathogens the sensitive and specific qpcr assay was also developed to quantify nh8b 1d2 strain by targeting the junction regions between the 23s rrna gene locus tag nh8b 3960 and tn5rl27 sequences no signal was detected from non spiked samples therefore strain nh8b 1d2 was a good candidate as a spc the dna recovery efficiencies were highly similar between spc and salmonella typhimurium but slightly different between spc and three other target pathogens i e e coli o157 h7 listeria monocytogenes and campylobacter jejuni this is probably due to the difference in their cell size and shape another potential reason for the different dna recovery efficiencies among bacteria is the variation in cell surface free energy which could cause distinct adhesion capabilities of bacteria to filter membranes for example salmonella had 49 5 0 9 mj m2 surface free energy which is significantly different from those of e coli 65 1 0 5 mj m2 zhang et al 2015 while dna recovery efficiencies were different among bacterial species the ratio of r path to r spc were constant among multiple samples which led us to propose a new concept to estimate true concentrations of pathogens we used the mean ratio in the recovery efficiencies between pathogens and spc strain i e rr path spc as a pathogen specific constant to estimate true concentrations of target pathogens by using eqs 3 and 4 this concept is new and has not been performed with previously developed spc strains d agostino et al 2011 diez valcarce et al 2011 hennechart collette et al 2015 kobayashi et al 2013 stoeckel et al 2009 the estimated true pathogen concentrations q ˆ path were not different from the actual inoculated concentrations of pathogens q path i in two types of water samples i e pond water in japan and river water in the u s supporting the validity of our approach these experiments were done with the same protocol but by different researchers in two laboratories i e hokkaido university and the university of minnesota suggesting that our approach can be applicable to various laboratory settings it is important to note that we used the same water filtration and dna extraction protocol for all water samples tested in this study the rr path spc values may become different when using different filtration and extraction procedures in this study we estimated the true concentrations of e coli o157 h7 salmonella typhimurium c jejuni and l monocytogenes as proof of concepts these pathogens represent both gram negative and positive bacteria and are relatively frequently detected in water and food samples anonymous 2009 ishii et al 2014b zhao et al 2001 when estimating true concentrations of other pathogens rr path spc values need to be obtained for each pathogen which should be done in the future the qpcr assay for the spc strain was included in the pbq chip ver 2 by using this chip various pathogens fib and spc can be quantified for many samples up to 192 samples in relatively short time 5 h by using the quantitative data obtained by pbq chip ver 2 as well as eqs 3 and 4 it is possible to estimate the true concentrations of pathogens in various environmental water samples without normalizing pathogen concentrations by using spc we may underestimate pathogen concentrations and potentially cause undesired public health outcomes therefore the direct multi pathogen quantification and normalization method reported here is one of the promising approaches for future water quality monitoring and risk assessment 5 conclusions the qpcr based water quality monitoring and risk assessment is becoming more common this study shows one promising approach to provide accurate quantitative data of multiple pathogens and fib in water samples the following conclusions are presented in this study a sample process control strain was created by genetically engineering the genome of pseudogulbenkiania sp strain nh8b the spc strain was specifically quantified by a newly designed taqman qpcr assay by using the ratio in the recovery efficiencies between pathogens and spc strain as a pathogen specific constant we can estimate the true concentrations of target pathogens in environmental water samples multiple waterborne pathogens fecal indicator bacteria and the spc strains can be simultaneously quantified for up to 192 samples by using pbq chip ver 2 conflicts of interest the spc strain and the spc specific qpcr assays are currently under review for a u s patent us 20170137868 a1 acknowledgments we thank reiko hirano for technical assistance and valerie
