2420,this study interprets the observed spatio temporal variation in the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition δ18o δd of shallow unconfined groundwater of central india madhya pradesh in terms of changing moisture sources for the indian summer monsoon rainfall orography and hydrogeological settings shallow groundwater samples collected from 282 locations for both pre monsoon april and post monsoon november seasons were analysed for δ18o and δd the isotopic composition of groundwater varies spatially and seasonally from pre monsoon to post monsoon a clear seasonal variation in isotopic composition with different spatial characters is ascribed to different recharge sources mixing and evaporation backward wind trajectory analysis confirms that the observed isotopic variation from east to west is due to different moisture sources contributing to rainfall in these regions the isotopic composition of groundwater in most 58 of the geographical area of the study area have lower values in the post monsoon season compared to the pre monsoon season suggesting seasonal recharge of groundwater by isotopically depleted indian summer monsoon ism rain while 15 of the study area shows the opposite trend caused by different recharge source irrigation return flow allochthonous water and evaporated surface water isotopic mass balance in two adjoining aquifers sedimentary hard rock and volcanic rock reveals that post monsoon groundwater is an admixture of 39 ism and 61 of pre monsoon residual water in sedimentary hard rock while in the volcanic system it is 32 ism and 68 pre monsoon residual which suggest a higher rate of groundwater recharge in sedimentary hard aquifers compared to the volcanic system this study provides new insights into the recharge characteristics in a data poor region of central india covered by different hydrogeological units keywords stable isotopes central india seasonal recharge mass balance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is one of the largest freshwater reservoirs globally which plays a critical role in providing drinking water to half of the global population famiglietti 2014 gleeson et al 2012 rodell et al 2009 sustaining 40 of the global irrigated land alley et al 2002 siebert et al 2010 and maintaining the riverine ecosystem by providing water through baseflow alley and leake 2004 gleeson et al 2012 due to the large scale dependency on groundwater for agriculture and also for industry and domestic use this freshwater reservoir faces an imbalance in recharge and abstraction resulting in water scarcity and water quality issues wada et al 2010 as per the un water report 2022 groundwater making the invisible visible 2022 highest groundwater extraction takes place in asia 65 of the global extraction which in turn causes groundwater depletion some of the prominent groundwater depletion zones in asia are north china plain most of the middle east aquifers in the arabian peninsula and the aquifers in the north western and eastern parts of india and bangladesh chakraborty et al 2020 figueroa and smilovic 2021 mukherjee et al 2020 yang and wang 2020 india is the highest extractor of groundwater in the world extracting 250 bcm billion cubic meters of dynamic groundwater seasonally recharged water which is 6 of the global extraction 3880 bcm however as per un water report 2022 https unesdoc unesco org ark 48223 pf0000380721 the annual groundwater recharge in india is only 1 436 bcm compared to that of the global 37000 bcm the groundwater recharge and extraction vary spatially and temporally because of highly seasonal and erratic rainfall patterns which recharge the groundwater variation in hydrogeological conditions and heterogeneous distribution of the surface water several studies have been carried out in the northern part of india covering the indo gangetic plains to understand the surface water groundwater interactions groundwater recharge groundwater depletion and their causes using satellite data and tracer methods chen et al 2014 döll et al 2014 long et al 2016 rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 however very few studies gupta et al 2005 have been carried out in central india which is home to a 70 million population and groundwater is a major source to fulfil the water demand as per cgwb report 2020 2021 https cgwb gov in gw year book state html the higher dependency on groundwater in this region leads to the overexploitation of dynamic groundwater resources patil et al 2019 to overcome this situation it is important to understand the groundwater recharge sources and their spatiotemporal variation conventionally the seasonal water level fluctuation and rainfall infiltration factor methods are used to estimate the groundwater recharge in this region https cgwb gov in documents gec2015 report final 2030 10 2017 pdf the increase in water level in the post monsoon season is ascribed to fresh groundwater influx however the seasonal difference in water level depends on aquifer properties and seasonal variation in groundwater extraction healy and cook 2002 scanlon et al 2002 therefore the water level increase in the post monsoon season does not necessarily represent the actual recharge the seasonal variation of stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in groundwater is used to find out the seasonality in groundwater recharge and delineation in groundwater recharge source jasechko et al 2014 mao et al 2021 o driscoll et al 2005 yeh et al 2014 as stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in groundwater are conservative tracers which faithfully record the signatures of recharge source water or evaporation from groundwater or water rock interaction clark and fritz 2013 yeh et al 2011 the isotopic composition of groundwater in conjunction with that of rainfall surface water and the hydrogeological parameters are widely used across the globe to understand various hydrogeological processes clark and fritz 2013 deshpande et al 2003 gat 1996 govender et al 2013 gupta et al 2005 joshi et al 2021 kendall and mcdonnell 2012 lawson et al 2008 liotta et al 2013 mukherjee et al 2007 zhao et al 2018 the spatial variation in the isotopic composition of shallow groundwater derived using ordinary kriging cerar et al 2018 melchiorre et al 2009 raidla et al 2016 represents the change in the isotopic composition of groundwater recharge sources mao et al 2021 west et al 2014 west et al 2009 in the absence of isotopic composition of rainfall these maps are used to predict the isotopic composition of rainfall as the isotopic composition of shallow groundwater represents the amount weighted mean of precipitation in that region e g ingraham and taylor 1991 rozanski 1985 apart from hydrology these maps are also used to understand animal migration rubenstein and hobson 2004 and many other general global patterns of ecological and hydrological processes cherel et al 2000 ehleringer et al 2010 gautam et al 2020 hobson et al 2012 west et al 2008 the spatial variation in the isotopic composition of shallow groundwater is caused by the spatial variation in the isotopic composition of rainfall clark and fritz 2013 the spatial variation in the isotopic composition of rainfall is mainly controlled by elevation temperature rainout volumes and airmass trajectory rozanski 2005 however the effect of each specific factor may vary with location and season rozanski 2005 tracking airmass trajectories containing moisture is important to investigate as they tell about the composition and origin of rainfall in any area bagheri et al 2019 the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model hysplit has been widely used as an effective method for determining airmass trajectories bagheri et al 2019 esquivel hernández et al 2019 oza et al 2020 soderberg et al 2013 sun et al 2019 wu et al 2015 in the present study a total of 564 shallow groundwater samples were collected i e 282 in pre monsoon and 282 in post monsoon seasons from the same locations from the state of madhya pradesh in central india under the aegis of a multi institutional collaborative iwin national programme 2008 2013 deshpande and gupta 2008 deshpande and gupta 2012 and analysed for their oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions the rainwater isotopic data for jabalpur and bhopal located in madhya pradesh were obtained from the doctoral thesis of oza 2020 the specific objectives of the present study are 1 to understand the spatio temporal variation in the isotopic composition of groundwater and its relationship with the indian summer monsoon ism rainfall orography and hydrogeological setting 2 groundwater recharge process and the contribution of ism to groundwater recharge in basaltic and sedimentary hard rock aquifers 2 study area 2 1 location physiography and climate located in the central part of india fig 1 the state of madhya pradesh lies between 21 06 n to 26 87 n latitude and 74 02 e to 82 80 e longitude it occupies a geographical area of 308 252 km2 9 of the country s area and accommodates nearly 70 million people most of the state lies on the tableland of central india bounded by the upper gangetic plains in the north the godawari valley in the south the plains of gujarat in the west and the plateau of bundelkhand and chhattisgarh in the east the physiography of the state is characterised by low hills extensive plateaus and river valleys the state is traversed by the vindhyan and the satpura hill ranges running east to west most of the state has an elevation of between 250 and 500 m above msl mean sea level low lying areas narmada valley lie between the vindhyan and the satpura range and the northern and eastern sides of the study area madhya pradesh experiences a subtropical climate with a mean annual temperature ranging between 22 5 c and 25 0 c the rainfall mainly occurs during indian summer monsoon june to september and it is highly heterogeneous varying from 800 mm northern and north western side to 1800 mm south and south east kundu et al 2015 wani et al 2010 2 2 hydrogeology the study area has varied hydrogeological settings fig 2 that include an alluvial system 8 4 of the geographical area sedimentary hard rocks 22 3 sedimentary soft rocks 7 2 crystalline systems 15 7 and volcanic systems 46 patil et al 2019 the hydrogeological settings of the region determine the rate of infiltration recharge yields of wells the extent and depth of the aquifers and the variable consequence of groundwater exploitation which eventually controls the groundwater potential of the region patil et al 2019 the alluvial system comprised unconsolidated gravel sand silt and clay in different proportions and has primarily intergranular porosity and permeability the thickness of the aquifer varies from 10 m to 300 m the depth of the water table ranges from 5 m to 30 m below ground level bgl the transmissivity ranges between 80 m2 day to 300 m2 day and the yield varies from 30 m3 h to 50 m3 h in this way the alluvial system forms the most potential aquifer for groundwater development the sedimentary hard rock system comprises sandstone shale and limestone groundwater occurs in the weathered zones in this system the sandstone and shale are hard and compact and form poor aquifers with a specific yield range between 1 and 3 the sedimentary soft rocks system is the gondwana deposits consisting of sandstone siltstone and clay and forms a good aquifer the hydraulic conductivity of these aquifers varies between 10 and 25 m d and the specific yield is from 10 to 15 the volcanic system covering nearly half of the study area forms the most important aquifer in the region the upper weathered zone in basaltic terrain forms moderate to good aquifers where water level varies from 2 to 14 m bgl hydraulic conductivity and specific yield vary between 5 and 15 m d and 1 to 3 2 to 30 m3 h respectively

unconfined aquifers were collected for one year 2010 during the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons covering all the hydrogeological units present in the study area fig 2 a total of 564 samples were collected i e 282 in pre monsoon and 282 in post monsoon data is given in supplementary material from the same locations the groundwater samples were collected from the dug wells and hand pumps the sampling was done from the deepest possible water levels in dug wells during their peak hours of usage to capture the in situ isotopic signature of groundwater and avoiding the possible effect of evaporation from stagnant water dug wells in the vicinity of any surface water body were avoided to prevent misleading signatures of any preferential surface water influence into groundwater for hand pumps samples were collected after purging them for ten to fifteen minutes to avoid sampling stagnant groundwater 3 2 sample analysis the oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δd isotope analysis of the groundwater samples was carried out using delta v plus isotopic ratio mass spectrometer irms in continuous flow mode with gas bench ii at physical research laboratory the analysis was done following the standard equilibration technique in which the water sample 300 μl was equilibrated with co2 or h2 respectively for oxygen or hydrogen the equilibrated gases were analysed in irms to obtain the value of 18o 16o and 2h 1h i e d h which was used to calculate the value of δ18o and δd respectively maurya et al 2009 oza et al 2020 the reproducibility of measurement was obtained by repeat analyses of multiple aliquots of the secondary laboratory standard which was better than 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δd the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions are expressed as the abundance ratio of less abundant to more abundant isotopes r 2h 1h or 18o 16o in terms of δ in per mil notation δ rsample rstd 1 1000 rstd rstd is the isotope abundance ratio in the vsmow apart from oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δd isotopic compositions of groundwater samples a derived parameter d excess δd 8 δ18o defined by dansgaard 1964 is used in this study to characterize the different groundwater masses and effects of evaporation on groundwater in addition to the isotopic composition of groundwater the unpublished isotopic data of rain oza 2020 has also been used in this study to discern the underlying hydrogeological processes to generate the spatial variation map of δ18o and d excess for shallow groundwater the variogram analysis was performed using the scikit gstat package in python 3 8 the exponential model returns the best results and least root mean square error rmse scores these maps were generated using the exponential function for the advanced gridding option in the kriging de wet et al 2020 hatvani et al 2020 raidla et al 2016 van der veer et al 2009 method using golden surfer 13 software 3 3 additional data apart from stables isotopes δ18o and δd some additional parameters affecting groundwater isotopic composition such as water table ism rainfall amount elevation slope evapotranspiration soil moisture and soil temperature have also been used in this study these data were taken from different sources at different resolutions the station wise water table data were taken from cgwb rainfall data of 0 25 0 25 resolution was taken from imd https www imdpune gov in elevation and slope data were extracted from the digital elevation model taken from bhuvan https bhuvan app3 nrsc gov in data download index php and the rest of the data were taken from gldas https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets keywords gldas at 0 25 0 25 resolution 3 4 k means clustering and principal component analysis the collection of pairwise pre monsoon and post monsoon samples provides us the unique opportunity to identify the major causal factors governing seasonal variation post monsoon pre monsoon of δ18o and d excess δδ18o δd excess in groundwater in order to elucidate the underlying hydrological processes which govern the seasonal variation in δ18o and d excess in this study elevation slope amount of ism rainfall water table fluctuation δwt seasonal difference in evapotranspiration δet seasonal difference in soil moisture δssm for surface soil moisture up to 0 cm to 10 cm depth and δtsm for total soil moisture up to 2 m depth and soil temperature δst were used however we found that the spatial distribution of input parameters has large variations which hinder a generalised interpretation of the data in order to segregate samples for which the variables behave in a more coherent and homogenous manner we performed k means clustering macqueen 1967 žalik 2008 the variables were first standardized and the ideal number of clusters was identified using the elbow method kodinariya and makwana 2013 nainggolan et al 2019 syakur et al 2018 the choice of three clusters provided the optimum performance in terms of reduction in the sum of squared errors k means clustering was then performed using python 3 8 the use of clustering enabled us to segregate our data into regions with a similar variation of the variables however owing to the high dimensionality of the data it was not possible to visualise the dependence of δδ18o δd excess along with variations in the independent variables moreover the initial set of variables is not mutually orthogonal with each variable perturbing the other this makes it difficult to identify the mutually exclusive role played by each variable and its importance in governing variations in δ18o and d excess in groundwater hence principal component analysis pca helena et al 2000 sârbu and pop 2005 yang et al 2021 was performed on the initial dataset using python 3 8 the projection of our original feature vectors was taken onto the first two principal components and plotted we considered the first two principal components since they explain the maximum variance in our dataset this allows us to investigate the variation of our original high dimensional dataset in a 2 dimensional space and hence identify the major causal factors responsible for governing seasonal variations in δ18o and d excess in groundwater 3 5 endmember mixing model the end member model is widely used to estimate the percentage contributions of the different components in groundwater recharge hameed et al 2015 jasechko 2019 mao et al 2021 pandey et al 2023 yeh et al 2011 in this study two end members are pre monsoon groundwater and ism and their contributions are calculated using the following equations phillips and gregg 2001 sakakibara et al 2017 1 δ pre m pre δ rain m rain δ post where 2 m pre m rain 1 where δpre is the δ18o of pre monsoon groundwater and mpre is the mass fraction of pre monsoon groundwater δrain is the δ18o of ism rainwater and mrain is the mass fraction of rainfall δpost is the δ18o of post monsoon groundwater which is the admixture of pre monsoon groundwater and the rainfall from the above equation the percentage contribution of rain in groundwater is calculated using the eq 3 and the uncertainty in rainwater contribution is calculated by the uncertainty propagation technique genereux 1998 3 r a i n w a t e r c o n t r i b u t i o n i n δ post δ pre δ rain δ pre 100 3 6 backward wind trajectory modelling to track the air parcels containing moisture for precipitation in the eastern rewa city and western indore city half of the study area backward wind trajectories were analysed using hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model downloaded from https ready arl noaa gov hysplit php draxler and rolph 2003 stein et al 2015 for each rainy day https www imdpune gov in four trajectories were generated at every six hours interval for the last 120 h each starting at 1500 m above ground level agl the converging altitude of 1500 m was considered because it is the approximate cloud base height reported around this region deshpande et al 2010 oza et al 2020 each backword trajectory contained information on five meteorological parameters namely 1 temperature c 2 specific humidity g kg 3 rainfall mm h 4 height m agl and 5 geographical coordinates provided by the hysplit model the percentage contribution of the sources for each 120 h back trajectory was calculated using the formula fs qs q r 100 oza et al 2020 in this formula f is the percentage contribution of vapour from a source region s for a particular rain event qs is the amount of moisture g kg picked by the air parcel while passing over the source q is the total moisture g kg gained in from all the source regions oceanic or continental over which the air parcel travelled and r is the amount of rainfall of that event sodemann et al 2008 4 results and discussion 4 1 δ18o and δd regression lines a total of 564 groundwater samples were collected from shallow unconfined aquifers from the 282 locations during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons for the analysis of its δ18o and δd during the pre monsoon season the δ18o varies from 7 3 to 2 9 with an average of 3 6 and the δd vary from 50 to 4 with an average of 27 table 1 whereas in the post monsoon season the δ18o varies from 10 5 to 2 1 with an average of 4 2 and δd vary from 76 to 3 with an average of 30 table 1 thus the average isotopic composition of post monsoon shallow groundwater is relatively depleted in heavy isotopes the d excess values range from 19 7 to 22 2 with an average of 2 3 for the pre monsoon season and range from 13 4 to 15 1 with an average of 3 4 for the post monsoon season table 1 the average low values of the δ18o and the δd and higher values of d excess during the post monsoon season indicate that water mass in the aquifer is replenished with isotopically depleted water during the rainy season between the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons the study area receives rainfall from indian summer monsoon ism the ism samples were collected from two nearby locations bhopal and jabalpur for the year 2010 2011 as part of the iwin national programme oza 2020 the rainfall has a very distinct isotopic character rainfall δ18o range 14 2 to 2 1 with an amounted weighted average of 6 4 δd range 99 to 19 with an amounted weighted average of 43 d excess range 8 to 19 with an amounted weighted average of 8 compared to the groundwater the amount weighted average δ18o ism rainfall is highly depleted compared to the average δ18o of pre monsoon 3 6 and post monsoon 4 2 groundwater from pre monsoon to post monsoon the average δ18o 3 6 to 4 2 of groundwater shifts towards the average value of rain which indicates seasonal recharge of groundwater from ism rain the δ18o δd regression line for ism rain and groundwater both post monsoon and pre monsoon are plotted in fig 3 a and d excess vs δ18o are plotted in fig 3b the slope of the local meteoric water line lmwl is 7 7 0 1 which is close to the slope of the global meteoric water line gmwl i e 8 craig 1961 groundwater both in the pre monsoon and post monsoon has a lower slope compared to lmwl the pre monsoon groundwater has a lower slope 5 8 0 1 compared to post monsoon groundwater 6 5 0 1 the d excess vs δ18o plot for ism rain shows no trend and most samples fall in the range between 5 to15 in contrast groundwater shows a decreasing trend in both seasons the lower slope of δ18o δd regression line for groundwater combined with the inverse relationship between δ18o and d excess suggests significant evaporation of shallow groundwater gupta et al 2005 mao et al 2021 yeh et al 2014 the higher δ18o δd regression line slope of post monsoon groundwater compared to the pre monsoon groundwater and the inverse relationship between δ18o and d excess even during the post monsoon season indicate a freshwater influx of isotopically lighter ism rainwater that mixes with the existing large reservoir of isotopically enriched pre monsoon groundwater groundwater samples identified within ellipses 1 and 2 fig 3a and b show conspicuously enriched and depleted samples respectively compared to other samples in the same season the samples in ellipses 1 and 2 geographically correspond with regions 1 and 2 fig 4 a and b the ellipse 1 contains mostly pre monsoon groundwater samples having enriched δ18o 2 0 and lower d excess 7 0 values the enriched groundwater in isolated patches can be ascribed to recharge by point sources such as lakes ponds or reservoirs which undergo substantial evaporative isotopic enrichment the ellipse 2 contains post monsoon groundwater samples having depleted δ18o 4 5 and higher d excess 0 0 compared to other post monsoon samples these depleted groundwater samples are ascribable to recharge by isotopically depleted ism rains of different meteorological origins discussed in the next section the isotopically depleted groundwater also suggests relatively faster groundwater recharge which favours the inheritance of pristine rainwater signature without much modification during infiltration jasechko 2019 mao et al 2021 4 2 spatial variation in δ18o and d excess and meteorological reasons the spatial distribution of δ18o for pre monsoon and post monsoon groundwater is plotted in fig 4a and b using the kriging method in surfer 13 software the same for d excess is plotted in fig 5 a and b based on spatial variation in δ18o and d excess the study area can be divided into two isotopically distinguishable regions 1 and 2 marked by two ellipses the groundwater in region 1 is isotopically enriched compared to region 2 the δ18o values of groundwater are getting progressively depleted from 1 0 in the west up to 6 0 in the east both during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons it is important to note that such an extent of depletion in δ18o values of groundwater cannot be explained by the isotopic depletion in recharge source i e ism rainfall either due to continental effect 2 1000 km reported by krishnamurthy and bhattacharya 1991 or elevation effect 0 4 per 100 m rise reported by deshpande et al 2003 this calls for an alternate meteorological explanation for observed isotopic depletion in groundwater which is discussed later groundwater also shows the spatial variation in d excess in pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons fig 5a and b during both seasons groundwater in most of the areas show d excess between 0 0 and 6 0 which is lower than the global average value of 10 and suggests that the groundwater is prone to considerable evaporation or recharge by considerably evaporated source water in the pre monsoon season there are a few localized pockets of groundwater in the study area which show the ve d excess and also very high δ18o these localized pockets are not in one climatic zone or in hydrogeological settings fig 2 which suggests that some localised processes are active in that region which lowers the d excess values these processes could be evaporation from groundwater due to shallow water table recharge from evaporated surface water and mixing of evaporated surface water having lower d excess and higher δ18o with shallow groundwater deshpande et al 2003 krishan et al 2020 the ve d excess patches turn into ve d excess in the post monsoon season which clearly indicates freshwater influx from ism rain the eastern side of the study area marked by region 2 shows higher d excess and correspondingly lower δ18o compared to region 1 where d excess is lower and δ18o is relatively high in both seasons the spatial variability of δ18o and d excess in groundwater from region 1 to region 2 indicates that although ism rainfall is known to be the source of groundwater recharge the rainfall in the east and west must have different isotopic compositions since the observed spatial isotopic variation in groundwater is more than that accountable by continental effect or elevation effect in rainfall we have examined other meteorological reasons such as moisture source and their transport history for regions 1 and 2 to identify the moisture sources their relative contribution and transport history for the ism rains june september in the region 1 and region 2 backword wind trajectories were for the indore located in region 1 and rewa located in region 2 shown in fig 6 a and b the resultant backward wind trajectory map of specific humidity variation for all the rainfall events during ism representing groundwater recharge source shows the direction of the moisture containing air parcel the percentage contribution of vapour by different sources such as the arabian sea as the bay of bengal bob and continentally recycled moisture estimated for each month of ism season are given in fig 6a and b it is clearly seen from fig 6a and b that almost all the rain bearing backward wind trajectories at indore fig 6a are coming from the as side with only a few trajectories coming from the bob side in contrast at rewa a large number of backward wind trajectories are from the bob side it is also seen from fig 6a and b that the relative contribution of moisture average of june to september from the as is 48 for indore region 1 whereas it is only 33 for rewa region 2 correspondingly the relative contribution of moisture combined from the bob and the continental recycling is only 52 i e 6 bob 46 continental for indore region 1 whereas that for the rewa region 2 is 67 i e 16 bob 51 continental the increased contribution of moisture from the bob and continental recycling is reported breitenbach et al 2010 deshpande et al 2010 oza et al 2020 to give rise to isotopically depleted rain elsewhere in the country the same reason is responsible for the depleted rains and the depleted groundwater that it recharges in region 2 4 3 seasonal variation in δ18o and d excess to understand the effect of ism on groundwater recharge in the study area the temporal variation in δ18o δδ18o δ18opost mon δ18o pre mon and d excess δd excess d excess post mon d excess pre mon contour is plotted in fig 7 a and b considering the 1σ measurement precision of better than 0 1 for δ18o and 1 0 for δd as mentioned in the methodology section the 2σ seasonal difference of 0 2 for δ18o and 1 3 for d excess is considered as a significant threshold value for evaluating the seasonal variations in these two parameters in other words a seasonal difference of more than 0 2 in δ18o and more than 1 3 in d excess is treated as a genuine seasonal isotopic difference caused by seasonal change in groundwater mass and not by any instrumental uncertainty mao et al 2021 pandey et al 2023 the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic data do not follow the normal distribution to evaluate the statistical difference between the isotope value of groundwater samples of pre monsoon and post monsoon season mann whitney u test has been carried out at a 0 05 significance level in both cases the obtained p values are less than the desired threshold 0 05 which rejects the null hypothesis and assures a significant difference in groundwater isotopic values between the seasons in the non rainy pre monsoon season dry climatic conditions in the study area favour evaporation from the groundwater and with the non availability of a recharge source groundwater shows enrichment in δ18o and lower d excess values during the rainy season due to recharge by monsoonal rainwater which has depleted δ18o and higher d excess values compared to pre monsoon groundwater the areas that receive freshwater influx show veδ18o and ve δd excess a large part of the study area shows veδ18o 58 or no variation 27 the veδ18o is possible when groundwater receives isotopically lighter freshwater influx during ism this suggests that 58 of the study area recharges seasonally some parts of the study show veδ18o 15 which mean during the pre monsoon season groundwater has depleted δ18o compare to surrounding regions and the amount weighted average δ18o of ism the lower δ18o in the pre monsoon season is possible only when groundwater is recharged by isotopically depleted sources such as deeper groundwater gonfiantini et al 1998 rivers originating from higher altitude areas liu and yamanaka 2012 lateral movement of groundwater from higher elevation to lower area jasechko 2019 to discern the interpretative significance of seasonal isotopic variation in groundwater the values of seasonal variation in δ18o δδ18o and d excess δd excess are plotted as δδ18o versus δd excess in fig 7c seasonal isotopic variation actually represents the variation in the groundwater mass groundwater mass can change both in the pre monsoon season due to direct evaporation from groundwater or recharge from evaporated sources such as irrigation return flow and evaporated surface water long distance transport of allochthonous rainwater or in the post monsoon season due to recharge from fresh rainwater plotting the seasonal variation as δδ18o vs δd excess can provide insights into season changes in the groundwater mass during pre and post monsoon in the following based on the observed seasonal isotopic variation in groundwater we hypothesise the possible geohydrological processes it is seen in fig 7c that the maximum number 134 of groundwater samples fall in the second quadrant q2 ve δδ18o and ve δd excess which signifies enriched δ18o and lower d excess in groundwater in the pre monsoon season compared to the post monsoon season these signatures can be ascribed to 1 direct evaporation of gw during warm and arid pre monsoon season or 2 recharge from the evaporated surface water in pre monsoon and or 3 recharge from fresh rainwater during post monsoon season the second highest number 49 of groundwater samples fall in the fourth quadrant q4 ve δδ18o and ve δd excess signifying lower δ18o and higher d excess in groundwater in the pre monsoon season compared to post monsoon such a seasonal isotopic difference is possible in two situations 1 groundwater is recharged in the post monsoon by isotopically enriched water with higher δ18o and lower d excess such as that stored in the surface reservoir and released when fresh influx is received or 2 groundwater is recharged in the pre monsoon season by the allochthonous monsoonal rainwater of previous season having lower δ18o and higher d excess which can be transported for a long distance through fractured terrain existing in the study area besides the above two possibilities the influence of paleowaters with lower δ18o and higher d excess may also be there thirty four groundwater samples are falling in the third quadrant q3 ve δδ18o and ve δd excess which signifies lower δ18o and lower d excess in groundwater during the post monsoon season compared to pre monsoon such an isotopic composition is possible in the case of cyclonic precipitation sun et al 2022 or precipitation from a cloud parcel highly diminished in its original moisture content clark and fritz 2013 while such an isotopic composition is already reported in precipitation müller et al 2020 its signatures in groundwater are identified in this study there are only a small number 20 of groundwater samples falling in the first quadrant q1 ve δδ18o and ve δd excess which signifies lower δ18o and lower d excess in groundwater in pre monsoon season compared to post monsoon this is possible when groundwater in a particular area is recharged in the pre monsoon season by allochthonous rainwater of the previous monsoon in higher altitude regions such higher altitude rainwater has lower δ18o and lower d excess due to the elevation effect araguás araguás et al 1998 kumar et al 2010 which can be transported for a long distance through fractured terrain existing in the study area and is detected in pre monsoon sampling of the next year various hypotheses regarding the recharge mechanism suggested above are based exclusively on seasonal variation in isotopic composition and highlight the importance of seasonal sampling 4 4 correlation between δδ18o δd excess and other hydrological parameters the seasonality in groundwater recharge can be controlled by several other hydrological parameters such as elevation slope amount of ism rainfall water table fluctuation δwt seasonal difference in evapotranspiration δet seasonal difference in soil moisture δssm for surface soil moisture up to 0 cm to 10 cm depth and δtsm for total soil moisture up to 2 m depth and soil temperature δst to find out the correlation between groundwater recharge indicators δδ18o δd excess and the above mentioned hydrological parameters first these data were grouped into three different clusters using k means clustering fig 8 a and then for individual clusters pca fig 8b was done in pca the original feature vectors have been plotted against the first two principal components the arrows represent the variables such that if two arrows are in the same or opposite direction then they are positively and negatively correlated respectively if the arrows are mutually perpendicular it implies no correlation exists the larger the length of the arrow the better the variable is represented the cluster 1 fig 8a falls in the higher altitude region satpura hill area fig 1 where the rainfall is highest compared to the other part of the study area kundu et al 2015 wani et al 2010 and δδ18o shows a ve variation fig 7a which indicates groundwater recharge during monsoon season the pca of cluster 1 shows a weak negative correlation between δδ18o and δet which means the area receiving groundwater recharge during monsoon season ve δδ18o shows higher evapotranspiration ve δet which is possible in this region as this part is covered by very dense to a moderately dense forest https fsi nic in isfr19 vol2 isfr 2019 vol ii madhya pradesh pdf cluster 2 fig 8a lies in the western margin which includes the low laying area of the narmada basin and the high altitude tableland area of the vindhyan range fig 1 and is covered by volcanic rock basalt groundwater in this region shows ve δδ18o which suggests recharge in the post monsoon season the pca of this cluster shows a weak ve correlation between δδ18o and elevation i e at higher altitudes groundwater has more ve δδ18o because groundwater recharge source rainfall will be depleted here due to altitude effect as well as in this region net cropped area and cropping intensity is very high as per agriculture atlas of madhya pradesh https jnkvv org pdf 27012021221604atlas 20jnkvv 20final pdf compared to other regions that enriched the groundwater through irrigation return flow while during the post monsoon season a small amount of recharge by isotopically depleted ism will create ve δδ18o cluster 3 falls in the north eastern margin of the study area fig 8a covered by alluvium crystalline hard rock and sedimentary hard rock fig 2 some part of the area is drought prone sharma and sen 2021 in this cluster only δδ18o and δd excess show the ve correlation fig 8b which indicates groundwater recharge although the variation in δδ18o is visible only in the crystalline hard rock section fig 7a rest part of the area in this cluster does not show any variation in δδ18o 4 5 seasonal groundwater recharge in two adjoining aquifers the major aquifer systems present in the study area are volcanic system basalt covers nearly 46 of the geographical area and sedimentary hard rock covers nearly 23 the rest of the area is covered with shale unconsolidated alluvium and crystalline hard rock these two major aquifers have different hydrogeological properties as discussed earlier which govern the groundwater availability in these aquifers the aquifers are recharged in general by the ism rainfall but the recharge varies spatially depending upon the aquifer types and recharge processes to understand and estimate the magnitude of seasonal ism rainfall contribution to groundwater recharge two adjoining aquifer systems basalt and sedimentary hard rocks were selected close to the rainfall sampling location and the isotope mass balance was carried out fig 9 a in basaltic aquifers the isotopic composition of groundwater in the pre monsoon season is δ18o 5 0 to 2 9 with an average of 3 2 δd 37 to 4 with an average of 26 and d excess 19 7 to 5 4 with an average of 0 5 in this aquifer the isotopic composition of groundwater for the post monsoon season is δ18o 5 3 to 2 5 with an average of 4 2 δd 40 to 21 with an average of 31 and d excess 1 7 to 8 3 with an average of 2 3 in sedimentary hard rock aquifer the groundwater has a different isotopic composition compared to basaltic aquifers in both seasons in the pre monsoon season the isotopic composition of groundwater in the sedimentary aquifer is δ18o 7 2 to 1 3 with an average of 4 2 δd 48 to 15 with an average of 32 and d excess 4 8 to 8 9 with an average of 2 2 in the post monsoon season the isotopic composition of groundwater in the sedimentary aquifer is δ18o 7 8 to 3 9 with an average of 5 1 δd 50 to 24 with an average of 35 d excess 1 0 to 13 8 with an average of 5 8 the δd vs δ18o and d excess vs δ18o for both the aquifers in pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons have been plotted in fig 9b b and fig 9c c the slopes of the regression lines in the pre monsoon season for basaltic aquifer and sedimentary hard rock are respectively 5 1 0 2 and 5 9 0 3 in the post monsoon season the regression line slopes for the basaltic and sedimentary aquifers increase to respectively 6 3 0 4 and 7 2 0 5 which is similar to the slope of lmwl 7 7 0 1 the depletion in the average isotopic composition of groundwater in the post monsoon season and the increase in the regression line slope confirms the groundwater recharge during the monsoon season the ism rainwater contribution to groundwater recharge in two aquifers is calculated using two end member isotopic mixing models using the seasonal isotopic composition of groundwater in the two aquifers and the local rainwater for basaltic aquifer the end member values are δ18opre 3 2 and δ18opost 4 2 for sedimentary aquifers the end member values are δ18opre 4 2 and δ18opost 5 1 the end member values for groundwater are the average δ18o value for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons whereas for rain it is the amount weighted average value δ18orain 6 4 the end member mixing model reveals that in the case of basaltic aquifer the post monsoon groundwater mass consists of an admixture of 32 of rainwater which mixes with 68 of the pre monsoon groundwater and in sedimentary hard rock aquifer it is 39 of rainwater and 61 of pre monsoon residual groundwater as discussed in the following these estimated mass fractions of rainwater and pre monsoon groundwater can be advantageously used for the volumetric estimation of other hydrological components of the eastern part of the study area where these aquifers are situated as per the dynamic groundwater resource of india cgwb 2011 the basaltic aquifer is spread over three districts jabalpur mandla and seoni of madhya pradesh and covers a 22727 km2 area and receives nearly 1 7 bcm billion cubic meter of groundwater recharge in the monsoon season while sedimentary hard rock aquifer covers 21048 km2 area in damoha rewa and satna districts of madhya pradesh and receives 1 2 bcm of groundwater recharge in monsoon season as per the mass balance calculation in the basaltic aquifer 32 of the groundwater is rainfall recharge which in volumetric terms becomes 1 7 bcm the rest 68 3 7 bcm is pre monsoon residual water the total groundwater potential calculated by the mass balance of this aquifer is 5 4 bcm 1 7 rainfall recharge 3 7 pre monsoon residual water the annual groundwater abstraction natural discharge and pre monsoon residual water in the basaltic aquifer are 0 6 bcm 0 1bcm reported by cgwb and 3 7 bcm calculated respectively so the remaining 1 0 bcm 5 4 minus 0 6 minus 0 1 minus 3 7 groundwater is estimated to percolate into deeper aquifers through faults present in the area this inference is justifiable considering the known faults in this region deshpande and gupta 2013 in sedimentary hard rock aquifer groundwater has a 39 freshwater influx from monsoonal rain which is nearly 1 2 bcm as per the cgwb report 2011 so the groundwater potential in this aquifer is 3 2 bcm 1 2 bcm freshwater influx 1 9 bcm pre monsoon residual water the annual groundwater abstraction natural discharge and pre monsoon residual water in this aquifer are 0 9 bcm 0 07 bcm given by cgwb and 1 9 bcm calculated respectively so the remaining 0 3bcm of groundwater percolates into the deeper aquifer this additional water can be advantageously used for some other purposes 5 conclusion this study uses seasonal variations in the isotopic composition of groundwater along with rainfall isotopic composition and trajectories of vapour masses to understand the interaction between the ism rainwater and the groundwater and estimate the relative contribution of ism rainfall to two adjoining aquifers there are distinct differences in the isotopic composition of groundwater in the western and eastern parts of the study area with significant isotopic depletion on the eastern side since the observed differences cannot be accounted by the isotopic difference in the rainwater due to continental effect or altitude effect backward wind trajectory analyses were performed to estimate the relative contribution of vapour sources the arabian sea bay of bengal and the continental recycling for rainfall in the eastern and western regions of the study area it is observed that due to meteorological reasons the contribution of moisture from the bay of bengal and the continental recycling is higher 67 16 bob 51 continental for rainfall in the eastern part compared to the western part 52 6 bob 46 continental the signatures of this meteorological process are discerned in the groundwater the temporal difference in the isotopic composition of groundwater δ18o reveals the seasonal recharge by different sources with 58 of the study area recharged by monsoonal rain and 15 of the area recharged in the pre monsoon season by isotopically depleted source water which could be irrigation return flow of deeper static water recharge by an allochthonous source such as rainfall in higher altitude region approximately 27 of the study area shows no variation in isotopic composition which suggests longer residence time and a lower rate of recharge this finding also conveys that if the groundwater in this 27 area is overexploited or polluted it would be difficult to restore or replenish it this is a societally useful input for groundwater development and management the rainwater contribution to groundwater recharge was also calculated for two adjoining aquifers basaltic aquifer and sedimentary hard rock using two end member mixing models suggesting that groundwater recharge occurs at a higher rate in the sedimentary hard aquifer 6 limitations in this study seasonal pre monsoon and post monsoon shallow groundwater samples were collected from central india madhya pradesh covering nearly 3 105 km2 areas and analysed for stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen this study tried to understand the hydrogeological processes governing the surface water groundwater interaction in central india madhya pradesh using seasonal variation in the isotopic composition of groundwater and factors affecting this variation this study has certain limitations which are listed below 1 this study is based on only one seasonal cycle pre monsoon and post monsoon of groundwater sampling for isotopic analyses hence the estimated groundwater recharge may not represent long term trend of groundwater recharge 2 according to the sampling strategy of the iwin national programme the groundwater samples were collected from the shallow first unconfined aquifers but it was not possible to ascertain the exact depth of dug well 116 or handpump 145 or tube wells 21 therefore the inference drawn is in general for shallow first unconfined aquifers without any qualification about the depth however it is known that the depth of the water table in all these wells was less than 100 feet 3 although the study area has a large geographical extent nearly 3 105 km2 there are only three stations for which rainwater isotopic data is available 4 pca was used to understand the correlation between seasonal variation in δ18o and other hydrological parameters a limitation of this method is that in case of the smaller length of the arrow for a particular variable that variable may not be well represented in the 2 dimensional space credit authorship contribution statement amit pandey conceptualization writing original draft

2420,this study interprets the observed spatio temporal variation in the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition δ18o δd of shallow unconfined groundwater of central india madhya pradesh in terms of changing moisture sources for the indian summer monsoon rainfall orography and hydrogeological settings shallow groundwater samples collected from 282 locations for both pre monsoon april and post monsoon november seasons were analysed for δ18o and δd the isotopic composition of groundwater varies spatially and seasonally from pre monsoon to post monsoon a clear seasonal variation in isotopic composition with different spatial characters is ascribed to different recharge sources mixing and evaporation backward wind trajectory analysis confirms that the observed isotopic variation from east to west is due to different moisture sources contributing to rainfall in these regions the isotopic composition of groundwater in most 58 of the geographical area of the study area have lower values in the post monsoon season compared to the pre monsoon season suggesting seasonal recharge of groundwater by isotopically depleted indian summer monsoon ism rain while 15 of the study area shows the opposite trend caused by different recharge source irrigation return flow allochthonous water and evaporated surface water isotopic mass balance in two adjoining aquifers sedimentary hard rock and volcanic rock reveals that post monsoon groundwater is an admixture of 39 ism and 61 of pre monsoon residual water in sedimentary hard rock while in the volcanic system it is 32 ism and 68 pre monsoon residual which suggest a higher rate of groundwater recharge in sedimentary hard aquifers compared to the volcanic system this study provides new insights into the recharge characteristics in a data

introduction groundwater is one of the largest freshwater reservoirs globally which plays a critical role in providing drinking water to half of the global population famiglietti 2014 gleeson et al 2012 rodell et al 2009 sustaining 40 of the global irrigated land alley et al 2002 siebert et al 2010 and maintaining the riverine ecosystem by providing water through baseflow alley and leake 2004 gleeson et al 2012 due to the large scale dependency on groundwater for agriculture and also for industry and domestic use this freshwater reservoir faces an imbalance in recharge and abstraction resulting in water scarcity and water quality issues wada et al 2010 as per the un water report 2022 groundwater making the invisible visible 2022 highest groundwater extraction takes place in asia 65 of the global extraction which in turn causes groundwater depletion some of the prominent groundwater depletion zones in asia are north china plain most of the middle east aquifers in the arabian peninsula and the aquifers in the north western and eastern parts of india and bangladesh chakraborty et al 2020 figueroa and smilovic 2021 mukherjee et al 2020 yang and wang 2020 india is the highest extractor of groundwater in the world extracting 250 bcm billion cubic meters of dynamic groundwater seasonally recharged water which is 6 of the global extraction 3880 bcm however as per un water report 2022 https unesdoc unesco org ark 48223 pf0000380721 the annual groundwater recharge in india is only 1 436 bcm compared to that of the global 37000 bcm the groundwater recharge and extraction vary spatially and temporally because of highly seasonal and erratic rainfall patterns which recharge the groundwater variation in hydrogeological conditions and heterogeneous distribution of the surface water several studies have been carried out in the northern part of india covering the indo gangetic plains to understand the surface water groundwater interactions groundwater recharge groundwater depletion and their causes using satellite data and tracer methods chen et al 2014 döll et al 2014 long et al 2016 rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 however very few studies gupta et al 2005 have been carried out in central india which is home to a 70 million population and groundwater is a major source to fulfil the water demand as per cgwb report 2020 2021 https cgwb gov in gw year book state html the higher dependency on groundwater in this region leads to the overexploitation of dynamic groundwater resources patil et al 2019 to overcome this situation it is important to understand the groundwater recharge sources and their spatiotemporal variation conventionally the seasonal water level fluctuation and rainfall infiltration factor methods are used to estimate the groundwater recharge in this region https cgwb gov in documents gec2015 report final 2030 10 2017 pdf the increase in water level in the post monsoon season is ascribed to fresh groundwater influx however the seasonal difference in water level depends on aquifer properties and seasonal variation in groundwater extraction healy and cook 2002 scanlon et al 2002 therefore the water level increase in the post monsoon season does not necessarily represent the actual recharge the seasonal variation of stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in groundwater is used to find out the seasonality in groundwater recharge and delineation in groundwater recharge source jasechko et al 2014 mao et al 2021 o driscoll et al 2005 yeh et al 2014 as stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in groundwater are conservative tracers which faithfully record the signatures of recharge source water or evaporation from groundwater or water rock interaction clark and fritz 2013 yeh et al 2011 the isotopic composition of groundwater in conjunction with that of rainfall surface water and the hydrogeological parameters are widely used across the globe to understand various hydrogeological processes clark and fritz 2013 deshpande et al 2003 gat 1996 govender et al 2013 gupta et al 2005 joshi et al 2021 kendall and mcdonnell 2012 lawson et al 2008 liotta et al 2013 mukherjee et al 2007 zhao et al 2018 the spatial variation in the isotopic composition of shallow groundwater derived using ordinary kriging cerar et al 2018 melchiorre et al 2009 raidla et al 2016 represents the change in the isotopic composition of groundwater recharge sources mao et al 2021 west et al 2014 west et al 2009 in the absence of isotopic composition of rainfall these maps are used to predict the isotopic composition of rainfall as the isotopic composition of shallow groundwater represents the amount weighted mean of precipitation in that region e g ingraham and taylor 1991 rozanski 1985 apart from hydrology these maps are also used to understand animal migration rubenstein and hobson 2004 and many other general global patterns of ecological and hydrological processes cherel et al 2000 ehleringer et al 2010 gautam et al 2020 hobson et al 2012 west et al 2008 the spatial variation in the isotopic composition of shallow groundwater is caused by the spatial variation in the isotopic composition of rainfall clark and fritz 2013 the spatial variation in the isotopic composition of rainfall is mainly controlled by elevation temperature rainout volumes and airmass trajectory rozanski 2005 however the effect of each specific factor may vary with location and season rozanski 2005 tracking airmass trajectories containing moisture is important to investigate as they tell about the composition and origin of rainfall in any area bagheri et al 2019 the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model hysplit has been widely used as an effective method for determining airmass trajectories bagheri et al 2019 esquivel hernández et al 2019 oza et al 2020 soderberg et al 2013 sun et al 2019 wu et al 2015 in the present study a total of 564 shallow groundwater samples were collected i e 282 in pre monsoon and 282 in post monsoon seasons from the same locations from the state of madhya pradesh in central india under the aegis of a multi institutional collaborative iwin national programme 2008 2013 deshpande and gupta 2008 deshpande and gupta 2012 and analysed for their oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions the rainwater isotopic data for jabalpur and bhopal located in madhya pradesh were obtained from the doctoral thesis of oza 2020 the specific objectives of the present study are 1 to understand the spatio temporal variation in the isotopic composition of groundwater and its relationship with the indian summer monsoon ism rainfall orography and hydrogeological setting 2 groundwater recharge process and the contribution of ism to groundwater recharge in basaltic and sedimentary hard rock aquifers 2 study area 2 1 location physiography and climate located in the central part of india fig 1 the state of madhya pradesh lies between 21 06 n to 26 87 n latitude and 74 02 e to 82 80 e longitude it occupies a geographical area of 308 252 km2 9 of the country s area and accommodates nearly 70 million people most of the state lies on the tableland of central india bounded by the upper gangetic plains in the north the godawari valley in the south the plains of gujarat in the west and the plateau of bundelkhand and chhattisgarh in the east the physiography of the state is characterised by low hills extensive plateaus and river valleys the state is traversed by the vindhyan and the satpura hill ranges running east to west most of the state has an elevation of between 250 and 500 m above msl mean sea level low lying areas narmada valley lie between the vindhyan and the satpura range and the northern and eastern sides of the study area madhya pradesh experiences a subtropical climate with a mean annual temperature ranging between 22 5 c and 25 0 c the rainfall mainly occurs during indian summer monsoon june to september and it is highly heterogeneous varying from 800 mm northern and north western side to 1800 mm south and south east kundu et al 2015 wani et al 2010 2 2 hydrogeology the study area has varied hydrogeological settings fig 2 that include an alluvial system 8 4 of the geographical area sedimentary hard rocks 22 3 sedimentary soft rocks 7 2 crystalline systems 15 7 and volcanic systems 46 patil et al 2019 the hydrogeological settings of the region determine the rate of infiltration recharge yields of wells the extent and depth of the aquifers and the variable consequence of groundwater exploitation which eventually controls the groundwater potential of the region patil et al 2019 the alluvial system comprised unconsolidated gravel sand silt and clay in different proportions and has primarily intergranular porosity and permeability the thickness of the aquifer varies from 10 m to 300 m the depth of the water table ranges from 5 m to 30 m below ground level bgl the transmissivity ranges between 80 m2 day to 300 m2 day and the yield varies from 30 m3 h to 50 m3 h in this way the alluvial system forms the most potential aquifer for groundwater development the sedimentary hard rock system comprises sandstone shale and limestone groundwater occurs in the weathered zones in this system the sandstone and shale are hard and compact and form poor aquifers with a specific yield range between 1 and 3 the sedimentary soft rocks system is the gondwana deposits consisting of sandstone siltstone and clay and forms a good aquifer the hydraulic conductivity of these aquifers varies between 10 and 25 m d and the specific yield is from 10 to 15 the volcanic system covering nearly half of the study area forms the most important aquifer in the region the upper weathered zone in basaltic terrain forms moderate to good aquifers where water level varies from 2 to 14 m bgl hydraulic conductivity and specific yield vary between 5 and 15 m d and 1 to 3 2 to 30 m3 h respectively

ground water board cgwb govt of india and the water resources department govt of madhya pradesh 3 methodology 3 1 sample locations and collection protocols the shallow groundwater samples from unconfined aquifers were collected for one year 2010 during the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons covering all the hydrogeological units present in the study area fig 2 a total of 564 samples were collected i e 282 in pre monsoon and 282 in post monsoon data is given in supplementary material from the same locations the groundwater samples were collected from the dug wells and hand pumps the sampling was done from the deepest possible water levels in dug wells during their peak hours of usage to capture the in situ isotopic signature of groundwater and avoiding the possible effect of evaporation from stagnant water dug wells in the vicinity of any surface water body were avoided to prevent misleading signatures of any preferential surface water influence into groundwater for hand pumps samples were collected after purging them for ten to fifteen minutes to avoid sampling stagnant groundwater 3 2 sample analysis the oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δd isotope analysis of the groundwater samples was carried out using delta v plus isotopic ratio mass spectrometer irms in continuous flow mode with gas bench ii at physical research laboratory the analysis was done following the standard equilibration technique in which the water sample 300 μl was equilibrated with co2 or h2 respectively for oxygen or hydrogen the equilibrated gases were analysed in irms to obtain the value of 18o 16o and 2h 1h i e d h which was used to calculate the value of δ18o and δd respectively maurya et al 2009 oza et al 2020 the reproducibility of measurement was obtained by repeat analyses of multiple aliquots of the secondary laboratory standard which was better than 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δd the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions are expressed as the abundance ratio of less abundant to more abundant isotopes r 2h 1h or 18o 16o in terms of δ in per mil notation δ rsample rstd 1 1000 rstd rstd is the isotope abundance ratio in the vsmow apart from oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δd isotopic compositions of groundwater samples a derived parameter d excess δd 8 δ18o defined by dansgaard 1964 is used in this study to characterize the different groundwater masses and effects of evaporation on groundwater in addition to the isotopic composition of groundwater the unpublished isotopic data of rain oza 2020 has also been used in this study to discern the underlying hydrogeological processes to generate the spatial variation map of δ18o and d excess for shallow groundwater the variogram analysis was performed using the scikit gstat package in python 3 8 the exponential model returns the best results and least root mean square error rmse scores these maps were generated using the exponential function for the advanced gridding option in the kriging de wet et al 2020 hatvani et al 2020 raidla et al 2016 van der veer et al 2009 method using golden surfer 13 software 3 3 additional data apart from stables isotopes δ18o and δd some additional parameters affecting groundwater isotopic composition such as water table ism rainfall amount elevation slope evapotranspiration soil moisture and soil temperature have also been used in this study these data were taken from different sources at different resolutions the station wise water table data were taken from cgwb rainfall data of 0 25 0 25 resolution was taken from imd https www imdpune gov in elevation and slope data were extracted from the digital elevation model taken from bhuvan https bhuvan app3 nrsc gov in data download index php and the rest of the data were taken from gldas https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets keywords gldas at 0 25 0 25 resolution 3 4 k means clustering and principal component analysis the collection of pairwise pre monsoon and post monsoon samples provides us the unique opportunity to identify the major causal factors governing seasonal variation post monsoon pre monsoon of δ18o and d excess δδ18o δd excess in groundwater in order to elucidate the underlying hydrological processes which govern the seasonal variation in δ18o and d excess in this study elevation slope amount of ism rainfall water table fluctuation δwt seasonal difference in evapotranspiration δet seasonal difference in soil moisture δssm for surface soil moisture up to 0 cm to 10 cm depth and δtsm for total soil moisture up to 2 m depth and soil temperature δst were used however we found that the spatial distribution of input parameters has large variations which hinder a generalised interpretation of the data in order to segregate samples for which the variables behave in a more coherent and homogenous manner we performed k means clustering macqueen 1967 žalik 2008 the variables were first standardized and the ideal number of clusters was identified using the elbow method kodinariya and makwana 2013 nainggolan et al 2019 syakur et al 2018 the choice of three clusters provided the optimum performance in terms of reduction in the sum of squared errors k means clustering was then performed using python 3 8 the use of clustering enabled us to segregate our data into regions with a similar variation of the variables however owing to the high dimensionality of the data it was not possible to visualise the dependence of δδ18o δd excess along with variations in the independent variables moreover the initial set of variables is not mutually orthogonal with each variable perturbing the other this makes it difficult to identify the mutually exclusive role played by each variable and its importance in governing variations in δ18o and d excess in groundwater hence principal component analysis pca helena et al 2000 sârbu and pop 2005 yang et al 2021 was performed on the initial dataset using python 3 8 the projection of our original feature vectors was taken onto the first two principal components and plotted we considered the first two principal components since they explain the maximum variance in our dataset this allows us to investigate the variation of our original high dimensional dataset in a 2 dimensional space and hence identify the major causal factors responsible for governing seasonal variations in δ18o and d excess in groundwater 3 5 endmember mixing model the end member model is widely used to estimate the percentage contributions of the different components in groundwater recharge hameed et al 2015 jasechko 2019 mao et al 2021 pandey et al 2023 yeh et al 2011 in this study two end members are pre monsoon groundwater and ism and their contributions are calculated using the following equations phillips and gregg 2001 sakakibara et al 2017 1 δ pre m pre δ rain m rain δ post where 2 m pre m rain 1 where δpre is the δ18o of pre monsoon groundwater and mpre is the mass fraction of pre monsoon groundwater δrain is the δ18o of ism rainwater and mrain is the mass fraction of rainfall δpost is the δ18o of post monsoon groundwater which is the admixture of pre monsoon groundwater and the rainfall from the above equation the percentage contribution of rain in groundwater is calculated using the eq 3 and the uncertainty in rainwater contribution is calculated by the uncertainty

5 geographical coordinates provided by the hysplit model the percentage contribution of the sources for each 120 h back trajectory was calculated using the formula fs qs q r 100 oza et al 2020 in this formula f is the percentage contribution of vapour from a source region s for a particular rain event qs is the amount of moisture g kg picked by the air parcel while passing over the source q is the total moisture g kg gained in from all the source regions oceanic or continental over which the air parcel travelled and r is the amount of rainfall of that event sodemann et al 2008 4 results and discussion 4 1 δ18o and δd regression lines a total of 564 groundwater samples were collected from shallow unconfined aquifers from the 282 locations during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons for the analysis of its δ18o and δd during the pre monsoon season the δ18o varies from 7 3 to 2 9 with an average of 3 6 and the δd vary from 50 to 4 with an average of 27 table 1 whereas in the post monsoon season the δ18o varies from 10 5 to 2 1 with an average of 4 2 and δd vary from 76 to 3 with an average of 30 table 1 thus the average isotopic composition of post monsoon shallow groundwater is relatively depleted in heavy isotopes the d excess values range from 19 7 to 22 2 with an average of 2 3 for the pre monsoon season and range from 13 4 to 15 1 with an average of 3 4 for the post monsoon season table 1 the average low values of the δ18o and the δd and higher values of d excess during the post monsoon season indicate that water mass in the aquifer is replenished with isotopically depleted water during the rainy season between the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons the study area receives rainfall from indian summer monsoon ism the ism samples were collected from two nearby locations bhopal and jabalpur for the year 2010 2011 as part of the iwin national programme oza 2020 the rainfall has a very distinct isotopic character rainfall δ18o range 14 2 to 2 1 with an amounted weighted average of 6 4 δd range 99 to 19 with an amounted weighted average of 43 d excess range 8 to 19 with an amounted weighted average of 8 compared to the groundwater the amount weighted average δ18o ism rainfall is highly depleted compared to the average δ18o of pre monsoon 3 6 and post monsoon 4 2 groundwater from pre monsoon to post monsoon the average δ18o 3 6 to 4 2 of groundwater shifts towards the average value of rain which indicates seasonal recharge of groundwater from ism rain the δ18o δd regression line for ism rain and groundwater both post monsoon and pre monsoon are plotted in fig 3 a and d excess vs δ18o are plotted in fig 3b the slope of the local meteoric water line lmwl is 7 7 0 1 which is close to the slope of the global meteoric water line gmwl i e 8 craig 1961 groundwater both in the pre monsoon and post monsoon has a lower slope compared to lmwl the pre monsoon groundwater has a lower slope 5 8 0 1 compared to post monsoon groundwater 6 5 0 1 the d excess vs δ18o plot for ism rain shows no trend and most samples fall in the range between 5 to15 in contrast groundwater shows a decreasing trend in both seasons the lower slope of δ18o δd regression line for groundwater combined with the inverse relationship between δ18o and d excess suggests significant evaporation of shallow groundwater gupta et al 2005 mao et al 2021 yeh et al 2014 the higher δ18o δd regression line slope of post monsoon groundwater compared to the pre monsoon groundwater and the inverse relationship between δ18o and d excess even during the post monsoon season indicate a freshwater influx of isotopically lighter ism rainwater that mixes with the existing large reservoir of isotopically enriched pre monsoon groundwater groundwater samples identified within ellipses 1 and 2 fig 3a and b show conspicuously enriched and depleted samples respectively compared to other samples in the same season the samples in ellipses 1 and 2 geographically correspond with regions 1 and 2 fig 4 a and b the ellipse 1 contains mostly pre monsoon groundwater samples having enriched δ18o 2 0 and lower d excess 7 0 values the enriched groundwater in isolated patches can be ascribed to recharge by point sources such as lakes ponds or reservoirs which undergo substantial evaporative isotopic enrichment the ellipse 2 contains post monsoon groundwater samples having depleted δ18o 4 5 and higher d excess 0 0 compared to other post monsoon samples these depleted groundwater samples are ascribable to recharge by isotopically depleted ism rains of different meteorological origins discussed in the next section the isotopically depleted groundwater also suggests relatively faster groundwater recharge which favours the inheritance of pristine rainwater signature without much modification during infiltration jasechko 2019 mao et al 2021 4 2 spatial variation in δ18o and d excess and meteorological reasons the spatial distribution of δ18o for pre monsoon and post monsoon groundwater is plotted in fig 4a and b using the kriging method in surfer 13 software the same for d excess is plotted in fig 5 a and b based on spatial variation in δ18o and d excess the study area can be divided into two isotopically distinguishable regions 1 and 2 marked by two ellipses the groundwater in region 1 is isotopically enriched compared to region 2 the δ18o values of groundwater are getting progressively depleted from 1 0 in the west up to 6 0 in the east both during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons it is important to note that such an extent of depletion in δ18o values of groundwater cannot be explained by the isotopic depletion in recharge source i e ism rainfall either due to continental effect 2 1000 km reported by krishnamurthy and bhattacharya 1991 or elevation effect 0 4 per 100 m rise reported by deshpande et al 2003 this calls for an alternate meteorological explanation for observed isotopic depletion in groundwater which is discussed later groundwater also shows the spatial variation in d excess in pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons fig 5a and b during both seasons groundwater in most of the areas show d excess between 0 0 and 6 0 which is lower than the global average value of 10 and suggests that the groundwater is prone to considerable evaporation or recharge by considerably evaporated source water in the pre monsoon season there are a few localized pockets of groundwater in the study area which show the ve d excess and also very high δ18o these localized pockets are not in one climatic zone or in hydrogeological settings fig 2 which suggests that some localised processes are active in that region which lowers the d excess values these processes could be evaporation from groundwater due to shallow water table recharge from evaporated surface water and mixing of evaporated surface water having lower d excess and higher δ18o with shallow groundwater deshpande et al 2003 krishan et al 2020 the ve d excess patches turn into ve d excess in the post monsoon season which clearly indicates freshwater influx from ism rain the eastern side of the study area marked by region 2 shows higher d excess and correspondingly lower δ18o compared to region 1 where d excess is lower and δ18o is relatively high in both seasons the spatial variability of δ18o and d excess in groundwater from region 1 to region 2 indicates that although ism rainfall is known to be the source of groundwater recharge the rainfall in the east and west must have different isotopic compositions since the observed spatial isotopic variation in groundwater is more than that accountable by continental effect or elevation effect in rainfall we have examined other meteorological reasons such as moisture source and their transport history for regions 1 and 2 to identify the moisture sources their relative contribution and transport history for the ism rains june september in the region 1 and region 2 backword wind trajectories were for the indore located in region 1 and rewa located in region 2 shown in fig 6 a and b the resultant backward wind trajectory map of specific humidity variation for all the rainfall events during ism representing groundwater recharge source shows the direction of the moisture containing air parcel the percentage contribution of vapour by different sources such as the arabian sea as the bay of bengal bob and continentally recycled moisture estimated for each month of ism season are given in fig 6a and b it is clearly seen from fig 6a and b that almost all the rain bearing backward wind trajectories at indore fig 6a are coming from the as side with only a few trajectories coming from the bob side in contrast at rewa a large number of backward wind trajectories are from the bob side it is also seen from fig 6a and b that the relative contribution of moisture average of june to september from the as is 48 for indore region 1 whereas it is only 33 for rewa region 2 correspondingly the relative contribution of moisture combined from the bob and the continental recycling is only 52 i e 6 bob 46 continental for indore region 1 whereas that for the rewa region 2 is 67 i e 16 bob 51 continental the increased contribution of moisture from the bob and continental recycling is reported breitenbach et al 2010 deshpande et al 2010 oza et al 2020 to give rise to isotopically depleted rain elsewhere in the country the same reason is responsible for the depleted rains and the depleted groundwater that it recharges in region 2 4 3 seasonal variation in δ18o and d excess to understand the effect of ism on groundwater recharge in the study area the temporal variation in δ18o δδ18o δ18opost mon δ18o pre mon and d excess δd excess d excess post mon d excess pre mon contour is plotted in fig 7 a and b considering the 1σ measurement precision of better than 0 1 for δ18o and 1 0 for δd as mentioned in the methodology section the 2σ seasonal difference of 0 2 for δ18o and 1 3 for d excess is considered as a significant threshold value for evaluating the seasonal variations in these two parameters in other words a seasonal difference of more than 0 2 in δ18o and more than 1 3 in d excess is treated as a genuine seasonal isotopic difference caused by seasonal change in groundwater mass and not by any instrumental uncertainty mao et al 2021 pandey et al 2023 the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic data do not follow the normal distribution to evaluate the statistical difference between the isotope value of groundwater samples of pre monsoon and post monsoon season mann whitney u test has been carried out at a 0 05 significance level in both cases the obtained p values are less than the desired threshold 0 05 which rejects the null hypothesis and assures a significant difference in groundwater isotopic values between the seasons in the non rainy pre monsoon season dry climatic conditions in the study area favour evaporation from the groundwater and with the non availability of a recharge source groundwater shows enrichment in δ18o and lower d excess values during the rainy season due to recharge by monsoonal rainwater which has depleted δ18o and higher d excess values compared to pre monsoon groundwater the areas that receive freshwater influx show veδ18o and ve δd excess a large part of the study area shows veδ18o 58 or no variation 27 the veδ18o is possible when groundwater receives isotopically lighter freshwater influx during ism this suggests that 58 of the study area recharges seasonally some parts of the study show veδ18o 15 which mean during the pre monsoon season groundwater has depleted δ18o compare to surrounding regions and the amount weighted average δ18o of ism the lower δ18o in the pre monsoon season is possible only when groundwater is recharged by isotopically depleted sources such as deeper groundwater gonfiantini et al 1998 rivers originating from higher altitude areas liu and yamanaka 2012 lateral movement of groundwater from higher elevation to lower area jasechko 2019 to discern the interpretative significance of seasonal isotopic variation in groundwater the values of seasonal variation in δ18o δδ18o and d excess δd excess are plotted as δδ18o versus δd excess in fig 7c seasonal isotopic variation actually represents the variation in the groundwater mass groundwater mass can change both in the pre monsoon season due to direct evaporation from groundwater or recharge from evaporated sources such as irrigation return flow and evaporated surface water long distance transport of allochthonous rainwater or in the post monsoon season due to recharge from fresh rainwater plotting the seasonal variation as δδ18o vs δd excess can provide insights into season changes in the groundwater mass during pre and post monsoon in the following based on the observed seasonal isotopic variation in groundwater we hypothesise the possible geohydrological processes it is seen in fig 7c that the maximum number 134 of groundwater samples fall in the second quadrant q2 ve δδ18o and ve δd excess which signifies enriched δ18o and lower d excess in groundwater in the pre monsoon season compared to the post monsoon season these signatures can be ascribed to 1 direct evaporation of gw during warm and arid pre monsoon season or 2 recharge from the evaporated surface water in pre monsoon and or 3 recharge from fresh rainwater during post monsoon season the second highest number 49 of groundwater samples fall in the fourth quadrant q4 ve δδ18o and ve δd excess signifying lower δ18o and higher d excess in groundwater in the pre monsoon season compared to post monsoon such a seasonal isotopic difference is possible in two situations 1 groundwater is recharged in the post monsoon by isotopically enriched water with higher δ18o and lower d excess such as that stored in the surface reservoir and released when fresh influx is received or 2 groundwater is recharged in the pre monsoon season by the allochthonous monsoonal rainwater of previous season having lower δ18o and higher d excess which can be transported for a long distance through fractured terrain existing in the study area besides the above two possibilities the influence of paleowaters with lower δ18o and higher d excess may also be there thirty four groundwater samples are falling in the third quadrant q3 ve δδ18o and ve δd excess which signifies lower δ18o and lower d excess in groundwater during the post monsoon season compared to pre monsoon such an isotopic composition is possible in the case of cyclonic precipitation sun et al 2022 or precipitation from a cloud parcel highly diminished in its original moisture content clark and fritz 2013 while such an isotopic composition is already reported in precipitation müller et al 2020 its signatures in groundwater are identified in this study there are only a small number 20 of groundwater samples falling in the first quadrant q1 ve δδ18o and ve δd excess which signifies lower δ18o and lower d excess in groundwater in pre monsoon season compared to post monsoon this is possible when groundwater in a particular area is recharged in the pre monsoon season by allochthonous rainwater of the previous monsoon in higher altitude regions such higher altitude rainwater has lower δ18o and lower d excess due to the elevation effect araguás araguás et al 1998 kumar et al 2010 which can be transported for a long distance through fractured terrain existing in the study area and is detected in pre monsoon sampling of the next year various hypotheses regarding the recharge mechanism suggested above are based exclusively on seasonal variation in isotopic composition and highlight the importance of seasonal sampling 4 4 correlation between δδ18o δd excess and other hydrological parameters the seasonality in groundwater recharge can be controlled by several other hydrological parameters such as elevation slope amount of ism rainfall water table fluctuation δwt seasonal difference in evapotranspiration δet seasonal difference in soil moisture δssm for surface soil moisture up to 0 cm to 10 cm depth and δtsm for total soil moisture up to 2 m depth and soil temperature δst to find out the correlation between groundwater recharge indicators δδ18o δd excess and the above mentioned hydrological parameters first these data were grouped into three different clusters using k means clustering fig 8 a and then for individual clusters pca fig 8b was done in pca the original feature vectors have been plotted against the first two principal components the arrows represent the variables such that if two arrows are in the same or opposite direction then they are positively and negatively correlated respectively if the arrows are mutually perpendicular it implies no correlation exists the larger the length of the arrow the better the variable is represented the cluster 1 fig 8a falls in the higher altitude region satpura hill area fig 1 where the rainfall is highest compared to the other part of the study area kundu et al 2015 wani et al 2010 and δδ18o shows a ve variation fig 7a which indicates groundwater recharge during monsoon season the pca of cluster 1 shows a weak negative correlation between δδ18o and δet which means the area receiving groundwater recharge during monsoon season ve δδ18o shows higher evapotranspiration ve δet which is possible in this region as this part is covered by very dense to a moderately dense forest https fsi nic in isfr19 vol2 isfr 2019 vol ii madhya pradesh pdf cluster 2 fig 8a lies in the western margin which includes the low laying area of the narmada basin and the high altitude tableland area of the vindhyan range fig 1 and is covered by volcanic rock basalt groundwater in this region shows ve δδ18o which suggests recharge in the post monsoon season the pca of this cluster shows a weak ve correlation between δδ18o and elevation i e at higher altitudes groundwater has more ve δδ18o because groundwater recharge source rainfall will be depleted here due to altitude effect as well as in this region net cropped area and cropping intensity is very high as per agriculture atlas of madhya pradesh https jnkvv org pdf 27012021221604atlas 20jnkvv 20final pdf compared to other regions that enriched the groundwater through irrigation return flow while during the post monsoon season a small amount of recharge by isotopically depleted ism will create ve δδ18o cluster 3 falls in the north eastern margin of the study area fig 8a covered by alluvium crystalline hard rock and sedimentary hard rock fig 2 some part of the area is drought prone sharma and sen 2021 in this cluster only δδ18o and δd excess show the ve correlation fig 8b which indicates groundwater recharge although the variation in δδ18o is visible only in the crystalline hard rock section fig 7a rest part of the area in this cluster does not show any variation in δδ18o 4 5 seasonal groundwater recharge in two adjoining aquifers the major aquifer systems present in the study area are volcanic system basalt covers nearly 46 of the geographical area and sedimentary hard rock covers nearly 23 the rest of the area is covered with shale unconsolidated alluvium and crystalline hard rock these two major aquifers have different hydrogeological properties as discussed earlier which govern the groundwater availability in these aquifers the aquifers are recharged in general by the ism rainfall but the recharge varies spatially depending upon the aquifer types and recharge processes to understand and estimate the magnitude of seasonal ism rainfall contribution to groundwater recharge two adjoining aquifer systems basalt and sedimentary hard rocks were selected close to the rainfall sampling location and the isotope mass balance was carried out fig 9 a in basaltic aquifers the isotopic composition of groundwater in the pre monsoon season is δ18o 5 0 to 2 9 with an average of 3 2 δd 37 to 4 with an average of 26 and d excess 19 7 to 5 4 with an average of 0 5 in this aquifer the isotopic composition of groundwater for the post monsoon season is δ18o 5 3 to 2 5 with an average of 4 2 δd 40 to 21 with an average of 31 and d excess 1 7 to 8 3 with an average of 2 3 in sedimentary hard rock aquifer the groundwater has a different isotopic composition compared to basaltic aquifers in both seasons in the pre monsoon season the isotopic composition of groundwater in the sedimentary aquifer is δ18o 7 2 to 1 3 with an average of 4 2 δd 48 to 15 with an average of 32 and d excess 4 8 to 8 9 with an average of 2 2 in the post monsoon season the isotopic composition of groundwater in the sedimentary aquifer is δ18o 7 8 to 3 9 with an average of 5 1 δd 50 to 24 with an average of 35 d excess 1 0 to 13 8 with an average of 5 8 the δd vs δ18o and d excess vs δ18o for both the aquifers in pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons have been plotted in fig 9b b and fig 9c c the slopes of the regression lines in the pre monsoon season for basaltic aquifer and sedimentary hard rock are respectively 5 1 0 2 and 5 9 0 3 in the post monsoon season the regression line slopes for the basaltic and sedimentary aquifers increase to respectively 6 3 0 4 and 7 2 0 5 which is similar to the slope of lmwl 7 7 0 1 the depletion in the average isotopic composition of groundwater in the post monsoon season and the increase in the regression line slope confirms the groundwater recharge during the monsoon season the ism rainwater contribution to groundwater recharge in two aquifers is calculated using two end member isotopic mixing models using the seasonal isotopic composition of groundwater in the two aquifers and the local rainwater for basaltic aquifer the end member values are δ18opre 3 2 and δ18opost 4 2 for sedimentary aquifers the end member values are δ18opre 4 2 and δ18opost 5 1 the end member values for groundwater are the average δ18o value for pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons whereas for rain it is the amount weighted average value δ18orain 6 4 the end member mixing model reveals that in the case of basaltic aquifer the post monsoon groundwater mass consists of an admixture of 32 of rainwater which mixes with 68 of the pre monsoon groundwater and in sedimentary hard rock aquifer it is 39 of rainwater and 61 of pre monsoon residual groundwater as discussed in the following these estimated mass fractions of rainwater and pre monsoon groundwater can be advantageously used for the volumetric estimation of other hydrological components of the eastern part of the study area where these aquifers are situated as per the dynamic groundwater resource of india cgwb 2011 the basaltic aquifer is spread over three districts jabalpur mandla and seoni of madhya pradesh and covers a 22727 km2 area and receives nearly 1 7 bcm billion cubic meter of groundwater recharge in the monsoon season while sedimentary hard rock aquifer covers 21048 km2 area in damoha rewa and satna districts of madhya pradesh and receives 1 2 bcm of groundwater recharge in monsoon season as per the mass balance calculation in the basaltic aquifer 32 of the groundwater is rainfall recharge which in volumetric terms becomes 1 7 bcm the rest 68 3 7 bcm is pre monsoon residual water the total groundwater potential calculated by the mass balance of this aquifer is 5 4 bcm 1 7 rainfall recharge 3 7 pre monsoon residual water the annual groundwater abstraction natural discharge and pre monsoon residual water in the basaltic aquifer are 0 6 bcm 0 1bcm reported by cgwb and 3 7 bcm calculated respectively so the remaining 1 0 bcm 5 4 minus 0 6 minus 0 1 minus 3 7 groundwater is estimated to percolate into deeper aquifers through faults present in the area this inference is justifiable considering the known faults in this region deshpande and gupta 2013 in sedimentary hard rock aquifer groundwater has a 39 freshwater influx from monsoonal rain which is nearly 1 2 bcm as per the cgwb report 2011 so the groundwater potential in this aquifer is 3 2 bcm 1 2 bcm freshwater influx 1 9 bcm pre monsoon residual water the annual groundwater abstraction natural discharge and pre monsoon residual water in this aquifer are 0 9 bcm 0 07 bcm given by cgwb and 1 9 bcm calculated respectively so the remaining 0 3bcm of groundwater percolates into the deeper aquifer this additional water can be advantageously used for some other purposes 5 conclusion this study uses seasonal variations in the isotopic composition of groundwater along with rainfall isotopic composition and trajectories of vapour masses to understand the interaction between the ism rainwater and the groundwater and estimate the relative contribution of ism rainfall to two adjoining aquifers there are distinct differences in the isotopic composition of groundwater in the western and eastern parts of the study area with significant isotopic depletion on the eastern side since the observed differences cannot be accounted by the isotopic difference in the rainwater due to continental effect or altitude effect backward wind trajectory analyses were performed to estimate the relative contribution of vapour sources the arabian sea bay of bengal and the continental recycling for rainfall in the eastern and western regions of the study area it is observed that due to meteorological reasons the contribution of moisture from the bay of bengal and the continental recycling is higher 67 16 bob 51 continental for rainfall in the eastern part compared to the western part 52 6 bob 46 continental the signatures of this meteorological process are discerned in the groundwater the temporal difference in the isotopic composition of groundwater δ18o reveals the seasonal recharge by different sources with 58 of the study area recharged by monsoonal rain and 15 of the area recharged in the pre monsoon season by isotopically depleted source water which could be irrigation return flow of deeper static water recharge by an allochthonous source such as rainfall in higher altitude region approximately 27 of the study area shows no variation in isotopic composition which suggests longer residence time and a lower rate of recharge this finding also conveys that if the groundwater in this 27 area is overexploited or polluted it would be difficult to restore or replenish it this is a societally useful input for groundwater development and management the rainwater contribution to groundwater recharge was also calculated for two adjoining aquifers basaltic aquifer and sedimentary hard rock using two end member mixing models suggesting that groundwater recharge occurs at a higher rate in the sedimentary hard aquifer 6 limitations in this study seasonal pre monsoon and post monsoon shallow groundwater samples were collected from central india madhya pradesh covering nearly 3 105 km2 areas and analysed for stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen this study tried to understand the hydrogeological processes governing the surface water groundwater interaction in central india madhya pradesh using seasonal variation in the isotopic composition of groundwater and factors affecting this variation this study has certain limitations which are listed below 1 this study is based on only one seasonal cycle pre monsoon and post monsoon of groundwater sampling for isotopic analyses hence the estimated groundwater recharge may not represent long term trend of groundwater recharge 2 according to the sampling strategy of the iwin national programme the groundwater samples were collected from the shallow first unconfined aquifers but it was not possible to ascertain the exact depth of dug well 116 or handpump 145 or tube wells 21 therefore the inference drawn is in general for shallow first unconfined aquifers without any qualification about the depth however it is known that the depth of the water table in all these wells was less than 100 feet 3 although the study area has a large geographical extent nearly 3 105 km2 there are only three stations for which rainwater isotopic data is available 4 pca was used to understand the correlation between seasonal variation in δ18o and other hydrological parameters a limitation of this method is that in case of the smaller length of the arrow for a particular variable that variable may not be well represented in the 2 dimensional space credit authorship contribution statement amit pandey conceptualization writing original draft

introduction with rapid population growth and decreasing cultivated land area increasing food demand has become a significant challenge worldwide tilman et al 2011 in this context arid and semiarid regions have gradually become important crop production areas where many people engage in agriculture to meet their basic needs however agricultural production in these regions is restricted by water shortages and low soil fertility ren et al 2016 li et al 2020b thus large amounts of irrigation water and mineral nitrogen fertilizer have been applied to obtain high crop production in recent decades goulding et al 2000 riley et al 2001 burney et al 2010 such use inevitably results in high soil water carbon and nitrogen losses thereby resulting in water and nitrogen productivity reduction and functional degradation of agroecosystems zhang et al 2004 these then intensify the conflict among resource utilization food production and ecosystem development however effective farmland irrigation and nitrogen fertilization strategies fins should consider the coordinated sustainable development of resources food and ecology rfe systems thus a systematic approach is required to optimize the fins for rfe trade off in recent decades many field experiments have been conducted to propose the appropriate fins thereby balancing the conflict between crop yield and water and nitrogen productivity ju et al 2000 li et al 2015a for example the contradictions between wheat yield and water productivity and between wheat maize yield and nitrogen productivity were mediated by optimizing the irrigation regime jiang et al 2012 and optimizing the nitrogen application strategy liu et al 2017 however optimizing fins through field experiments is time consuming and expensive additionally due to the influence of climate soil and field management factors it is difficult to obtain general conclusions from field experiments many agro ecosystem simulation models e g rzwqm aquacrop dndc dssat swap daisy and hydrus have been gradually used to solve these problems liang et al 2014 for instance in order to obtain the optimal irrigation and or fertilization strategies for crop production and efficient utilization of water and or fertilizer the wheat and maize fields soil water and salt transportation were simulated with hydrus 1d pan et al 2017 the maize growth and nitrogen fates were simulated with the dndc model li et al 2020c and the soil water dynamics and wheat growth were simulated with the aquacrop model huang et al 2022 however to our knowledge these models have their own limitations due to the different focus of model functions for instance hydrus 1d does not consider the processes of crop growth dndc is relatively simple when considering crop growth and dssat is relatively simple when considering carbon nitrogen c n cycle processes liang et al 2014 thus many previous studies have mainly focused on simulations of soil water salt transport water crop growth and water salt crop growth and little attention has been given to the coupled simulation of farmland water carbon nitrogen and crop growth processes this also indicates that previous studies have not considered the farmland ecosystem service value esv loss caused by carbon and nitrogen losses such as co2 and n2o emissions nh3 volatilization and no3 n leaching when optimizing fins therefore conflicts among resource utilization food production and ecosystem development still exist however sustainable fins must meet current food demands while maintaining higher resource use efficiency and ecosystem stability xie et al 2017 in recent decades many studies have proposed different esv assessment methods to study the effects of human activities on ecosystems costanza et al 1997 xie et al 2017 although large scale esvs have been well evaluated xiao et al 2000 xie et al 2005 xie et al 2017 but the farmland esvs should be further quantified and studied due to that are strongly related to farmland ecosystem rfe management farmland ecosystems is significantly influenced by natural conditions and human activities that not only provide positive service function including food production water conservation carbon sequestration oxygen release and nutrient cycling carpenter et al 2009 xie et al 2017 but also cause greenhouse gas ghg emissions nh3 volatilization water consumption and inorganic nitrogen leaching thereby causing negative impacts on global climate change and surface and subsurface water environments bennett et al 2009 yue et al 2021 these negative effects usually lead to farmland ecosystem service function degradation and esv loss maintaining the stability of farmland ecosystem service function requires a detailed understanding of how ecosystems respond to different farmland management practices e g irrigation and nitrogen application and when the maximum esv is obtained therefore it is important to quantify the response of farmland esvs and to incorporate esvs into the decision making framework combining agro hydrological models with esv assessment methods may be a good choice for quantifying farmland esvs among many agro hydrological models ahc agro hydrological chemical and crop systems simulator has a relatively complete function which can accurately model farmland water salt carbon nitrogen and crop growth processes xu et al 2018 for instance the ahc model was tested by experimental data in wheat and maize farmland systems in the arid northwest china and the north china plain xu et al 2018 the modeling results indicated that the ahc model could model well the soil water salt dynamics water nitrogen dynamics and wheat and maize growth processes wang et al 2022 also simulated soil water and salt dynamics crops maize wheat sunflower and pepper growth processes and their yield with the ahc model in the arid hetao irrigation district therefore it is feasible to use the ahc model to simulate the farmland water carbon nitrogen dynamics and crop growth processes under different fins and then use the esv assessment method to calculate farmland esvs based on these simulation results on this basis the multicriteria decision method i e vikor can be used to optimize fins which can reconcile conflicts among resource utilization food production and ecosystem development however to our knowledge studies on process simulation based farmland esv quantification and rfe trade off approaches have not yet been reported additionally the vikor method is rarely used to determine fins therefore to fill these gaps identified above the main research objectives are 1 to propose a process simulation based framework for rfe trade off by coupling the ahc model with the esv assessment method and vikor method 2 to verify the framework s feasibility and practicality by a case study in the upper yellow river basin northwest china and 3 to quantify farmland esvs and to optimize the fins for rfe trade off in the study area 2 methodology 2 1 framework development the water carbon nitrogen process simulation based framework for rfe trade off was developed by combining the agro hydrological model i e ahc with the esv assessment method and decision making method i e vikor vlsekriterijuska optimizacija i komoromisno resenje a detailed description of the framework is shown in fig 1 based on the framework the farmland esvs can be assessed and the rfe systems can be traded off by optimizing fins for the target crop farmland ecosystem 1 calibration and validation of the ahc model with the measured spatial

farmland esvs positive esv and negative esv as well as revealing the connections and synergies among multiple service values and 5 integrating water and nitrogen productivity yield and farmland esvs into a multicriteria decision method and calculating the benefit ratio value qi corresponding to the i th scenario under the conditions of decision coefficient v 0 5 and v 0 5 with eq 19a and then determining the appropriate fins for the target crop farmland ecosystem the fins with the smallest value of q 2 2 ahc model description the ahc is a one dimensional 1 d agro hydrological model developed by xu et al 2018 which was inherited and modified based on the swap and epic subsequently other modules were gradually developed to meet user application requirements thus far the soil water

mechanistic model based on crop physiological and ecological processes that can simulate crop growth including biomass leaf area evapotranspiration nutrient uptake crop yield and environmental stress based on crop growth parameters and field management parameters the advantage of this model is that it does not consider microphysiological processes has fewer parameters and can simulate the growth processes of multiple crops at the same time overall the ahc model can be used to simulate farmland system water carbon nitrogen dynamics and crop growth processes 2 3 calculations 2 3 1 ecosystem

site is located in the arid upper yellow river basin 41 09 n 107 39 e northwest china with a semiarid temperate continental climate in the area annual precipitation varies between 50 and 240 mm annual sunshine varies between 3100 and 3300 h and annual mean temperature is approximately 6 8 c the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations in precipitation were in a range of 0 6 6 mg l 1 the groundwater depth varied between 0 9 and 3 m during the crop growing period the nh4 n concentration in the groundwater and irrigation water was in a range of 0 1 3 mg l 1 and the no3 n concentration was in a range of 1 20 mg l 1 the daily precipitation air temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation and groundwater depth during the simulation periods in 2019 and 2020 are shown in fig 2 according to the us textural classification 0 70 cm and 70 100 cm soils were defined as silt loam soil and loamy soil respectively shirazi and boersma 1984 detailed soil physicochemical properties in the test field including soil texture bulk density field capacity wilting point organic matter content and nh4 n and no3 n contents are presented in table 1 the meteorological and groundwater depth data were collected by the miniature weather station hobo u30 usa and the water level logger hobo u20 usa respectively the soil particle composition was analyzed by laser diffraction particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 uk li et al 2020a the soil field capacity and bulk density were measured by cutting ring method zou et al 2015 chai et al 2016 the soil wilting point were measured by biological method zou et al 2015 the soil organic matter was tested by the potassium dichromate volumetric external heating method li et al 2022 the nh4 n and no3 n contents in soil groundwater irrigation water and precipitation were measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometer uv 3100 china previous studies have reported that the irrigation depth exceeds 400 mm during the spring wheat growing season in this region zhang et al 2013 in addition the nitrogen fertilizer input exceeds 300 kg ha 1 per season was used to maintain high wheat yield this practice inevitably caused low water and nitrogen productivity high inorganic nitrogen leaching nh3 volatilization and ghg emissions zhang et al 2004 which threaten the sustainability of the agricultural rfe system in this area thus a field experiment under different irrigation and nitrogen application levels was conducted in 2019 and 2020 at the hetao experimental station of china agricultural university in this area to obtain experimental data three irrigation depth levels 450 mm i450 315 mm i315 and 180 mm i180 together with two nitrogen application levels 340 kg ha 1 n340 and 170 kg ha 1 n170 were implemented in 2019 and 2020 the experimental design was completely random with six irrigation and fertilization treatments i450n340 i315n340 i180n340 i450n170 i315n170 and i180n170 furthermore we also added a mild nitrogen application level i e 250 kg ha 1 n250 under the condition of the 315 mm irrigation depth i e i315n250 in 2020 each treatment included three complete replications in 2019 and 2020 the experiments included 18 and 21 plots 25 m 7 m respectively the i450n340 treatment was the control treatment and was consistent with local farming practices the specific irrigation and fertilization schedules of all treatments table s1 can be found in the supplementary material the main irrigation method in the study area is surface irrigation thus we hypothesized that the land utilization is not affected by canal irrigation and ground water irrigation in the upper yellow river basin spring wheat yongliang no 4 was seeded on 15 march in 2019 and 2020 and the planting density was approximately 6 030 000 plant hectare the spring wheat was harvested on 20 july in both years more detailed descriptions of irrigation fertilization and crop management can be found in li et al 2022 3 2 sample collection and measurement in 2019 and 2020 soil samples from each plot were collected from 0 to 100 cm soil depths 10 cm increments to a depth of 20 cm then 20 cm increments to a depth of 100 cm approximately every 10 days during the spring wheat growing season these soil samples were used to measure the soil water content and soil nh4 n and no3 n contents after each irrigation and precipitation event the inorganic nitrogen nh4 n and no3 n leaching from the 0 100 cm root zone soil was measured by the leakage bucket method li et al 2020a the detailed processes for measuring and calculating the soil water content soil nh4 n and no3 n contents and their leaching amounts can be found in li et al 2022 in addition during the spring wheat growing seasons the soil co2 and n2o emissions were collected using the static chamber method in a 10 day interval li et al 2020b additionally the sampling interval was shortened to 2 3 days after irrigation and topdressing at the jointing stage the soil nh3 volatilization was measured using the ventilation method li et al 2019b the sampling time of soil nh3 volatilization was consistent with the sampling time of soil co2 and n2o emissions the detailed processes for measuring and calculating the soil co2 n2o and nh3 fluxes can be found in li et al 2020b and li et al 2019b during the spring wheat growing seasons the wheat plants with a length of 2 m in each plot were cut off approximately every 10 days for plant height leaf area index lai and aboveground dry biomass determinations the height of wheat plants was measured using a tapeline all leaves of the wheat plants were cut down and then the length and width of each leaf were measured using a ruler the lai was calculated using eq 20 li 2015 after measurement of the plant height and lai all these plant organs were used to determine the aboveground dry biomass in addition one square meter of wheat plant was selected from each plot to evaluate the grain yield at harvest these wheat plants were not disturbed by sampling during the growing seasons the detailed processes for measuring the aboveground dry biomass and yield can be found in li et al 2022 the leaf area index can be calculated as li 2015 20 lai 0 721 p d lw l l d where lai is the wheat leaf area index pd is the wheat plant density plant ha 1 lw and ll are the width and length of wheat leaf respectively m and d is area m2 3 3 model setup calibration and validation the soil water flow and solute transport were calculated for soil layers from 0 to 300 cm the vertical 1 d soil profile was uniformly discretized into 301 nodes with 1 cm spacing and generalized to 4 layers based on the soil particle data of the test field table 1 ren et al 2016 the simulation period was from early march to late july including the entire growth season of spring wheat in this study region li et al 2022 for soil water flow the flux boundary and variable pressure water head boundary were selected as the upper boundary and lower boundary conditions respectively the upper boundary i e flux boundary was determined by the daily precipitation and irrigation and the daily actual evaporation the lower boundary i e variable pressure water head boundary was determined by the monitored daily groundwater depth for solute transport the concentration flux boundary was selected as the upper and lower boundary conditions which were determined by specifying the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations of precipitation irrigation water and groundwater the field test data including soil water nh4 n and no3 n contents were used to determine the initial conditions before running the simulation the soil hydraulic parameters solute nh4 n and no3 n transport parameters c n turnover parameters water stress parameters and crop growth parameters were initially specified according to studies by ren et al 2016 and xu et al 2018 after setting the initial value of the parameters 41 important parameters including soil hydraulic parameters solute dispersion lengths water stress parameters and crop growth parameters were selected for sensitivity analysis the definitions and ranges of these parameters can be found in tables2 of the supplemental material the parameters sensitivities to soil moisture and nitrogen dynamics soil co2 emissions eta lai aboveground dry biomass were analyzed based on the simulated and measured data the gsa module of ahc model was used to calculate the sensitivity values for these parameters and these highly sensitive parameters were presented in this study then the soil water contents soil nh4 n and no3 n contents soil co2 n2o and nh3 fluxes inorganic nitrogen leaching crop growth indicators plant height lai and aboveground dry biomass and grain yield obtained in 2019 and 2020 were used to calibrate and validate these parameters three indices including the normalized relative root mean error nrmse nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse and determination coefficient r2 were selected to evaluate model performance 3 4 scenario design and dataset establishment in this study twelve water saving scenarios and eleven nitrogen reduction scenarios i e 132 irrigation and nitrogen application combinations were designed based on local farmer irrigation and nitrogen application practices i e 450 mm irrigation and 340 kg ha 1 nitrogen application and previous related studies by dong et al 2011 and li et al 2015a the irrigation depth was reduced at 30 mm intervals from 450 mm to 120 mm the nitrogen application rate was reduced at 20 kg ha 1 from 340 kg ha 1 to 140 kg ha 1 the dates and proportions of each irrigation and fertilization event were consistent with the local practices table s1 the specific scenario combinations are shown in table 2 the calibrated and validated ahc model was used to simulate the soil water nh4 n and no3 n contents inorganic nitrogen leaching soil co2 n2o and nh3 fluxes aboveground dry biomass and yield of different irrigation and fertilization scenarios in the current year 2019 and 2020 based on these simulation results the datasets including wheat yield water and nitrogen productivity positive esv and negative esv were established using eqs 4 16 4 results and discussion 4 1 model performance evaluation the parameters of the ahc model were calibrated by the datasets with all treatments obtained in 2019 and were validated by the datasets with all treatments obtained in 2020 in this study the simulated values and measured values of soil water nh4 n and no3 n dynamics soil co2 and n2o emissions nh3 volatilization lai plant height and aboveground dry biomass are shown in figs s1 s5 the goodness of fit indicators during the calibration and validation periods are shown in table s3 in addition the simulated values and measured values of inorganic nitrogen leaching and yield and their goodness of fit indicators are shown in fig s6 the calibrated values of soil hydraulic parameters c n turnover parameters water stress parameters and wheat growth parameters are shown in tables 3 5 figs s1 s6 and table s3 can be found in the supplementary material the simulated soil water content showed a fine agreement with their measured values for different soil layers during the spring wheat seasons fig s1 in the calibration period the values of nrmse nse and r2 for the soil water content of all treatments were in a range of 0 11 0 13 0 45 0 67 and 0 85 0 92 respectively and these values were in a range of 0 13 0 17 0 31 0 51 and 0 72 0 85 in the validation period table s3 the soil water dynamics simulated by the ahc were similar to those simulated by hydrus 1d in pan et al 2017 for soil nitrogen dynamic simulation the ahc accurately captured the observed soil nh4 n and no3 n dynamics figs s2 and s3 in particular the soil nh4 n and no3 n variations were relatively dramatic in the 0 25 cm soil layer and were also described well using the ahc furthermore these simulation results of soil nh4 n and no3 n dynamics obtained by the ahc were better than those of meier et al 2006 and liang et al 2014 who used the apsim and rzwqm models respectively the goodness of fit indicators i e the values of nrmse nse and r2 for the soil nh4 n and no3 n during the calibration and validation periods were within the range of acceptable values table s3 cameira et al 2007 wang and huang 2008 in addition the simulated soil inorganic nitrogen leaching also fit well with the measured values during the growth seasons especially in the calibration period fig s6 the nrmse nse and r2 values for inorganic nitrogen leaching were 0 09 0 57 and 0 92 respectively for the soil co2 and n2o emissions the ahc model also reasonably captured the variation trend of their observed values during the spring wheat growing seasons fig s4 although the fitting accuracy of soil co2 and n2o emissions was lower than that of soil moisture variations the simulated soil co2 and n2o emission variations using the ahc were better than those using the dndc zimmermann et al 2018 cui and wang 2019 for soil nh3 volatilization we found that the simulated soil nh3 volatilization peaks using the ahc were slightly higher than the measured soil nh3 volatilization peaks based on the field trial but the variation trend of observed soil nh3 volatilization could be captured by the ahc fig s4 there are two probable explanations for this result on the one hand the surface broadcast of urea increased the uncertainty in soil nh3 volatilization observations xu et al 2018 on the other hand it was relatively difficult to accurately observe the soil nh3 volatilization peaks because the main process of nh3 volatilization after each irrigation rainfall and fertilization event was usually completed in a short time lei et al 2009 the same problem also existed in an earlier study by li et al 2019a who simulated the soil nh3 volatilization fluxes from maize and wheat farmland with the dndc model for crop growth the simulated lai plant height and aboveground dry biomass all showed a fine agreement with their measured values during the spring wheat seasons fig s5 the values of nrmse nse and r2 for lai plant height and aboveground dry biomass obtained with the ahc in the two years during the calibration and validation periods are shown in table s3 these indicators were all within reasonable ranges xu et al 2018 wang et al 2022 moreover these simulated wheat growth indicators using the ahc were quite close to those simulated by apsim and aquacrop in zhang et al 2012 and huang et al 2022 respectively moreover the wheat yield simulated by the ahc also fit well with the observed values in the two seasons fig s6 in the calibration period the nrmse nse and r2 values for the yield of all treatments were 0 03 0 89 and 0 98 respectively and these values were 0 04 0 79 and 0 96 in the validation period overall the ahc model had excellent performance in simulating farmland water carbon nitrogen dynamics and crop growth processes in arid northwest china 4 2 farmland irrigation and fertilization decisions the wheat yield water and nitrogen productivity farmland positive esv and negative esv figs s7 and s8 were taken as the decision indicators of the vikor method to calculate the benefit ratio value q corresponding to each scenario under the conditions of the compromise decision v 0 5 focusing on a lower negative esv and the maximizing the group utility decision v 0 9 focusing on a higher yield and positive esv figs s7 and s8 can be found in the supplementary material the benefit ratio q corresponding to each irrigation and nitrogen application scenario is shown in fig 3 the q value was significantly affected by irrigation depth and nitrogen application in 2019 and 2020 for all decision coefficients the q value first decreased and then increased as the irrigation depth decreased from 450 mm to 120 mm the lowest q value was obtained when irrigation was 210 mm regardless of the decision coefficient v in 2019 and 2020 in addition the effect of nitrogen application on the q value was consistent with that of irrigation on the q value the q value first decreased and then increased as the nitrogen application decreased from 340 kg ha 1 to 140 kg ha 1 however the nitrogen application corresponding to the lowest q value differed under different decision coefficients in 2019 and 2020 the 200 kg ha 1 nitrogen application obtained the lowest q value when v was 0 5 while the 260 kg ha 1 nitrogen application obtained the lowest q value when v was 0 9 therefore in 2019 and 2020 the fins for compromise decision was 210 mm irrigation and 200 kg n ha 1 nitrogen application i210n200 fig 4 suggesting that the i210n200 scenario could significantly reduce the negative farmland esv but it might cause yield and positive farmland esv losses in addition the fins for maximizing the group utility decision was 210 mm irrigation and 260 kg n ha 1 nitrogen application i210n260 suggesting that the i210n260 scenario could obtain higher water and fertilizer productivity yield and positive farmland esv but this scenario might ignore the negative farmland esv reduction compared with the control scenario the compromise decision i e the i210n200 scenario could save approximately 53 of irrigation water and 41 of nitrogen fertilizer while the maximizing group utility decision i e the i210n260 scenario could save approximately 53 of irrigation water and 24 of nitrogen fertilizer fig 4 respectively 4 3 farmland ecosystem service value assessment in 2019 and 2020 the spring wheat farmland esvs in the upper yellow river basin under local irrigation and nitrogen application practices are shown in fig 5 the positive farmland esv included provisioning esv regulating esv and supporting esv and the value was 5 30 5 52 104 cny ha 1 the negative farmland esv was generated by crop water consumption ghg emissions and fertilizer loss and the value was 5 43 6 49 103 cny ha 1 thus the total farmland esv was 4 76 4 87 104 cny ha 1 obviously the spring wheat farmland ecosystem would cause approximately 0 11 cny ha 1 esv loss for every 1 cny ha 1 esv produced these results indicated that current irrigation and fertilization patterns might lead to the degradation of farmland ecosystem service functions among these positive farmland esvs provisioning esv had the largest proportion of 42 to the total positive esv with the value of 2 21 2 39 104 cny ha 1 owing to wheat grain and straw production these results indicated that the farmland ecosystem provides security for human and animal food needs furthermore regulating esv was 2 03 2 06 104 cny ha 1 which also had a higher proportion of 38 to the total positive esv the climate regulation value contributed the most to regulating esv followed by water conservation value for the climate regulating value the oxygen release value was the major component followed by carbon sequestration this finding occurred because the irrigation water and nitrogen fertilizer input rate in this region was high thereby resulting in great crop growth and high rates of oxygen release and carbon dioxide fixation chen et al 2022b the water conservation value indicated that the farmland ecosystem had a certain flood regulation capacity li et al 2015b the supporting esv i e the nutrient cycling value caused by plant nitrogen phosphorus and potassium uptake was also an important component and its value was 1 06 1 07 104 cny ha 1 accounting for 20 of the total positive esv these results indicated that the farmland ecosystem could both support crop production and promote soil fertility renewal although large amounts of irrigation water and nitrogen fertilizer has resulted in higher agricultural productivity in the upper yellow river basin it has caused a series of adverse resource and environmental problems due to water carbon and nitrogen losses li et al 2020b li et al 2022 which resulted in some negative farmland esvs for these negative esvs the ghg emission value was the major component accounting for 76 of the total negative esv with the value of 4 08 4 99 103 cny ha 1 in 2019 and 2020 even beyond the sum of the water consumption value 0 85 0 93 103 cny ha 1 and fertilizer loss value 0 50 0 57 103 cny ha 1 these results suggested that the negative impact of higher soil ghg emissions on climate change was the prime factor impeding the sustainable development of the rfe systems in this area in addition the negative fertilizer loss value and water consumption value indicated that local irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer input rate might be exceed the maximum demand for wheat plants and might result in a high soil inorganic nitrogen leaching and water resource waste increasing the risks of nonpoint source pollution and water resource shortage he et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 4 4 result analysis of different scenarios the wp pfpn yield and farmland esvs for the control scenario i210n200 scenario and i210n260 scenario are shown in figs 6 and 7 compared with the control scenario the i210n200 scenario i e the compromise decision increased the wp and pfpn by approximately 6 and 66 and decreased the negative esv by approximately 10 respectively while only caused slight losses in wheat yield provisioning esv regulating esv and supporting esv the reason for this result is that the control scenario i e 450 mm irrigation and 340 kg ha 1 nitrogen application might exceed the plant water and nitrogen demands additionally excessive irrigation might result in higher soil water percolation and evaporation and higher soil inorganic nitrogen leaching he et al 2016 li et al 2022 moreover higher irrigation water input could increase soil respiration i e co2 emissions by improving the activity of soil microbes and crop roots and increasing n2o emissions by improving the activity of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria bateman and baggs 2005 li et al 2020b thus the control scenario resulted in a lower wp and pfpn and a higher negative esv i e water consumption value fertilizer loss value and ghg emission value in the wheat farmland ecosystem in contrast appropriately reducing irrigation water and nitrogen application could effectively reduce soil water percolation and evaporation no3 n leaching goulding et al 2000 and ghg emissions li et al 2020b without significantly decreasing the soil available water and nitrogen content li et al 2022 thus an appropriate irrigation and nitrogen application strategy might not significantly decrease soil water retention crop root growth and nutrient uptake carbon sequestration and crop production that is also why the i210n200 scenario increased the water and nitrogen productivity and decreased the negative esv but only resulted in a slight reduction in wheat yield and positive esv the i210n260 scenario i e maximizing the group utility decision increased the nitrogen input by 60 kg ha 1 compared to the compromise decision therefore the wp yield provisioning esv regulating esv and supporting esv for the maximizing group utility decision were obviously higher than those of the compromise decision however the negative esv for the maximizing group utility decision was also higher than that of the compromise decision these findings are primarily because increasing nitrogen input could increase the soil available nitrogen content li et al 2022 higher soil available nitrogen could promote plants root development and improve root water and nutrient absorption liu et al 2017 liu et al 2018 thereby increasing crop water utilization biomass and grain production mon et al 2016 in addition higher soil available nitrogen could also promote crop leaf growth subsequently increasing leaf area and photosynthesis and ultimately increasing crop carbon sequestration and oxygen release li et al 2015b however compared with the compromise decision the maximizing group utility decision increased the nitrogen application rate by 10 while the yield increased by only 4 thus the pfpn was reduced the reason for this result may be that the increased nitrogen fertilizer produced a part of the nitrogen loss for example many studies have indicated that increasing nitrogen application could increase topsoil nh3 volatilization and n2o emissions by increasing their mineral nitrogen i e nh4 n and no3 n substrates of nitrification and denitrification li et al 2011 liu et al 2011 moreover adequate available nutrient supplies could promote crop root and soil microbial activity and respiration thereby increasing soil co2 emissions weintraub and schimel 2003 scheer et al 2008 that is also why the negative esv for the maximizing group utility decision was higher than that of the compromise decision these results indicated that in farmland ecosystems higher returns are often accompanied by higher environmental pollution risks therefore compared with the control scenario the maximizing group utility decision only resulted in a small negative esv mitigation but its advantage is that it increased wheat yield and positive esv by approximately 6 and 4 respectively in addition the maximizing group utility decision increased the wp and pfpn by approximately 10 and 34 compared to the control scenario respectively it can be summarized that under current irrigation and fertilization practices the wheat farmland ecosystem produced certain economic profits through food production water conservation climate regulation and nutrient cycling but also brought about relatively high economic losses risks of non point source pollution and water resources shortage due to ghg emissions fertilizer loss and water resources consumption compared with the control scenario the compromise decision and maximizing group utility decision both significantly saved irrigation water and nitrogen fertilizer resources improved water and n productivity however the former focused on obtaining a lower negative esv while the latter focused on obtaining a higher yield and positive esv these results indicated that the proposed process simulation based framework could balance well the conflicts among resource utilization food production and ecosystem development by optimizing fins 4 5 framework functional assessment sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis the model based framework shows its wide and reliable adaptability in this study we developed a process simulation based framework for agricultural rfe trade off by coupling the agro hydrological model ahc with the esv assessment method and vikor method similarly chen et al 2022a developed a hydrological model based framework for nonpoint source management zhu et al 2022 developed a hydrological model based framework for water environmental capacity management and yang et al 2012 developed a hydrological model based framework for water management under climate change and urbanization all these studies indicated that these hydrological model based frameworks have a wide range of applications and can obtain reasonable results in this work our framework also had excellent performance in optimizing fins for rfe trade off in addition for sustainable agricultural development yue et al 2021 also developed an integrated modeling framework for agricultural energy water food trade off and regional water resource allocation however their study did not assess the response of farmland esvs to water resource allocation and could not be used for fertilization management in contrast our framework was established based on an agricultural hydrological model that considered the effect of farmland hydrological process changes on farmland esvs and can be used for esv quantitative characterization rfe trade off and fins decisions however our framework cannot be used for regional scale rfe management which is still a disadvantage the reason for this result is that the ahc is a field scale numerical physical model it is worth noting that the gis ahc model had been developed and applied at the regional scale by coupling the ahc model with the gis software xu et al 2018 wang et al 2022 thus developing a gis ahc model based framework may be a good choice to achieve esv quantitative characterization rfe trade off and fins decisions at the irrigated district or watershed scale but this method still needs to be further explored and tested the model based framework is inevitably affected by some highly sensitive parameters clarifying these sensitive parameters can improve the working efficiency of the framework the 5 very important parameters included totp θs2 lb4 α1 fdlai and their sensitivity values exceed 3 1 fig 8 these parameters significantly affected the soil water dynamics no3 n transport and crop growth processes thus affecting the eta no3 n leaching and soil respiration the 14 important parameters mainly included soil hydraulic parameters of 0 50 cm soil layers such as n1 ks2 α2 θs1 ks1 and n2 followed by crop growth parameters and water stress parameters such as tba thu laimax h1 and h2u the values of these parameters were in the range of 1 1 2 8 the soil water dynamics root water extraction and crop production processes were significantly affected by these parameters and then the eta and root respiration also were affected the sensitivity value of some soil hydraulic parameters in 50 100 cm soil layers i e n3 n4 α4 and θs4 and a crop growth parameter i e rlad were in the range of 0 5 1 indicating that these parameters had a certain effect on soil water dynamics and crop growth processes in addition the no3 n dispersion lengths in upper soil layers i e lb1 lb2 lb3 had a slightly effect on soil no3 n dynamics however the sensitivity value of two nh4 n dispersion lengths in upper soil layers i e la1 and la2 and a water stress parameter i e h3h were the lowest indicating that the soil nh4 n dynamics and root water extraction had the lower sensitivity to these parameters these sensitive parameters of each process could be very useful to model calibration and framework application in addition to sensitive parameters of model the model based framework used in agriculture is also vulnerable to many external factors for example precise prediction of weather and groundwater conditions spatial heterogeneity of soil textures rationality of model parameters complicated and comprehensive agricultural management practices and designed scenarios are not able to fully capture actual situations in addition uncertainties exist in the agro selection of indicators and the determination of weights for the vikor method for example several esvs including waste disposal value clean air value landscape and cultural service values were usually overlooked due to the difficulty of accurate quantification generally different agricultural indicators and weights can generate different management strategies therefore the determined appropriate fins inevitably have certain uncertainties and thus should be adjusted accordingly in real practice 5 conclusion in this study a new process simulation based framework for rfe trade off was developed by coupling the ahc model with the esv assessment and vikor method the main contributions are 1 quantifying farmland water carbon nitrogen processes and esvs and 2 reconciling conflicts among resource utilization food production and ecosystem development by optimizing fins the proposed framework was applied to quantify the esvs and to obtain the appropriate decisions for ref trade off of the spring wheat farmland in northwest china several conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the ahc model performs well in simulating farmland water carbon nitrogen and crop growth processes in this area under local fins i e 450 mm irrigation and 340 kg ha 1 n application the total esv generated by spring wheat farmland per season was 4 76 4 87 104 cny ha 1 among these esvs every 1 cny ha 1 positive esv generation was accompanied by approximately 0 11 cny ha 1 negative esv in addition local fins also resulted in lower water and n productivity 2 compared with local fins the compromise decision with 210 mm irrigation and 200 kg ha 1 n application significantly reduced negative esv but caused slight losses in yield and positive esv while the maximizing group utility decision with 210 mm irrigation and 260 kg ha 1n application increased yield and positive esv but resulted in a small negative esv mitigation both the compromise decision and the maximizing group utility decision could save irrigation water and n fertilizer resources while increase water and n productivity to various degrees 3 the developed framework obtained acceptable results in assessing ecosystem service value and reconciling conflicts among resources food and ecology by optimizing farmland irrigation and fertilization strategies this framework has the potential to achieve sustainable development goals in agricultural resources food and ecological systems at the field scale however how to achieve resource food and ecology trade off and farmland irrigation and fertilization decisions at the irrigated

farmland irrigation and nitrogen n application strategies fins the framework was used to analyze the fins and then to obtain the compromise decision focusing on a lower negative esv and the maximizing group utility decision focusing on a higher yield and positive esv for spring wheat farmland in northwest china results indicated that under the local fins i e 450 mm irrigation and 340 kg ha 1 n application the total esv generated by spring wheat farmland per season was 4 76 4 87 104 cny ha 1 among these esvs every 1 cny ha 1 positive esv generation was accompanied by approximately 0 11 cny ha 1 negative esv compared with the local fins the compromise decision i e the fins with 210 mm irrigation and 200 kg ha 1n application significantly reduced negative esv but caused slight losses in yield and positive esv while the maximizing group utility decision i e the fins with 210 mm irrigation and 260 kg ha 1n application increased yield and positive esv but resulted in a small negative esv mitigation moreover both finss could save irrigation water and n fertilizer resources and improve water and n productivity to various degrees this framework has excellent performance in

introduction with rapid population growth and decreasing cultivated land area increasing food demand has become a significant challenge worldwide tilman et al 2011 in this context arid and semiarid regions have gradually become important crop production areas where many people engage in agriculture to meet their basic needs however agricultural production in these regions is restricted by water shortages and low soil fertility ren et al 2016 li et al 2020b thus large amounts of irrigation water and mineral nitrogen fertilizer have been applied to obtain high crop production in recent decades goulding et al 2000 riley et al 2001 burney et al 2010 such use inevitably results in high soil water carbon and nitrogen losses thereby resulting in water and nitrogen productivity reduction and functional degradation of agroecosystems zhang et al 2004 these then intensify the conflict among resource utilization food production and ecosystem development however effective farmland irrigation and nitrogen fertilization strategies fins should consider the coordinated sustainable development of resources food and ecology rfe systems thus a systematic approach is required to optimize the fins for rfe trade off in recent decades many field experiments have been conducted to propose the appropriate fins thereby balancing the conflict between crop yield and water and nitrogen productivity ju et al 2000 li et al 2015a for example the contradictions between wheat yield and water productivity and between wheat maize yield and nitrogen productivity were mediated by optimizing the irrigation regime jiang et al 2012 and optimizing the nitrogen application strategy liu et al 2017 however optimizing fins through field experiments is time consuming and expensive additionally due to the influence of climate soil and field management factors it is difficult to obtain general conclusions from field experiments many agro ecosystem simulation models e g rzwqm aquacrop dndc dssat swap daisy and hydrus have been gradually used to solve these problems liang et al 2014 for instance in order to obtain the optimal irrigation and or fertilization strategies for crop production and efficient utilization of water and or fertilizer the wheat and maize fields soil water and salt transportation were simulated with hydrus 1d pan et al 2017 the maize growth and nitrogen fates were simulated with the dndc model li et al 2020c and the soil water dynamics and wheat growth were simulated with the aquacrop model huang et al 2022 however to our knowledge these models have their own limitations due to the different focus of model functions for instance hydrus 1d does not consider the processes of crop growth dndc is relatively simple when considering crop growth and dssat is relatively simple when considering carbon nitrogen c n cycle processes liang et al 2014 thus many previous studies have mainly focused on simulations of soil water salt transport water crop growth and water salt crop growth and little attention has been given to the coupled simulation of farmland water carbon nitrogen and crop growth processes this also indicates that previous studies have not considered the farmland ecosystem service value esv loss caused by carbon and nitrogen losses such as co2 and n2o emissions nh3 volatilization and no3 n leaching when optimizing fins therefore conflicts among resource utilization food production and ecosystem development still exist however sustainable fins must meet current food demands while maintaining higher resource use efficiency and ecosystem stability xie et al 2017 in recent decades many studies have proposed different esv assessment methods to study the effects of human activities on ecosystems costanza et al 1997 xie et al 2017 although large scale esvs have been well evaluated xiao et al 2000 xie et al 2005 xie et al 2017 but the farmland esvs should be further quantified and studied due to that are strongly related to farmland ecosystem rfe management farmland ecosystems is significantly influenced by natural conditions and human activities that not only provide positive service function including food production water conservation carbon sequestration oxygen release and nutrient cycling carpenter et al 2009 xie et al 2017 but also cause greenhouse gas ghg emissions nh3 volatilization water consumption and inorganic nitrogen leaching thereby causing negative impacts on global climate change and surface and subsurface water environments bennett et al 2009 yue et al 2021 these negative effects usually lead to farmland ecosystem service function degradation and esv loss maintaining the stability of farmland ecosystem service function requires a detailed understanding of how ecosystems respond to different farmland management practices e g irrigation and nitrogen application and when the maximum esv is obtained therefore it is important to quantify the response of farmland esvs and to incorporate esvs into the decision making framework combining agro hydrological models with esv assessment methods may be a good choice for quantifying farmland esvs among many agro hydrological models ahc agro hydrological chemical and crop systems simulator has a relatively complete function which can accurately model farmland water salt carbon nitrogen and crop growth processes xu et al 2018 for instance the ahc model was tested by experimental data in wheat and maize farmland systems in the arid northwest china and the north china plain xu et al 2018 the modeling results indicated that the ahc model could model well the soil water salt dynamics water nitrogen dynamics and wheat and maize growth processes wang et al 2022 also simulated soil water and salt dynamics crops maize wheat sunflower and pepper growth processes and their yield with the ahc model in the arid hetao irrigation district therefore it is feasible to use the ahc model to simulate the farmland water carbon nitrogen dynamics and crop growth processes under different fins and then use the esv assessment method to calculate farmland esvs based on these simulation results on this basis the multicriteria decision method i e vikor can be used to optimize fins which can reconcile conflicts among resource utilization food production and ecosystem development however to our knowledge studies on process simulation based farmland esv quantification and rfe trade off approaches have not yet been reported additionally the vikor method is rarely used to determine fins therefore to fill these gaps identified above the main research objectives are 1 to propose a process simulation based framework for rfe trade off by coupling the ahc model with the esv assessment method and vikor method 2 to verify the framework s feasibility and practicality by a case study in the upper yellow river basin northwest china and 3 to quantify farmland esvs and to optimize the fins for rfe trade off in the study area 2 methodology 2 1 framework development the water carbon nitrogen process simulation based framework for rfe trade off was developed by combining the agro hydrological model i e ahc with the esv assessment method and decision making method i e vikor vlsekriterijuska optimizacija i komoromisno resenje a detailed description of the framework is shown in fig 1 based on the framework the farmland esvs can be assessed and the rfe systems can be traded off by optimizing fins for the target crop farmland ecosystem 1 calibration and validation of the ahc model with the measured spatial

and fertilization scenarios 4 the simulated water carbon nitrogen dynamics crop growth and yield datasets were used to calculate the decision indicators including water and nitrogen productivity and farmland esvs positive esv and negative esv as well as revealing the connections and synergies among multiple service values and 5 integrating water and nitrogen productivity yield and farmland esvs into a multicriteria decision method and calculating the benefit ratio value qi corresponding to the i th scenario under the conditions of decision coefficient v 0 5 and v 0 5 with eq 19a and then determining the appropriate fins for the target crop farmland ecosystem the fins with the smallest value of q 2 2 ahc model description the ahc is a one dimensional 1 d agro hydrological model developed by xu et al 2018 which was inherited and modified based on the swap and epic subsequently other modules were gradually developed to meet user application requirements thus far the soil water flow and solute transport mass transformation heat transfer and crop growth can be simulated by ahc the ahc uses the 1 d richards equation and convection dispersion equation to describe soil water flow and solute transport the first order reaction kinetics equation to describe soil c n turnover processes the 1 d convection diffusion equation to describe to describe soil heat transfer and the modified epic crop growth model to describe crop growth and development processes the related chain reactions such as root water extraction crop nitrogen uptake nitrogen leaching nitrification and denitrification nh3 volatilization and n2o emissions are considered as the source and sink terms xu et al 2018 the irrigation precipitation and soil evaporation to are used to determine the upper boundary condition the groundwater conditions are used to determine the lower boundary condition in addition ahc also considers the global sensitivity analysis gsa module based on the latin hypercube one factor at a time method lh oat xu et al 2016 the ahc had been described in more detail in our previous work xu et al 2016 xu et al 2018 wang et al 2022 soil water flow is commonly described using

related chain reactions such as crop nitrogen uptake nitrogen leaching nitrification and denitrification nh3 volatilization n2o emissions etc g cm 2 d 1 the c n turnover processes are described by the first order reaction kinetics equation the ahc divides organic matter into three main pools including dead soil organic matter som soil microbial biomass smb and added fresh organic matter aom then each of these main pools is subdivided into two subpools i e som1 som2 smb1 smb2 aom1 and aom2 among these subpools the aom1 smb1 and aom1 with a slow turnover rate the aom2 smb2 and aom2 with a fast turnover rate the turnover rates of som1 and som2 are calculated by eqs 3e and 3f reflecting the decomposition rate of soil organic matter the turnover rates of smb1 and smb2 are described by eqs 3c and 3d reflecting the soil microbial respiration and death rates the aom is the added organic fertilizer which is allocated to the subpools aom1 aom2 and som2 respectively the turnover rates of aom1

mechanistic model based on crop physiological and ecological processes that can simulate crop growth including biomass leaf area evapotranspiration nutrient uptake crop yield and environmental stress based on crop growth parameters and field management parameters the advantage of this model is that it does not consider microphysiological processes has fewer parameters and can simulate the growth processes of multiple crops at the same time overall the ahc model can be used to simulate farmland system water carbon nitrogen dynamics and crop growth processes 2 3 calculations 2 3 1 ecosystem service values the millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 divided ecosystem service functions into provisioning function regulating function supporting function and cultural services function xie et al 2017 divided farmland esvs into provisioning esv regulating esv habitat esv and cultural esv in this study farmland esvs were classified into positive esv and negative esv water consumption value fertilizer loss value and ghg emissions value based on the actual situation of the study area and previous studies xiao et al 2000 xie et al 2005 xie et al 2017 yue et al 2021 the positive esv included provisioning esv food production value and raw material production value regulating esv water conservation value and climate regulation value oxygen release value and carbon sequestration value and supporting esv nutrient cycling value the food production value and raw material production value were calculated by the market value method xie et al 2005 yue et al 2021 4 f e s v 1 y p y i

site is located in the arid upper yellow river basin 41 09 n 107 39 e northwest china with a semiarid temperate continental climate in the area annual precipitation varies between 50 and 240 mm annual sunshine varies between 3100 and 3300 h and annual mean temperature is approximately 6 8 c the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations in precipitation were in a range of 0 6 6 mg l 1 the groundwater depth varied between 0 9 and 3 m during the crop growing period the nh4 n concentration in the groundwater and irrigation water was in a range of 0 1 3 mg l 1 and the no3 n concentration was in a range of 1 20 mg l 1 the daily precipitation air temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation and groundwater depth during the simulation periods in 2019 and 2020 are shown in fig 2 according to the us textural classification 0 70 cm and 70 100 cm soils were defined as silt loam soil and loamy soil respectively shirazi and boersma 1984 detailed soil physicochemical properties in the test field including soil texture bulk density field capacity wilting point organic matter content and nh4 n and no3 n contents are presented in table 1 the meteorological and groundwater depth data were collected by the miniature weather station hobo u30 usa and the water level logger hobo u20 usa respectively the soil particle composition was analyzed by laser diffraction particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 uk li et al 2020a the soil field capacity and bulk density were measured by cutting ring method zou et al 2015 chai et al 2016 the soil wilting point were measured by biological method zou et al 2015 the soil organic matter was tested by the potassium dichromate volumetric external heating method li et al 2022 the nh4 n and no3 n contents in soil groundwater irrigation water and precipitation were measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometer uv 3100 china previous studies have reported that the irrigation depth exceeds 400 mm during the spring wheat growing season in this region zhang et al 2013 in addition the nitrogen fertilizer input exceeds 300 kg ha 1 per season was used to maintain high wheat yield this practice inevitably caused low water and nitrogen productivity high inorganic nitrogen leaching nh3 volatilization and ghg emissions zhang et al 2004 which threaten the sustainability of the agricultural rfe system in this area thus a field experiment under different irrigation and nitrogen application levels was conducted in 2019 and 2020 at the hetao experimental station of china agricultural university in this area to obtain experimental data three irrigation depth levels 450 mm i450 315 mm i315 and 180 mm i180 together with two nitrogen application levels 340 kg ha 1 n340 and 170 kg ha 1 n170 were implemented in 2019 and 2020 the experimental design was completely random with six irrigation and fertilization treatments i450n340 i315n340 i180n340 i450n170 i315n170 and i180n170 furthermore we also added a mild nitrogen application level i e 250 kg ha 1 n250 under the condition of the 315 mm irrigation depth i e i315n250 in 2020 each treatment included three complete replications in 2019 and 2020 the experiments included 18 and 21 plots 25 m 7 m respectively the i450n340 treatment was the control treatment and was consistent with local farming practices the specific irrigation and fertilization schedules of all treatments table s1 can be found in the supplementary material the main irrigation method in the study area is surface irrigation thus we hypothesized that the land utilization is not affected by canal irrigation and ground water irrigation in the upper yellow river basin spring wheat yongliang no 4 was seeded on 15 march in 2019 and 2020 and the planting density was approximately 6 030 000 plant hectare the spring wheat was harvested on 20 july in both years more detailed descriptions of irrigation fertilization and crop management can be found in li et al 2022 3 2 sample collection and measurement in 2019 and 2020 soil samples from each plot were collected from 0 to 100 cm soil depths 10 cm increments to a depth of 20 cm then 20 cm increments to a depth of 100 cm approximately every 10 days during the spring wheat growing season these soil samples were used to measure the soil water content and soil nh4 n and no3 n contents after each irrigation and precipitation event the inorganic nitrogen nh4 n and no3 n leaching from the 0 100 cm root zone soil was measured by the leakage bucket method li et al 2020a the detailed processes for measuring and calculating the soil water content soil nh4 n and no3 n contents and their leaching amounts can be found in li et al 2022 in addition during the spring wheat growing seasons the soil co2 and n2o emissions were collected using the static chamber method in a 10 day interval li et al 2020b additionally the sampling interval was shortened to 2 3 days after irrigation and topdressing at the jointing stage the soil nh3 volatilization was measured using the ventilation method li et al 2019b the sampling time of soil nh3 volatilization was consistent with the sampling time of soil co2 and n2o emissions the detailed processes for measuring and calculating the soil co2 n2o and nh3 fluxes can be found in li et al 2020b and li et al 2019b during the spring wheat growing seasons the wheat plants with a length of 2 m in each plot were cut off approximately every 10 days for plant height leaf area index lai and aboveground dry biomass determinations the height of wheat plants was measured using a tapeline all leaves of the wheat plants were cut down and then the length and width of each leaf were measured using a ruler the lai was calculated using eq 20 li 2015 after measurement of the plant height and lai all these plant organs were used to determine the aboveground dry biomass in addition one square meter of wheat plant was selected from each plot to evaluate the grain yield at harvest these wheat plants were not disturbed by sampling during the growing seasons the detailed processes for measuring the aboveground dry biomass and yield can be found in li et al 2022 the leaf area index can be calculated as li 2015 20 lai 0 721 p d lw l l d where lai is the wheat leaf area index pd is the wheat plant density plant ha 1 lw and ll are the width and length of wheat leaf respectively m and d is area m2 3 3 model setup calibration and validation the soil water flow and solute transport were calculated for soil layers from 0 to 300 cm the vertical 1 d soil profile was uniformly discretized into 301 nodes with 1 cm spacing and generalized to 4 layers based on the soil particle data of the test field table 1 ren et al 2016 the simulation period was from early march to late july including the entire growth season of spring wheat in this study region li et al 2022 for soil water flow the flux boundary and variable pressure water head boundary were selected as the upper boundary and lower boundary conditions respectively the upper boundary i e flux boundary was determined by the daily precipitation and irrigation and the daily actual evaporation the lower boundary i e variable pressure water head boundary was determined by the monitored daily groundwater depth for solute transport the concentration flux boundary was selected as the upper and lower boundary conditions which were determined by specifying the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations of precipitation irrigation water and groundwater the field test data including soil water nh4 n and no3 n contents were used to determine the initial conditions before running the simulation the soil hydraulic parameters solute nh4 n and no3 n transport parameters c n turnover parameters water stress parameters and crop growth parameters were initially specified according to studies by ren et al 2016 and xu et al 2018 after setting the initial value of the parameters 41 important parameters including soil hydraulic parameters solute dispersion lengths water stress parameters and crop growth parameters were selected for sensitivity analysis the definitions and ranges of these parameters can be found in tables2 of the supplemental material the parameters sensitivities to soil moisture and nitrogen dynamics soil co2 emissions eta lai aboveground dry biomass were analyzed based on the simulated and measured data the gsa module of ahc model was used to calculate the sensitivity values for these parameters and these highly sensitive parameters were presented in this study then the soil water contents soil nh4 n and no3 n contents soil co2 n2o and nh3 fluxes inorganic nitrogen leaching crop growth indicators plant height lai and aboveground dry biomass and grain yield obtained in 2019 and 2020 were used to calibrate and validate these parameters three indices including the normalized relative root mean error nrmse nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse and determination coefficient r2 were selected to evaluate model performance 3 4 scenario design and dataset establishment in this study twelve water saving scenarios and eleven nitrogen reduction scenarios i e 132 irrigation and nitrogen application combinations were designed based on local farmer irrigation and nitrogen application practices i e 450 mm irrigation and 340 kg ha 1 nitrogen application and previous related studies by dong et al 2011 and li et al 2015a the irrigation depth was reduced at 30 mm intervals from 450 mm to 120 mm the nitrogen application rate was reduced at 20 kg ha 1 from 340 kg ha 1 to 140 kg ha 1 the dates and proportions of each irrigation and fertilization event were consistent with the local practices table s1 the specific scenario combinations are shown in table 2 the calibrated and validated ahc model was used to simulate the soil water nh4 n and no3 n contents inorganic nitrogen leaching soil co2 n2o and nh3 fluxes aboveground dry biomass and yield of different irrigation and fertilization scenarios in the current year 2019 and 2020 based on these simulation results the datasets including wheat yield water and nitrogen productivity positive esv and negative esv were established using eqs 4 16 4 results and discussion 4 1 model performance evaluation the parameters of the ahc model were calibrated by the datasets with all treatments obtained in 2019 and were validated by the datasets with all treatments obtained in 2020 in this study the simulated values and measured values of soil water nh4 n and no3 n dynamics soil co2 and n2o emissions nh3 volatilization lai plant height and aboveground dry biomass are shown in figs s1 s5 the goodness of fit indicators during the calibration and validation periods are shown in table s3 in addition the simulated values and measured values of inorganic nitrogen leaching and yield and their goodness of fit indicators are shown in fig s6 the calibrated values of soil hydraulic parameters c n turnover parameters water stress parameters and wheat growth parameters are shown in tables 3 5 figs s1 s6 and table s3 can be found in the supplementary material the simulated soil water content showed a fine agreement with their measured values for different soil layers during the spring wheat seasons fig s1 in the calibration period the values of nrmse nse and r2 for the soil water content of all treatments were in a range of 0 11 0 13 0 45 0 67 and 0 85 0 92 respectively and these values were in a range of 0 13 0 17 0 31 0 51 and 0 72 0 85 in the validation period table s3 the soil water dynamics simulated by the ahc were similar to those simulated by hydrus 1d in pan et al 2017 for soil nitrogen dynamic simulation the ahc accurately captured the observed soil nh4 n and no3 n dynamics figs s2 and s3 in particular the soil nh4 n and no3 n variations were relatively dramatic in the 0 25 cm soil layer and were also described well using the ahc furthermore these simulation results of soil nh4 n and no3 n dynamics obtained by the ahc were better than those of meier et al 2006 and liang et al 2014 who used the apsim and rzwqm models respectively the goodness of fit indicators i e the values of nrmse nse and r2 for the soil nh4 n and no3 n during the calibration and validation periods were within the range of acceptable values table s3 cameira et al 2007 wang and huang 2008 in addition the simulated soil inorganic nitrogen leaching also fit well with the measured values during the growth seasons especially in the calibration period fig s6 the nrmse nse and r2 values for inorganic nitrogen leaching were 0 09 0 57 and 0 92 respectively for the soil co2 and n2o emissions the ahc model also reasonably captured the variation trend of their observed values during the spring wheat growing seasons fig s4 although the fitting accuracy of soil co2 and n2o emissions was lower than that of soil moisture variations the simulated soil co2 and n2o emission variations using the ahc were better than those using the dndc zimmermann et al 2018 cui and wang 2019 for soil nh3 volatilization we found that the simulated soil nh3 volatilization peaks using the ahc were slightly higher than the measured soil nh3 volatilization peaks based on the field trial but the variation trend of observed soil nh3 volatilization could be captured by the ahc fig s4 there are two probable explanations for this result on the one hand the surface broadcast of urea increased the uncertainty in soil nh3 volatilization observations xu et al 2018 on the other hand it was relatively difficult to accurately observe the soil nh3 volatilization peaks because the main process of nh3 volatilization after each irrigation rainfall and fertilization event was usually completed in a short time lei et al 2009 the same problem also existed in an earlier study by li et al 2019a who simulated the soil nh3 volatilization fluxes from maize and wheat farmland with the dndc model for crop growth the simulated lai plant height and aboveground dry biomass all showed a fine agreement with their measured values during the spring wheat seasons fig s5 the values of nrmse nse and r2 for lai plant height and aboveground dry biomass obtained with the ahc in the two years during the calibration and validation periods are shown in table s3 these indicators were all within reasonable ranges xu et al 2018 wang et al 2022 moreover these simulated wheat growth indicators using the ahc were quite close to those simulated by apsim and aquacrop in zhang et al 2012 and huang et al 2022 respectively moreover the wheat yield simulated by the ahc also fit well with the observed values in the two seasons fig s6 in the calibration period the nrmse nse and r2 values for the yield of all treatments were 0 03 0 89 and 0 98 respectively and these values were 0 04 0 79 and 0 96 in the validation period overall the ahc model had excellent performance in simulating farmland water carbon nitrogen dynamics and crop growth processes in arid northwest china 4 2 farmland irrigation and fertilization decisions the wheat yield water and nitrogen productivity farmland positive esv and negative esv figs s7 and s8 were taken as the decision indicators of the vikor method to calculate the benefit ratio value q corresponding to each scenario under the conditions of the compromise decision v 0 5 focusing on a lower negative esv and the maximizing the group utility decision v 0 9 focusing on a higher yield and positive esv figs s7 and s8 can be found in the supplementary material the benefit ratio q corresponding to each irrigation and nitrogen application scenario is shown in fig 3 the q value was significantly affected by irrigation depth and nitrogen application in 2019 and 2020 for all decision coefficients the q value first decreased and then increased as the irrigation depth decreased from 450 mm to 120 mm the lowest q value was obtained when irrigation was 210 mm regardless of the decision coefficient v in 2019 and 2020 in addition the effect of nitrogen application on the q value was consistent with that of irrigation on the q value the q value first decreased and then increased as the nitrogen application decreased from 340 kg ha 1 to 140 kg ha 1 however the nitrogen application corresponding to the lowest q value differed under different decision coefficients in 2019 and 2020 the 200 kg ha 1 nitrogen application obtained the lowest q value when v was 0 5 while the 260 kg ha 1 nitrogen application obtained the lowest q value when v was 0 9 therefore in 2019 and 2020 the fins for compromise decision was 210 mm irrigation and 200 kg n ha 1 nitrogen application i210n200 fig 4 suggesting that the i210n200 scenario could significantly reduce the negative farmland esv but it might cause yield and positive farmland esv losses in addition the fins for maximizing the group utility decision was 210 mm irrigation and 260 kg n ha 1 nitrogen application i210n260 suggesting that the i210n260 scenario could obtain higher water and fertilizer productivity yield and positive farmland esv but this scenario might ignore the negative farmland esv reduction compared with the control scenario the compromise decision i e the i210n200 scenario could save approximately 53 of irrigation water and 41 of nitrogen fertilizer while the maximizing group utility decision i e the i210n260 scenario could save approximately 53 of irrigation water and 24 of nitrogen fertilizer fig 4 respectively 4 3 farmland ecosystem service value assessment in 2019 and 2020 the spring wheat farmland esvs in the upper yellow river basin under local irrigation and nitrogen application practices are shown in fig 5 the positive farmland esv included provisioning esv regulating esv and supporting esv and the value was 5 30 5 52 104 cny ha 1 the negative farmland esv was generated by crop water consumption ghg emissions and fertilizer loss and the value was 5 43 6 49 103 cny ha 1 thus the total farmland esv was 4 76 4 87 104 cny ha 1 obviously the spring wheat farmland ecosystem would cause approximately 0 11 cny ha 1 esv loss for every 1 cny ha 1 esv produced these results indicated that current irrigation and fertilization patterns might lead to the degradation of farmland ecosystem service functions among these positive farmland esvs provisioning esv had the largest proportion of 42 to the total positive esv with the value of 2 21 2 39 104 cny ha 1 owing to wheat grain and straw production these results indicated that the farmland ecosystem provides security for human and animal food needs furthermore regulating esv was 2 03 2 06 104 cny ha 1 which also had a higher proportion of 38 to the total positive esv the climate regulation value contributed the most to regulating esv followed by water conservation value for the climate regulating value the oxygen release value was the major component followed by carbon sequestration this finding occurred because the irrigation water and nitrogen fertilizer input rate in this region was high thereby resulting in great crop growth and high rates of oxygen release and carbon dioxide fixation chen et al 2022b the water conservation value indicated that the farmland ecosystem had a certain flood regulation capacity li et al 2015b the supporting esv i e the nutrient cycling value caused by plant nitrogen phosphorus and potassium uptake was also an important component and its value was 1 06 1 07 104 cny ha 1 accounting for 20 of the total positive esv these results indicated that the farmland ecosystem could both support crop production and promote soil fertility renewal although large amounts of irrigation water and nitrogen fertilizer has resulted in higher agricultural productivity in the upper yellow river basin it has caused a series of adverse resource and environmental problems due to water carbon and nitrogen losses li et al 2020b li et al 2022 which resulted in some negative farmland esvs for these negative esvs the ghg emission value was the major component accounting for 76 of the total negative esv with the value of 4 08 4 99 103 cny ha 1 in 2019 and 2020 even beyond the sum of the water consumption value 0 85 0 93 103 cny ha 1 and fertilizer loss value 0 50 0 57 103 cny ha 1 these results suggested that the negative impact of higher soil ghg emissions on climate change was the prime factor impeding the sustainable development of the rfe systems in this area in addition the negative fertilizer loss value and water consumption value indicated that local irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer input rate might be exceed the maximum demand for wheat plants and might result in a high soil inorganic nitrogen leaching and water resource waste increasing the risks of nonpoint source pollution and water resource shortage he et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 4 4 result analysis of different scenarios the wp pfpn yield and farmland esvs for the control scenario i210n200 scenario and i210n260 scenario are shown in figs 6 and 7 compared with the control scenario the i210n200 scenario i e the compromise decision increased the wp and pfpn by approximately 6 and 66 and decreased the negative esv by approximately 10 respectively while only caused slight losses in wheat yield provisioning esv regulating esv and supporting esv the reason for this result is that the control scenario i e 450 mm irrigation and 340 kg ha 1 nitrogen application might exceed the plant water and nitrogen demands additionally excessive irrigation might result in higher soil water percolation and evaporation and higher soil inorganic nitrogen leaching he et al 2016 li et al 2022 moreover higher irrigation water input could increase soil respiration i e co2 emissions by improving the activity of soil microbes and crop roots and increasing n2o emissions by improving the activity of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria bateman and baggs 2005 li et al 2020b thus the control scenario resulted in a lower wp and pfpn and a higher negative esv i e water consumption value fertilizer loss value and ghg emission value in the wheat farmland ecosystem in contrast appropriately reducing irrigation water and nitrogen application could effectively reduce soil water percolation and evaporation no3 n leaching goulding et al 2000 and ghg emissions li et al 2020b without significantly decreasing the soil available water and nitrogen content li et al 2022 thus an appropriate irrigation and nitrogen application strategy might not significantly decrease soil water retention crop root growth and nutrient uptake carbon sequestration and crop production that is also why the i210n200 scenario increased the water and nitrogen productivity and decreased the negative esv but only resulted in a slight reduction in wheat yield and positive esv the i210n260 scenario i e maximizing the group utility decision increased the nitrogen input by 60 kg ha 1 compared to the compromise decision therefore the wp yield provisioning esv regulating esv and supporting esv for the maximizing group utility decision were obviously higher than those of the compromise decision however the negative esv for the maximizing group utility decision was also higher than that of the compromise decision these findings are primarily because increasing nitrogen input could increase the soil available nitrogen content li et al 2022 higher soil available nitrogen could promote plants root development and improve root water and nutrient absorption liu et al 2017 liu et al 2018 thereby increasing crop water utilization biomass and grain production mon et al 2016 in addition higher soil available nitrogen could also promote crop leaf growth subsequently increasing leaf area and photosynthesis and ultimately increasing crop carbon sequestration and oxygen release li et al 2015b however compared with the compromise decision the maximizing group utility decision increased the nitrogen application rate by 10 while the yield increased by only 4 thus the pfpn was reduced the reason for this result may be that the increased nitrogen fertilizer produced a part of the nitrogen loss for example many studies have indicated that increasing nitrogen application could increase topsoil nh3 volatilization and n2o emissions by increasing their mineral nitrogen i e nh4 n and no3 n substrates of nitrification and denitrification li et al 2011 liu et al 2011 moreover adequate available nutrient supplies could promote crop root and soil microbial activity and respiration thereby increasing soil co2 emissions weintraub and schimel 2003 scheer et al 2008 that is also why the negative esv for the maximizing group utility decision was higher than that of the compromise decision these results indicated that in farmland ecosystems higher returns are often accompanied by higher environmental pollution risks therefore compared with the control scenario the maximizing group utility decision only resulted in a small negative esv mitigation but its advantage is that it increased wheat yield and positive esv by approximately 6 and 4 respectively in addition the maximizing group utility decision increased the wp and pfpn by approximately 10 and 34 compared to the control scenario respectively it can be summarized that under current irrigation and fertilization practices the wheat farmland ecosystem produced certain economic profits through food production water conservation climate regulation and nutrient cycling but also brought about relatively high economic losses risks of non point source pollution and water resources shortage due to ghg emissions fertilizer loss and water resources consumption compared with the control scenario the compromise decision and maximizing group utility decision both significantly saved irrigation water and nitrogen fertilizer resources improved water and n productivity however the former focused on obtaining a lower negative esv while the latter focused on obtaining a higher yield and positive esv these results indicated that the proposed process simulation based framework could balance well the conflicts among resource utilization food production and ecosystem development by optimizing fins 4 5 framework functional assessment sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis the model based framework shows its wide and reliable adaptability in this study we developed a process simulation based framework for agricultural rfe trade off by coupling the agro hydrological model ahc with the esv assessment method and vikor method similarly chen et al 2022a developed a hydrological model based framework for nonpoint source management zhu et al 2022 developed a hydrological model based framework for water environmental capacity management and yang et al 2012 developed a hydrological model based framework for water management under climate change and urbanization all these studies indicated that these hydrological model based frameworks have a wide range of applications and can obtain reasonable results in this work our framework also had excellent performance in optimizing fins for rfe trade off in addition for sustainable agricultural development yue et al 2021 also developed an integrated modeling framework for agricultural energy water food trade off and regional water resource allocation however their study did not assess the response of farmland esvs to water resource allocation and could not be used for fertilization management in contrast our framework was established based on an agricultural hydrological model that considered the effect of farmland hydrological process changes on farmland esvs and can be used for esv quantitative characterization rfe trade off and fins decisions however our framework cannot be used for regional scale rfe management which is still a disadvantage the reason for this result is that the ahc is a field scale numerical physical model it is worth noting that the gis ahc model had been developed and applied at the regional scale by coupling the ahc model with the gis software xu et al 2018 wang et al 2022 thus developing a gis ahc model based framework may be a good choice to achieve esv quantitative characterization rfe trade off and fins decisions at the irrigated district or watershed scale but this method still needs to be further explored and tested the model based framework is inevitably affected by some highly sensitive parameters clarifying these sensitive parameters can improve the working efficiency of the framework the 5 very important parameters included totp θs2 lb4 α1 fdlai and their sensitivity values exceed 3 1 fig 8 these parameters significantly affected the soil water dynamics no3 n transport and crop growth processes thus affecting the eta no3 n leaching and soil respiration the 14 important parameters mainly included soil hydraulic parameters of 0 50 cm soil layers such as n1 ks2 α2 θs1 ks1 and n2 followed by crop growth parameters and water stress parameters such as tba thu laimax h1 and h2u the values of these parameters were in the range of 1 1 2 8 the soil water dynamics root water extraction and crop production processes were significantly affected by these parameters and then the eta and root respiration also were affected the sensitivity value of some soil hydraulic parameters in 50 100 cm soil layers i e n3 n4 α4 and θs4 and a crop growth parameter i e rlad were in the range of 0 5 1 indicating that these parameters had a certain effect on soil water dynamics and crop growth processes in addition the no3 n dispersion lengths in upper soil layers i e lb1 lb2 lb3 had a slightly effect on soil no3 n dynamics however the sensitivity value of two nh4 n dispersion lengths in upper soil layers i e la1 and la2 and a water stress parameter i e h3h were the lowest indicating that the soil nh4 n dynamics and root water extraction had the lower sensitivity to these parameters these sensitive parameters of each process could be very useful to model calibration and framework application in addition to sensitive parameters of model the model based framework used in agriculture is also vulnerable to many external factors for example precise prediction of weather and groundwater conditions spatial heterogeneity of soil textures rationality of model parameters complicated and comprehensive agricultural management practices and designed scenarios are not able to fully capture actual situations in addition uncertainties exist in the agro selection of indicators and the determination of weights for the vikor method for example several esvs including waste disposal value clean air value landscape and cultural service values were usually overlooked due to the difficulty of accurate quantification generally different agricultural indicators and weights can generate different management strategies therefore the determined appropriate fins inevitably have certain uncertainties and thus should be adjusted accordingly in real practice 5 conclusion in this study a new process simulation based framework for rfe trade off was developed by coupling the ahc model with the esv assessment and vikor method the main contributions are 1 quantifying farmland water carbon nitrogen processes and esvs and 2 reconciling conflicts among resource utilization food production and ecosystem development by optimizing fins the proposed framework was applied to quantify the esvs and to obtain the appropriate decisions for ref trade off of the spring wheat farmland in northwest china several conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the ahc model performs well in simulating farmland water carbon nitrogen and crop growth processes in this area under local fins i e 450 mm irrigation and 340 kg ha 1 n application the total esv generated by spring wheat farmland per season was 4 76 4 87 104 cny ha 1 among these esvs every 1 cny ha 1 positive esv generation was accompanied by approximately 0 11 cny ha 1 negative esv in addition local fins also resulted in lower water and n productivity 2 compared with local fins the compromise decision with 210 mm irrigation and 200 kg ha 1 n application significantly reduced negative esv but caused slight losses in yield and positive esv while the maximizing group utility decision with 210 mm irrigation and 260 kg ha 1n application increased yield and positive esv but resulted in a small negative esv mitigation both the compromise decision and the maximizing group utility decision could save irrigation water and n fertilizer resources while increase water and n productivity to various degrees 3 the developed framework obtained acceptable results in assessing ecosystem service value and reconciling conflicts among resources food and ecology by optimizing farmland irrigation and fertilization strategies this framework has the potential to achieve sustainable development goals in agricultural resources food and ecological systems at the field scale however how to achieve resource food and ecology trade off and farmland irrigation and fertilization decisions at the irrigated district or watershed scale still needs to be further explored and studied credit authorship contribution statement yue li investigation formal analysis writing original draft writing review editing

2422,hydraulic tomography ht is a well established approach to yield the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity of an aquifer this work explores the potential of ht for the characterization of the distribution and connectivity of conduits in a two dimensional sandbox and its corresponding synthetic aquifer two inversion techniques were implemented and compared the geostatistics based inversion which uses the simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle algorithm to conduct stochastic inversions on the transient hydraulic heads and the travel time based inversion which employs the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique sirt algorithm on the hydraulic travel times for tomography reconstructions four artificial karst conduits of different geometries were placed in an aquifer of layer with different hydraulic conductivities we conducted 6 pumping tests at 6 different locations and the resultant pressure responses were recorded at 42 observation points in both the sandbox and the corresponding synthetic aquifer the measured data were then used for the inversion of hydraulic diffusivity using the simsle and sirt algorithms our results show that both algorithms were able to approximately identify the embedded karst conduits and yield similar hydraulic diffusivity distribution statistically the travel time based inversion re constructed high contrast diffusivities which clearly differentiate the karst structures from the surrounding matrix the geostatistics based simsle algorithm yields a better agreement on the positions and the shapes of the embedded karst structures compared to those obtained by the travel time based sirt algorithm uncertainties and limitations of our results are also discussed in this work followed by recommendations on hydraulic tests in karst aquifers keywords hydraulic tomography karst aquifer heterogeneity laboratory sandbox inverse modeling hydraulic travel time data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction karst water resources play an important role in the water supply for industrial agricultural and domestic water use ford and williams 2013 due to the complex development processes superposition of geological tectonic movement surface water dissolution and groundwater movement karst aquifers are highly heterogeneous scanlon et al 2003 xu et al 2022a b conduits in karst aquifers strongly affect the distribution of groundwater contaminants and mineral resources worldwide a large number of underground projects is built in karst areas illman et al 2009 mao et al 2018 dong et al 2020 these projects are often engaged with groundwater seepage of various degrees such as water inrush accidents in tunnels and coalmine xu et al 2021 in the past few decades extensive studies have been conducted to characterize karst conduits and to capture detailed and reliable information on the heterogeneity of karst aquifers abusaada and sauter 2013 mohammadi and illman 2019 knowledge about the spatial distribution of hydraulic parameters facilitates identification of structural characteristics of karst aquifers when analyzing geotechnical and hydrogeological problems wang et al 2016 2017 in general hydraulic properties can be estimated by performing conventional hydraulic tests e g flow through experiments on core samples and slug pumping tests in the field berg and illman 2011 typical single well hydraulic tests yield point wise hydraulic parameters over a control volume of interest without further upgrade on the measurement scale these point wise data are typically insufficient to describe heterogeneity of karst aquifers and to map geometric characteristics of conduit networks on the other hand although geophysical tomography methods such as electrical tomography cross well radar and seismic tomography liu et al 2018 torrese 2020 are often applied to obtain structural characterizations of aquifers the obtained geophysical parameters are usually difficult to be converted into hydraulic parameters hu et al 2017 in addition relations between geophysical and hydrogeological parameters are site specific and not easy to be generalized hyndman and tronicke 2005 therefore a more reliable manner is demanded to characterize the hydrological characteristics of karst aquifers in the past two decades several research groups have been working on the development of the so called hydraulic tomography ht techniques which have been demonstrated to be a cost effective tool for characterizing the heterogeneity of porous aquifers at high spatial resolutions e g yeh and liu 2000 brauchler et al 2003 ht employs a series of sequential cross hole pumping or injection tests and inversely solves the groundwater flow equation with the collected hydraulic head responses to determine the spatial distribution of aquifer hydraulic parameters when performing ht analysis multiple wells are needed to be installed at different locations and hydraulic head perturbations are induced by water injection or withdraw at selected wells while the hydraulic head responses are monitored in the observation wells hydraulic head perturbations are often repeated multiple times with different well combinations to obtain sufficient but not redundant hydraulic head responses during ht analysis one set of head responses presents one snapshot of the aquifer heterogeneity sampled at a perspective angle ht analysis thus simultaneously utilizes all snapshots to realistically and reliably map the aquifer heterogeneity yeh and liu 2000 brauchler et al 2003 zhu and yeh 2005 multiple sets of hydraulic head responses are usually obtained using cross hole pumping or injection tests by interpreting the head responses and assessing the associated uncertainties different kinds of ht inversion schemes have been reported in literature to determine the spatial distribution of hydraulic parameters these inverse methods include general geostatistical inverse methods yeh and liu 2000 zhu and yeh 2005 li and cirpka 2006 klein et al 2017 schwede et al 2014 cardiff et al 2009 2013 mao et al 2013a 2013b zhao et al 2015 zhao and illman 2018 li et al 2021 travel time based inverse methods brauchler et al 2003 2010 2013 vasco et al 2019 pilot point based approaches lavenue and de marsily 2001 castagna et al 2011 sparse nonlinear optimizer and stochastic newton approach wang et al 2016 2017 cellular automata based approaches fischer et al 2017a b and discrete network deterministic inversion method fischer et al 2018 2020 in this study we focus on the geostatistics based and travel time based inversion methods of ht the geostatistics based inversion used in this work is a geostatistical procedure originated from the work of yeh et al 1996 it relies on a so called successive linear estimator sle which was derived from the iterative co kriging technique the hydraulic parameter field is computed as a spatial stochastic process although the kriging method assumes a linear relationship between the hydraulic head and the hydraulic conductivity the nonlinearity in the relationship is managed using an iteratively updating approach in the sle algorithm it continuously matches the observed heads with the simulated heads at different observation times and updates the conditional mean and covariance of the estimated hydraulic parameters to improve the estimation accuracy and to reconstruct an average hydraulic parameter distribution yeh and liu 2000 zhu and yeh 2005 on the other hand the travel time based inversion scheme follows the procedure of seismic tomography in seismic tomography the travel time of seismic waves between a source and a receiver can be described as a staright and or curved line integral that relates the travel time to the velocity field of seismic waves similar to seismic tomography in the travel time based ht the line integral relates the square root of the peak arrival time of a transient pressure signal to the inverse square root of hydraulic diffusivity brauchler et al 2003 this line integral can be derived by transforming the transient groundwater flow equation into the so called eikonal equation utilizing an asymptotic approach which can be solved with ray tracing or particle tracking methods brauchler et al 2013 vasco et al 2019 up to date these two aforementioned inversion schemes have been successfully tested for porous and fractured media in synthetic inversion of single or multiphase flow yin and illman 2009 berg and illman 2012 hu et al 2015 and laboratory experiments brauchler et al 2003 illman et al 2007 2008 as well as field assessments illman et al 2009 brauchler et al 2011 paradis et al 2016 zha et al 2015 zhao and illman 2018 mao et al 2018 thus ht may provide a viable and feasible solution to characterize the spatially distributed hydraulic properties of conduits in heterogeneous karst aquifers and the use of ht for characterizing karst aquifers is becoming a new and challenging research topic fischer et al 2018 mohammadi and illman 2019 using physical groundwater models is a common approach for reconstructing the hydrogeological conditions and predicting the hydraulic response of an aquifer different laboratory models such as sandbox models and conduit matrix coupling models have been popular in studying groundwater flow and solute transport in karst aquifers mohammadi et al 2021 sandbox models of high contrast hydraulic conductivity field could be comparable to natural karst aquifers for example xiao et al 2018 and mohammadi et al 2019 employed the conduit matrix coupling models to simulate groundwater flow in karst aquifers conduits are usually assumed to be active inside of the porous matrix which can be composed of sand castro 2017 xiao et al 2018 beads faulkner et al 2009 and bentonite mixed sand mohammadi et al 2019 in this work we report on a comparative study on tomographic imaging of a quasi two dimensional 2d heterogeneous sandbox aquifer and its corresponding synthetic aquifer with karst conduits using two types of ht inversion techniques namely the geostatistics based and travel time based inversions the main objective of this study is to examine the capability of these two inversion algorithms using physically measured and numerically simulated hydraulic heads in the following we first describe our physical experiments on the sandbox karst aquifer and numerical simulations on the synthetic karst aquifers we then introduce the two ht techniques and their inverse models i e the geostatistics based simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle algorithm and the travel time based simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique sirt algorithm finally we compare the obtained hydraulic diffusivity and discuss the corresponding uncertainties and limitations 2 karst aquifers 2 1 physical karst aquifer in a sandbox in this study a quasi 2d synthetic karst aquifer was constructed in a vertical sandbox to evaluate the performance of two ht inversion techniques fig 1 a illustrates the sandbox with two water storage tanks on its left and right sides the sandbox dimensions are 120 0 cm in length 75 0 cm in height and 10 0 cm in width cross section while the dimensions of each storage tank are 10 0 cm in length 75 5 cm in height and 10 0 cm in width the storage tanks were used to keep constant hydraulic head at the top left and right boundaries during the experiments the sandbox is made of polymethyl methacrylate with the support of a stainless steel frame in the front panel of the sandbox 42 cylindrical ports 1 2 cm in diameter were implemented to accommodate pressure measurements and pumping operations fig 1a each port was equipped with a well which is perpendicular to the sandbox front back panels and fully penetrates the aquifer width i e 10 cm these wells were made of polymethyl methacrylate tubes each perforated with 10 holes of roughly equal distances of a 0 6 cm diameter each well was wrapped with a screen of stainless steel using corrosion resistant epoxy these screens prevented the entering of sand particles into the wells wells were connected to either pressure transducers or peristaltic pumps through a silicone hose when they served as observation or pumping wells respectively in this study out of the 42 horizontal wells only several of them were selected as pumping wells the used peristaltic pump had a maximum pumping rate of 0 3 l min according to previous studies liu et al 2007 illman et al 2010 berg and illman 2012 zhao et al 2016 and the dimensions of our sandbox aquifer we used a moderate pumping rate between 0 15 and 0 216 l min to avoid weak pressure changes below the detection limit and to prevent fast and significant pressure changes which could disrupt the upper boundary condition of the sandbox due to an insufficient communication between the storage tanks and the sand aquifer liu et al 2002 the flow system of sandbox consisted of two water storage tanks two overflow tanks and hoses one storage tank and one overflow water tank located on the left side of the sandbox constituting a left water reservoir the other storage tank and overflow water tank located on the right side of the sandbox constituting a right water reservoir these two reservoirs maintained constant head boundaries on the left and right boundaries of the sandbox in addition the third constant head boundary was maintained by ponding water on the top of the sandbox the bottom boundary of sandbox was set to a no flow boundary it has been demonstrated that the stability of the boundary conditions is crucial for head records in the forward modeling of pumping tests in laboratory liu et al 2007 we installed two perforated plate with a length of 75 0 cm and a width of 10 0 cm between the sand body and the water storage tanks on both sides of the sandbox to provide stable hydraulic controls these plates separated the sandy aquifer from two storage tanks preventing the entering of sand particles into the storage tanks in summary the flow system can be conveniently imposed various constant heads to generate a desired hydraulic gradient for our experiments the data acquisition system consisted of 42 pressure transducers cfsensor xgzp and a data logger siemens s7 200smart the acquisition system can automatically acquire transient hydraulic heads at the ports fig 1a shows the 42 ports wells and pressure transducers locations on the sandbox we manually constructed the karst aquifer such that we can easily control the heterogeneity pattern in the sandbox however one drawback of this manual packing approach is that the heterogeneity of the constructed aquifer is not the same as the natural sedimentary aquifer formed by natural deposition processes to mimic the natural deposition processes as much as possible silica sand from sibelco corporation grains were slowly added into the sandbox to create depositional layers uniform compaction of each layer was achieved to its greatest extent meanwhile the sandbox was slowly filled with water from its bottom so that air can be gradually displaced sequentially the water filled sandbox was at rest for one week to remove the potential residual gas to achieve a full saturation to control the heterogeneity of sand layers sand grains were sieved using variable sieve sizes 20 30 30 50 50 50 60 50 65 60 80 65 80 80 80 100 100 100 120 120 150 and 150 the grain size characteristics table s1 show that each category of sand was well sorted denoted by its d10 ranging between 0 086 mm and 0 61 mm here d10 defines the diameter of sand grains corresponding to 10 cumulative from 0 to 100 undersize grain size distribution the hydraulic conductivity k of each sand layer was estimated with its d10 value using the hazen model hazen 1892 and the kozeny carman model chapuis and aubertin 2003 which yielded a k range of 7 40 10 3 to 3 66 10 1 cm s and of 5 10 10 3 to 2 54 10 1 cm s respectively table s1 these sand layers established a heterogeneous matrix for the synthetic karst aquifer four types of conduits were embedded in the layered sandy aquifer to accommodate heterogeneous karst structures including an ordinary conduit a an auxiliary side conduit b a pool c and a waterfall d as shown in fig 1 these conduits present the common karst structures of immobile flow regions and ramiform auxiliary channels hauns et al 2001 morales et al 2010 field and leij 2012 for simplicity all conduits are rectangular geometry structures which were bonded using polymethyl methacrylate plates their detailed dimensions are shown in figure s1 where their widths in the third dimension are 6 cm along their longitudinal direction i e parallel to the top and bottom boundaries of the sandbox holes of 0 6 cm in diameter were drilled with 1 cm apart along the conduits each conduit was wrapped with a screen of stainless steel using corrosion resistant epoxy with the current geometry dimensions conduits are expected to retain much higher hydraulic conductivities compared to the surrounding sand layers the large contrast in k between conduits 103 cm s and sand layers 10 3 10 1 cm s is intent to simulate the high k contrast in natural karst aquifers tables s1 and s2 fig 1a shows the overview of the heterogeneous karst aquifer in the sandbox including 18 homogeneous sand layers indicated by solid black lines and 4 karst conduits outlined by solid red lines our 2d karst aquifer was designed by following two dimensional sandboxes reported in literature e g liu et al 2007 illman et al 2010 and berg and illman 2011 during the experiments due to the much higher k of conduits water is expected to preferably flow through conduits instead of the sand layers in the front of and behind of conduits even though the thickness of conduits is slightly smaller than that of the sandbox therefore we could treat the sandbox with conduits as a quasi 2d karst aquifer the recorded pressure responses were used for later hydraulic tomography 2 2 synthetic numerical karst aquifer for comparison we also employed a synthetic karst aquifer for numerical pumping tests using the software vsaft2 developed by yeh et al 1993 vsaft2 stands for variably saturated flow and transport which is a windows software with graphical user interface for setting up running and calibrating a variably saturated flow and transport model with a 2d finite element approach http tian hwr arizona edu downloads the corresponding synthetic aquifer inherits the physical dimensions the boundary conditions the theoretical hydraulic diffusivity and the pumping test setup of the physical sandbox aquifer specifically the 2d synthetic aquifer has a dimension of 120 cm 64 cm in the forward modelling of pumping tests the model domain was discretized to 48 32 elements with a rectangular grid of 2 5 cm 2 cm same as the physical sandbox the left right and top boundaries are dirichlet boundaries of the same constant hydraulic head while its bottom boundary is a no flow boundary the synthetic aquifer is composed of low k matrix of 18 layers and high k karst conduits of 4 types the matrix hydraulic conductivity ranges between 1 49 10 3 to 8 11 10 2 cm s which were obtained from steady state darcy experiments on the core samples from sand layers shown in table s1 the hydraulic conductivities of the four conduits were obtained from the equivalent hydraulic conductivities of the conduit zones 3 19 103 to 7 16 103 cm s shown in the supporting information conduits and sand layers and table s2 here the equivalent hydraulic conductivity takes the geometric mean of the hydraulic conductivities of conduits and the sand layers in front of and behind of conduits based on their area proportions at the cross section the specific storage ss values for both matrix and conduits were set to be a constant of 3 10 6 cm 1 according to our inversion results from the physical sandbox fig 1b shows the theoretical hydraulic diffusivity field of the numerical synthetic aquifer which is the product of the k and ss values same as the pumping tests in physical sandbox six pumping tests were conducted at the same 6 locations with the same pumping rate details of these pumping rates can be found in table s3 during the numerical pumping tests transient hydraulic heads were monitored at the same observation locations as the physical pumping tests the recorded head responses from numerical pumping tests were then used for later hydraulic tomography 3 geostatistics based and travel time based hydraulic tomography the purpose of this study is to interpret multiple sets of head responses obtained from pumping tests and to evaluate hydraulic parameters of a heterogeneous karst aquifer two inversion techniques were implemented to characterize the distribution and geometry of the embedded karst conduits one is the geostatistics based inversion technique which employs the simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle algorithm for stochastic inversions on transient hydraulic heads and the other is the travel time based inversion technique which uses the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique sirt algorithm for tomography reconstructions on the hydraulic travel times the fundamental concepts of two inversion techniques were described in detail by zhu and yeh 2005 and brauchler et al 2003 respectively here we only give them a brief introduction 3 1 the geostatistics based inversion with the simsle algorithm at the continuum scale a karst aquifer can be treated as a heterogeneous continuous medium where karst conduits have higher hydraulic conductivities than the matrix thus the groundwater flow in the continuum scale karst aquifer can be described by the following equation 1 k x h q x p s s x h t subjected to the following initial and boundary conditions 2 h t 0 h 0 h γ 1 h 1 a n d k x h n γ 2 q where k x is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 h is the hydraulic head l x is the spatial coordinate l q xp is the pumping rate per unit volume of the aquifer l3 t 1 l 3 at the location xp t is time t and ss x is the specific storage l 1 in eq 2 h0 represents the initial head l h1 is the constant head l at the dirichlet boundary γ 1 q is the specific discharge l t at the neumann boundary γ 2 and n is a unit vector normal to γ 2 the simsle algorithm performs geostatistical inversions on the transient hydraulic heads the inverse model assumes that the natural logarithm of hydraulic parameter i e lnk is treated as a stationary stochastic process and the mean and correlation of hydraulic parameter field is known a priori similar to the sequential sle algorithm developed by yeh and liu 2000 the simsle algorithm calculates the hydraulic parameters iteratively firstly it applies the classical cokriging technique on the observed hydraulic parameters and the collected heads to create a map of cokriged log hydraulic conductivities then a successive linear estimator is implemented to improve the estimate hydraulic parameters by minimizing the differences between the simulated and observed heads with the improved estimates the governing flow equation is solved to obtain the conditional effective hydraulic parameter fields the unconditional covariances as well as the cross covariances calculated by a first order analysis with the covariance function of the head perturbations are updated and propagated to evaluate the weights of the new estimates iterations continue until convergence is achieved i e when changes in the simulated heads are smaller than the prescribed tolerance multiple data sets can be inverted simultaneously instead of sequentially thereby more constraints can be provided for the inverse problem the simultaneous feature of the simsle algorithm usually results in a faster convergence than the sequential sle the simsle algorithm has been implemented in the software vsaft2 yeh et al 1993 in this study we adopted vsaft2 to analyze the head responses from our pumping tests 3 2 the travel time based inversion with the sirt algorithm the travel time based inversion follows the procedure of seismic ray tomography and is supported by the transformation of the transient groundwater flow equation into the eikonal equation vasco et al 2000 brauchler et al 2011 it can be solved with ray tracing or particle tracking methods by a line integral the line integral is related to the arrival time of a hydraulic signal to the reciprocal value of hydraulic diffusivity vasco et al 2000 3 t peak x 2 1 6 x 1 x 2 ds d h s where tpeak is defined as the travel time of the peak of a transient pressure signal from the point x1 source to the observation point x2 receiver and dh is the hydraulic diffusivity as a function of arc length along the propagation path s here dh is defined as the quotient of the hydraulic conductivity over the specific storage in equation 3 the travel time can be naturally defined for the propagation of a dirac source pressure pulse however the line integral is also capable for inversions using other travel time diagnostics brauchler et al 2013 the travel time diagnostic can be defined as the time of a certain feature of a transient pressure response in this paper we used the peak and t 50 travel time diagnostics for example the t 50 travel time diagnostic is the time that the pressure response rises to 50 of the peak value as illustrated in figure s2 the line integral describes the relationship between the travel time and the hydraulic diffusivity therefore a set of travel time integrals forms an inverse problem yielding the hydraulic diffusivity values similar to the inversion methods for seismic signals or electromagnetic waves in geophysical tomography the sirt algorithm tomographically reconstructs the travel times and calculates the hydraulic diffusivity field in a discretized domain the sirt algorithm has been implemented in the software geotom3d geotom llc 2019 this software was originally designed for two or three dimensional seismic tomography jackson and tweeton 1996 and further applied to hydraulic tomography ht with multiple observation wells e g brauchler et al 2011 in this study a given pumping test of multiple observation location results in a set of transient pressure curves where each observation location yields one travel time from its corresponding transient pressure curve these travel times were then used for travel time based analysis performed by the geotom3d with the sirt algorithm the hydraulic diffusivity on each discretized grid is updated iteratively until the reconstructed and observed travel times have a best matching the staggered grid method böhm and vesnaver 1996 somogyvári and bayer 2017 kong et al 2018 is also utilized in this study which is based on the concept of multi grid to avoid excessive calculations it combines the advantages of a low resolution grid for stable inversion and the need for a high resolution hydraulic diffusivity computation the inversion is first solved over multiple coarse grids then shifted along each dimension to obtain a higher resolution result it can reduce the inversion bias caused by the relation between the source receiver locations and the grid geometry moreover the null space energy map is also calculated in this study to assess the reliability of different parts of the computed tomogram by masking out pixels with unreliable values böhm and vesnaver 1996 the null space energy map is computed by singular value decomposition of the tomographical matrix with a range between 0 and 1 the high value of the null space energy means a low density of the rays or streamlines at the local grid implying a highly uncertain inversion result that is the low value of the null space energy should indicate a more reliable result 4 inverse models 4 1 inversion for the physical karst aquifer in the sandbox 4 1 1 geostatistics based inversion with the simsle algorithm in this study the transient observed hydraulic heads were stochastically matched by the simsle algorithm to derive the hydraulic diffusivity field here the inverse model treated both the transient flow field and the natural logarithm of k as a multi gaussian second order stationary stochastic process illman et al 2007 in addition the mean and spatial correlation of the k field were known a priori in the inverse modeling we only considered the portion of the sandbox that contains the medium which is a quasi two dimensional vertical domain with a dimension of 115 cm 64 cm the domain was discretized to 46 32 elements each element was a rectangular grid of a dimension of 2 5 cm 2 cm the top left and right boundaries of the 2d domain were set as constant hydraulic head boundaries of 64 cm and the bottom of the domain was set as a no flow boundary input parameters of the inverse model included initial guesses of hydraulic parameters mean variance and spatial correlation scale the discharge rate of each cross hole pumping test and head measurements over time the initial fields of k and ss were assumed to be homogeneous with k and ss approximated as 0 6 cm s and 3 01 10 6 cm 1 respectively these two values were derived using vsaft2 on two cross hole pumping tests conducted at ports 17 and 32 in the analysis of these two pumping tests the aquifer was assumed to be homogeneous and the steady state heads were utilized to estimate the equivalent parameters for the entire aquifer illman et al 2010 these two pumping tests yielded 80 estimates for k and ss we then calculated the means of k and ss for the full inversion computation with the total 6 pumping tests in this study the required variances of lnk and lnss in the inverse model were initially set as 1 and 0 5 respectively although the variance estimation involves uncertainty the variance uncertainty has negligible effects on the estimated tomogram for transient hydraulic tomography as pointed out by illman et al 2007 in their numerical study the spatial correlation scale represents the characteristic size of heterogeneity and is critical for analyzing the average behavior of heterogeneous aquifers the determination of the correlation scale usually needs decent amount of data which are often difficult to be obtained in the field on the other hand if a large number of head measurements is available the site specific heterogeneity could be captured by ht if this is so the uncertainty in correlation scale has negligible impact on the tomography inversion yeh and liu 2000 this is the luxury for the current experiments therefore in this study the correlation scale was approximated based on the dimensions of conduits and the average thickness and average length of the sand layers liu et al 2007 illman et al 2010 berg and illman 2011 the horizontal and vertical correlation lengths were set as 40 cm and 8 cm respectively we utilized six independent cross hole pumping tests at ports 5 13 17 27 31 and 40 for ht analyses prior to each pumping test the pressure transducers were calibrated to ensure accurate measurements for each pumping test the transient heads recorded at the rest of the ports were selected as the data sets of the hydraulic tomographic survey drawdown records of excessive noise were excluded due to a poor polynomial fitting that will be explained in the next drawdowns at the pumping ports were also excluded because these measurements are noisy likely caused by the non pulsation free pumping we processed the transient drawdowns with various noise reduction schemes as discussed by illman et al 2007 2011 particularly following the work of liu et al 2007 and berg and illman 2011 we used a fifth order polynomial curve to fit the drawdown records over time to achieve a better fitting drawdown values at steady state were populated using the averaged value of drawdowns at steady state in this study the average r2 of all polynomial fittings for the inverse modeling is about 0 943 from the polynomial fitting curve five or six data points were extracted presumably these extracted data points capture the overall behavior of the transient drawdowns illman et al 2007 berg and illman 2011 zhao et al 2015 in total 1190 drawdowns were extracted from 223 transient drawdown curves for the ht inverse modeling using the simsle algorithm 4 1 2 travel time based inversion with the sirt algorithm the travel time based ht analysis was performed using geotom3d with the sirt algorithm similar to the aforementioned hydraulic head inversion using vsaft2 a homogeneous field was initialized for the travel time based inversion the initial coarse gridded model consisted of 16 elements in the horizontal direction length of the sandbox and 9 elements in the vertical direction height of the sandbox each element with a dimension of 10 cm 8 cm we then staggered coarse grid three times in both dimensions to reach a higher spatial resolution with a grid size of 2 5 cm 2 cm the required travel times for geotom3d were extracted from the same transient drawdown curves out of the six pumping tests as the geostatistics based ht inverse modeling using the simsle algorithm prior to the extraction the recorded hydraulic heads were smoothed with a moving average and then fitted with a fifth order polynomial function consisting of 6 terms and 6 coefficients the travel time points are the peak times of the pressure pulses determined from the first derivative of the polynomially fitted transient drawdown curves to some extent travel times capture an important feature of the transient drawdown curves although each transient drawdown curves only produced one travel time these extracted travel times still characterize the transient drawdown curves as pointed out by brauchler et al 2007 small travel time diagnostics reflect preferential flow paths while large travel time diagnostics reflect the integral behavior of the aquifer therefore early travel times are better suited to resolve the spatial distribution of hydraulic diffusivity of an heterogenous aquifer brauchler et al 2013 here we adopted the t 50 travel time diagnostic for the travel time based inversion to mitigate ray interference during inversion if multiple receivers of the same source are aligned in a straight line only the farthest receiver on both side of the source is included in the inversion in total 203 travel times were used for the travel time based inversion specifically cross hole pumping tests at ports 5 and 17 yielded 33 2 travel times of t 50 and cross hole pumping tests at ports 13 27 31 and 40 yielded 35 37 34 and 31 travel times of t 50 respectively for travel time based inversion the curved rays were used in the forward modeling the inversion quickly reached its convergence after only a few iterations and met the convergence criteria as shown by the root mean square rms residuals of the reconstructed travel times in figure s3 the null space energy map was computed by singular value decomposition of the tomographic matrix to filter out unfavored inverted hydraulic diffusivities with a cutoff value of 0 96 4 2 inversion for the numerical synthetic karst aquifer 4 2 1 geostatistics based inversion with the simsle algorithm same as the geostatistics based inversion performed on the experimental data the recorded hydraulic heads from forward numerical pumping tests were matched by the simsle algorithm to map the hydraulic diffusivity field for numerical synthetic aquifer the inverse model also treated both the transient flow field and the natural logarithm of k as a multi gaussian second order stationary stochastic process the domain dimensions used for the inverse modeling was 120 cm in length and 64 cm in height which was composed of rectangular elements with a size of 2 5 cm 2 cm the boundary conditions for the inverse modeling are the same as the forward modelling of pumping tests the initial fields of k and ss were assumed to be homogeneous and the mean of k and ss were 0 6 cm s and 3 10 6 cm 1 respectively the variances of lnk and lnss in the inverse model for numerical karst aquifer were initially set as 1 and 0 5 the horizontal and vertical correlation lengths were set as 40 cm and 8 cm same as the ones for the inversion of physical sandbox the six independent pumping tests were at the same locations of ports 5 13 17 27 31 and 40 the transient hydraulic heads were monitored at locations of other 41 ports i e excluding the pumping port and were selected as the inversion data set for each drawdown curve 5 data points at 0 005 min 0 02 min 0 1 min 0 3 min 5 min were extracted to represent the entire transient behavior according to the data time sampling strategy by sun et al 2013 and jiang et al 2022 in total 1230 drawdowns were extracted from 246 transient drawdown curves for the geostatistics based ht inversion of the numerical synthetic karst aquifer 4 2 2 travel time based inversion with the sirt algorithm for the travel time based inversion of numerical synthetic karst aquifer we also initialized a homogeneous field same as the aforementioned travel time based inversion for the physical sandbox karst aquifer the initial coarse gridded model also consisted of 16 elements in the horizontal direction and 9 elements in the vertical direction the dimension of each element was 10 cm 8 cm then we boosted to a higher spatial resolution with a grid size of 2 5 cm 2 cm by staggering the coarse grid three times in both horizontal and vertical directions the required travel times were extracted from the transient drawdown curves obtained from the 6 pumping tests in the forward simulations similar to the travel time based inversion for the physical karst aquifer if multiple receivers of the same source are aligned in a straight line only the farthest receiver on both side of the source is included in the inversion for the numerical synthetic aquifer we have computed the inversion with both the peak i e t 100 and t 50 travel times which yielded similar hydraulic diffusivity distributions considering that the travel times obtained from numerical synthetic aquifer are small and thus the value of peak travel time is easier to be determined than the t 50 travel time we opt to report the inversion using the peak travel time diagnostic for the numerical synthetic aquifer we obtained 222 travel times for the travel time based inversion we calculated null space energy map and a cutoff value of 0 96 is found suitable to constrain the dh tomograms for the filtering of the low trajectory regions 5 results and discussion 5 1 spatial distribution of hydraulic diffusivities for the physical sandbox karst aquifer the geostatistics based ht yielded both the hydraulic conductivity fig 2 a and the specific storage field fig 3 b while the travel time based ht also yielded the hydraulic diffusivity fig 2b and the specific storage field fig 4 b after applying the mask of null space energy for the un masked hydraulic diffusivity refer to figure s5 for the numerical synthetic karst aquifer fig 5 a shows the geostatistics based inverted hydraulic diffusivity field which is determined by the reconstructed hydraulic conductivity and the constant specific storage 3 10 6 cm 1 while fig 5b shows the travel time based inverted hydraulic diffusivity field after applying the mask of null space energy for the un masked hydraulic diffusivity refer to figure s6 the geostatistics based ht yielded almost a constant specific storage 3 10 6 cm 1 for the whole aquifer likely because the dimensions of aquifer and conduits are at the same order of magnitude because the travel time based ht only produces hydraulic diffusivity to reconstruct the spatial distribution of the specific storage we performed the attenuation inversion based on the sirt algorithm details refer to the supporting information due to the unreasonable large variation of the reconstructed specific storage fig 4b we decided to only compare the reconstructed hydraulic diffusivity from the two ht inversion methods for the geostatistics based inversion hydraulic diffusivities were calculated using the reconstructed hydraulic conductivity and specific storage for the travel time based inversion the hydraulic conductivity was calculated using its reconstructed hydraulic diffusivity and the constant specific storage from the geostatistics based inversion both ht inversions clearly produced high dh zones on and around the conduits but the positions and shapes of the predicted high dh zones are slightly different between the geostatistics based fig 2a and 5a and travel time based fig 2b and 5b inversions and between the physical sandbox fig 2 and the numerical synthetic aquifer fig 5 overall a satisfactory match can be concluded on the locations between the conduit zones and the high dh zones for conduit a the geostatistics based ht produced a horizontally elongated parallel to the conduit a high dh zone slightly above the conduit in the physical sandbox but slightly beneath the conduit in the numerical synthetic aquifer the travel time based ht also yielded a horizontally elongated high dh zone where the high dh zone perfectly overlays the conduit a in the physical sandbox but locates beneath the conduit a in the numerical synthetic aquifer for conduit b the geostatistics based ht produced a horizontally elongated high dh zone on the upper bound of the conduit in the physical sandbox but in the central of the conduit in the numerical synthetic aquifer in contrast the travel time based ht yielded a disc like high dh zone off the center of conduit b similarly its location in the physical sandbox is higher than the one in the numerical synthetic aquifer for conduit c in the physical sandbox the geostatistics based ht produced a scythe like high dh zone slightly on the upper bound of the conduit c in the numerical synthetic aquifer the geostatistics based ht produced a vertically elongated high dh zone inside the conduit c in contrast the travel time based ht yielded an offset disc like high dh zone in the physical sandbox in the numerical synthetic aquifer the travel time based ht yielded a large scythe like median dh zone on the conduit c for conduit d in the physical sandbox the geostatistics based ht produced a horizontally elongated high dh zone on the lower bound of the conduit d in the numerical synthetic aquifer the geostatistics based ht produced an inclined elongated high dh zone around the center of the conduit d in contrast the travel time based ht yielded a square high dh zone inside the conduit d in both the physical sandbox and the numerical synthetic aquifer in addition the geostatistics based ht predicted a median dh zone bridging conduits c and d towards the left end of the sand layer l14 fig 2a and 5a both ht techniques are able to map the sand layers of low hydraulic diffusivity figures 2 4 5 6 s5 and s6 the geostatistics based ht produced a low dh zone along the aquifer bottom while the travel time based ht yielded low dh zones immediately next to the high dh zones around the conduits the inverted dh fields also indicate that dh of the same sand layer is strongly influenced by the embedded conduit this is likely because the dimension of sand layers is similar to the ones of conduits in particular the geostatistics based ht predicted much higher hydraulic diffusivity than the values calculated using the specific storage 3 10 6 cm 1 and the hydraulic conductivities from hazen or kozeny carman model table s1 a slightly high dh zone near the aquifer top was predicted by the geostatistics based ht this high dh zone may be attributed to the lack of compaction of sands near the top illman et al 2007 2010 due to the low contrast in k among the sand layers and the high contrast between the sand layers and the conduit zones both geostatistics based and travel time based hts are not able to distinguish the boundaries between the sand layers the low dh zone of the sand layers l1 l2 and l3 can only be reasonably predicted by the geostatistics based ht at the bottom of the aquifer this could be related to the fact that the geostatistics based ht uses the boundary information but the travel time based ht does not moreover there is no source and receiver at the bottom of the aquifer so that rays passing through this area integrate unreliable information in the travel time based ht inversion thus the values of the null space energy in this areas are high resulting in highly uncertain inversion results both geostatistics based and travel time based hts are capable of approximately revealing the structures of the embedded karst conduits and producing similar spatial distributions of hydraulic diffusivity specifically the geostatistics based simsle algorithm yielded the high dh zones in a good agreement with the positions of the embedded karst structures it is likely that the simsle algorithm was benefited from the matching of multiple drawdown values from every drawdown curve while the sirt algorithm only matched one arrival time out of a drawdown curve on the other hand the travel time based sirt algorithm produced hydraulic diffusivities for sand layers in a better agreement with the values calculated using the specific storage 3 10 6 cm 1 and the hydraulic conductivities from hazen or kozeny carman model table s1 5 2 statistics of the inverted hydraulic diffusivities in this section we present statistical quantifications of the inverted hydraulic diffusivities from the two ht techniques for both physical and numerical karst aquifers note that for all inversion results only the diffusivities with lower null space energy are used for the quantification and comparison to ensure equal sample size for both inversion approaches tables s4 and s5 document the statistical properties minimum maximum mean and standard deviation of the inverted logdh with dh given in m2 s which is used for the rest of the paper for the simsle inversion logdh ranges from 0 61 to 3 93 and 0 96 to 3 25 for the physical and numerical aquifers with arithmetic means of 1 84 and 0 75 respectively these values show lower dh and k for the numerical aquifer indicating that the theoretical k derived from the core samples may be underestimated the actual transmissivity at the sand layer scale is probably much larger due to the scale effect for the travel time based inversion logdh ranges from 1 97 to 4 5 and 0 99 to 4 6 for the physical and numerical aquifers with arithmetic means of 0 04 and 0 61 respectively contrary to the simsle inversion results the numerical aquifer has a higher dh than the physical aquifer likely due to the larger travel time calculated from the actual pumping test data which will be discussed further in the following sections overall for both aquifers the maximum values of logdh inverted by the sirt algorithm are larger than the values inverted by the simsle algorithm while the minimum values are smaller the travel time based inversion yielded a larger standard deviation of logdh fig 6 displays the histograms and the cumulative frequency plots of logdh for the two different inversion approaches the histograms and cumulative frequency plots in fig 6a and 4c show a skewed normal distribution of logdh obtained from the simsle inversion in contrast fig 6b and 6d show two different distributions including a normal distribution for logdh 1 5 and a uniform distribution for logdh 1 5 these two distributions are clearly indicated in the cumulative frequency plots where a nearly linear behavior is shown for logdh 1 5 which is a characteristic of a uniform distribution the statistics of these four cases suggest that matrix and karst conduits cannot be distinguished with a fixed logdh value thus we propose to use the cumulative frequency plots from the travel time based inversion to find out the differentiation criterion and use this criterion also for the corresponding simsle inversion results as the area of the karst conduits should be the same for the two inversion algorithms the normal distribution is considered as the sand layers and the uniform distribution represents the karst conduits therefore for fig 6b and 6d with reference to the cumulative frequency plots 77 6 and 89 8 are used as the criterion with the corresponding logdh values of 0 59 fig 6b and 1 46 fig 6d respectively similarly these two percentages were used for fig 6a and 6c respectively for the physical aquifer pixels with logdh greater than 2 51 fig 6a are considered as karst conduits while for the numerical aquifer pixels with logdh greater than 2 08 fig 6c are considered as karst conduits the reason for two different percentages is that there are fewer pixels of the physical aquifer used for comparison referring to figs 2 and 5 the karst conduits seem to be well characterized in this way 5 3 comparison of local hydraulic diffusivity fig 7 compares the local hydraulic conductivity at the 42 observation points fig 1a obtained from the geostatistics based simsle algorithm and the travel time based sirt algorithm to facilitate the comparison a 1 1 identity line solid line is added to each subplot of fig 7 the size of the hollow circle represents the euclidean distance between the observation points and the nearest conduits the larger the hollow circle size the smaller the distance for the physical karst aquifer most of the inverted dh at the observation points deviate from the identity line fig 7a no clear relationship can be observed between the distance and the deviation of dh away from the identity line as previously concluded that in sand layers the travel time based ht yielded low dh zones immediately next to the high dh zones around the conduits while the geostatistics based ht produced a median dh zone specifically the geostatistics based inversion generally yielded higher dh about 1 2 orders of magnitude larger of sand layers than those obtained from the travel time based inversion this is likely because the geostatistics based ht inversion tends to produce a smooth transition in dh from the conduit zones to the surrounding sand layers due to the kriging and the forward flow model therefore it is difficult to match the local hydraulic diffusivity at the same position from the two tomograms on the contrary for the numerical karst aquifer most of the inverted dh are distributed around the identity line fig 7b the two dh obviously deviating from the identity line are located in the sand near the karst structure b the reason for its deviation is that the position of the high dh region from the travel time based inversion slightly above that from the geostatistics based inversion considering that the local hydraulic diffusivity at the same position from the two tomograms can be roughly matched in this sense the two hydraulic tomography inversions validate with each other 5 4 result validation and uncertainty discussion previous studies revealed that the simulation of independent pumping tests can provide rigorous quantitative assessments of the estimated parameters illman et al 2007 liu et al 2007 for geostatistics based inversion with the simsle algorithm we validate the inverted tomogram of hydraulic diffusivity by performing forward simulations of two additional pumping tests which were not used in the inversion calculations the forward simulations calculated the steady state drawdowns at the observation ports which were then compared to the observed values these two additional pumping tests were conducted at ports 9 and 34 at different times for travel time based inversion with the sirt algorithm the observed and reconstructed travel times are directly compared to evaluate the inversion uncertainty fig 8 shows the scatterplots of the observed versus the simulated values where fig 8a and 8b show the validation for the physical karst aquifer and fig 8c and 8d show the validation for the numerical karst aquifer fig 8a and 8c include a dashed line which is the linear regression to the data points the corresponding fitting coefficient is also shown in the plots the observed and simulated drawdowns measured from the numerical aquifer are approximately one order of magnitude larger than that of the physical aquifer which is the proof that the theoretical k values table s1 were underestimated moreover fig 8a and 8c show that the data points scatter around the identity line indicating a good match between the simulated drawdowns and the observed ones for such a heterogeneous aquifer no surprisingly the physical aquifer shows slightly more scattering due to the data noise and the much smaller drawdown in magnitude fig 8b and 8d show the comparison of the observed and reconstructed travel times for the travel time based inversion the error bars represent the standard deviations of the reconstructed travel times from the different staggered grids the observed and reconstructed travel times scatter along the identity line however for both two physical and numerical aquifers there are some travel times obviously deviating from the identity line in fig 8b the small travel times indicated by zone i mainly come from ports 23 24 27 30 and 31 near the conduits high dh zones this deviation of zone i is likely because the predicted diffusivities inside conduit c are underestimated in fig 8d although there are some travel times slightly deviating from the identity line the number of travel times that deviate from the identity line are smaller than the one obtained from the physical karst aquifer it is challenging for the geostatistics based ht with the simsle algorithm to handle strongly heterogeneous aquifers with high contrasts in k or dh like the karst conduits and the matrix since it treats the karst conduits as a porous continuum therefore the inverted dh may not perfectly correspond to the true values for the conduits and the matrix fig 2a this is the reason why there is a deviation of drawdowns at the monitoring ports when the inverted tomograms are utilized for predicting the steady state drawdowns for the two additional pumping tests fig 7a despite these slightly deviations in general the inverted tomograms are able to capture the observed drawdown behaviors at the monitoring ports this validation still indicates the robustness of the geostatistics based ht analysis with the simsle algorithm for such a heterogeneous karst aquifer our geostatistics based inversion has obtained a satisfactory imaging result in terms of accuracy and robustness although both early and late data were used for the geostatistics based ht in this study previous studies also show that the k fields could be well estimated by the simsle algorithm using the steady state heads if estimating ss fields is not the goal and the inversion process can be accelerated tremendously sun et al 2013 jiang et al 2022 this is valuable when accurate early head data from field hydraulic tests are scarce on the other hand for travel time based tomography the imaging accuracy is mainly determined by the initial grids and the spatial resolution depends on the staggered level because fewer rays are passing through the low dh zones some observed and reconstructed travel times may not match well thus the travel time based tomography seems to be more suitable for capturing local heterogeneity of high contrast in e g hydraulic conductivity considering that the hydraulic diffusivity of the karst structures differs greatly to the matrix one the travel time based inversion also yields acceptable results remarkably the travel time based ht only uses the early travel times with low computational inversion cost thus undoubtedly has the advantage of fast and stable inversion generally the two types of ht techniques implemented in this study mainly differ in three aspects the fundamental governing equations the inversion assumptions and the uncertainty presentation for the geostatistics based inversion the groundwater flow equation is adopted as the governing equation the geostatistical assumption is adopted in which the natural logarithm of hydraulic parameter is treated as a multi gaussian stationary stochastic process and the mean and correlation length of hydraulic parameter field are known the variogram model based on cokriging process often generates smooth spatial patterns the simsle algorithm improves the estimation of hydraulic parameters by minimizing the difference between simulated and observed heads and continuously updating the unconditional covariance as well as the cross covariance on the other hand for the travel time based inversion the eikonal equation transformed from the groundwater flow equation by an asymptotic solution is used as the governing equation it is assumed that the propagation of a hydraulic stimulation follows fermat s principle that is early arrivals characterizing the initial part of a signal follow the fastest pathways between the source and the receiver the sirt algorithm iteratively inverts the hydraulic parameters without imposing regularization since the inversion is overdetermined due to the coarse inverse model in the presence of the three differences both two inversion results could approximately reveal the structures of the embedded karst conduits and produce similar and reasonable hydraulic diffusivity fields as shown in our results thus these two ht techniques are promising tools to map the conduit position and the hydraulic parameters distribution of karst aquifers which is a challenge for decades the advantage of ht is that it does not rely on some specific hydrogeological information obtained by field exploration or drilling campaign including detailed deterministic or statistical information of the geometry of karst conduits experiences show neuman 2005 field and leij 2012 borghi et al 2016 that like fissures the sinkhole density on the surface outcrop is often different from those obtained from the boreholes it implies that this accessible geological information often may not accurately represent the internal conditions of karst formation in contrast the drawdown responses collected by a series of pumping tests provide necessary information for ht these responses are propagated in the main karst conduits carrying integral information on hydraulic properties of karst aquifer that is not easy to obtain therefore hydraulic tomography based on pumping data has great potential for mapping the karst media 6 conclusions the main objective of this paper is to explore the potential of hydraulic tomography ht for the characterization of the distribution and geometry of karst conduits at the laboratory scale a quasi 2d physical synthetic karst aquifer was constructed in a vertical sandbox which consisted of heterogeneous sand matrix and artificial karst conduits of different geometries a corresponding numerical synthetic karst aquifer was also evaluated using the same hydraulic parameters boundary conditions and karst conduits as the ones of the physical karst aquifer then we conducted six pumping tests at different locations to produce the pressure responses for the ht inversion of hydraulic diffusivity two types of ht techniques namely the geostatistics based inversion with the simsle algorithm and the travel time based inversion with the sirt algorithm were implemented and evaluated for physical and numerical synthetic karst aquifer we compared and analyzed the inverted diffusivity tomograms concluding that both the geostatistics based and travel time based inversions are capable of approximately revealing the structures of the embedded karst conduits and yielding similar and reasonable hydraulic diffusivities karst structures are able to be distinguished from the surrounding matrix with statistics analysis of the inverted diffusivity obtained by the travel time based inversion because the travel time based inversion yields high contrast between the diffusivities of karst structures and the surrounding matrix on the other hand it is evident that the geostatistics based simsle algorithm yields the zones of high hydraulic diffusivity in a slightly better agreement with respect to their positions of the embedded karst structures because the geostatistics based simsle algorithm incorporates the boundary conditions with the attempt of matching the observed hydraulic heads but the travel time based inversion does not in this study with the help of hydraulic head responses both ht techniques investigated can produce the characteristics of hydraulic parameters for the established aquifer and reveal the characterization of the heterogeneity of the karst structures with the cross hole pumping tests in both the physical and numerical synthetic karst aquifers the examined ht techniques have been proven to be a powerful method for identifying the locations of karst conduits and the spatial distribution of hydraulic parameters of aquifer in the laboratory scale we argue that in the case of data scarcity in large scale field experiments the travel time based inversion with the sirt algorithm may be favorable because early drawdown data are sufficient for estimate of travel times even with early drawdowns the travel time based inversion could capture reasonable values of hydraulic parameters and approximate distribution of the high dh zones these approximate estimates will aid in estimating the potential water storage in karst structures and predicting water seepage for some underground projects in karst areas when field hydraulic tests i e pumping tests wang et al 2021 and sequential water releasing tests liu et al 2020 could be performed for sufficiently long period of time the geostatistics based inversion should be further carried out the inverted hydraulic fields are valuable for distinguishing the boundary characteristics of karst structures providing a guidance for the better positioning of karst structures prior to underground projects and as prior information for stochastic inversion in addition besides head data geological data obtained from geophysical surveys and tracer tests data may be able to provide additional useful information about karst structures to improve the results of ht whenever it is possible geological information should also be incorporated into the hydraulic inversion modeling to yield better results credit authorship contribution statement xintong wang data

2422,hydraulic tomography ht is a well established approach to yield the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity of an aquifer this work explores the potential of ht for the characterization of the distribution and connectivity of conduits in a two dimensional sandbox and its corresponding synthetic aquifer two inversion techniques were implemented and compared the geostatistics based inversion which uses the simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle algorithm to conduct stochastic inversions on the transient hydraulic heads and the travel time based inversion which employs the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique sirt algorithm on the hydraulic travel times for tomography reconstructions four artificial karst conduits of different geometries were placed in an aquifer of layer with different hydraulic conductivities we conducted 6 pumping tests at 6 different locations and the resultant pressure responses were recorded at 42 observation points in both the sandbox and the corresponding synthetic aquifer the measured data were then used for the inversion of hydraulic diffusivity using the simsle and sirt algorithms our results show that both algorithms were able to approximately identify the embedded karst conduits and yield similar hydraulic diffusivity distribution statistically the travel time based inversion re constructed high contrast diffusivities which clearly differentiate the karst structures from the surrounding matrix the geostatistics based simsle algorithm yields a better agreement on the positions and the shapes of the embedded karst structures compared to those obtained by the travel time based sirt algorithm uncertainties and limitations of our results are also discussed in this work followed by recommendations on hydraulic tests in karst aquifers keywords hydraulic tomography karst aquifer heterogeneity laboratory sandbox inverse modeling hydraulic travel time data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction karst water resources play an important role in the water supply for industrial agricultural and domestic water use ford and williams 2013 due to the complex development processes superposition of geological tectonic movement surface water dissolution and groundwater movement karst aquifers are highly heterogeneous scanlon et al 2003 xu et al 2022a b conduits in karst aquifers strongly affect the distribution of groundwater contaminants and mineral resources worldwide a large number of underground projects is built in karst areas illman et al 2009 mao et al 2018 dong et al 2020 these projects are often engaged with groundwater seepage of various degrees such as water inrush accidents in tunnels and coalmine xu et al 2021 in the past few decades extensive studies have been conducted to characterize karst conduits and to capture detailed and reliable information on the heterogeneity of karst aquifers abusaada and sauter 2013 mohammadi and illman 2019 knowledge about the spatial distribution of hydraulic parameters facilitates identification of structural characteristics of karst aquifers when analyzing geotechnical and hydrogeological problems wang et al 2016 2017 in general hydraulic properties can be estimated by performing conventional hydraulic tests e g flow through experiments on core samples and slug pumping tests in the field berg and illman 2011 typical single well hydraulic tests yield point wise hydraulic parameters over a control volume of interest without further upgrade on the measurement scale these point wise data are typically insufficient to describe heterogeneity of karst aquifers and to map geometric characteristics of conduit networks on the other hand although geophysical tomography methods such as electrical tomography cross well radar and seismic tomography liu et al 2018 torrese 2020 are often applied to obtain structural characterizations of aquifers the obtained geophysical parameters are usually difficult to be converted into hydraulic parameters hu et al 2017 in addition relations between geophysical and hydrogeological parameters are site specific and not easy to be generalized hyndman and tronicke 2005 therefore a more reliable manner is demanded to characterize the hydrological characteristics of karst aquifers in the past two decades several research groups have been working on the development of the so called hydraulic tomography ht techniques which have been demonstrated to be a cost effective tool for characterizing the heterogeneity of porous aquifers at high spatial resolutions e g yeh and liu 2000 brauchler et al 2003 ht employs a series of sequential cross hole pumping or injection tests and inversely solves the groundwater flow equation with the collected hydraulic head responses to determine the spatial distribution of aquifer hydraulic parameters when performing ht analysis multiple wells are needed to be installed at different locations and hydraulic head perturbations are induced by water injection or withdraw at selected wells while the hydraulic head responses are monitored in the observation wells hydraulic head perturbations are often repeated multiple times with different well combinations to obtain sufficient but not redundant hydraulic head responses during ht analysis one set of head responses presents one snapshot of the aquifer heterogeneity sampled at a perspective angle ht analysis thus simultaneously utilizes all snapshots to realistically and reliably map the aquifer heterogeneity yeh and liu 2000 brauchler et al 2003 zhu and yeh 2005 multiple sets of hydraulic head responses are usually obtained using cross hole pumping or injection tests by interpreting the head responses and assessing the associated uncertainties different kinds of ht inversion schemes have been reported in literature to determine the spatial distribution of hydraulic parameters these inverse methods include general geostatistical inverse methods yeh and liu 2000 zhu and yeh 2005 li and cirpka 2006 klein et al 2017 schwede et al 2014 cardiff et al 2009 2013 mao et al 2013a 2013b zhao et al 2015 zhao and illman 2018 li et al 2021 travel time based inverse methods brauchler et al 2003 2010 2013 vasco et al 2019 pilot point based approaches lavenue and de marsily 2001 castagna et al 2011 sparse nonlinear optimizer and stochastic newton approach wang et al 2016 2017 cellular automata based approaches fischer et al 2017a b and discrete network deterministic inversion method fischer et al 2018 2020 in this study we focus on the geostatistics based and travel time based inversion methods of ht the geostatistics based inversion used in this work is a geostatistical procedure originated from the work of yeh et al 1996 it relies on a so called successive linear estimator sle which was derived from the iterative co kriging technique the hydraulic parameter field is computed as a spatial stochastic process although the kriging method assumes a linear relationship between the hydraulic head and the hydraulic conductivity the nonlinearity in the relationship is managed using an iteratively updating approach in the sle algorithm it continuously matches the observed heads with the simulated heads at different observation times and updates the conditional mean and covariance of the estimated hydraulic parameters to improve the estimation accuracy and to reconstruct an average hydraulic parameter distribution yeh and liu 2000 zhu and yeh 2005 on the other hand the travel time based inversion scheme follows the procedure of seismic tomography in seismic tomography the travel time of seismic waves between a source and a receiver can be described as a staright and or curved line integral that relates the travel time to the velocity field of seismic waves similar to seismic tomography in the travel time based ht the line integral relates the square root of the peak arrival time of a transient pressure signal to the inverse square root of hydraulic diffusivity brauchler et al 2003 this line integral can be derived by transforming the transient groundwater flow equation into the so called eikonal equation utilizing an asymptotic approach which can be solved with ray tracing or particle tracking methods brauchler et al 2013 vasco et al 2019 up to date these two aforementioned inversion schemes have been successfully tested for porous and fractured media in synthetic inversion of single or multiphase flow yin and illman 2009 berg and illman 2012 hu et al 2015 and laboratory experiments brauchler et al 2003 illman et al 2007 2008 as well as field assessments illman et al 2009 brauchler et al 2011 paradis et al 2016 zha et al 2015 zhao and illman 2018 mao et al 2018 thus ht may provide a viable and feasible solution to characterize the spatially distributed hydraulic properties of conduits in heterogeneous karst aquifers and the use of ht for characterizing karst aquifers is becoming a new and challenging research topic fischer et al 2018 mohammadi and illman 2019 using physical groundwater models is a common approach for reconstructing the hydrogeological conditions and predicting the hydraulic response of an aquifer different laboratory models such as sandbox models and conduit matrix coupling models have been popular in studying groundwater flow and solute transport in karst aquifers mohammadi et al 2021 sandbox models of high contrast hydraulic conductivity field could be comparable to natural karst aquifers for example xiao et al 2018 and mohammadi et al 2019 employed the conduit matrix coupling models to simulate groundwater flow in karst aquifers conduits are usually assumed to be active inside of the porous matrix which can be composed of sand castro 2017 xiao et al 2018 beads faulkner et al 2009 and bentonite mixed sand mohammadi et al 2019 in this work we report on a comparative study on tomographic imaging of a quasi two dimensional 2d heterogeneous sandbox aquifer and its corresponding synthetic aquifer with karst conduits using two types of ht inversion techniques namely the geostatistics based and travel time based inversions the main objective of this study is to examine the capability of these two inversion algorithms using physically measured and numerically simulated hydraulic heads in the following we first describe our physical experiments on the sandbox karst aquifer and numerical simulations on the synthetic karst aquifers we then introduce the two ht techniques and their inverse models i e the geostatistics based simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle algorithm and the travel time based simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique sirt algorithm finally we compare the obtained hydraulic diffusivity and discuss the corresponding uncertainties and limitations 2 karst aquifers 2 1 physical karst aquifer in a sandbox in this study a quasi 2d synthetic karst aquifer was constructed in a vertical sandbox to evaluate the performance of two ht inversion techniques fig 1 a illustrates the sandbox with two water storage tanks on its left and right sides the sandbox dimensions are 120 0 cm in length 75 0 cm in height and 10 0 cm in width cross section while the dimensions of each storage tank are 10 0 cm in length 75 5 cm in height and 10 0 cm in width the storage tanks were used to keep constant hydraulic head at the top left and right boundaries during the experiments the sandbox is made of polymethyl methacrylate with the support of a stainless steel frame in the front panel of the sandbox 42 cylindrical ports 1 2 cm in diameter were implemented to accommodate pressure measurements and pumping operations fig 1a each port was equipped with a well which is perpendicular to the sandbox front back panels and fully penetrates the aquifer width i e 10 cm these wells were made of polymethyl methacrylate tubes each perforated with 10 holes of roughly equal distances of a 0 6 cm diameter each well was wrapped with a screen of stainless steel using corrosion resistant epoxy these screens prevented the entering of sand particles into the wells wells were connected to either pressure transducers or peristaltic pumps through a silicone hose when they served as observation or pumping wells respectively in this study out of the 42 horizontal wells only several of them were selected as pumping wells the used peristaltic pump had a maximum pumping rate of 0 3 l min according to previous studies liu et al 2007 illman et al 2010 berg and illman 2012 zhao et al 2016 and the dimensions of our sandbox aquifer we used a moderate pumping rate between 0 15 and 0 216 l min to avoid weak pressure changes below the detection limit and to prevent fast and significant pressure changes which could disrupt the upper boundary condition of the sandbox due to an insufficient communication between the storage tanks and the sand aquifer liu et al 2002 the flow system of sandbox consisted of two water storage tanks two overflow tanks and hoses one storage tank and one overflow water tank located on the left side of the sandbox constituting a left water reservoir the other storage tank and overflow water tank located on the right side of the sandbox constituting a right water reservoir these two reservoirs maintained constant head boundaries on the left and right boundaries of the sandbox in addition the third constant head boundary was maintained by ponding water on the top of the sandbox the bottom boundary of sandbox was set to a no flow boundary it has been demonstrated that the stability of the boundary conditions is crucial for head records in the forward modeling of pumping tests in laboratory liu et al 2007 we installed two perforated plate with a length of 75 0 cm and a width of 10 0 cm between the sand body and the water storage tanks on both sides of the sandbox to provide stable hydraulic controls these plates separated the sandy aquifer from two storage tanks preventing the entering of sand particles into the storage tanks in summary the flow system can be conveniently imposed various constant heads to generate a desired hydraulic gradient for our experiments the data acquisition system consisted of 42 pressure transducers cfsensor xgzp and a data logger siemens s7 200smart the acquisition system can automatically acquire transient hydraulic heads at the ports fig 1a shows the 42 ports wells and pressure transducers locations on the sandbox we manually constructed the karst aquifer such that we can easily control the heterogeneity pattern in the sandbox however one drawback of this manual packing approach is that the heterogeneity of the constructed aquifer is not the same as the natural sedimentary aquifer formed by natural deposition processes to mimic the natural deposition processes as much as possible silica sand from sibelco corporation grains were slowly added into the sandbox to create depositional layers uniform compaction of each layer was achieved to its greatest extent meanwhile the sandbox was slowly filled with water from its bottom so that air can be gradually displaced sequentially the water filled sandbox was at rest for one week to remove the potential residual gas to achieve a full saturation to control the heterogeneity of sand layers sand grains were sieved using variable sieve sizes 20 30 30 50 50 50 60 50 65 60 80 65 80 80 80 100 100 100 120 120 150 and 150 the grain size characteristics table s1 show that each category of sand was well sorted denoted by its d10 ranging between 0 086 mm and 0 61 mm here d10 defines the diameter of sand grains corresponding to 10 cumulative from 0 to 100 undersize grain size distribution the hydraulic conductivity k of each sand layer was estimated with its d10 value using the hazen model hazen 1892 and the kozeny carman model chapuis and aubertin 2003 which yielded a k range of 7 40 10 3 to 3 66 10 1 cm s and of 5 10 10 3 to 2 54 10 1 cm s respectively table s1 these sand layers established a heterogeneous matrix for the synthetic karst aquifer four types of conduits were embedded in the layered sandy aquifer to accommodate heterogeneous karst structures including an ordinary conduit a an auxiliary side conduit b a pool c and a waterfall d as shown in fig 1 these conduits present the common karst structures of immobile flow regions and ramiform auxiliary channels hauns et al 2001 morales et al 2010 field and leij 2012 for simplicity all conduits are rectangular geometry structures which were bonded using polymethyl methacrylate plates their detailed dimensions are shown in figure s1 where their widths in the third dimension are 6 cm along their longitudinal direction i e parallel to the top and bottom boundaries of the sandbox holes of 0 6 cm in diameter were drilled with 1 cm apart along the conduits each conduit was wrapped with a screen of stainless steel using corrosion resistant epoxy with the current geometry dimensions conduits are expected to retain much higher hydraulic conductivities compared to the surrounding sand layers the large contrast in k between conduits 103 cm s and sand layers 10 3 10 1 cm s is intent to simulate the high k contrast in natural karst aquifers tables s1 and s2 fig 1a shows the overview of the heterogeneous karst aquifer in the sandbox including 18 homogeneous sand layers indicated by solid black lines and 4 karst conduits outlined by solid red lines our 2d karst aquifer was designed by following two dimensional sandboxes reported in literature e g liu et al 2007 illman et al 2010 and berg and illman 2011 during the experiments due to the much higher k of conduits water is expected to preferably flow through conduits instead of the sand layers in the front of and behind of conduits even though the thickness of conduits is slightly smaller than that of the sandbox therefore we could treat the sandbox with conduits as a quasi 2d karst aquifer the recorded pressure responses were used for later hydraulic tomography 2 2 synthetic numerical karst aquifer for comparison we also employed a synthetic karst aquifer for numerical pumping tests using the software vsaft2 developed by yeh et al 1993 vsaft2 stands for variably saturated flow and transport which is a windows software with graphical user interface for setting up running and calibrating a variably saturated flow and transport model with a 2d finite element approach http tian hwr arizona edu downloads the corresponding synthetic aquifer inherits the physical dimensions the boundary conditions the theoretical hydraulic diffusivity and the pumping test setup of the physical sandbox aquifer specifically the 2d synthetic aquifer has a dimension of 120 cm 64 cm in the forward modelling of pumping tests the model domain was discretized to 48 32 elements with a rectangular grid of 2 5 cm 2 cm same as the physical sandbox the left right and top boundaries are dirichlet boundaries of the same constant hydraulic head while its bottom boundary is a no flow boundary the synthetic aquifer is composed of low k matrix of 18 layers and high k karst conduits of 4 types the matrix hydraulic conductivity ranges between 1 49 10 3 to 8 11 10 2 cm s which were obtained from steady state darcy experiments on the core samples from sand layers shown in table s1 the hydraulic conductivities of the four conduits were obtained from the equivalent hydraulic conductivities of the conduit zones 3 19 103 to 7 16 103 cm s shown in the supporting information conduits and sand layers and table s2 here the equivalent hydraulic conductivity takes the geometric mean of the hydraulic conductivities of conduits and the sand layers in front of and behind of conduits based on their area proportions at the cross section the specific storage ss values for both matrix and conduits were set to be a constant of 3 10 6 cm 1 according to our inversion results from the physical sandbox fig 1b shows the theoretical hydraulic diffusivity field of the numerical synthetic aquifer which is the product of the k and ss values same as the pumping tests in physical sandbox six pumping tests were conducted at the same 6 locations with the same pumping rate details of these pumping rates can be found in table s3 during the numerical pumping tests transient hydraulic heads were monitored at the same observation locations as the physical pumping tests the recorded head responses from numerical pumping tests were then used for later hydraulic tomography 3 geostatistics based and travel time based hydraulic tomography the purpose of this study is to interpret multiple sets of head responses obtained from pumping tests and to evaluate hydraulic parameters of a heterogeneous karst aquifer two inversion techniques were implemented to characterize the distribution and geometry of the embedded karst conduits one is the geostatistics based inversion technique which employs the simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle algorithm for stochastic inversions on transient hydraulic heads and the other is the travel time based inversion technique which uses the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique sirt algorithm for tomography reconstructions on the hydraulic travel times the fundamental concepts of two inversion techniques were described in detail by zhu and yeh 2005 and brauchler et al 2003 respectively here we only give them a brief introduction 3 1 the geostatistics based inversion with the simsle algorithm at the continuum scale a karst aquifer can be treated as a heterogeneous continuous medium where karst conduits have higher hydraulic conductivities than the matrix thus the groundwater flow in the continuum scale karst aquifer can be described by the following equation 1 k x h q x p s s x h t subjected to the following initial and boundary conditions 2 h t 0 h 0 h γ 1 h 1 a n d k x h n γ 2 q where k x is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 h is the hydraulic head l x is the spatial coordinate l q xp is the pumping rate per unit volume of the aquifer l3 t 1 l 3 at the location xp t is time t and ss x is the specific storage l 1 in eq 2 h0 represents the initial head l h1 is the constant head l at the dirichlet boundary γ 1 q is the specific discharge l t at the neumann boundary γ 2 and n is a unit vector normal to γ 2 the simsle algorithm performs geostatistical inversions on the transient hydraulic heads the inverse model assumes that the natural logarithm of hydraulic parameter i e lnk is treated as a stationary stochastic process and the mean and correlation of hydraulic parameter field is known a priori similar to the sequential sle algorithm developed by yeh and liu 2000 the simsle algorithm calculates the hydraulic parameters iteratively firstly it applies the classical cokriging technique on the observed hydraulic parameters and the collected heads to create a map of cokriged log hydraulic conductivities then a successive linear estimator is implemented to improve the estimate hydraulic parameters by minimizing the differences between the simulated and observed heads with the improved estimates the governing flow equation is solved to obtain the conditional effective hydraulic parameter fields the unconditional covariances as well as the cross covariances calculated by a first order analysis with the covariance function of the head perturbations are updated and propagated to evaluate the weights of the new estimates iterations continue until convergence is achieved i e when changes in the simulated heads are smaller than the prescribed tolerance multiple data sets can be inverted simultaneously instead of sequentially thereby more constraints can be provided for the inverse problem the simultaneous feature of the simsle algorithm usually results in a faster convergence than the sequential sle the simsle algorithm has been implemented in the software vsaft2 yeh et al 1993 in this study we adopted vsaft2 to analyze the head responses from our pumping tests 3 2 the travel time based inversion with the sirt algorithm the travel time based inversion follows the procedure of seismic ray tomography and is supported by the transformation of the transient groundwater flow equation into the eikonal equation vasco et al 2000 brauchler et al 2011 it can be solved with ray tracing or particle tracking methods by a line integral the line integral is related to the arrival time of a hydraulic signal to the reciprocal value of hydraulic diffusivity vasco et al 2000 3 t peak x 2 1 6 x 1 x 2 ds d h s where tpeak is defined as the travel time of the peak of a transient pressure signal from the point x1 source to the observation point x2 receiver and dh is the hydraulic diffusivity as a function of arc length along the propagation path s here dh is defined as the quotient of the hydraulic conductivity over the specific storage in equation 3 the travel time can be naturally defined for the propagation of a dirac source pressure pulse however the line integral is also capable for inversions using other travel time diagnostics brauchler et al 2013 the travel time diagnostic can be defined as the time of a certain feature of a transient pressure response in this paper we used the peak and t 50 travel time diagnostics for example the t 50 travel time diagnostic is the time that the pressure response rises to 50 of the peak value as illustrated in figure s2 the line integral describes the relationship between the travel time and the hydraulic diffusivity therefore a set of travel time integrals forms an inverse problem yielding the hydraulic diffusivity values similar to the inversion methods for seismic signals or electromagnetic waves in geophysical tomography the sirt algorithm tomographically reconstructs the travel times and calculates the hydraulic diffusivity field in a discretized domain the sirt algorithm has been implemented in the software geotom3d geotom llc 2019 this software was originally designed for two or three dimensional seismic tomography jackson and tweeton 1996 and further applied to hydraulic tomography ht with multiple observation wells e g brauchler et al 2011 in this study a given pumping test of multiple observation location results in a set of transient pressure curves where each observation location yields one travel time from its corresponding transient pressure curve these travel times were then used for travel time based analysis performed by the geotom3d with the sirt algorithm the hydraulic diffusivity on each discretized grid is updated iteratively until the reconstructed and observed travel times have a best matching the staggered grid method böhm and vesnaver 1996 somogyvári and bayer 2017 kong et al 2018 is also utilized in this study which is based on the concept of multi grid to avoid excessive calculations it combines the advantages of a low resolution grid for stable inversion and the need for a high resolution hydraulic diffusivity computation the inversion is first solved over multiple coarse grids then shifted along each dimension to obtain a higher resolution result it can reduce the inversion bias caused by the relation between the source receiver locations and the grid geometry moreover the null space energy map is also calculated in this study to assess the reliability of different parts of the computed tomogram by masking out pixels with unreliable values böhm and vesnaver 1996 the null space energy map is computed by singular value decomposition of the tomographical matrix with a range between 0 and 1 the high value of the null space energy means a low density of the rays or streamlines at the local grid implying a highly uncertain inversion result that is the low value of the null space energy should indicate a more reliable result 4 inverse models 4 1 inversion for the physical karst aquifer in the sandbox 4 1 1 geostatistics based inversion with the simsle algorithm in this study the transient observed hydraulic heads were stochastically matched by the simsle algorithm to derive the hydraulic diffusivity field here the inverse model treated both the transient flow field and the natural logarithm of k as a multi gaussian second order stationary stochastic process illman et al 2007 in addition the mean and spatial correlation of the k field were known a priori in the inverse modeling we only considered the portion of the sandbox that contains the medium which is a quasi two dimensional vertical domain with a dimension of 115 cm 64 cm the domain was discretized to 46 32 elements each element was a rectangular grid of a dimension of 2 5 cm 2 cm the top left and right boundaries of the 2d domain were set as constant hydraulic head boundaries of 64 cm and the bottom of the domain was set as a no flow boundary input parameters of the inverse model included initial guesses of hydraulic parameters mean variance and spatial correlation scale the discharge rate of each cross hole pumping test and head measurements over time the initial fields of k and ss were assumed to be homogeneous with k and ss approximated as 0 6 cm s and 3 01 10 6 cm 1 respectively these two values were derived using vsaft2 on two cross hole pumping tests conducted at ports 17 and 32 in the analysis of these two pumping tests the aquifer was assumed to be homogeneous and the steady state heads were utilized to estimate the equivalent parameters for the entire aquifer illman et al 2010 these two pumping tests yielded 80 estimates for k and ss we then calculated the means of k and ss for the full inversion computation with the total 6 pumping tests in this study the required variances of lnk and lnss in the inverse model were initially set as 1 and 0 5 respectively although the variance estimation involves uncertainty the variance uncertainty has negligible effects on the estimated tomogram for transient hydraulic tomography as pointed out by illman et al 2007 in their numerical study the spatial correlation scale represents the characteristic size of heterogeneity and is critical for analyzing the average behavior of heterogeneous aquifers the determination of the correlation scale usually needs decent amount of data which are often difficult to be obtained in the field on the other hand if a large number of head measurements is available the site specific heterogeneity could be captured by ht if this is so the uncertainty in correlation scale has negligible impact on the tomography inversion yeh and liu 2000 this is the luxury for the current experiments therefore in this study the correlation scale was approximated based on the dimensions of conduits and the average thickness and average length of the sand layers liu et al 2007 illman et al 2010 berg and illman 2011 the horizontal and vertical correlation lengths were set as 40 cm and 8 cm respectively we utilized six independent cross hole pumping tests at ports 5 13 17 27 31 and 40 for ht analyses prior to each pumping test the pressure transducers were calibrated to ensure accurate measurements for each pumping test the transient heads recorded at the rest of the ports were selected as the data sets of the hydraulic tomographic survey drawdown records of excessive noise were excluded due to a poor polynomial fitting that will be explained in the next drawdowns at the pumping ports were also excluded because these measurements are noisy likely caused by the non pulsation free pumping we processed the transient drawdowns with various noise reduction schemes as discussed by illman et al 2007 2011 particularly following the work of liu et al 2007 and berg and illman 2011 we used a fifth order polynomial curve to fit the drawdown records over time to achieve a better fitting drawdown values at steady state were populated using the averaged value of drawdowns at steady state in this study the average r2 of all polynomial fittings for the inverse modeling is about 0 943 from the polynomial fitting curve five or six data points were extracted presumably these extracted data points capture the overall behavior of the transient drawdowns illman et al 2007 berg and illman 2011 zhao et al 2015 in total 1190 drawdowns were extracted from 223 transient drawdown curves for the ht inverse modeling using the simsle algorithm 4 1 2 travel time based inversion with the sirt algorithm the travel time based ht analysis was performed using geotom3d with the sirt algorithm similar to the aforementioned hydraulic head inversion using vsaft2 a homogeneous field was initialized for the travel time based inversion the initial coarse gridded model consisted of 16 elements in the horizontal direction length of the sandbox and 9 elements in the vertical direction height of the sandbox each element with a dimension of 10 cm 8 cm we then staggered coarse grid three times in both dimensions to reach a higher spatial resolution with a grid size of 2 5 cm 2 cm the required travel times for geotom3d were extracted from the same transient drawdown curves out of the six pumping tests as the geostatistics based ht inverse modeling using the simsle algorithm prior to the extraction the recorded hydraulic heads were smoothed with a moving average and then fitted with a fifth order polynomial function consisting of 6 terms and 6 coefficients the travel time points are the peak times of the pressure pulses determined from the first derivative of the polynomially fitted transient drawdown curves to some extent travel times capture an important feature of the transient drawdown curves although each transient drawdown curves only produced one travel time these extracted travel times still characterize the transient drawdown curves as pointed out by brauchler et al 2007 small travel time diagnostics reflect preferential flow paths while large travel time diagnostics reflect the integral behavior of the aquifer therefore early travel times are better suited to resolve the spatial distribution of hydraulic diffusivity of an heterogenous aquifer brauchler et al 2013 here we adopted the t 50 travel time diagnostic for the travel time based inversion to mitigate ray interference during inversion if multiple receivers of the same source are aligned in a straight line only the farthest receiver on both side of the source is included in the inversion in total 203 travel times were used for the travel time based inversion specifically cross hole pumping tests at ports 5 and 17 yielded 33 2 travel times of t 50 and cross hole pumping tests at ports 13 27 31 and 40 yielded 35 37 34 and 31 travel times of t 50 respectively for travel time based inversion the curved rays were used in the forward modeling the inversion quickly reached its convergence after only a few iterations and met the convergence criteria as shown by the root mean square rms residuals of the reconstructed travel times in figure s3 the null space energy map was computed by singular value decomposition of the tomographic matrix to filter out unfavored inverted hydraulic diffusivities with a cutoff value of 0 96 4 2 inversion for the numerical synthetic karst aquifer 4 2 1 geostatistics based inversion with the simsle algorithm same as the geostatistics based inversion performed on the experimental data the recorded hydraulic heads from forward numerical pumping tests were matched by the simsle algorithm to map the hydraulic diffusivity field for numerical synthetic aquifer the inverse model also treated both the transient flow field and the natural logarithm of k as a multi gaussian second order stationary stochastic process the domain dimensions used for the inverse modeling was 120 cm in length and 64 cm in height which was composed of rectangular elements with a size of 2 5 cm 2 cm the boundary conditions for the inverse modeling are the same as the forward modelling of pumping tests the initial fields of k and ss were assumed to be homogeneous and the mean of k and ss were 0 6 cm s and 3 10 6 cm 1 respectively the variances of lnk and lnss in the inverse model for numerical karst aquifer were initially set as 1 and 0 5 the horizontal and vertical correlation lengths were set as 40 cm and 8 cm same as the ones for the inversion of physical sandbox the six independent pumping tests were at the same locations of ports 5 13 17 27 31 and 40 the transient hydraulic heads were monitored at locations of other 41 ports i e excluding the pumping port and were selected as the inversion data set for each drawdown curve 5 data points at 0 005 min 0 02 min 0 1 min 0 3 min 5 min were extracted to represent the entire transient behavior according to the data time sampling strategy by sun et al 2013 and jiang et al 2022 in total 1230 drawdowns were extracted from 246 transient drawdown curves for the geostatistics based ht inversion of the numerical synthetic karst aquifer 4 2 2 travel time based inversion with the sirt algorithm for the travel time based inversion of numerical synthetic karst aquifer we also initialized a homogeneous field same as the aforementioned travel time based inversion for the physical sandbox karst aquifer the initial coarse gridded model also consisted of 16 elements in the horizontal direction and 9 elements in the vertical direction the dimension of each element was 10 cm 8 cm then we boosted to a higher spatial resolution with a grid size of 2 5 cm 2 cm by staggering the coarse grid three times in both horizontal and vertical directions the required travel times were extracted from the transient drawdown curves obtained from the 6 pumping tests in the forward simulations similar to the travel time based inversion for the physical karst aquifer if multiple receivers of the same source are aligned in a straight line only the farthest receiver on both side of the source is included in the inversion for the numerical synthetic aquifer we have computed the inversion with both the peak i e t 100 and t 50 travel times which yielded similar hydraulic diffusivity distributions considering that the travel times obtained from numerical synthetic aquifer are small and thus the value of peak travel time is easier to be determined than the t 50 travel time we opt to report the inversion using the peak travel time diagnostic for the numerical synthetic aquifer we obtained 222 travel times for the travel time based inversion we calculated null space energy map and a cutoff value of 0 96 is found suitable to constrain the dh tomograms for the filtering of the low trajectory regions 5 results and discussion 5 1 spatial distribution of hydraulic diffusivities for the physical sandbox karst aquifer the geostatistics based ht yielded both the hydraulic conductivity fig 2 a and the specific storage field fig 3 b while the travel time based ht also yielded the hydraulic diffusivity fig 2b and the specific storage field fig 4 b after applying the mask of null space energy for the un masked hydraulic diffusivity refer to figure s5 for the numerical synthetic karst aquifer fig 5 a shows the geostatistics based inverted hydraulic diffusivity field which is determined by the reconstructed hydraulic conductivity and the constant specific storage 3 10 6 cm 1 while fig 5b shows the travel time based inverted hydraulic diffusivity field after applying the mask of null space energy for the un masked hydraulic diffusivity refer to figure s6 the geostatistics based ht yielded almost a constant specific storage 3 10 6 cm 1 for the whole aquifer likely because the dimensions of aquifer and conduits are at the same order of magnitude because the travel time based ht only produces hydraulic diffusivity to reconstruct the spatial distribution of the specific storage we performed the attenuation inversion based on the sirt algorithm details refer to the supporting information due to the unreasonable large variation of the reconstructed specific storage fig 4b we decided to only compare the reconstructed hydraulic diffusivity from the two ht inversion methods for the geostatistics based inversion hydraulic diffusivities were calculated using the reconstructed hydraulic conductivity and specific storage for the travel time based inversion the hydraulic conductivity was calculated using its reconstructed hydraulic diffusivity and the constant specific storage from the geostatistics based inversion both ht inversions clearly produced high dh zones on and around the conduits but the positions and shapes of the predicted high dh zones are slightly different between the geostatistics based fig 2a and 5a and travel time based fig 2b and 5b inversions and between the physical sandbox fig 2 and the numerical synthetic aquifer fig 5 overall a satisfactory match can be concluded on the locations between the conduit zones and the high dh zones for conduit a the geostatistics based ht produced a horizontally elongated parallel to the conduit a high dh zone slightly above the conduit in the physical sandbox but slightly beneath the conduit in the numerical synthetic aquifer the travel time based ht also yielded a horizontally elongated high dh zone where the high dh zone perfectly overlays the conduit a in the physical sandbox but locates beneath the conduit a in the numerical synthetic aquifer for conduit b the geostatistics based ht produced a horizontally elongated high dh zone on the upper bound of the conduit in the physical sandbox but in the central of the conduit in the numerical synthetic aquifer in contrast the travel time based ht yielded a disc like high dh zone off the center of conduit b similarly its location in the physical sandbox is higher than the one in the numerical synthetic aquifer for conduit c in the physical sandbox the geostatistics based ht produced a scythe like high dh zone slightly on the upper bound of the conduit c in the numerical synthetic aquifer the geostatistics based ht produced a vertically elongated high dh zone inside the conduit c in contrast the travel time based ht yielded an offset disc like high dh zone in the physical sandbox in the numerical synthetic aquifer the travel time based ht yielded a large scythe like median dh zone on the conduit c for conduit d in the physical sandbox the geostatistics based ht produced a horizontally elongated high dh zone on the lower bound of the conduit d in the numerical synthetic aquifer the geostatistics based ht produced an inclined elongated high dh zone around the center of the conduit d in contrast the travel time based ht yielded a square high dh zone inside the conduit d in both the physical sandbox and the numerical synthetic aquifer in addition the geostatistics based ht predicted a median dh zone bridging conduits c and d towards the left end of the sand layer l14 fig 2a and 5a both ht techniques are able to map the sand layers of low hydraulic diffusivity figures 2 4 5 6 s5 and s6 the geostatistics based ht produced a low dh zone along the aquifer bottom while the travel time based ht yielded low dh zones immediately next to the high dh zones around the conduits the inverted dh fields also indicate that dh of the same sand layer is strongly influenced by the embedded conduit this is likely because the dimension of sand layers is similar to the ones of conduits in particular the geostatistics based ht predicted much higher hydraulic diffusivity than the values calculated using the specific storage 3 10 6 cm 1 and the hydraulic conductivities from hazen or kozeny carman model table s1 a slightly high dh zone near the aquifer top was predicted by the geostatistics based ht this high dh zone may be attributed to the lack of compaction of sands near the top illman et al 2007 2010 due to the low contrast in k among the sand layers and the high contrast between the sand layers and the conduit zones both geostatistics based and travel time based hts are not able to distinguish the boundaries between the sand layers the low dh zone of the sand layers l1 l2 and l3 can only be reasonably predicted by the geostatistics based ht at the bottom of the aquifer this could be related to the fact that the geostatistics based ht uses the boundary information but the travel time based ht does not moreover there is no source and receiver at the bottom of the aquifer so that rays passing through this area integrate unreliable information in the travel time based ht inversion thus the values of the null space energy in this areas are high resulting in highly uncertain inversion results both geostatistics based and travel time based hts are capable of approximately revealing the structures of the embedded karst conduits and producing similar spatial distributions of hydraulic diffusivity specifically the geostatistics based simsle algorithm yielded the high dh zones in a good agreement with the positions of the embedded karst structures it is likely that the simsle algorithm was benefited from the matching of multiple drawdown values from every drawdown curve while the sirt algorithm only matched one arrival time out of a drawdown curve on the other hand the travel time based sirt algorithm produced hydraulic diffusivities for sand layers in a better agreement with the values calculated using the specific storage 3 10 6 cm 1 and the hydraulic conductivities from hazen or kozeny carman model table s1 5 2 statistics of the inverted hydraulic diffusivities in this section we present statistical quantifications of the inverted hydraulic diffusivities from the two ht techniques for both physical and numerical karst aquifers note that for all inversion results only the diffusivities with lower null space energy are used for the quantification and comparison to ensure equal sample size for both inversion approaches tables s4 and s5 document the statistical properties minimum maximum mean and standard deviation of the inverted logdh with dh given in m2 s which is used for the rest of the paper for the simsle inversion logdh ranges from 0 61 to 3 93 and 0 96 to 3 25 for the physical and numerical aquifers with arithmetic means of 1 84 and 0 75 respectively these values show lower dh and k for the numerical aquifer indicating that the theoretical k derived from the core samples may be underestimated the actual transmissivity at the sand layer scale is probably much larger due to the scale effect for the travel time based inversion logdh ranges from 1 97 to 4 5 and 0 99 to 4 6 for the physical and numerical aquifers with arithmetic means of 0 04 and 0 61 respectively contrary to the simsle inversion results the numerical aquifer has a higher dh than the physical aquifer likely due to the larger travel time calculated from the actual pumping test data which will be discussed further in the following sections overall for both aquifers the maximum values of logdh inverted by the sirt algorithm are larger than the values inverted by the simsle algorithm while the minimum values are smaller the travel time based inversion yielded a larger standard deviation of logdh fig 6 displays the histograms and the cumulative frequency plots of logdh for the two different inversion approaches the histograms and cumulative frequency plots in fig 6a and 4c show a skewed normal distribution of logdh obtained from the simsle inversion in contrast fig 6b and 6d show two different distributions including a normal distribution for logdh 1 5 and a uniform distribution for logdh 1 5 these two distributions are clearly indicated in the cumulative frequency plots where a nearly linear behavior is shown for logdh 1 5 which is a characteristic of a uniform distribution the statistics of these four cases suggest that matrix and karst conduits cannot be distinguished with a fixed logdh value thus we propose to use the cumulative frequency plots from the travel time based inversion to find out the differentiation criterion and use this criterion also for the corresponding simsle inversion results as the area of the karst conduits should be the same for the two inversion algorithms the normal distribution is considered as the sand layers and the uniform distribution represents the karst conduits therefore for fig 6b and 6d with reference to the cumulative frequency plots 77 6 and 89 8 are used as the criterion with the corresponding logdh values of 0 59 fig 6b and 1 46 fig 6d respectively similarly these two percentages were used for fig 6a and 6c respectively for the physical aquifer pixels with logdh greater than 2 51 fig 6a are considered as karst conduits while for the numerical aquifer pixels with logdh greater than 2 08 fig 6c are considered as karst conduits the reason for two different percentages is that there are fewer pixels of the physical aquifer used for comparison referring to figs 2 and 5 the karst conduits seem to be well characterized in this way 5 3 comparison of local hydraulic diffusivity fig 7 compares the local hydraulic conductivity at the 42 observation points fig 1a obtained from the geostatistics based simsle algorithm and the travel time based sirt algorithm to facilitate the comparison a 1 1 identity line solid line is added to each subplot of fig 7 the size of the hollow circle represents the euclidean distance between the observation points and the nearest conduits the larger the hollow circle size the smaller the distance for the physical karst aquifer most of the inverted dh at the observation points deviate from the identity line fig 7a no clear relationship can be observed between the distance and the deviation of dh away from the identity line as previously concluded that in sand layers the travel time based ht yielded low dh zones immediately next to the high dh zones around the conduits while the geostatistics based ht produced a median dh zone specifically the geostatistics based inversion generally yielded higher dh about 1 2 orders of magnitude larger of sand layers than those obtained from the travel time based inversion this is likely because the geostatistics based ht inversion tends to produce a smooth transition in dh from the conduit zones to the surrounding sand layers due to the kriging and the forward flow model therefore it is difficult to match the local hydraulic diffusivity at the same position from the two tomograms on the contrary for the numerical karst aquifer most of the inverted dh are distributed around the identity line fig 7b the two dh obviously deviating from the identity line are located in the sand near the karst structure b the reason for its deviation is that the position of the high dh region from the travel time based inversion slightly above that from the geostatistics based inversion considering that the local hydraulic diffusivity at the same position from the two tomograms can be roughly matched in this sense the two hydraulic tomography inversions validate with each other 5 4 result validation and uncertainty discussion previous studies revealed that the simulation of independent pumping tests can provide rigorous quantitative assessments of the estimated parameters illman et al 2007 liu et al 2007 for geostatistics based inversion with the simsle algorithm we validate the inverted tomogram of hydraulic diffusivity by performing forward simulations of two additional pumping tests which were not used in the inversion calculations the forward simulations calculated the steady state drawdowns at the observation ports which were then compared to the observed values these two additional pumping tests were conducted at ports 9 and 34 at different times for travel time based inversion with the sirt algorithm the observed and reconstructed travel times are directly compared to evaluate the inversion uncertainty fig 8 shows the scatterplots of the observed versus the simulated values where fig 8a and 8b show the validation for the physical karst aquifer and fig 8c and 8d show the validation for the numerical karst aquifer fig 8a and 8c include a dashed line which is the linear regression to the data points the corresponding fitting coefficient is also shown in the plots the observed and simulated drawdowns measured from the numerical aquifer are approximately one order of magnitude larger than that of the physical aquifer which is the proof that the theoretical k values table s1 were underestimated moreover fig 8a and 8c show that the data points scatter around the identity line indicating a good match between the simulated drawdowns and the observed ones for such a heterogeneous aquifer no surprisingly the physical aquifer shows slightly more scattering due to the data noise and the much smaller drawdown in magnitude fig 8b and 8d show the comparison of the observed and reconstructed travel times for the travel time based inversion the error bars represent the standard deviations of the reconstructed travel times from the different staggered grids the observed and reconstructed travel times scatter along the identity line however for both two physical and numerical aquifers there are some travel times obviously deviating from the identity line in fig 8b the small travel times indicated by zone i mainly come from ports 23 24 27 30 and 31 near the conduits high dh zones this deviation of zone i is likely because the predicted diffusivities inside conduit c are underestimated in fig 8d although there are some travel times slightly deviating from the identity line the number of travel times that deviate from the identity line are smaller than the one obtained from the physical karst aquifer it is challenging for the geostatistics based ht with the simsle algorithm to handle strongly heterogeneous aquifers with high contrasts in k or dh like the karst conduits and the matrix since it treats the karst conduits as a porous continuum therefore the inverted dh may not perfectly correspond to the true values for the conduits and the matrix fig 2a this is the reason why there is a deviation of drawdowns at the monitoring ports when the inverted tomograms are utilized for predicting the steady state drawdowns for the two additional pumping tests fig 7a despite these slightly deviations in general the inverted tomograms are able to capture the observed drawdown behaviors at the monitoring ports this validation still indicates the robustness of the geostatistics based ht analysis with the simsle algorithm for such a heterogeneous karst aquifer our geostatistics based inversion has obtained a satisfactory imaging result in terms of accuracy and robustness although both early and late data were used for the geostatistics based ht in this study previous studies also show that the k fields could be well estimated by the simsle algorithm using the steady state heads if estimating ss fields is not the goal and the inversion process can be accelerated tremendously sun et al 2013 jiang et al 2022 this is valuable when accurate early head data from field hydraulic tests are scarce on the other hand for travel time based tomography the imaging accuracy is mainly determined by the initial grids and the spatial resolution depends on the staggered level because fewer rays are passing through the low dh zones some observed and reconstructed travel times may not match well thus the travel time based tomography seems to be more suitable for capturing local heterogeneity of high contrast in e g hydraulic conductivity considering that the hydraulic diffusivity of the karst structures differs greatly to the matrix one the travel time based inversion also yields acceptable results remarkably the travel time based ht only uses the early travel times with low computational inversion cost thus undoubtedly has the advantage of fast and stable inversion generally the two types of ht techniques implemented in this study mainly differ in three aspects the fundamental governing equations the inversion assumptions and the uncertainty presentation for the geostatistics based inversion the groundwater flow equation is adopted as the governing equation the geostatistical assumption is adopted in which the natural logarithm of hydraulic parameter is treated as a multi gaussian stationary stochastic process and the mean and correlation length of hydraulic parameter field are known the variogram model based on cokriging process often generates smooth spatial patterns the simsle algorithm improves the estimation of hydraulic parameters by minimizing the difference between simulated and observed heads and continuously updating the unconditional covariance as well as the cross covariance on the other hand for the travel time based inversion the eikonal equation transformed from the groundwater flow equation by an asymptotic solution is used as the governing equation it is assumed that the propagation of a hydraulic stimulation follows fermat s principle that is early arrivals characterizing the initial part of a signal follow the fastest pathways between the source and the receiver the sirt algorithm iteratively inverts the hydraulic parameters without imposing regularization since the inversion is overdetermined due to the coarse inverse model in the presence of the three differences both two inversion results could approximately reveal the structures of the embedded karst conduits and produce similar and reasonable hydraulic diffusivity fields as shown in our results thus these two ht techniques are promising tools to map the conduit position and the hydraulic parameters distribution of karst aquifers which is a challenge for decades the advantage of ht is that it does not rely on some specific hydrogeological information obtained by field exploration or drilling campaign including detailed deterministic or statistical information of the geometry of karst conduits experiences show neuman 2005 field and leij 2012 borghi et al 2016 that like fissures the sinkhole density on the surface outcrop is often different from those obtained from the boreholes it implies that this accessible geological information often may not accurately represent the internal conditions of karst formation in contrast the drawdown responses collected by a series of pumping tests provide necessary information for ht these responses are propagated in the main karst conduits carrying integral information on hydraulic properties of karst aquifer that is not easy to obtain therefore hydraulic tomography based on pumping data has great potential for mapping the karst media 6 conclusions the main objective of this paper is to explore the potential of hydraulic tomography ht for the characterization of the distribution and geometry of karst conduits at the laboratory scale a quasi 2d physical synthetic karst aquifer was constructed in a vertical sandbox which consisted of heterogeneous sand matrix and artificial karst conduits of different geometries a corresponding numerical synthetic karst aquifer was also evaluated using the same hydraulic parameters boundary conditions and karst conduits as the ones of the physical karst aquifer then we conducted six pumping tests at different locations to produce the pressure responses for the ht inversion of hydraulic diffusivity two types of ht techniques namely the geostatistics based inversion with the simsle algorithm and the travel time based inversion with the sirt algorithm were implemented and evaluated for physical and numerical synthetic karst aquifer we compared and analyzed the inverted diffusivity tomograms concluding that both the geostatistics based and travel time based inversions are capable of approximately revealing the structures of the embedded karst conduits and yielding similar and reasonable hydraulic diffusivities karst structures are able to be distinguished from the surrounding matrix with statistics analysis of the inverted diffusivity obtained by the travel time based inversion because the travel time based inversion yields high contrast between the diffusivities of karst structures and the surrounding matrix on the other hand it is evident that the geostatistics based simsle algorithm yields the zones of high hydraulic diffusivity in a slightly better agreement with respect to their positions of the embedded karst structures because the geostatistics based simsle algorithm incorporates the boundary conditions with the attempt of matching the observed hydraulic heads but the travel time based inversion does not in this study with the help of hydraulic head responses both ht techniques investigated can produce the characteristics of hydraulic parameters for the established aquifer and reveal the characterization of the heterogeneity of the karst structures with the cross hole pumping tests in both the physical and numerical synthetic karst aquifers the examined ht techniques have been proven to be a powerful method for identifying the locations of karst conduits and the spatial distribution of hydraulic parameters of aquifer in the laboratory scale we argue that in the case of data scarcity in large scale field experiments the travel time based inversion with the sirt algorithm may be favorable because early drawdown data are sufficient for estimate of travel times even with early drawdowns the travel time based inversion could capture reasonable values of hydraulic parameters and approximate distribution of the high dh zones these approximate estimates will aid in estimating the potential water storage in karst structures and predicting water seepage for some underground projects in karst areas when field hydraulic tests i e pumping tests wang et al 2021 and sequential water releasing tests liu et al 2020 could be performed for sufficiently long period of time the geostatistics based inversion should be further carried out the inverted hydraulic fields are valuable for distinguishing the boundary characteristics of karst structures providing a guidance for the better positioning of karst structures prior to underground projects and as prior information for stochastic inversion in addition besides head data geological data obtained from geophysical surveys and tracer tests data may be able to provide additional useful information about karst structures to improve the results of ht whenever it is possible geological information should also be incorporated into the hydraulic inversion modeling to yield better results credit authorship contribution statement xintong wang data

2423,in situ hydrologic monitoring over regions most susceptible to food insecurity can be a challenge in current times due to various socio economic and political issues in combination with environmental factors such as ongoing famine or drought hydrologic monitoring and initializing forecasts based on remotely sensed and analyzed data can contribute significantly to early warning in such regions routine hydrologic forecasts as provided by nasa s hydrologic forecasting and analysis system nhyfas are a recent addition to early warning systems a custom instance of nhyfas termed fldas forecast is used by fews net sland data assimilation system fldas the fldas forecast s dynamic forecasting component was originally set up with goddard earth observing system geos forecast inputs and has been recently expanded with precipitation forecast forcing from the north american multi model ensemble nmme this paper describes the improvements in seasonal hydrologic forecasts produced with this updated system evaluations in this study focus on soil moisture across southern africa s growing season soil moisture forecasts are benchmarked and evaluated relative to climatology based forecasts and historic runs which are driven by observation based meteorological forcing fields and they are verified with remotely sensed observations of soil moisture and vegetation through multiple deterministic and probabilistic skill assessments we show that using the larger ensemble of nmme precipitation inputs in the forecast system results in higher quality hydrologic forecasts than are allowed by climatology or geos only based forecasts further the near real time nmme based rootzone soil moisture forecasts were able to correctly predict developing drought conditions over southern africa through late 2019 and into early 2020 keywords hydrologic forecasts hydrologic forecast of extremes e g droughts north american multi model ensembles nmme land information system lis noahmp catchment land surface model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction there is acute food insecurity in many regions around the globe that are also subject to recurring drought conditions united nations 2018 early warning of drought and response at the right time could help a large number of people especially in the particularly food insecure regions of africa and the middle east vörösmarty et al 2005 getirana et al 2012 which are some of the most food insecure regions in the world the famine early warning systems network fews net https fews net verdin et al 2005 funk et al 2019 provides objective and evidence based analyses to help government decision makers and relief agencies plan for and respond to such humanitarian crises forecasting systems such as national oceanic and atmospheric administration s noaa s africa specific sub seasonal to seasonal s2s meteorological forecasts xthiaw and kumar 2015 and the national aeronautics and space administration s nasa s multi model remote sensing based hydrological forecasting and analysis system nhyfas arsenault et al 2020 are critical to such efforts seasonal forecasts of meteorological and hydrologic conditions are an important tool for early warning and also for developing and guiding strategic planning of water resources across different climate sensitive sectors

buchwitz et al 2017 http climate copernicus eu seasonal forecasts and world meteorological organization s wmo long range forecasts using multi model ensembles https www wmolc org there are operational hydrologic forecast products as well such as the global flood awareness system glofas emerton et al 2018 which provides probabilistic seasonal forecasts of river flow at up to four months lead time for a global river network and the africa drought and flood monitor http stream princeton edu yuan et al 2013 sheffield et al 2014 which provides hydrologic forecasts out to a week over select regions of africa using the canadian centre for climate modeling and analysis coupled climate model merryfield et al 2013 however wolski et al 2017 have highlighted the lack of finer than 100 km 10 spatial resolution country scale seasonal hydrologic forecasts of extreme conditions over africa hydrologic forecasts are of particular importance as they reduce the impact of extreme events by identifying high risk areas such forecasts for example could show how heavy precipitation upstream along a river may affect areas downstream that did not receive above average precipitation nhyfas developed by arsenault et al 2020 fills this gap producing high resolution seasonal hydrologic forecasts at 25 km 0 250 over continental africa and the middle east to support food and water security nhyfas has successfully demonstrated the forecasting of both hydrologic drought and flood risks across africa and the middle east arsenault et al 2020 it utilizes the data assimilation and modeling capabilities of nasa s land information system lis kumar et al 2006 peters lidard et al 2007 a modified version of nhyfas without data assimilation has been providing routine hydrologic forecasts across africa and the middle east since 2018 as a part of fews net sland data assimilation system fldas mcnally et al 2017 only this custom instance of nhyfas for fewsnet termed as fldas forecast is utilized in this study the fldas forecast system was initially set up with a single nmme dynamical model nasa s goddard earth observing system version 2 geos rienecker et al 2008 molod et al 2012 borovikov et al 2019 molod et al 2020 sub seasonal to seasonal s2s forecast system this fldas forecast system is considered version 1 ffv1 however various independent studies wang et al 2009 becker et al 2014 krakauer 2019 wanders and wood 2016 cash et al 2019 wanders et al 2019 have shown that nmme s s2s precipitation and temperature forecasts are significantly more skilful than any individual model including geos in the suite to leverage this multi model skill and to thereby improve the early warning system to support proactive drought management efforts the fldas forecast was upgraded to incorporate the full suite of nmme precipitation forecasts in combination with geos non precipitation forecast forcing fields this upgraded system is considered version 2 fldas forecast version 2 ffv2 using precipitation information from the nmme forecast suite is particularly beneficial given that precipitation is the primary driver for surface and ground hydrology the fldas forecast system is a multi land surface model lsm seasonal forecast system that uses nasa s capabilities in modeling and utilizing remote sensing based products and is set up specifically for continental africa and the middle east this system bias corrects and downscales all the meteorological forecast fields produced by the dynamical forecast system using well tested techniques keyed to satellite and station based data wood et al 2004 arsenault et al 2020 shukla et al 2020 the novelty in this study is the incorporation of the full suite of bias corrected and downscaled nmme precipitation and geos non precipitation meteorological forcings to produce multi lsm s2s hydrologic forecasts at 0 250 spatial resolution over continental africa and middle east one of the main outcomes of implementing nmme into the system s multiple lsms ensembles is a large increase in the number of ensemble members which allows us to examine the probabilistic nature of forecasted hydrological extremes the hypothesis tested in this study is that since the ensemble of nmme precipitation forecasts have better seasonal skill than any individual model s forecasts in the nmme suite the nmme based hydrological forecasts will also have more skill than those based only on the geos precipitation based forecasts various studies have already analyzed the meteorological forecast skill of the different nmme models out to the 6 month forecast lead mo and lyon 2015 shukla et al 2016 setiawan et al 2017 these studies have shown that using the full nmme suite provides more accurate forecasts than any single model several other studies have highlighted the importance of exploring the ensemble spread as a source of information regarding forecast uncertainty using various probabilistic metrics paiva et al 2012 van schaeybroeck and vannitsem 2015 in this paper we follow a combined approach of using deterministic analyses and probabilistic analyses of extremes to explore and demonstrate the benefits of using the full nmme ensemble in ffv2 compared to ffv1 and thereby determine whether or not including the full nmme suite is justified implementing nmme into the fldas forecast system was a substantial undertaking the main objectives of the present paper are 1 to describe the framework and methodology for including nmme precipitation forecasts into the fldas forecast system and 2 to demonstrate that the inclusion of this information improves hydrological forecasts relative to those obtained with geos based forecast information alone this study compares ffv2 to ffv1 and benchmarks the fldas forecast versions relative to ensemble streamflow prediction esp based forecasts the forecast performance is assessed in terms of i deterministic i e ensemble mean forecast skill analysis relative to historic model runs ii deterministic ensemble mean comparison of the nmme based fldas forecast system with remotely sensed observation and iii probabilistic forecast skill analysis of extreme conditions relative to historic model runs the evaluations focus on southern africa sa which has suffered consecutive droughts in the 1990s and from 2014 through 2020 edossa et al 2014 nash et al 2019 the next section describes the land information system lis along with the land surface models and the fldas forecast framework section 3 specifies the data sets used and the analysis s methodological approach results are presented in section 4 followed by a discussion of application and limitations of the system in section 5 a summary and a discussion of future developments is provided in section 6 2 framework ffv2 routinely produces monthly hydrologic forecasts over continental africa and the middle east fig 1 describes the schematic for fldas forecasts which includes establishing initial conditions for the forecasts using observation and reanalysis based meteorological data sets generating ensemble forecasts of hydrologic conditions based on nmme meteorological forecasts and producing drought and flood risk analysis products derived from the hydrological forecast data these steps are described in detail in the following subsections 2 1 land information system lis nasa s land information system lis kumar et al 2006 peters lidard et al 2007 is a high performance terrestrial hydrology modeling and data assimilation framework developed in the hydrological sciences laboratory at nasa s goddard space flight center lis is a flexible software framework that can be customized by end users according to their preference and expanded to meet their changing needs lis s land surface data toolkit ldt arsenault et al 2020 is used to parametrize the hydrological models and pre process model inputs in nhyfas and also in its custom instance fldas forecast the lsms utilized for fldas forecast through lis have groundwater schemes and are run in tandem with the hydrological modeling and analysis platform hymap getirana et al 2012 getirana et al 2017a hymap provides the river routing scheme and is driven by the total runoff from the lsms lis s land verification toolkit lvt kumar et al 2012 provides multiple evaluation and drought metrics the lis framework lisf is at the core of fldas forecast lisf also supports data assimilation strategies for forecast initialization which are currently in development data assimilation however is not currently utilized in fldas forecasts 2 2 fldas forecast modeling framework 2 2 1 land surface models and streamflow routing fldas forecast employs two lsms through lis noah with multi parameterizations noah mp niu et al 2011 and nasa s catchment lsm clsm koster et al 2000 it also uses the hymap river routing scheme these two lsms were also evaluated for water budget over eastern africa jung et al 2017 the entire system is currently set up over continental africa and the middle east at a spatial resolution of 0 25 x 0 25 and at a 15 minute model time step the hydrologic output is produced at monthly time step both the lsms have soil moisture profiles with water contents at surface noahmp 10 cm clsm 2 cm average 6 cm rootzone 1 m and total 2 m depths hydrological output includes surface and sub surface runoffs terrestrial water and through the application of hymap streamflow 2 2 2 fldas reanalysis the fldas forecast modeling framework generates non forecast historic simulations from 1982 to present termed as reanalysis or ra based on observational and reanalysis meteorological data sets following the setup of mcnally et al 2017 this long period of record nearly 40 years is critical for drought and flood risk assessment the ra uses precipitation inputs from climate hazards center infrared precipitation with station data version 2 0 chirps funk et al 2015 all other requisite meteorological inputs are from nasa s modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 bosilovich et al 2016 gelaro et al 2017 the fldas forecast uses chirps prelim funk et al 2015 https data chc ucsb edu products chirps 2 0 prelim only for near real time monitoring and producing forecast initial conditions because the 3 day latency of this product allows model updates close to real time for all prior time steps the system uses the chirps final 6 hourly product dinku et al 2018 http data chc ucsb edu products chirps 2 0 africa 6 hourly which has a latency of 2 3 weeks and is available for continental africa and part of the middle east domain merra 2 data have about an internal 10 day latency which is sufficient for seasonal climate forecast initialization and monitoring the ra is used to initialize the nmme ensemble geos only and esp based forecast model runs and is considered the primary reference data set in this study 2 2 3 meteorological forcing data for nmme based hydrologic forecasts the meteorological forecasts used in setting up ffv2 are dynamic the meteorological fields within the models that produce them evolve in time in response to imposed dynamical equations in the modeled atmospheric and ocean components and parameterizations of physical processes such as turbulence and moist convection ffv2 uses dynamical precipitation forecasts from the nmme suite nmme provides near real time monthly forecasts based on 98 ensemble members and hindcasts 1982 2010 based on 68 ensemble members from the climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 saha et al 2010 2014 geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory s gfdl delworth et al 2012 vecchi et al 2014 forecast oriented climate model version 2 5 canadian coupled models cancm4i and gnemo lin et al 2020 the ncar climate system model version 4 ccsm4 gent et al 2011 and nasa global modelling and assimilation office s gmao geos version 2 geosv2 borovikov et al 2019 as provided in table 1 a particular innovation of ffv2 is that it has the flexibility to run any combination of the nmme suite s models ffv1 is a subset of this option it uses the meteorological forcings from geosv2 alone the current ffv2 system employs all active nmme models with all the ensemble members as of 2021 table 1 most models have 10 ensemble members the only exception is cfsv2 for which we use 12 of the 24 ensemble members to aptly handle the processing of the model for gfdl flor we use all the 24 ensemble members but average each of the 12 members of its two sub models to have 12 averaged ensemble members in case of the hindcast period 1982 2010 because the nmme does not provide the full complement of required input fields e g temperature radiation winds ffv2 uses non precipitation meteorological forcings from geos seasonal forecasts the geos seasonal forecasts consist of 10 ensemble members for real time applications and 4 ensemble members for the hindcast period 1982 2010 the smaller number of geos non precipitation ensemble members are in part randomly matched with the nmme based precipitation ensemble members in the ffv2 setup for example geos s four non precipitation ensemble members are first matched twice up to the first eight out of the ten precipitation ensemble members of ccsm4 and then randomly matched to the last two precipitation ensemble members of ccsm4 in the hindcast period for the near real time period geos s non precipitation ensemble members and ccsm4 precipitation ensemble members are matched one to one the meteorological forecasts are then bias corrected and spatially downscaled bcsd wood et al 2004 using the ra based meteorological data sets chirps and merra 2 as the reference data following the methods outlined in arsenault et al 2020 forecasts from climate models do not usually match the statistical properties of the ra inputs e g due to lead dependent climate drift gupta et al 2013 hermanson et al 2018 bias correction is used to reduce such errors cui et al 2012 the bcsd method used in this study has been evaluated and verified across africa for nhyfas arsenault et al 2020 shukla et al 2020 2 2 4 esp based hydrologic forecasts in addition to nmme fldas forecast can also employ the esp type forecasting approach twedt et al 1977 day 1985 yuan et al 2015 li et al 2009 yossef et al 2017 the esp forecasts are climatology based and use the same observed inputs chirps and merra 2 as ra lis configures the ensemble of meteorological forecast members by assembling individual years from the historical merra 2 and chirps meteorological data taking each historical year as a representation of a potential single forecast thus the 1982 2011 chirps and merra 2 data holdings allow us to produce 30 ensemble members for each initial condition the skill of the hydrological esp forecast is derived only from the initial hydrological conditions in this study the esp based forecast is used as a benchmark for both versions of fldas forecast output as both dynamic forecast inputs are bias corrected and downscaled relative to the same sets of observed data that go into esp based runs also the initial conditions are the same for the esp based forecasts and both versions of fldas forecast 2 2 5 summary of fldas forecast version 2 workflow the fldas forecast workflow illustrated in fig 2 consists of three main steps 1 pre processing 2 lis based processing and 3 post processing during the pre processing step all nmme precipitation and complementary geos non precipitation fields needed to run the lsms are gathered downscaled and bias corrected relative to chirps and merra 2 data sets respectively and are then temporally disaggregated to sub daily time steps 6 hour intervals in the lis based processing section the two lsms noahmp and clsm are run with the forcing data produced in the previous step producing a combined model total of 196 near real time hydrologic forecast ensemble members and 136 hindcast ensemble members per forecast start date the ffv1 considered in this study produces a total of 20 ensemble members for near real time forecasts and 8 ensemble members for the hindcasts in this step fldas forecast is also configured in esp mode for the same set of lsms and initial conditions to produce esp based forecasts with a total of 60 ensemble members per forecast start date in the post processing step we analyze the near real time hydrologic forecast outputs for hydrologic extremes such as droughts and flood potentials relative to hindcast climatology these results are updated on our webpage https ldas gsfc nasa gov fldas models forecast by the second week of every month and are provided to our fews net partners and to regional scientists 2 2 6 derived products derived products enhance fews net s early warning capabilities by allowing regional experts to visualize the potential hydrologic impacts of forecasted climate fldas forecast based real time esp forecasts over africa are used to produce probabilistic tercile maps for rootzone soil moisture rzsm to indicate the likelihood of above normal greater than 67th percentile normal between 33rd to 67th percentile and below normal less than 33rd percentile conditions these conditions especially below normal a potentially drought like condition in hydrology forms the basis of various categorical probabilistic evaluations in this study the esp forecast percentiles are derived from the ra based output and the tercile maps provide estimates of hydrologic conditions when the input meteorological forcings are considered to be climatologically average for forecast initial conditions similarly nmme rzsm forecast based probabilistic tercile maps are also produced over africa and the middle east where percentiles are based on the nmme rzsm hindcasts the terciles describe the likelihood of the three categories based on the ensemble members additionally ffv2 routinely provides the ensemble median of nmme based forecasted soil moisture percentile anomaly standardized anomaly and percent saturation along with 3 month aggregates of soil moisture percentile anomaly and standardized anomaly https ldas gsfc nasa gov fldas models forecast 3 methodology the impact of implementing nmme in fldas forecast was evaluated by assessing improvements in deterministic forecast skill ensemble spread and probabilistic forecast skill all the assessments are focused on the forecasts covering the wet season over sa as it is the critical growing season for crops laux et al 2009 sultan et al 2010 mubaya et al 2012 trambauer et al 2015 seibert et al 2017 hence forecasts initialized with hydrologic conditions covering the start of the wet season september october and november son are considered in this study the following subsections describe the evaluation data set as well as our analysis approach 3 1 dataset for all the analyses in this study except those using remotely sensed observations the esp ffv1 and ffv2 forecasts and the ra are first standardized by converting them to percentiles for the analyses using remotely sensed observations all the data sets are standardized by converting them to standardized anomalies due to the observation s relatively short temporal extent unless otherwise noted all the forecasts esp ffv1 and ffv2 are then averaged over three months of data data at zero lead i e over the first month of the forecast at 1 month lead over the 2nd month of the forecast and so on out to the 5 month lead for simplicity we will refer to the 0 month lead through 5 month lead averages as ond for october november and december start dates ndj djf jfm fma and mam respectively the initial condition ic period covers the start of the rainy season son and is provided by the ra usually skill is lost with increasing forecast lead hence averaging the forecasts starting from the three different ic months helps isolate for each lead the forecast signal from the noise since ra is used as the truth to evaluate the seasonal forecasts it is also averaged over the ond ndj djf jfm fma and mam periods we will hereafter use hindcast interchangeably with forecast for the sake of clarity 3 2 deterministic forecast skill analysis for all deterministic skill assessments of rzsm top 1 m forecasts we consider the ensemble mean as it is the best deterministic forecast ehrendorfer 1997 we calculate the anomaly correlation ac and the root mean squared error rmse between the ensemble mean of esp ffv1 and ffv2 seasonal rzsm forecast percentiles with respect to the ra perfect run rzsm percentiles which are used here as the truth for validating the forecasts the anomalies used in ac are computed by subtracting the seasonally varying climatologies from the individual monthly values forecasts or ra both metrics are assessed over the period of 1982 2010 the equations used for computing them are provided in appendix 1 equations 1 and 2 the ac is chosen as one of the evaluation metrics as it shows how well the variabilities of the forecast anomalies match the variability of the ra anomalies it does not however provide any information about the magnitude of forecast error which is determined using rmse statistical significance for ac is determined using the fisher transformation the fisher transformation ensures gaussian distribution of the ac coefficients and the z score provides the probability value p value of the correlation coefficient for esp ffv1 and ffv2 with ra for both metrics we also determine the differences between values produced by ffv1 and ffv2 the significance of the difference of ac between the fldas forecast versions is also determined using fisher transformation the statistically significant values for ac and ac differences are provided at the 95 confidence interval appendix 1 equations 1a and 1b further to estimate the best forecast s deterministic accuracy relative to observations we calculate the correlation appendix 1 equation 3 between the seasonal ra and ensemble mean of the forecast s surface soil moisture ssm top 6 cm standardized anomalies with respect to remotely sensed soil moisture and vegetation standardized anomalies both the remotely sensed observations are first spatially upscaled to 25 km before being standardized we map the correlation between the ssm and the nasa soil moisture active passive smap mission standardized anomalies between 2015 and 2020 smap provides high quality soil moisture estimates posted at 9 km spatial and daily temporal resolution entekhabi et al 2016 in addition to correlations with smap we also compute the correlation between model ssm and global inventory monitoring and modeling system s gimms normalized difference vegetation index ndvi spruce et al 2016 tucker 1978 standardized anomalies between 2010 and 2018 the gimms vegetation index is available at 0 25 km spatial and 8 day temporal resolution to correlate the seasonal ra and forecasts relative to both of these remotely sensed observations the observations are also averaged over the seasonal periods of ond ndj djf jfm fma and mam for the correlation with remotely sensed observations the fisher transformation is used to test the significance which we provide at the 95 confidence interval 3 3 ensemble spread analysis before studying the probabilistic features of the ensembles in the seasonal forecasts we analyze the ensemble spreads of ffv2 and ffv1 as ensemble spread is often related to uncertainty grimit and mass 2007 hopson 2014 van schaeybroeck and vannitsem 2015 we compare the ensemble spreads of the rzsm forecasts over 1982 to 2010 through the sixth forecast lead between the fldas forecast versions for each initial condition ic month september october and november the ensemble spread is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values across each forecast ensemble fortin et al 2014 appendix 1 equation 4 3 4 probabilistic forecast skill analysis for hydrologic drought we use different probability metrics to examine how often the forecasts are accurate and this requires categorizing certain forecast events this in fact fits in well with our interest in categories of soil moisture drought below normal unless otherwise noted here too we average the forecasts covering the period 1982 2010 over the different lead periods ond ndj djf jfm fma and mam and over the ic months son which represents the start of the rainy season the probability metrics are based on all the ensembles present in each of the three forecasts first we compute the rank probability skill score rpss müller et al 2005 which describes the quality of categorical probabilistic forecasts for drought both at the seasonal and sub seasonal scales for this calculation drought conditions are categorized as an rzsm less than the 33rd percentile rpss is based on the rank probability skill rps which is the cumulative squared probability error the ratio of the difference between the climatological rps and forecast rps to the climatological rps is the rpss appendix 1 equation 5 rpss rewards a forecast for the number of ensemble members that fall within the observed category the larger that number is the higher the rpss an rpss greater than 0 is considered skilful in comparison to the climatological forecast and an rpss of 1 indicates a perfect forecast for the rpss we adopted the threshold of above five percent 5 as representing good skill in a forecast following goddard and dilley 2005 to support the results of rpss we also compute the forecast hit rate for drought conditions by creating a contingency table and using the ratio of forecasted drought events rzsm less than 33rd percentile and observed drought events appendix 1 equation 6 reliability diagrams representing probability of seasonal forecast events relative to observations are also included in the probabilistic analysis these are graphs of the observed frequency of a categorical event plotted against the forecast probability of that event during our hindcast period of study from 1982 to 2010 over sa brocker and smith 2007 wilks 1995 jolliffe and stephenson 2003 similar to the rpss analysis we define drought category using rzsm percentiles this diagram is useful for decision making purposes as it tells users how often a given forecast probability of a certain category drought matches the frequency of the event in observations a perfectly reliable forecast system would have a 1 1 association with the observed frequency e g a forecast probability of 50 will be associated with observed frequency of 50 in this study the reliability diagram is plotted by dividing the forecast probabilities 0 1 0 into 10 bins and estimating observed frequency of a given category for each of those bins finally we compute the relative operating characteristics roc mason and graham 1999 hogan and mason 2012 siegmund et al 2015 a complementary metric to the reliability diagram roc is used in forecast verification to measure the ability of the forecasts to distinguish an event from a non event it utilizes plots of the probabilistic hit rate hr to false alarm rate far for a given category drought it is plotted by constructing a contingency table for drought with hr probabilities y axis plotted against the far probabilities x axis by dividing the respective probabilities of 0 to 1 0 into 10 bins a perfect roc curve would have high hr probability relative to the far probabilities lending further confidence to the forecast accuracy 4 results and discussion 4 1 deterministic analysis fig 3 and row 1 in table 2 present forecast skill as represented by anomaly correlation coefficient acc of the rzsm forecast percentiles relative to the ra percentiles the ensemble mean seasonal forecasts are averaged over ond ndj djf jfm fma and mam following the son ics the first row of fig 3 is the skill acc of the seasonal hydrological esp forecast where skill is derived from the initial hydrological conditions alone moderate skill is seen at lead 1 and lead 2 at 0 3 0 6 acc with localized areas of 0 8 acc in the democratic republic of congo rzsm skill for both ffv1 and ffv2 shown in rows 2 and 3 fig 3 respectively is higher than the esp based seasonal forecast skill row 1 in terms of area averages the skills over southern africa table 2 row 1 for both ffv1 and ffv2 are about 0 1 0 15 acc larger than that for esp skill in the early part of the season the overall acc of all the seasonal forecasts decreases with increasing lead however the acc of both the dynamical versions of the seasonal forecasts lasts longer than that of the esp seasonal forecasts this is expected though not assured given that the dynamical models are deriving skill from both initial conditions and the forecasted meteorology with the latter providing skill at longer leads importantly ffv2 has higher acc than ffv1 as seen in the last row of fig 3 many regions show improvements of more than 0 2 acc with ffv2 relative to ffv1 a difference that is statistically significant as determined by the fisher transformation appendix 1 b the figure also shows that the difference between the skill of ffv2 and ffv1 is relatively smaller in the first lead because of greater influence of ic than in the longer leads although there are some areas in sa that show ffv2 with lower skill than ffv1 those areas are relatively small these results are similar to those shown by becker et al 2014 for precipitation forecasts over the northern hemisphere 23 75 n where acc for the entire nmme suite based forecast was found to be significantly more skilful than that for the geos model alone in addition to acc we compared the root mean squared error rmse of the three forecast percentiles fig 4 relative to the ra percentiles here too we provide results for the ensemble means at the six forecast leads ond ndj djf jfm fma and mam the results are similar to those for acc the rmse values gradually increase with lead for all three forecasts as expected the rmse values at 0 month lead are the lowest given the proximity of this lead to the ic rmses for both ffv1 and ffv2 rows 2 and 3 respectively are smaller than those for esp row 1 consistent in terms of skill with what was found in fig 3 for acc also outside of a few small areas ffv2 shows higher skill lower rmses than ffv1 the areally averaged seasonal forecast rmses tabulated in table 2 row 2 confirm that rmses in all forecasts increase with lead and that ffv2 produces the lowest rmses the latter further highlighting the improvements obtained with the nmme based fldas forecast 4 2 comparison to observations we show above that ffv2 provide forecasts that agree best with the ra model products here we evaluate the ffv2 forecasts directly against observations we compare the correlation r between the seasonal ra and ffv2 ensemble mean top 6 cm ssm with seasonal smap soil moisture top 5 cm over sa between 2015 and 2020 there is generally a good agreement between the ra and smap values in row 1 of fig 5 where a large section over the eastern part of southern africa shows more than 0 9r and with most of the other regions showing significant values of more than 0 6r even the ffv2 based ensemble mean seasonal forecasts row 2 of fig 5 show significantly high correlations r 0 6 with smap over large areas of sa out to the 2 month lead djf with gradually decreasing values thereafter results of the correlation between ra and ffv2 ensemble mean ssm with gimms ndvi over sa between 2010 and 2018 are similar fig 6 the seasonal ra ssm row 1 shows good agreement with ndvi with significant values of more than 0 7r over large sections of eastern and central sa through the djf season the correlation tapers off during jfm and fma but recovers in the mam season the reason for this behaviour may be related to the fact that the timing of peak seasonal precipitation differs from the timing of peak seasonal ndvi by mam the harvest season both ssm and ndvi reduce in similar manner explaining the high correlation ffv2 ssm also shows significant correlation values of more than 0 5r over considerable regions of eastern and central sa out to the third lead month djf after which it tapers off however ndvi based results show lower correlations than the smap based results the areally averaged correlations between smap ndvi and ra esp ffv1 and ffv2 ssm are provided in table 2 row4 smap and row5 ndvi as was found in the ra analysis comparisons against the remotely sensed data show that ffv2 is more skilful than either esp or ffv1 however the skill of the forecasts relative to the observations is much smaller as are the differences in skill between esp ffv1 and ffv2 both smap and ndvi based forecast correlations show particularly lower correlation values in the fourth jfm and fifth fma seasonal leads compared to the sixth seasonal lead mam this dip in correlation of forecasted ssm can be attributed to the ssm forecasts inability to correctly predict the magnitude of moisture at the peak period of the wet season jfm fma at longer leads which produces lower ssm variability in forecasts than in the observations when the seasonal ssm forecast lead is towards the end of the wet season mam the variabilities are captured better and therefore have higher correlation values than the previous two leads the deterministic analyses evaluated the ensemble mean of the dynamical and esp forecasts showing that the ensemble mean of ffv2 has higher skill and accuracy than the ffv1 and esp ensemble mean forecasts at the seasonal scale over sa however these evaluations do not consider the probabilistic nature of the forecasts which is the main reason for updating the version of fldas forecast with a much larger number of ensemble members the next section of this study evaluates the probabilistic skill of these forecasts over sa 4 3 probabilistic analysis of droughts the ensemble spreads of ffv2 based and ffv1 based rzsm forecasts through the monthly leads of each son ic are illustrated in fig 7 the september through november ics forecasts ensemble spread are stacked in the figure and the ffv2 monthly rzsm ensemble forecasts show a larger spread by 0 02 0 1 m3 m3 as compared to the ffv1 based forecasts for all ics over large regions of sa except over the very dry regions of namibia south africa and the democratic republic of congo where the difference in spread is less than 0 03 m3 m3 the ensemble spread is seen to increase through the wet season peaking in february and reducing thereafter for both the forecast version and the three initial conditions over sa the forecasts are now evaluated for extremes droughts by using the ranked probability skill score rpss this metric describes the quality of categorical probabilistic forecasts fig 8 shows the rzsm forecast rpss for conditions when rzsm is less than the 33rd percentile categorized as drought hereafter as shown in fig 8 ffv2 row 3 exhibits rpss above 50 over a larger region of sa compared to the ffv1 and esp forecasts row 2 and row 1 we find both the dynamic models forecast rpss to be better than that of esp and we find that the ffv2 forecast rpss is 10 20 better than that of ffv1 row 4 rpss decreases with increasing lead for all three forecasts but not as rapidly as it does for the deterministic skill retaining significant rpss of over 5 until the sixth seasonal forecast lead these results are also confirmed by areally averaged rpss for the seasonal leads table 2 row 3 additionally more areas over sa show higher rpss in ffv2 relative to ffv1 than found for the deterministic skill assessment the nmme forecasts are also known to have good skill in the sub seasonal or monthly scale wanders and wood 2016 cash et al 2019 the ffv2 rzsm rpss values in the drought category are evaluated separately for each of the early season s monthly ics over sa to further evaluate the sub seasonal probabilistic skill in rzsm fig 9 shows monthly forecast rpss through the sixth lead for the september to november ics the forecast rpss values are progressively higher as the wet season advances from september to november ic the october ic forecasts have an average of 2 higher rpss than the september ic forecasts the november ic forecasts have on average another 2 higher skill score than the october ic forecasts during the first three forecast leads this increase in skill score can be attributed to the availability of more moisture in the initial condition with the advancing wet season the september ic is relatively dry and the dryness persists through the hydrologic forecasts hence forecasts made with september ics are more likely to have more false alarms for drought conditions than the forecasts initialized during later months that have higher soil moisture content leading to lower rpss for the september ic forecasts to support this argument ffv2 rzsm hit rate hr for drought conditions in fig 10 shows ffv2 forecasts initialized in september have an average of 2 lower hr than those initialized in october and november these results are also reflected in the areally averaged monthly ffv2 rpss and hr values table 3 rows 1 3 hence it can be concluded that hydrologic forecasts made further into the early wet season have better drought based rpss and hr in the first three to four forecast lead months than those made too early in the season fig 11 presents reliability diagrams for the esp ffv1 and ffv2 seasonal forecasts son ics over sa in the upper row reliability diagrams diagnose categorical forecast quality by plotting the observed frequency of a categorical event against the forecast probability of that event in this case drought the highest reliability is shown by the forecast closest to the diagonal ffv2 shows better drought forecast reliability than esp and ffv1 through all the forecast seasonal leads though the overall reliability decreases with increasing lead the lower row in fig 11 presents the relative operating characteristics roc curve for the same set of seasonal forecasts rocs which are used to measure the ability of the forecasts to distinguish an event from a non event are shown here as plots of the probabilistic hit rate hr to false alarm rate far for a given category taken here to be drought at low leads the hr for ffv2 in fig 10 is initially much larger than the far which brings the trajectory of the ffv2 curve closer to the top left hand corner this trajectory indicates that ffv2 rzsm has a better roc than esp and ffv1 that is a better ability to discriminate events from non events the roc of all forecasts decreases with increasing lead ffv2 still shows the best roc across all leads even at longer leads showing ffv2 is better at discriminating events drought condition from non events non drought conditions 4 4 application and limitations the results thus far indicate that ffv2 forecasts can serve as a useful tool in the early reporting of extreme events as an example the near real time rzsm forecast percentiles with five monthly leads for october 2019 ic fig 12 a are able to aptly forecast severe drought conditions over parts of the sa region as corroborated by news reports in nasa s earth observatory carlowicz and dauphin 2019 relief web 2019 and the new humanitarian anyadike 2019 the fldas forecast based rzsm percentiles use a drought severity category scale similar to that of the climate prediction center cpc and united states drought monitor usdm which uses five classifications to characterize a soil moisture percentile in the context of drought i abnormally dry d0 21 30 percentile showing areas that may be going into or are coming out of drought ii moderate drought d1 10 20 percentile iii severe drought d2 6 10 percentile iv extreme drought d3 3 5 percentile and v exceptional drought d4 0 2 percentile in fig 12 a the november 2019 through march 2020 ffv2 rzsm forecasts of extreme to severe drought conditions in sa is found consistent with the crop monitor alert geoglam 2019 and other alerts like the joint call for action s world food programme wfp 2019 further fig 12 b provides the probability of below normal normal and above normal rzsm conditions over the region the below normal conditions highlight the likelihood of potentially severe drought like conditions the probability of below normal conditions i e drought was found to have a probability of over 60 over parts of south africa botswana and namibia results presented in this study are limited by the initialization of a single season and a relatively small study domain this work is intended to support remote early warning in the vulnerable regions of the world where there are few in situ data sets to support this type of analysis other limitations include the absence of complementary meteorological fields for driving land surface and hydrology models like wind radiation humidity and surface pressure from the different nmme modeling centers forecast data sets this leads to the less optimal option of combining the nmme precipitation forecasts with the gmao geos forecasts for the other meteorological fields which may lead to potential inconsistencies such as high solar radiation during times of high rainfall we currently have no way to quantify the impact of this limitation further improvements to the system inputs could also be made by using higher resolution data sets such as the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis version 5 era5 and the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg or other relevant reanalyses and or satellite based products for the bias correction and downscaling procedures 5 conclusions this study evaluates the nmme based fldas soil moisture forecasts relative to an observation based forcing driven reanalysis ra through deterministic and probabilistic analyses the entire nmme suite of precipitation forecasts is now used in fldas forecast as it has higher skill than any of the individual forecast products in the suite because the original version of fldas forecast ffv1 used only geos based inputs the updated fldas forecast ffv2 is shown to perform better here we demonstrate and quantify this improved performance by examining ffv1 and ffv2 forecasts over southern africa using the same simulation design as used for producing routine real time hydrologic forecast products results show that the ffv2 based rzsm forecasts have higher deterministic skill than ffv1 both versions of fldas forecast are also found to have better deterministic skill and probabilistic accuracy than the esp based forecasts through the wet season over southern africa which is also the main growing season in that region additionally the ra ssm shows excellent correlation with remotely sensed observations like smap and ndvi through the wet season over southern africa the nmme based ssm forecasts also show good correlation with these observations until the third seasonal forecast lead which includes the peak of the wet season hence ffv2 shows promise for forecasting the main part of this season well further ffv2 based rzsm forecasts yield higher ensemble spread through the wet season compared to ffv1 based forecasts probabilistically the ffv2 based seasonal rzsm forecasts also have higher rpss for the drought category a monthly probabilistic analysis of the wet season showed that for the ffv2 based forecasts rpss and hr for drought over southern africa improves with later initializations during the wet season in addition the probabilistic drought study over the region shows that the ffv2 based rzsm forecasts have better reliability and roc scores than either the ffv1 or esp forecasts highlighting an improved ability to discriminate events droughts from non events the probabilistic analyses also show that both versions of fldas forecast have higher forecast skill and quality than esp based forecasts through the wet season over southern africa in presenting a past operationally based case near real time ffv2 based rzsm percentiles for october 2019 ics successfully predicted drought like conditions over southern africa having a larger number of ensemble members we could provide highly reliable probabilities of drought conditions through the forecast lead months this work shows that updating fldas forecast with the entire nmme s2s suite allows for more skilful hydrologic forecasts future work will aim to integrate nmme s2s based surface temperature along with precipitation into the system and will expand the domain to cover the globe the setup may also expand to improve initial conditions by including multivariate data assimilation ingesting for example assimilating leaf area index lai kumar et al 2019 and soil moisture information draper and reichle 2019 rahman et al 2022 sabater et al 2008 the near real time products have been very useful in providing potential drought forecasts these drought based products will continue to provide support for usaid s fews net as well as for other ongoing early warning systems credit

2423,in situ hydrologic monitoring over regions most susceptible to food insecurity can be a challenge in current times due to various socio economic and political issues in combination with environmental factors such as ongoing famine or drought hydrologic monitoring and initializing forecasts based on remotely sensed and analyzed data can contribute significantly to early warning in such regions routine hydrologic forecasts as provided by nasa s hydrologic forecasting and analysis system nhyfas are a recent addition to early warning systems a custom instance of nhyfas termed fldas forecast is used by fews net sland data assimilation system fldas the fldas forecast s dynamic forecasting component was originally set up with goddard earth observing system geos forecast inputs and has been recently expanded with precipitation forecast forcing from the north american multi model ensemble nmme this paper describes the improvements in seasonal hydrologic forecasts produced with this updated system evaluations in this study focus on soil moisture across southern africa s growing season soil moisture forecasts are benchmarked and evaluated relative to climatology based forecasts and historic runs which are driven by observation based meteorological forcing fields and they are verified with remotely sensed observations of soil moisture and vegetation through multiple deterministic and probabilistic skill assessments we show that using the larger ensemble of nmme precipitation inputs in the forecast system results in higher quality hydrologic forecasts than are allowed by climatology or geos only based forecasts further the near real time nmme based rootzone soil moisture forecasts were able to correctly predict developing drought conditions over

of africa using the canadian centre for climate modeling and analysis coupled climate model merryfield et al 2013 however wolski et al 2017 have highlighted the lack of finer than 100 km 10 spatial resolution country scale seasonal hydrologic forecasts of extreme conditions over africa hydrologic forecasts are of particular importance as they reduce the impact of extreme events by identifying high risk areas such forecasts for example could show how heavy precipitation upstream along a river may affect areas downstream that did not receive above average precipitation nhyfas developed by arsenault et al 2020 fills this gap producing high resolution seasonal hydrologic forecasts at 25 km 0 250 over continental africa and the middle east to support food and water security nhyfas has successfully demonstrated the forecasting of both hydrologic drought and flood risks across africa and the middle east arsenault et al 2020 it utilizes the data assimilation and modeling capabilities of nasa s land information system lis kumar et al 2006 peters lidard et al 2007 a modified version of nhyfas without data assimilation has been providing routine hydrologic forecasts across africa and the middle east since 2018 as a part of fews net sland data assimilation system fldas mcnally et al 2017 only this custom instance of nhyfas for fewsnet termed as fldas forecast is utilized in this study the fldas forecast system was initially set up with a single nmme dynamical model nasa s goddard earth observing system version 2 geos rienecker et al 2008 molod et al 2012 borovikov et al 2019 molod et al 2020 sub seasonal to seasonal s2s forecast system this fldas forecast system is considered version 1 ffv1 however various independent studies wang et al 2009 becker et al 2014 krakauer 2019 wanders and wood 2016 cash et al 2019 wanders et al 2019 have shown that nmme s s2s precipitation and temperature forecasts are significantly more skilful than any individual model including geos in the suite to leverage this multi model skill and to thereby improve the early warning system to support proactive drought management efforts the fldas forecast was upgraded to incorporate the full suite of nmme precipitation forecasts in combination with geos non precipitation forecast forcing fields this upgraded system is considered version 2 fldas forecast version 2 ffv2 using precipitation information from the nmme forecast suite is particularly beneficial given that precipitation is the primary driver for surface and ground hydrology the fldas forecast system is a multi land surface model lsm seasonal forecast system that uses nasa s capabilities in modeling and utilizing remote sensing based products and is set up specifically for continental africa and the middle east this system bias corrects and downscales all the meteorological forecast fields produced by the dynamical forecast system using well tested techniques keyed to satellite and station based data wood et al 2004 arsenault et al 2020 shukla et al 2020 the novelty in this study is the incorporation of the full suite of bias corrected and downscaled nmme precipitation and geos non precipitation meteorological forcings to produce multi lsm s2s hydrologic forecasts at 0 250 spatial resolution over continental africa and middle east one of the main outcomes of implementing nmme into the system s multiple lsms ensembles is a large increase in the number of ensemble members which allows us to examine the probabilistic nature of forecasted hydrological extremes the hypothesis tested in this study is that since the ensemble of nmme precipitation forecasts have better seasonal skill than any individual model s forecasts in the nmme suite the nmme based hydrological forecasts will also have more skill than those based only on the geos precipitation based forecasts various studies have already analyzed the meteorological forecast skill of the different nmme models out to the 6 month forecast lead mo and lyon 2015 shukla et al 2016 setiawan et al 2017 these studies have shown that using the full nmme suite provides more accurate forecasts than any single model several other studies have highlighted the importance of exploring the ensemble spread as a source of information regarding forecast uncertainty using various probabilistic metrics paiva et al 2012 van schaeybroeck and vannitsem 2015 in this paper we follow a combined approach of using deterministic analyses and probabilistic analyses of extremes to explore and demonstrate the benefits of using the full nmme ensemble in ffv2 compared to ffv1 and thereby determine whether or not including the full nmme suite is justified implementing nmme into the fldas forecast system was a substantial undertaking the main objectives of the present paper are 1 to describe the framework and methodology for including nmme precipitation forecasts into the fldas forecast system and 2 to demonstrate that the inclusion of this information improves hydrological forecasts relative to those obtained with geos based forecast information alone this study compares ffv2 to ffv1 and benchmarks the fldas forecast versions relative to ensemble streamflow prediction esp based forecasts the forecast performance is assessed in terms of i deterministic i e ensemble mean forecast skill analysis relative to historic model runs ii deterministic ensemble mean comparison of the nmme based fldas forecast system with remotely sensed observation and iii probabilistic forecast skill analysis of extreme conditions relative to historic model runs the evaluations focus on southern africa sa which has suffered consecutive droughts in the 1990s and from 2014 through 2020 edossa et al 2014 nash et al 2019 the next section

ffv2 routinely produces monthly hydrologic forecasts over continental africa and the middle east fig 1 describes the schematic for fldas forecasts which includes establishing initial conditions for the forecasts using observation and reanalysis based meteorological data sets generating ensemble forecasts of hydrologic conditions based on nmme meteorological forecasts and producing drought and

chirps 2 0 prelim only for near real time monitoring and producing forecast initial conditions because the 3 day latency of this product allows model updates close to real time for all prior time steps the system uses the chirps final 6 hourly product dinku et al 2018 http data chc ucsb edu products chirps 2 0 africa 6 hourly which has a latency of 2 3 weeks and is available for continental africa and part of the middle east domain merra 2 data have about an internal 10 day latency which is sufficient for seasonal climate forecast initialization and monitoring the ra is used to initialize the nmme ensemble geos only and esp based forecast model runs and is considered the primary reference data set in this study 2 2 3 meteorological forcing data for nmme based hydrologic forecasts the meteorological forecasts used in setting up ffv2 are dynamic the meteorological fields within the models that produce them evolve in time in response to imposed dynamical equations in the modeled atmospheric and ocean components and parameterizations of physical processes such as turbulence and moist convection ffv2 uses dynamical precipitation forecasts from the nmme suite nmme provides near real time monthly forecasts based on 98 ensemble members and hindcasts 1982 2010 based on 68 ensemble members from the climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 saha et al 2010 2014 geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory s gfdl delworth et al 2012 vecchi et al 2014 forecast oriented climate model version 2 5 canadian coupled models cancm4i and gnemo lin et al 2020 the ncar climate system model version 4 ccsm4 gent et al 2011 and nasa global modelling and assimilation office s gmao geos version 2 geosv2 borovikov et al 2019 as provided in table 1 a particular innovation of ffv2 is that it has the flexibility to run any combination of the nmme suite s models ffv1 is a subset of this option it uses the meteorological forcings from geosv2 alone the current ffv2 system employs all active nmme models with all the ensemble members as of 2021 table 1 most models have 10 ensemble members the only exception is cfsv2 for which we use 12 of the 24 ensemble members to aptly handle the processing of the model for gfdl flor we use all the 24 ensemble members but average each of the 12 members of its two sub models to have 12 averaged ensemble members in case of the hindcast period 1982 2010 because the nmme does not provide the full complement of required input fields e g temperature radiation winds ffv2 uses non precipitation meteorological forcings from geos seasonal forecasts the geos seasonal forecasts consist of 10 ensemble members for real time applications and 4 ensemble members for the hindcast period 1982 2010 the smaller number of geos non precipitation ensemble members are in part randomly matched with the nmme based precipitation ensemble members in the ffv2 setup for example geos s four non precipitation ensemble members are first matched twice up to the first eight out of the ten precipitation ensemble members of ccsm4 and then randomly matched to the last two precipitation ensemble members of ccsm4 in the hindcast period for the near real time period geos s non precipitation ensemble members and ccsm4 precipitation ensemble members are matched one to one the meteorological forecasts are then bias corrected and spatially downscaled bcsd wood et al 2004 using the ra based meteorological data sets chirps and merra 2 as the reference data following the methods outlined in arsenault et al 2020 forecasts from climate models do not usually match the statistical properties of the ra inputs e g due to lead dependent climate drift gupta et al 2013 hermanson et al 2018 bias correction is used to reduce such errors cui et al 2012 the bcsd method used in this study has been evaluated and verified across africa for nhyfas arsenault et al 2020 shukla et al 2020 2 2 4 esp based hydrologic forecasts in addition to nmme fldas forecast can also employ the esp type forecasting approach twedt et al 1977 day 1985 yuan et al 2015 li et al 2009 yossef et al 2017 the esp forecasts are climatology based and use the same observed inputs chirps and merra 2 as ra lis configures the ensemble of meteorological forecast members by assembling individual years from the historical merra 2 and chirps meteorological data taking each historical year as a representation of a potential single forecast thus the 1982 2011 chirps and merra 2 data holdings allow us to produce 30 ensemble members for each initial condition the skill of the hydrological esp forecast is derived only from the initial hydrological conditions in this study the esp based forecast is used as a benchmark for both versions of fldas forecast output as both dynamic forecast inputs are bias corrected and downscaled relative to the same sets of observed data that go into esp based runs also the initial conditions are the same for the esp based forecasts and both versions of fldas forecast 2 2 5 summary of fldas forecast version 2 workflow the fldas forecast workflow illustrated in fig 2 consists of three main steps 1 pre processing 2 lis based processing and 3 post processing during the pre processing step all nmme precipitation and complementary geos non precipitation fields needed to run the lsms are gathered downscaled and bias corrected relative to chirps and merra 2 data sets respectively and are then temporally disaggregated to sub daily time steps 6 hour intervals in the lis based processing section the two lsms noahmp and clsm are run with the forcing data produced in the previous step producing a combined model total of 196 near real time hydrologic forecast ensemble members and 136 hindcast ensemble members per forecast start date the ffv1 considered in this study produces a total of 20 ensemble members for near real time forecasts and 8 ensemble members for the hindcasts in this step fldas forecast is also configured in esp mode for the same set of lsms and initial conditions to produce esp based forecasts with a total of 60 ensemble members per forecast start date in the post processing step we analyze the near real time hydrologic forecast outputs for hydrologic extremes such as droughts and flood potentials relative to hindcast climatology these results are updated on our webpage https ldas gsfc nasa gov fldas models forecast by the second week of every month and are provided to our fews net partners and to regional scientists 2 2 6 derived products derived products enhance fews net s early warning capabilities by allowing regional experts to visualize the potential hydrologic impacts of forecasted climate fldas forecast based real time esp forecasts over africa are used to produce probabilistic tercile maps for rootzone soil moisture rzsm to indicate the likelihood of above normal greater than 67th percentile normal between 33rd to 67th percentile and below normal less than 33rd percentile conditions these conditions especially below normal a potentially drought like condition in hydrology forms the basis of various categorical probabilistic evaluations in this study the esp forecast percentiles are derived from the ra based output and the tercile maps provide estimates of hydrologic conditions when the input meteorological forcings are considered to be climatologically average for forecast initial conditions similarly nmme rzsm forecast based probabilistic tercile maps are also produced over africa and the middle east where percentiles are based on the nmme rzsm hindcasts the terciles describe the likelihood of the three categories based on the ensemble members additionally ffv2 routinely provides the ensemble median of nmme based forecasted soil moisture percentile anomaly standardized anomaly and percent saturation along with 3 month aggregates of soil moisture percentile anomaly and standardized anomaly https ldas gsfc nasa gov fldas models forecast 3 methodology the impact of implementing nmme in fldas forecast was evaluated by assessing improvements in deterministic forecast skill ensemble spread and probabilistic forecast skill all the assessments are focused on the forecasts covering the wet season over sa as it is the critical growing season for crops laux et al 2009 sultan et al 2010 mubaya et al 2012 trambauer et al 2015 seibert et al 2017 hence forecasts initialized with hydrologic conditions covering the start of the wet season september october and november son are considered in this study the following subsections describe the evaluation data set as well as our analysis approach 3 1 dataset for all the analyses in this study except those using remotely sensed observations the esp ffv1 and ffv2 forecasts and the ra are first standardized by converting them to percentiles for the analyses using remotely sensed observations all the data sets are standardized by converting them to standardized anomalies due to the observation s relatively short temporal extent unless otherwise noted all the forecasts esp ffv1 and ffv2 are then averaged over three months of data data at zero lead i e over the first month of the forecast at 1 month lead over the 2nd month of the forecast and so on out to the 5 month lead for simplicity we will refer to the 0 month lead through 5 month lead averages as ond for october november and december start dates ndj djf jfm fma and mam respectively the initial condition ic period covers the start of the rainy season son and is provided by the ra usually skill is lost with increasing forecast lead hence averaging the forecasts starting from the three different ic months helps isolate for each lead the forecast signal from the noise since ra is used as the truth to evaluate the seasonal forecasts it is also averaged over the ond ndj djf jfm fma and mam periods we will hereafter use hindcast interchangeably with forecast for the sake of clarity 3 2 deterministic forecast skill analysis for all deterministic skill assessments of rzsm top 1 m forecasts we consider the ensemble mean as it is the best deterministic forecast ehrendorfer 1997 we calculate the anomaly correlation ac and the root mean squared error rmse between the ensemble mean of esp ffv1 and ffv2 seasonal rzsm forecast percentiles with respect to the ra perfect run rzsm percentiles which are used here as the truth for validating the forecasts the anomalies used in ac are computed by subtracting the seasonally varying climatologies from the individual monthly values forecasts or ra both metrics are assessed over the period of 1982 2010 the equations used for computing them are provided in appendix 1 equations 1 and 2 the ac is chosen as one of the evaluation metrics as it shows how well the variabilities of the forecast anomalies match the variability of the ra anomalies it does not however provide any information about the magnitude of forecast error which is determined using rmse statistical significance for ac is determined using the fisher transformation the fisher transformation ensures gaussian distribution of the ac coefficients and the z score provides the probability value p value of the correlation coefficient for esp ffv1 and ffv2 with ra for both metrics we also determine the differences between values produced by ffv1 and ffv2 the significance of the difference of ac between the fldas forecast versions is also determined using fisher transformation the statistically significant values for ac and ac differences are provided at the 95 confidence interval appendix 1 equations 1a and 1b further to estimate the best forecast s deterministic accuracy relative to observations we calculate the correlation appendix 1 equation 3 between the seasonal ra and ensemble mean of the forecast s surface soil moisture ssm top 6 cm standardized anomalies with respect to remotely sensed soil moisture and vegetation standardized anomalies both the remotely sensed observations are first spatially upscaled to 25 km before being standardized we map the correlation between the ssm and the nasa soil moisture active passive smap mission standardized anomalies between 2015 and 2020 smap provides high quality soil moisture estimates posted at 9 km spatial and daily temporal resolution entekhabi et al 2016 in addition to correlations with smap we also compute the correlation between model ssm and global inventory monitoring and modeling system s gimms normalized difference vegetation index ndvi spruce et al 2016 tucker 1978 standardized anomalies between 2010 and 2018 the gimms vegetation index is available at 0 25 km spatial and 8 day temporal resolution to correlate the seasonal ra and forecasts relative to both of these remotely sensed observations the observations are also averaged over the seasonal periods of ond ndj djf jfm fma and mam for the correlation with remotely sensed observations the fisher transformation is used to test the significance which we provide at the 95 confidence interval 3 3 ensemble spread analysis before studying the probabilistic features of the ensembles in the seasonal forecasts we analyze the ensemble spreads of ffv2 and ffv1 as ensemble spread is often related to uncertainty grimit and mass 2007 hopson 2014 van schaeybroeck and vannitsem 2015 we compare the ensemble spreads of the rzsm forecasts over 1982 to 2010 through the sixth forecast lead between the fldas forecast versions for each initial condition ic month september october and november the ensemble spread is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values across each forecast ensemble fortin et al 2014 appendix 1 equation 4 3 4 probabilistic forecast skill analysis for hydrologic drought we use different probability metrics to examine how often the forecasts are accurate and this requires categorizing certain forecast events this in fact fits in well with our interest in categories of soil moisture drought below normal unless otherwise noted here too we average the forecasts covering the period 1982 2010 over the different lead periods ond ndj djf jfm fma and mam and over the ic months son which represents the start of the rainy season the probability metrics are based on all the ensembles present in each of the three forecasts first we compute the rank probability skill score rpss müller et al 2005 which describes the quality of categorical probabilistic forecasts for drought both at the seasonal and sub seasonal scales for this calculation drought conditions are categorized as an rzsm less than the 33rd percentile rpss is based on the rank probability skill rps which is the cumulative squared probability error the ratio of the difference between the climatological rps and forecast rps to the climatological rps is the rpss appendix 1 equation 5 rpss rewards a forecast for the number of ensemble members that fall within the observed category the larger that number is the higher the rpss an rpss greater than 0 is considered skilful in comparison to the climatological forecast and an rpss of 1 indicates a perfect forecast for the rpss we adopted the threshold of above five percent 5 as representing good skill in a forecast following goddard and dilley 2005 to support the results of rpss we also compute the forecast hit rate for drought conditions by creating a contingency table and using the ratio of forecasted drought events rzsm less than 33rd percentile and observed drought events appendix 1 equation 6 reliability diagrams representing probability of seasonal forecast events relative to observations are also included in the probabilistic analysis these are graphs of the observed frequency of a categorical event plotted against the forecast probability of that event during our hindcast period of study from 1982 to 2010 over sa brocker and smith 2007 wilks 1995 jolliffe and stephenson 2003 similar to the rpss analysis we define drought category using rzsm percentiles this diagram is useful for decision making purposes as it tells users how often a given forecast probability of a certain category drought matches the frequency of the event in observations a perfectly reliable forecast system would have a 1 1 association with the observed frequency e g a forecast probability of 50 will be associated with observed frequency of 50 in this study the reliability diagram is plotted by dividing the forecast probabilities 0 1 0 into 10 bins and estimating observed frequency of a given category for each of those bins finally we compute the relative operating characteristics roc mason and graham 1999 hogan and mason 2012 siegmund et al 2015 a complementary metric to the reliability diagram roc is used in forecast verification to measure the ability of the forecasts to distinguish an event from a non event it utilizes plots of the probabilistic hit rate hr to false alarm rate far for a given category drought it is plotted by constructing a contingency table for drought with hr probabilities y axis plotted against the far probabilities x axis by dividing the respective probabilities of 0 to 1 0 into 10 bins a perfect roc curve would have high hr probability relative to the far probabilities lending further confidence to the forecast accuracy 4 results and discussion 4 1 deterministic analysis fig 3 and row 1 in table 2 present forecast skill as represented by anomaly correlation coefficient acc of the rzsm forecast percentiles relative to the ra percentiles the ensemble mean seasonal forecasts are averaged over ond ndj djf jfm fma and mam following the son ics the first row of fig 3 is the skill acc of the seasonal hydrological esp forecast where skill is derived from the initial hydrological conditions alone moderate skill is seen at lead 1 and lead 2 at 0 3 0 6 acc with localized areas of 0 8 acc in the democratic republic of congo rzsm skill for both ffv1 and ffv2 shown in rows 2 and 3 fig 3 respectively is higher than the esp based seasonal forecast skill row 1 in terms of area averages the skills over southern africa table 2 row 1 for both ffv1 and ffv2 are about 0 1 0 15 acc larger than that for esp skill in the early part of the season the overall acc of all the seasonal forecasts decreases with increasing lead however the acc of both the dynamical versions of the seasonal forecasts lasts longer than that of the esp seasonal forecasts this is expected though not assured given that the dynamical models are deriving skill from both initial conditions and the forecasted meteorology with the latter providing skill at longer leads importantly ffv2 has higher acc than ffv1 as seen in the last row of fig 3 many regions show improvements of more than 0 2 acc with ffv2 relative to ffv1 a difference that is statistically significant as determined by the fisher transformation appendix 1 b the figure also shows that the difference between the skill of ffv2 and ffv1 is relatively smaller in the first lead because of greater influence of ic than in the longer leads although there are some areas in sa that show ffv2 with lower skill than ffv1 those areas are relatively small these results are similar to those shown by becker et al 2014 for precipitation forecasts over the northern hemisphere 23 75 n where acc for the entire nmme suite based forecast was found to be significantly more skilful than that for the geos model alone in addition to acc we compared the root mean squared error rmse of the three forecast percentiles fig 4 relative to the ra percentiles here too we provide results for the ensemble means at the six forecast leads ond ndj djf jfm fma and mam the results are similar to those for acc the rmse values gradually increase with lead for all three forecasts as expected the rmse values at 0 month lead are the lowest given the proximity of this lead to the ic rmses for both ffv1 and ffv2 rows 2 and 3 respectively are smaller than those for esp row 1 consistent in terms of skill with what was found in fig 3 for acc also outside of a few small areas ffv2 shows higher skill lower rmses than ffv1 the areally averaged seasonal forecast rmses tabulated in table 2 row 2 confirm that rmses in all forecasts increase with lead and that ffv2 produces the lowest rmses the latter further highlighting the improvements obtained with the nmme based fldas forecast 4 2 comparison to observations we show above that ffv2 provide forecasts that agree best with the ra model products here we evaluate the ffv2 forecasts directly against observations we compare the correlation r between the seasonal ra and ffv2 ensemble mean top 6 cm ssm with seasonal smap soil moisture top 5 cm over sa between 2015 and 2020 there is generally a good agreement between the ra and smap values in row 1 of fig 5 where a large section over the eastern part of southern africa shows more than 0 9r and with most of the other regions showing significant values of more than 0 6r even the ffv2 based ensemble mean seasonal forecasts row 2 of fig 5 show significantly high correlations r 0 6 with smap over large areas of sa out to the 2 month lead djf with gradually decreasing values thereafter results of the correlation between ra and ffv2 ensemble mean ssm with gimms ndvi over sa between 2010 and 2018 are similar fig 6 the seasonal ra ssm row 1 shows good agreement with ndvi with significant values of more than 0 7r over large sections of eastern and central sa through the djf season the correlation tapers off during jfm and fma but recovers in the mam season the reason for this behaviour may be related to the fact that the timing of peak seasonal precipitation differs from the timing of peak seasonal ndvi by mam the harvest season both ssm and ndvi reduce in similar manner explaining the high correlation ffv2 ssm also shows significant correlation values of more than 0 5r over considerable regions of eastern and central sa out to the third lead month djf after which it tapers off however ndvi based results show lower correlations than the smap based results the areally averaged correlations between smap ndvi and ra esp ffv1 and ffv2 ssm are provided in table 2 row4 smap and row5 ndvi as was found in the ra analysis comparisons against the remotely sensed data show that ffv2 is more skilful than either esp or ffv1 however the skill of the forecasts relative to the observations is much smaller as are the differences in skill between esp ffv1 and ffv2 both smap and ndvi based forecast correlations show particularly lower correlation values in the fourth jfm and fifth fma seasonal leads compared to the sixth seasonal lead mam this dip in correlation of forecasted ssm can be attributed to the ssm forecasts inability to correctly predict the magnitude of moisture at the peak period of the wet season jfm fma at longer leads which produces lower ssm variability in forecasts than in the observations when the seasonal ssm forecast lead is towards the end of the wet season mam the variabilities are captured better and therefore have higher correlation values than the previous two leads the deterministic analyses evaluated the ensemble mean of the dynamical and esp forecasts showing that the ensemble mean of ffv2 has higher skill and accuracy than the ffv1 and esp ensemble mean forecasts at the seasonal scale over sa however these evaluations do not consider the probabilistic nature of the forecasts which is the main reason for updating the version of fldas forecast with a much larger number of ensemble members the next section of this study evaluates the probabilistic skill of these forecasts over sa 4 3 probabilistic analysis of droughts the ensemble spreads of ffv2 based and ffv1 based rzsm forecasts through the monthly leads of each son ic are illustrated in fig 7 the september through november ics forecasts ensemble spread are stacked in the figure and the ffv2 monthly rzsm ensemble forecasts show a larger spread by 0 02 0 1 m3 m3 as compared to the ffv1 based forecasts for all ics over large regions of sa except over the very dry regions of namibia south africa and the democratic republic of congo where the difference in spread is less than 0 03 m3 m3 the ensemble spread is seen to increase through the wet season peaking in february and reducing thereafter for both the forecast version and the three initial conditions over sa the forecasts are now evaluated for extremes droughts by using the ranked probability skill score rpss this metric describes the quality of categorical probabilistic forecasts fig 8 shows the rzsm forecast rpss for conditions when rzsm is less than the 33rd percentile categorized as drought hereafter as shown in fig 8 ffv2 row 3 exhibits rpss above 50 over a larger region of sa compared to the ffv1 and esp forecasts row 2 and row 1 we find both the dynamic models forecast rpss to be better than that of esp and we find that the ffv2 forecast rpss is 10 20 better than that of ffv1 row 4 rpss decreases with increasing lead for all three forecasts but not as rapidly as it does for the deterministic skill retaining significant rpss of over 5 until the sixth seasonal forecast lead these results are also confirmed by areally averaged rpss for the seasonal leads table 2 row 3 additionally more areas over sa show higher rpss in ffv2 relative to ffv1 than found for the deterministic skill assessment the nmme forecasts are also known to have good skill in the sub seasonal or monthly scale wanders and wood 2016 cash et al 2019 the ffv2 rzsm rpss values in the drought category are evaluated separately for each of the early season s monthly ics over sa to further evaluate the sub seasonal probabilistic skill in rzsm fig 9 shows monthly forecast rpss through the sixth lead for the september to november ics the forecast rpss values are progressively higher as the wet season advances from september to november ic the october ic forecasts have an average of 2 higher rpss than the september ic forecasts the november ic forecasts have on average another 2 higher skill score than the october ic forecasts during the first three forecast leads this increase in skill score can be attributed to the availability of more moisture in the initial condition with the advancing wet season the september ic is relatively dry and the dryness persists through the hydrologic forecasts hence forecasts made with september ics are more likely to have more false alarms for drought conditions than the forecasts initialized during later months that have higher soil moisture content leading to lower rpss for the september ic forecasts to support this argument ffv2 rzsm hit rate hr for drought conditions in fig 10 shows ffv2 forecasts initialized in september have an average of 2 lower hr than those initialized in october and november these results are also reflected in the areally averaged monthly ffv2 rpss and hr values table 3 rows 1 3 hence it can be concluded that hydrologic forecasts made further into the early wet season have better drought based rpss and hr in the first three to four forecast lead months than those made too early in the season fig 11 presents reliability diagrams for the esp ffv1 and ffv2 seasonal forecasts son ics over sa in the upper row reliability diagrams diagnose categorical forecast quality by plotting the observed frequency of a categorical event against the forecast probability of that event in this case drought the highest reliability is shown by the forecast closest to the diagonal ffv2 shows better drought forecast reliability than esp and ffv1 through all the forecast seasonal leads though the overall reliability decreases with increasing lead the lower row in fig 11 presents the relative operating characteristics roc curve for the same set of seasonal forecasts rocs which are used to measure the ability of the forecasts to distinguish an event from a non event are shown here as plots of the probabilistic hit rate hr to false alarm rate far for a given category taken here to be drought at low leads the hr for ffv2 in fig 10 is initially much larger than the far which brings the trajectory of the ffv2 curve closer to the top left hand corner this trajectory indicates that ffv2 rzsm has a better roc than esp and ffv1 that is a better ability to discriminate events from non events the roc of all forecasts decreases with increasing lead ffv2 still shows the best roc across all leads even at longer leads showing ffv2 is better at discriminating events drought condition from non events non drought conditions 4 4 application and limitations the results thus far indicate that ffv2 forecasts can serve as a useful tool in the early reporting of extreme events as an example the near real time rzsm forecast percentiles with five monthly leads for october 2019 ic fig 12 a are able to aptly forecast severe drought conditions over parts of the sa region as corroborated by news reports in nasa s earth observatory carlowicz and dauphin 2019 relief web 2019 and the new humanitarian anyadike 2019 the fldas forecast based rzsm percentiles use a drought severity category scale similar to that of the climate prediction center cpc and united states drought monitor usdm which uses five classifications to characterize a soil moisture percentile in the context of drought i abnormally dry d0 21 30 percentile showing areas that may be going into or are coming out of drought ii moderate drought d1 10 20 percentile iii severe drought d2 6 10 percentile iv extreme drought d3 3 5 percentile and v exceptional drought d4 0 2 percentile in fig 12 a the november 2019 through march 2020 ffv2 rzsm forecasts of extreme to severe drought conditions in sa is found consistent with the crop monitor alert geoglam 2019 and other alerts like the joint call for action s world food programme wfp 2019 further fig 12 b provides the probability of below normal normal and above normal rzsm conditions over the region the below normal conditions highlight the likelihood of potentially severe drought like conditions the probability of below normal conditions i e drought was found to have a probability of over 60 over parts of south africa botswana and namibia results presented in this study are limited by the initialization of a single season and a relatively small study domain this work is intended to support remote early warning in the vulnerable regions of the world where there are few in situ data sets to support this type of analysis other limitations include the absence of complementary meteorological fields for driving land surface and hydrology models like wind radiation humidity and surface pressure from the different nmme modeling centers forecast data sets this leads to the less optimal option of combining the nmme precipitation forecasts with the gmao geos forecasts for the other meteorological fields which may lead to potential inconsistencies such as high solar radiation during times of high rainfall we currently have no way to quantify the impact of this limitation further improvements to the system inputs could also be made by using higher resolution data sets such as the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis version 5 era5 and the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg or other relevant reanalyses and or satellite based products for the bias correction and downscaling procedures 5 conclusions this study evaluates the nmme based fldas soil moisture forecasts relative to an observation based forcing driven reanalysis ra through deterministic and probabilistic analyses the entire nmme suite of precipitation forecasts is now used in fldas forecast as it has higher skill than any of the individual forecast products in the suite because the original version of fldas forecast ffv1 used only geos based inputs the updated fldas forecast ffv2 is shown to perform better here we demonstrate and quantify this improved performance by examining ffv1 and ffv2 forecasts over southern africa using the same simulation design as used for producing routine real time hydrologic forecast products results show that the ffv2 based rzsm forecasts have higher deterministic skill than ffv1 both versions of fldas forecast are also found to have better deterministic skill and probabilistic accuracy than the esp based forecasts through the wet season over southern africa which is also the main growing season in that region additionally the ra ssm shows excellent correlation with remotely sensed observations like smap and ndvi through the wet season over southern africa the nmme based ssm forecasts also show good correlation with these observations until the third seasonal forecast lead which includes the peak of the wet season hence ffv2 shows promise for forecasting the main part of this season well further ffv2 based rzsm forecasts yield higher ensemble spread through the wet season compared to ffv1 based forecasts probabilistically the ffv2 based seasonal rzsm forecasts also have higher rpss for the drought category a monthly probabilistic analysis of the wet season showed that for the ffv2 based forecasts rpss and hr for drought over southern africa improves with later initializations during the wet season in addition the probabilistic drought study over the region shows that the ffv2 based rzsm forecasts have better reliability and roc scores than either the ffv1 or esp forecasts highlighting an improved ability to discriminate events droughts from non events the probabilistic analyses also show that both versions of fldas forecast have higher forecast skill and quality than esp based forecasts through the wet season over southern africa in presenting a past operationally based case near real time ffv2 based rzsm percentiles for october 2019 ics successfully predicted drought like conditions over southern africa having a larger number of ensemble members we could provide highly reliable probabilities of drought conditions through the forecast lead months this work shows that updating fldas forecast with the entire nmme s2s suite allows for more skilful hydrologic forecasts future work will aim to integrate nmme s2s based surface temperature along with precipitation into the system and will expand the domain to cover the globe the setup may also expand to improve initial conditions by including multivariate data assimilation ingesting for example assimilating leaf area index lai kumar et al 2019 and soil moisture information draper and reichle 2019 rahman et al 2022 sabater et al 2008 the near real time products have been very useful in providing potential drought forecasts these drought based products will continue to provide support for usaid s fews net as well as for other ongoing early warning systems credit

2424,managed aquifer recharge mar using artificial freshwater recharge from infiltration basins or injection wells is an effective method to control seawater intrusion the effect of oceanic tides however are usually not considered when dimensioning and operating freshwater injection installations this study employed lab scale physical experiments and groundwater numerical models to investigate salt transport and salinity distributions as driven by artificial freshwater injection under the influence of tides in an unconfined coastal aquifer results revealed that the effectiveness of artificial freshwater injection is significantly reduced under tidal conditions as compared to conditions without tides the response of the upper saline plume the tidal recirculation cell to artificial freshwater injection in tidal conditions is nearly twice more rapid than that of the lower seawater wedge the seaward displacement of the seawater wedge toe is higher for low seawater concentration isohalines 5 than for higher concentration isohalines 50 to 95 it was further found that an overshoot phenomenon whereby the seawater toe first moves seaward before moving landward again occurs and mainly affects the higher concentration isohalines this further decreases the effectiveness of freshwater injection in controlling seawater intrusion and the phenomenon is more pronounced with increased injection rates increased distance between injection well and coastal line increased tidal amplitude and decreased tidal periods this study provides insights with direct implications

intrusion sea tides sand tank numerical groundwater modelling data availability all the results data have been included in the paper 1 introduction coastal aquifers are crucial sources of freshwater supply for drinking agricultural and industrial water in many coastal regions un 2017 xin et al 2019 palacios et al 2020 for example over 100 million americans and thousands of farms in coastal counties in us depend fully or partly on groundwater jasechko et al 2020 global scale analyses suggest that more than 45 of the world population i e 2 69 109 people in 2018 august lives within 100 km from the coastal line martínez et al 2007 fernandino et al 2018 and population density of coastal zones is approximately five times greater than that of global average neumann et al 2015 seawater intrusion is recognized as a global threat to freshwater resources in coastal areas and is amplified by increasing groundwater abstraction caused by high and growing coastal population and sea level rises induced by climate warming bear et al 1999 cui et al 2015 walther et al 2020 in addition to threatening freshwater supply seawater intrusion can have serious environmental impacts such increasing soil water salinity and triggering the mortality of salt intolerant vegetation werner 2010 shi and jiao 2014 lu et al 2017 therefore it is important to develop effective countermeasures to mitigate seawater intrusion in order to protect water supplies and ecosystems in coastal areas various engineering techniques exist to mitigate seawater intrusion and protect freshwater supply in coastal areas the most common techniques involve the construction of subsurface barriers including physical barriers such as construction of subsurface dams and cut off walls kaleris and ziogas 2013 wu et al 2020 fang et al 2021a fang et al 2021b gao et al 2022 or hydraulic barriers induced by freshwater injection from boreholes or infiltration trenches lu et al 2013 lu et al 2017 shi et al 2020 subsurface saltwater extraction stein et al 2019 stein et al 2020 injection extraction well pair whereby the extracted fresh groundwater is reinjected through the injection well located between the interface toe and extraction well ebeling et al 2019 lu et al 2019 double pumping barrier through use of an inland well pumping freshwater and a seaward well pumping saltwater pool and carrera 2010 air barriers which consist in injecting compressed air into the aquifer is another less common but effective method to prevent seawater intrusion which cannot cause a secondary contamination to the aquifer dror et al 2004 sun and semprich 2013 zang and li 2021 apart from subsurface barriers optimized arrangement and pumping of well fields is the most common and pragmatic precaution measures for reducing the risk of seawater intrusion it is typically accomplished through searching optimal well locations and pumping rates that enables both minimal extent of seawater intrusion and maximal pumping rate strack 1976 ataie ashtiani and ketabchi 2011 among the reported methods artificial recharge of freshwater through infiltration basins or injection wells is relatively cost effective method for preventing seawater intrusion through the management of infiltration injection rates the technique has been widely used in various hydrogeological settings to remediate salinized coastal aquifers including in the usa australia and china hussain et al 2019 luyun et al 2011 lu et al 2017 pu et al 2021 the dynamics and patterns of groundwater flow and salt transport in coastal aquifers subject to artificial freshwater recharge have been examined through various approaches including analytical solutions numerical simulations lab scale experiments and field investigations armanuos et al 2019 armanuos et al 2020 lu et al 2017 luyun et al 2011 bouri and dhia 2010 previous studies have generated important insights into the performance of artificial freshwater recharge demonstrating that it is an efficient method to slow down or reverse seawater intrusion in which the sea boundary was always simplified as a static condition neglecting oceanic water table oscillations driven by tides yet the temporal variability of sea levels associated with oceanic tides is widespread and the effect of tidally induced sea level fluctuation on the groundwater flow and salinity in coastal aquifers has been examined extensively li et al 2000 robinson et al 2014 2018 xin et al 2011 2014 wilson et al 2015 xin et al 2018 levanon et al 2019 xiao et al 2019 yang et al 2022 panjehfouladgaran and mahdi rajabi 2022 suk et al 2022 all these studies suggested that the coupled groundwater flow and salt transport were significantly altered by periodic tidal fluctuations in both confined and unconfined coastal aquifers resulting in enhanced dispersion of the freshwater saltwater transition zone the formation of an upper saline plume usp and the migration of the lower saltwater wedge sw towards the seaward side as compared to no tide conditions parlange et al 1984 nielsen 1990 li et al 2000 robinson et al 2014 2018 xin et al 2011 xin et al 2014 xin et al 2022 das et al 2021 fang et al 2021a suk et al 2022 yang et al 2022 a few authors have reported on the effect of physical barriers such as cut off wall and subsurface dams on the groundwater flow and salt transport in coastal aquifer that considered a fluctuating sea level for example shen et al 2020 showed that the retreat effectiveness of the cutoff wall on saltwater intrusion was no longer evident under tidal conditions compared with that in no tide condition fang et al 2021 revealed that tidal fluctuations significantly increased the effective sea discharge height range edhr which dictates the effectiveness of subsurface dams and that the lower and upper thresholds of the edhr were lower than in absence of tides yang et al 2021 numerically simulated in 2d vertical an ocean surge inundation on an island constructed with a cut off wall indicating that the cut off wall can significantly reduce seawater infiltration by up to 40 during the inundation to the best of our knowledge however the effect of oceanic tides on the efficiency of artificial freshwater injection to control seawater intrusion is still lacking specifically the differences in performance of artificial freshwater injection with and without tides have not been compared such analysis is urgent given the ubiquity of tidal conditions in coastal aquifer thus a series of laboratory experiments examined alongside numerical simulations were implemented to investigate the groundwater flow and salinity patterns driven by artificial freshwater injection under the influence of various tidal regimes amplitude period and further assess the influence of tides on the artificial recharge performance the saltwater toe location and the spatial configuration of usp under different scenarios were adopted as performance indicators the results are discussed with a focus on providing guidelines for the design of efficient artificial freshwater injection wells in controlling seawater intrusion 2 methodology 2 1 laboratory experiments controlled lab scale experiments were conducted in a 2d sand tank fig 1 of dimensions 3 7 m length 0 8 m height 0 05 m width the sand tank was divided into three compartments the left hand side was a salt water reservoir 0 1 m in length representing the sea boundary the middle part 3 5 m in length was packed with fine sands to represent loose sediments and the right hand side was another freshwater reservoir 0 1 m in length representing the landward freshwater boundary in the physical experiments well screen holes were made on the back face of the sand tank and were connected to peristaltic pumps with a maximum pumping rate of 2 88 m3 d wu et al 2019 wu et al 2021 the landward freshwater reservoir was connected to an overflow tank filled with freshwater to maintain a constant freshwater head boundary the seaward side reservoir was also connected to an overflow tank filled with saltwater to maintain a constant salinity and water level under the no tide condition the seaward side reservoir was further connected to a variable height overflow column which was used to generate sinusoidal tides under the tidal condition cartwright et al 2003 cartwright et al 2004 the sinusoidal tides level could be described as follows 1 h t h msl a sin 2 π t t where h t is the transient sea level l at time t t hmsl is the mean sea level l a is the tidal amplitude l and t is the tidal period t the granulometry of the sand used in the experiments was relatively uniform with d50 0 42 mm and d90 d10 2 57 these parameters were optically determined using a ls particle size analyzer by beckman coulter usa with a measurement range between 0 040 μm and 2000 μm the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the sand was measured at 2 4 10 3 5 m s using the constant head method and the bulk porosity was found to be 0 4 using the oven drying method wu et al 2019 the seawater was prepared by dissolving sodium chloride nacl ar grade 34 g to obtain a salinity and density of 35 1 g l and 1025 1 g l respectively the longitudinal dispersity was measured using 1 d column experiment at 0 001 m chang et al 2019 to visualize the saltwater intrusion process and patterns the tracer dye eosine red was added to the seaward side reservoir at a concentration of 0 3 g l the effect of the tracer on the density and viscosity of the fluid were assumed to be negligible stoeckl and houben 2012 the freshwater was deionized water with a salinity of 0 g l and density of 1000 g l to analyze the development of both the seawater wedge and the usp the physical experiment was recorded using a canon eos r7 pixel 3250 w camera capturing one frame every 10 min 2 2 numerical simulations to allow for extending the findings from the lab experiments to field scale studies numerical simulations were also conducted which enabled to quantify the dynamics of groundwater flow and salt transport and the movement of the freshwater seawater mixing zone feflow diersch 2014 a finite element variably saturated groundwater flow modeling program which has been widely applied to the modelling of seawater intrusion including in tidal conditions zheng et al 2020 fang et al 2021a fang et al 2021b ke et al 2021 was used the equations diersch 2014 governing the groundwater flow as computed in feflow code are shown below 2 ε s ρ ρ t ε s t k r k ψ 1 χ e 0 3 t ε s c c k r k ψ 1 χ e ε s

and minimum solute concentration ml 3 respectively d is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor l2t 1 α is the solute expansion coefficient additionally the relationships between relative hydraulic conductivity water saturation and capillary pressure head are described by the van genuchten 1980 functions the lab scale numerical model was set according to the sand tank experimental setup including the boundary conditions and the calibrated hydrogeological parameters fig 1b in particular the landward boundary of the model was set as constant head and constant concentration boundary the seaward boundary was set as constant head and constant mass concentration boundary under no tide conditions and a variable head and constant mass concentration boundary under tide condition the seawater level fluctuations were set according to equation 1 practically the seawater boundary was set as follows 1 in no tide conditions a constant head was applied to all nodes of the boundary 2 in tidal conditions a fixed seawater head boundary was dynamically applied to the nodes located below the time varying seawater level whereas nodes above this level were assigned a seepage face at the corresponding time step whist the nodes which are located below the minimum tide level were permanently assigned a fixed time varying seawater level however because the seawater level fluctuated at different time steps according to the varying tidal stage the nodes located above which became lower than sea level when tide raised were then converted from seepage nodes to fixed seawater level nodes and this until the tide fell again below them at which point they were converted back to seepage nodes it should be pointed out that time series of seawater head at each node below seawater level was calculated first according to the piezometric head of seawater and the vertical coordinate of boundary nodes and then applied to each node the parameters adopted in the numerical models are shown in table1 the nine injection wells were set with constant injection rates using the well bc in feflow the top and bottom boundary of the lab scale model by default were set as no flow bcs for both flow and mass transport 2 3 scenarios definition three pairs of sub scenarios table 2 scenarios s1 and scenarios s1 scenarios s2 and scenarios s2 scenarios s3 and scenarios s3 were conducted to investigate the influence of tide on the performance of injection well in controlling seawater intrusion scenarios s1 represented the experiments and numerical simulations without injections under no tide conditions scenarios s2 represented the experiments and numerical simulations without injections but under tidal conditions using a constant tidal period but variable tidal amplitudes scenarios s3 represented constant tidal amplitude and variable tidal period the asterisk denotes the sub scenarios applying well injections all of the experiments were run for at least 24 h until the groundwater flow and salt distribution reached a quasi steady state i e in no tide conditions a dynamic steady state in tidal conditions after which the injections were switched on the scenarios input variables are summarized in table2 3 results 3 1 comparison of lab experiments and numerical simulations image captures of steady state under no tide conditions and dynamic steady state under tidal conditions from the sand tank experiments were used to verify the numerical simulation results using the 50 seawater isohalines fig 2 shows that the simulated seawater plume for the scenarios s1 s1 s2 and s2 displaying the salinity distribution at the quasi steady state conditions compared well with the experimental observations all of the sub figures in fig 2 displayed the seawater plume when the sea level rose to the average sea level similarly to previous studies fang et al 2021a fang et al 2021b kuan et al 2012 and 2019 at that small scale the dye tracer did not produce a mixing zone between freshwater and seawater due to the high porosity the low dispersivity and the low hydraulic gradients which restrict dispersion instead only a clear sharp interface was recorded fig 2a á and fig 2b b show the steady state salinity distributions without tides and with and without injection scenarios s1 and s1 respectively indicating that the seawater toe was pushed back towards the sea side in both physical experiments and numerical simulation which are very similar in fig 2á and fig 2b the numerical simulation results indicated that no obvious change in the thickness of the mixing zone along the seawater and freshwater interface could be observed under no injection conditions freshwater injection however resulted in a narrower mixing zone at the bottom of the aquifer compared to the upper part near the beach consistent with previous studies kuan et al 2012 and 2019 yu et al 2019a yu et al 2019b shen et al 2020 fang et al 2021a fang et al 2021b sea level fluctuations induced by tide formed a usp in the upper part of the aquifer and a seawater wedge in the lower part of the aquifer as shown in fig 2c ć and fig 2d d in the tidal scenarios the formation of the usp significantly inhibited the distance of penetration of the seawater i e the toe as compared to fig 2a á no tides also a significant wider mixing zone can be seen in fig 2ćas a result of tidal fluctuations which enhanced solute dispersion fig 2d d show a clear retreat distance of seawater wedge after injection compared to fig 2c ć no injection although the retreat distance tracked by the 5 isohaline toe fig 2ć d in tidal conditions is larger than that tracked by the 50 isohaline toe fig 2c d the retreat distance of seawater wedge induced by injection in no tide conditions is significantly larger than that in tidal conditions the freshwater injection significantly reduced the thickness of the freshwater saltwater mixing zone indicated by the numerical simulation results in fig 2ć d and led to the development of a fresh water discharge zone both indicated by fig 2c ć with fig 2d d under tidal conditions in addition to retreating the lower seawater wedge the freshwater injection also reduced the thickness of usp shrinking 3 2 seawater toe location fig 3 displayed the effect on salinity distribution over time after constant rate injection of freshwater and under the influence of tides initially before injection was applied relatively thick seawater freshwater mixing zone and usp were produced by the numerical simulations as a result of the mixing of freshwater inflow from inland with the density driven seawater entering from the sea boundary the freshwater discharge zone in these pre injection conditions was in fact brackish due to the large dispersion after starting freshwater injection however the salinity of the discharge zone decreased forming a better separation between the usp and lower seawater wedge alongside a considerably retreating seawater wedge and a shrunk usp furthermore the injection also increased the tilt angle of the seawater freshwater interface which was most obvious when looking at the 5 isohaline contour fig 4 a shows the temporal variations of the toe retreat distance along the aquifer base marked by δ xtoe displaying the retreat process of seawater induced by injection with the injection rate at iw1 of 1 6 m3 d the toe movement was generally consistent between the physical experiments and the numerically simulated 50 isohaline which was used to calibrate the numerical model both physical and numerical experiment indicated that the toe movement over time δ xtoe is non linear under both no tide and tidal conditions in more details the response of the 5 isohaline toe in absence of tides was slower than for the 50 and 95 isohalines with the latter having the fastest response a significantly reduced toe retreat distance was observed fig 4a for the tidal conditions as compared to no tide opposite to no tide conditions in tidal conditions the response of the simulated 5 isohaline toe was faster than for the 50 and 95 isohaline toes freshwater injections in tidal conditions also led to a much larger δ xtoe for the 5 isohaline than that of 50 and 95 isohaline as indicated by fig 4b the increase of toe with increasing injection rate is slower under tidal conditions than when there are no tides in other words in tidal condition larger injection rates were needed to achieve the same δ xtoe as in no tide condition for example to achieve a δ xtoe of 45 cm in the lab the injection rate should be increased from 1 127 m3 d in no tide conditions to 1 987 m3 d 76 3 increase in tidal conditions the toe response under varying injection rate was observed to be nonlinear and could be fitted by logarithmic functions fig 4b whereby the increase in toe retreat with increasing injection rate slowed down for high injection rates following freshwater injection an overshoot phenomenon was also observed in the numerical simulations in tidal conditions fig 4a that is the toes initially moved back towards the sea boundary but later moved back inland this overshoot phenomenon is more obvious in fig 5 a which specifically plots the δ xtoe evolution of the 50 isohaline at different injection locations fig 5a also indicates that the magnitude of the overshoot increases with increasing upstream distance from injection well i e from iw1 to iw7 the depth of injection iw1 to iw3 however shows much smaller effect on the overshoot it was found that the overshoot was more marked when the injection rate was higher fig 5b for example the overshoot distance decreased from 9 124 cm to 1 758 cm when the injection rate was decreased from 2 4 m3 d to 1 6 m3 d fig 5a also shows that the δ xtoe 50 isohaline decreased with increasing injection depth and with increasing injection distance from sea boundary unfortunately this overshoot phenomenon indicated by numerical simulation results was not confirmed by the lab experiments possibly because of the freshwater seawater sharp interface narrow mixing zone produced by the dye tracer 3 3 spatial configuration of usp temporal variations of salinity distributions near the coastline are shown in fig 6 which specifically focus on the variation of the shape of the usp over time under the influence of tides and injection of 2 4 m3 d at well iw1 as widely acknowledged usp changes during a tidal cycle all of the sub figures in fig 6 displayed the usp when the sea level rose to the average sea level similarly to the results displayed in fig 3 the tidal fluctuations produced a thick mixing zone and a large usp before the injection was applied fig 6a with the 50 isohaline indicating a relatively narrow freshwater discharge zone fig 6b shows that after 2 tidal cycles following injection the usp contracted compared to the conditions shown in fig 6a the usp contraction was mainly vertical with no obvious contraction in the horizontal direction further increasing contraction in both horizontal and vertical directions became more evident after longer injection durations fig 6c e which display the salinity distributions after four six and eight tidal cycles the shape of the usp in fig 6f fig 6g and fig 6h are relatively similar suggesting that a quasi steady state was reached after 10 tidal cycles however the lower seawater wedge as tracked using the 50 isohaline was still retreating back towards the coastal boundary seaward side after 20 cycles the usp thickness and toe length defined as tusp and xtoe in fig 1a were further used as a quantitative indicator of respectively usp and toe length change over time after injection the rate of change of δtusp the retreat thickness of usp by injection and δ xtoe marked by δusp δtusp t1 δtusp t1 t1 t2 and δsw δxtoe t1 δxtoe t1 t1 t2 during injection is shown in fig 7 a which indicates a non linear response of δtusp and the δ xtoe over time could be fitted by logarithmic functions δ αln t β where α and β are the coefficients if the absolute value of δ is taken as a measure of the rapidity of response to injection the larger δ 17 06 for usp and smaller δ 10 93 for δ xtoe indicate that the response of usp was more rapid than the response of the lower seawater wedge which is consistent with the results observed in fig 6 the variation of δtusp over time as obtained from the numerical simulation results is shown in fig 7b similarly to the lower seawater wedge the usp response to freshwater injection shows an overshoot phenomenon that is the usp thickness first rapidly decreased after injection was started which was followed by a small expansion fig 7b also indicates that freshwater injection at shallow depth led to a larger δtusp than at larger depths furthermore injections near the coastline inhibited the development of usp that is unsurprisingly injections at shallow depths i e iw3 and near the coastline i e iw1 would be more effective at controlling the development of usp 3 4 effect of tidal conditions the effect of different tidal amplitudes and periods on the dynamics of both the seawater wedge and usp under freshwater injection were numerically investigated input values considering injection of 2 4 m3 d at iw1 are shown in table 2 for a fixed tidal period of 240 s increasing tidal amplitudes led to an increasing δ xtoe for low salinity isohaline i e the tracked 5 isohaline as shown in fig 8 but a decreased δ xtoe for medium and high salinity isohalines i e 50 and 95 furthermore an overshoot phenomenon for all isohalines 5 50 and 95 was also observed and was particularly evident at higher tidal amplitudes for isohalines 50 and 95 which were initially pushed back by the injection but intruded landward then the final toe length marked by the 50 and 95 isohalines were even larger i e further inland negative δxtoe values after four hours of injection than the toe length before injection when the tidal amplitudes were set at 6 cm fig 8 also shows that the decrease of the usp thickness 50 isohaline following freshwater injection was larger for larger tidal amplitudes the effect of the tidal period on toe length and usp thickness are shown in fig 9 the tidal amplitudes in this section were all set at 5 cm it was clear that the increased tidal periods led to a smaller δ xtoe for the 5 isohaline but larger δ xtoe for 50 and 95 isohalines fig 8 and fig 9 also shows that the toe length overshoot phenomenon was more obvious for high salinity seaward isohalines i e 50 and 95 than for lower concentration landward isohalines i e 5 specifically the toe length overshoot for the 5 isohaline could only be seen when the tidal amplitude was set at 6 cm but the overshoot of the 95 isohaline was obvious even when the tidal amplitude was set as lower as 3 cm the sensitivity of injection driven toe length and usp thickness tracked by the 50 isohaline under different tidal conditions was also examined using numerical simulations and results are shown in fig 10 note that negative values of variation rates of tidal amplitudes the variation rate of tidal amplitudes between two scenarios was defined as a1 a2 a1 when the tidal amplitude a1 was applied to scenario s1 and a2 was applied to scenario s2 tidal periods δ xtoe and δ tusp mean a decrease of values consistently to the lab experiment results shown fig 8 and fig 9 and increasing variation rate of tidal amplitudes led to a linear increase of variation rate of δtusp and decrease of variation rate of δ xtoe tracked by the 50 isohaline a unit increase of tidal amplitudes resulted in an increase in about 4 2 units for δtusp and a decrease of about 2 3 units of δ xtoe increasing tidal periods also led to a linear increase of both δtusp and δ xtoe a unit increase of tidal periods led to an increase of about 3 6 units for δtusp and about 1 1 units for δ xtoe fig 10 also indicates that the variation of tidal amplitude and tidal period has a larger influence on the variation of the usp than the toe length 4 discussion artificial freshwater recharge is an efficient method in controlling seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers previous mar studies in coastal aquifers simplified the seaward boundary as a static condition defined by the mean sea level neglecting sea level oscillations driven by tides pu et al 2021 armanuos et al 2019 armanuos et al 2020 hussain et al 2019 lu et al 2017 luyun et al 2011 bouri and dhia 2010 yet other studies that also used laboratory experiments and or numerical simulations indicated that tidal oceanic oscillations significantly affect the salinity distributions and groundwater flow dynamics in coastal aquifers li et al 2000 robinson et al 2014 2018 xin et al 2011 2014 wilson et al 2015 xin et al 2018 xiao et al 2019 yang et al 2022 panjehfouladgaran and mahdi rajabi 2022 suk et al 2022 this suggested that tides may affect the performance of freshwater injection wells for use in controlling seawater intrusion to address this knowledge gap physical sandbox experiments combined with numerical models were conducted in a lab scale analogue of unconsolidated coastal aquifer in accordance with previous studies the numerical simulations indicated that fluctuating seawater levels formed a relatively thick shallow mixing zone of seawater and freshwater saline recirculation cell and reduced seawater intrusion extent the saline wedge significantly compared to the nontidal case kuan et al 2012 xin et al 2011 2014 wilson et al 2015 xin et al 2018 yang et al 2022 panjehfouladgaran and mahdi rajabi 2022 suk et al 2022 as demonstrated by kuan et al 2012 the reduced seawater intrusion extent could be attribute to the presence of usp which shifted the fresh groundwater discharge zone seaward to the low tide mark and thus restricted the intrusion of the saltwater wedge under tidal conditions injection wells that have been located and designed without considering tides would be further away from the seawater wedge leading to reduced efficiency for seawater intrusion in addition it is shown that the amplitude and period of tides dictate the distance of retreat of saltwater intrusion following injection thus tidal fluctuations should be considered for future design of freshwater injection wells due to the complexity of water and salt migration processes some of the derived results are counterintuitive for example the final simulated toe lengths tracked by the 50 and 95 isohalines were shown to be larger than before freshwater injection when the tidal amplitudes were set at 6 cm this could be attributed to the change of usp under injection condition according to previous studies the presence of usp produced by tides pushed the discharge zone of freshwater towards the sea kuan et al 2012 xin et al 2011 xin et al 2014 however the narrowing of the usp induced by freshwater injection would weaken this effect on the freshwater discharge zone and thus lead to the redistribution of salinity in seawater wedge also the obvious overshoot phenomenon in higher amplitude tidal conditions could also contribute to that counterintuitive result nevertheless more studies should be conducted to further examine this particular phenomenon the overshoot phenomenon has been observed in many previous studies of sea level rise and seawater intrusion under no tide conditions chang et al 2011 lu and werner 2013 morgan et al 2013 2015 watson et al 2010 specifically morgan et al 2013 confirmed through using sand tank model that the overshoot is a measurable physical process this was also observed in studies of seawater intrusion and retreat process that considered tides yu et al 2019 consistent with the results of yu et al 2019 we found that the overshoot phenomenon weakens when reducing tidal amplitude and strengthen when reducing tidal period we further found that this overshoot phenomenon weakens with decreasing injection rate and distance between injection well and coastal line the overshoot phenomenon was shown to reduce the effectiveness of artificial freshwater recharge in controlling seawater intrusion i e artificial freshwater recharge will be more effective in coastal aquifers with lower tide amplitudes in addition a short distance between coastline and injection well reduced the influence of the overshoot phenomenon on the effectiveness of freshwater injection evidently a larger injection rate leads to a larger retreat distance of the seawater toe but prolongs the overshoot phenomenon which reduces the effectiveness of freshwater injection therefore the larger retreat distances and larger overshoot distances induced by larger injection rate also need further optimization in practice the toe isohaline contours were used as quantitative indicators to describe seawater intrusion some authors used the 50 isohaline fang et al 2021a zheng et al 2021 morgan et al 2013 kuan et al 2012 while others used the 25 isohaline kaleris and ziogas 2013 wu et al 2020 our results suggest that tracking a single isohaline cannot accurately describe the seawater retreat process induced by artificial freshwater injection in the tidally affected coastal aquifer especially in these aquifers with higher tidal amplitudes in which the overshoot phenomenon would push the high concentration isohaline intrusion further inland after a long time injection but with little effect on the low concentration isohalines thus several toe isohalines across low to high concentration should be considered to comprehensively determine the performance of injection wells in controlling seawater intrusion practically long term monitoring of width and concentration range of the saltwater transition zone is needed to better test the performance of injection wells in controlling seawater intrusion because of the prolonged duration of the overshoot phenomenon affecting by high concentration isohalines mao et al 2006 indicated that density differences and tidal forcing lead to more complex hydrodynamic patterns in gently dipping beaches than in steeply dipping or vertical beaches for which the sloping beach enhances the effect of tides on coastal groundwater dynamics flow and solute transport yu et al 2019a yu et al 2019b demonstrated that a low angle dipping beach led to a wider usp associated with a wider intertidal zone yu et al 2019a yu et al 2019b also shows that larger hydraulic conductivity leads to a larger usp consistently with previous works kuan et al 2012 the expansion of the usp was shown in the present work to influence the seawater intrusion toe length in the lower part of the coastal aquifer whereby larger usp causes submarine groundwater discharge and saltwater wedge to migrate further offshore the variation of spatial configuration of the usp formed by tides should be considered when test the performance of artificial freshwater injection according to our knowledge this has not attracted enough attention in the development of approaches for controlling of seawater intrusion and the current study provides a contribution to fill this gap in addition the different response time of lower seawater wedge toe and usp to freshwater well injection suggested that multilayer injection wells installations could be considered in future studies to further optimize seawater intrusion control while minimizing the amount of injected freshwater we must highlight some limitations relating to the two dimensionality of the physical and numerical experiments conducted in this study indeed in a three dimensional aquifer a larger injection rate would be needed to move the seawater toe because of the additional flow component in the lateral direction in 3d geng and michael 2021 indicated that the existence of a groundwater flow component along the shore increases the variability of terrestrial groundwater travel length and travel time prior to discharge into the ocean the natural movement of groundwater along the shore in a three dimensional aquifer would also decrease the effectiveness of the artificial freshwater injection in mitigating seawater intrusion 5 conclusions lab scale experiments coupled with numerical simulations were conducted to examine the effect of tides on the effectiveness of artificial freshwater injection in controlling seawater intrusion in an unconfined coastal aquifer key conclusions are a tide significantly decreased the effectiveness of artificial freshwater recharge in controlling seawater intrusion in coastal aquifer in the given example freshwater injection rates should be increased by 76 to achieve the same retreat distance of seawater wedge toe as in the absence of tides b in presence of tides freshwater injection produces a narrower freshwater seawater mixing zone causing offshore migration of the low concentration isohalines but minor effect on high concentration isohaline c an overshoot phenomenon was observed in the numerical models just after injection which had more effect on high concentration isohalines than on lower concentration isohalines the phenomenon increased with increased injection rates increased distance between injection well and coastal line increased tidal amplitudes and shorter periods the phenomenon can further decrease the effectiveness of freshwater injection in controlling seawater intrusion d the response contraction of the upper saline plume to freshwater injection was more rapid and more sensitive to the variation of tidal conditions than the response of the lower seawater wedge e the toe retreat distance under freshwater injection is different and in some cases opposite for high and low concentration isohalines therefore both high and low isohaline should be tracked to best determine the performance of injection wells in controlling seawater intrusion this work highlights the important of considering tides on the retreat of seawater intrusion using freshwater injection because of the altered flow dynamic and salinity distribution accurately evaluation of effectiveness is of great important for the protection of groundwater resources and alleviation of groundwater contaminant in coastal aquifer thus further studies to examine more factors and be conducted in larger field scale are still needed to extend the application of study results in the future despite this study has provided a useful assessment of the effectiveness of artificial freshwater injection in coastal aquifers affected by tides credit authorship

2424,managed aquifer recharge mar using artificial freshwater recharge from infiltration basins or injection wells is an effective method to control seawater intrusion the effect of oceanic tides however are usually not considered when dimensioning and operating freshwater injection installations this study employed lab scale physical experiments and groundwater numerical models to investigate salt transport and salinity distributions as driven by artificial freshwater injection under the influence of tides in an unconfined coastal aquifer results revealed that the effectiveness of artificial freshwater injection is significantly reduced under tidal conditions as compared to conditions without tides the response of the upper saline plume the tidal recirculation cell to artificial freshwater injection in tidal conditions is nearly twice more rapid than that of the lower seawater wedge the seaward displacement of the seawater wedge toe is higher for low seawater concentration isohalines 5 than for higher concentration isohalines 50 to 95 it was further found that an overshoot phenomenon whereby the seawater toe first moves seaward before moving landward again occurs and mainly affects the higher concentration isohalines this further decreases the effectiveness of freshwater injection in controlling seawater intrusion and the phenomenon is more pronounced with increased injection rates increased distance between injection well and coastal line increased tidal amplitude and decreased tidal periods this study provides insights with direct implications

supply for drinking agricultural and industrial water in many coastal regions un 2017 xin et al 2019 palacios et al 2020 for example over 100 million americans and thousands of farms in coastal counties in us depend fully or partly on groundwater jasechko et al 2020 global scale analyses suggest that more than 45 of the world population i e 2 69 109 people in 2018 august lives within 100 km from the coastal line martínez et al 2007 fernandino et al 2018 and population density of coastal zones is approximately five times greater than that of global average neumann et al 2015 seawater intrusion is recognized as a global threat to freshwater resources in coastal areas and is amplified by increasing groundwater abstraction caused by high and growing coastal population and sea level rises induced by climate warming bear et al 1999 cui et al 2015 walther et al 2020 in addition to threatening freshwater supply seawater intrusion can have serious environmental impacts such increasing soil water salinity and triggering the mortality of salt intolerant vegetation werner 2010 shi and jiao 2014 lu et al 2017 therefore it is important to develop effective countermeasures to mitigate seawater intrusion in order to protect water supplies and ecosystems in coastal areas various engineering techniques exist to mitigate seawater intrusion and protect freshwater supply in coastal areas the most common techniques involve the construction of subsurface barriers including physical barriers such as construction of subsurface dams and cut off walls kaleris and ziogas 2013 wu et al 2020 fang et al 2021a fang et al 2021b gao et al 2022 or hydraulic barriers induced by freshwater injection from boreholes or infiltration trenches lu et al 2013 lu et al 2017 shi et al 2020 subsurface saltwater extraction stein et al 2019 stein et al 2020 injection extraction well pair whereby the extracted fresh groundwater is reinjected through the injection well located between the interface toe and extraction well ebeling et al 2019 lu et al 2019 double pumping barrier through use of an inland well pumping freshwater and a seaward well pumping saltwater pool and carrera 2010 air barriers which consist in injecting compressed air into the aquifer is another less common but effective method to prevent seawater intrusion which cannot cause a secondary contamination to the aquifer dror et al 2004 sun and semprich 2013 zang and li 2021 apart from subsurface barriers optimized arrangement and pumping of well fields is the most common and pragmatic precaution measures for reducing the risk of seawater intrusion it is typically accomplished through searching optimal well locations and pumping rates that enables both minimal extent of seawater intrusion and maximal pumping rate strack 1976 ataie ashtiani and ketabchi 2011 among the reported methods artificial recharge of freshwater through infiltration basins or injection wells is relatively cost effective method for preventing seawater intrusion through the management of infiltration injection rates the technique has been widely used in various hydrogeological settings to remediate salinized coastal aquifers including in the usa australia and china hussain et al 2019 luyun et al 2011 lu et al 2017 pu et al 2021 the dynamics and patterns of groundwater flow and salt transport in coastal aquifers subject to artificial freshwater recharge have been examined through various approaches including analytical solutions numerical simulations lab scale experiments and field investigations armanuos et al 2019 armanuos et al 2020 lu et al 2017 luyun et al 2011 bouri and dhia 2010 previous studies have generated important insights into the performance of artificial freshwater recharge demonstrating that it is an efficient method to slow down or reverse seawater intrusion in which the sea boundary was always simplified as a static condition neglecting oceanic water table oscillations driven by tides yet the temporal variability of sea levels associated with oceanic tides is widespread and the effect of tidally induced sea level fluctuation on the groundwater flow and salinity in coastal aquifers has been examined extensively li et al 2000 robinson et al 2014 2018 xin et al 2011 2014 wilson et al 2015 xin et al 2018 levanon et al 2019 xiao et al 2019 yang et al 2022 panjehfouladgaran and mahdi rajabi 2022 suk et al 2022 all these studies suggested that the coupled groundwater flow and salt transport were significantly altered by periodic tidal fluctuations in both confined and unconfined coastal aquifers resulting in enhanced dispersion of the freshwater saltwater transition zone the formation of an upper saline plume usp and the migration of the lower saltwater wedge sw towards the seaward side as compared to no tide conditions parlange et al 1984 nielsen 1990 li et al 2000 robinson et al 2014 2018 xin et al 2011 xin et al 2014 xin et al 2022 das et al 2021 fang et al 2021a suk et al 2022 yang et al 2022 a few authors have reported on the effect of physical barriers such as cut off wall and subsurface dams on the groundwater flow and salt transport in coastal aquifer that considered a fluctuating sea level for example shen et al 2020 showed that the retreat effectiveness of the cutoff wall on saltwater intrusion was no longer evident under tidal conditions compared with that in no tide condition fang et al 2021 revealed that tidal fluctuations significantly increased the effective sea discharge height range edhr which dictates the effectiveness of subsurface dams and that the lower and upper thresholds of the edhr were lower than in absence of tides yang et al 2021 numerically simulated in 2d vertical an ocean surge inundation on an island constructed with a cut off wall indicating that the cut off wall can significantly reduce seawater infiltration by up to 40 during the inundation to the best of our knowledge however the effect of oceanic tides on the efficiency of artificial freshwater injection to control seawater intrusion is still lacking specifically the differences in performance of artificial freshwater injection with and without tides have not been compared such analysis is urgent given the ubiquity of tidal conditions in coastal aquifer thus a series of laboratory experiments examined alongside numerical simulations were implemented to investigate the groundwater flow and salinity patterns driven by artificial freshwater injection under the influence of various tidal regimes amplitude period and further assess the influence of tides on the artificial recharge performance the saltwater toe location and the spatial configuration of usp under different scenarios were adopted as performance indicators the results are discussed with a focus on providing guidelines for the design of efficient artificial freshwater injection wells in controlling seawater intrusion 2 methodology 2 1 laboratory experiments controlled lab scale experiments were conducted in a 2d sand tank fig 1 of dimensions 3 7 m length 0 8 m height 0 05 m width the sand tank was divided into three compartments the left hand side was a salt water reservoir 0 1 m in length representing the sea boundary the middle part 3 5 m in length was packed with fine sands to represent loose sediments and the right hand side was another freshwater reservoir 0 1 m in length representing the landward freshwater boundary in the physical experiments well screen holes were made on the back face of the sand tank and were connected to peristaltic pumps with a maximum pumping rate of 2 88 m3 d wu et al 2019 wu et al 2021 the landward freshwater reservoir was connected to an overflow tank filled with freshwater to maintain a constant freshwater head boundary the seaward side reservoir was also connected to an overflow tank filled with saltwater to maintain a constant salinity and water level under the no tide condition the seaward side reservoir was further connected to a variable height overflow column which was used to generate sinusoidal tides under the tidal condition cartwright et al 2003 cartwright et al 2004 the sinusoidal tides level could be described as follows 1 h t h msl a sin 2 π t t where h t is the transient sea level l at time t t hmsl is the mean sea level l a is the tidal amplitude l and t is the tidal period t the granulometry of the sand used in the experiments was relatively uniform with d50 0 42 mm and d90 d10 2 57 these parameters were optically determined using a ls particle size analyzer by beckman coulter usa with a measurement range between 0 040 μm and 2000 μm the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the sand was measured at 2 4 10 3 5 m s using the constant head method and the bulk porosity was found to be 0 4 using the oven drying method wu et al 2019 the seawater was prepared by dissolving sodium chloride nacl ar grade 34 g to obtain a salinity and density of 35 1 g l and 1025 1 g l respectively the longitudinal dispersity was measured using 1 d column experiment at 0 001 m chang et al 2019 to visualize the saltwater intrusion process and patterns the tracer dye eosine red was added to the seaward side reservoir at a concentration of 0 3 g l the effect of the tracer on the density and viscosity of the fluid were assumed to be negligible stoeckl and houben 2012 the freshwater was deionized water with a salinity of 0 g l and density of 1000 g l to analyze the development of both the seawater wedge and the usp the physical experiment was recorded using a canon eos r7 pixel 3250 w camera capturing one frame every 10 min 2 2 numerical simulations to allow for extending the findings from the lab experiments to field scale studies numerical simulations were also conducted which enabled to quantify the dynamics of groundwater flow and salt transport and the movement of the freshwater seawater mixing zone feflow diersch 2014 a finite element variably saturated groundwater flow modeling program which has been widely applied to the modelling of seawater intrusion including in tidal conditions zheng et al 2020 fang et al 2021a fang et al 2021b ke et al 2021 was used the equations diersch 2014 governing the groundwater flow as computed in feflow code are shown below 2 ε s ρ ρ t ε s t k r k ψ 1 χ e 0 3 t ε s c c k r k ψ 1 χ e ε s d c 0 4 χ ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 α c c 0 c s c 0 where ε is the porosity s is the water saturation ρ and ρo are the fluid and freshwater density ml 3 respectively t is the time t kr is the relative hydraulic

and minimum solute concentration ml 3 respectively d is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor l2t 1 α is the solute expansion coefficient additionally the relationships between relative hydraulic conductivity water saturation and capillary pressure head are described by the van genuchten 1980 functions the lab scale numerical model was set according to the sand tank experimental setup including the boundary conditions and the calibrated hydrogeological parameters fig 1b in particular the landward boundary of the model was set as constant head and constant concentration boundary the seaward boundary was set as constant head and constant mass concentration boundary under no tide conditions and a variable head and constant mass concentration boundary under tide condition the seawater level fluctuations were set according to equation 1 practically the seawater boundary was set as follows 1 in no tide conditions a constant head was applied to all nodes of the boundary 2 in tidal conditions a fixed seawater head boundary was dynamically applied to the nodes located below the time varying seawater level whereas nodes above this level were assigned a seepage face at the corresponding time step whist the nodes which are located below the minimum tide level were permanently assigned a fixed time varying seawater level however because the seawater level fluctuated at different time steps according to the varying tidal stage the nodes located above which became lower than sea level when tide raised were then converted from seepage nodes to fixed seawater level nodes and this until the tide fell again below them at which point they were converted back to seepage nodes it should be pointed out that time series of seawater head at each node below seawater level was calculated first according to the piezometric head of seawater and the vertical coordinate of boundary nodes and then applied to each node the parameters adopted in the numerical models are shown in table1 the nine injection wells were set with constant injection rates using the well bc in feflow the top and bottom boundary of the lab scale model by default were set as no flow bcs for both flow and mass transport 2 3 scenarios definition three pairs of sub scenarios table 2 scenarios s1 and scenarios s1 scenarios s2 and scenarios s2 scenarios s3 and scenarios s3 were conducted to investigate the influence of tide on the performance of injection well in controlling seawater intrusion scenarios s1 represented the experiments and numerical simulations without injections under no tide conditions scenarios s2 represented the experiments and numerical simulations without injections but under tidal conditions using a constant tidal period but variable tidal amplitudes scenarios s3 represented constant tidal amplitude and variable tidal period the asterisk denotes the sub scenarios applying well injections all of the experiments were run for at least 24 h until the groundwater flow and salt distribution reached a quasi steady state i e in no tide conditions a dynamic steady state in tidal conditions after which the injections were switched on the scenarios input variables are summarized in table2 3 results 3 1 comparison of lab experiments and numerical simulations image captures of steady state under no tide conditions and dynamic steady state under tidal conditions from the sand tank experiments were used to verify the numerical simulation results using the 50 seawater isohalines fig 2 shows that the simulated seawater plume for the scenarios s1 s1 s2 and s2 displaying the salinity distribution at the quasi steady state conditions compared well with the experimental observations all of the sub figures in fig 2 displayed the seawater plume when the sea level rose to the average sea level similarly to previous studies fang et al 2021a fang et al 2021b kuan et al 2012 and 2019 at that small scale the dye tracer did not produce a mixing zone between freshwater and seawater due to the high porosity the low dispersivity and the low hydraulic gradients which restrict dispersion instead only a clear sharp interface was recorded fig 2a á and fig 2b b show the steady state salinity distributions without tides and with and without injection scenarios s1 and s1 respectively indicating that the seawater toe was pushed back towards the sea side in both physical experiments and numerical simulation which are very similar in fig 2á and fig 2b the numerical simulation results indicated that no obvious change in the thickness of the mixing zone along the seawater and freshwater interface could be observed under no injection conditions freshwater injection however resulted in a narrower mixing zone at the bottom of the aquifer compared to the upper part near the beach consistent with previous studies kuan et al 2012 and 2019 yu et al 2019a yu et al 2019b shen et al 2020 fang et al 2021a fang et al 2021b sea level fluctuations induced by tide formed a usp in the upper part of the aquifer and a seawater wedge in the lower part of the aquifer as shown in fig 2c ć and fig 2d d in the tidal scenarios the formation of the usp significantly inhibited the distance of penetration of the seawater i e the toe as compared to fig 2a á no tides also a significant wider mixing zone can be seen in fig 2ćas a result of tidal fluctuations which enhanced solute dispersion fig 2d d show a clear retreat distance of seawater wedge after injection compared to fig 2c ć no injection although the retreat distance tracked by the 5 isohaline toe fig 2ć d in tidal conditions is larger than that tracked by the 50 isohaline toe fig 2c d the retreat distance of seawater wedge induced by injection in no tide conditions is significantly larger than that in tidal conditions the freshwater injection significantly reduced the thickness of the freshwater saltwater mixing zone indicated by the numerical simulation results in fig 2ć d and led to the development of a fresh water discharge zone both indicated by fig 2c ć with fig 2d d under tidal conditions in addition to retreating the lower seawater wedge the freshwater injection also reduced the thickness of usp shrinking 3 2 seawater toe location fig 3 displayed the effect on salinity distribution over time after constant rate injection of freshwater and under the influence of tides initially before injection was applied relatively thick seawater freshwater mixing zone and usp were produced by the numerical simulations as a result of the mixing of freshwater inflow from inland with the density driven seawater entering from the sea boundary the freshwater discharge zone in these pre injection conditions was in fact brackish due to the large dispersion after starting freshwater injection however the salinity of the discharge zone decreased forming a better separation between the usp and lower seawater wedge alongside a considerably retreating seawater wedge and a shrunk usp furthermore the injection also increased the tilt angle of the seawater freshwater interface which was most obvious when looking at the 5 isohaline contour fig 4 a shows the temporal variations of the toe retreat distance along the aquifer base marked by δ xtoe displaying the retreat process of seawater induced by injection with the injection rate at iw1 of 1 6 m3 d the toe movement was generally consistent between the physical experiments and the numerically simulated 50 isohaline which was used to calibrate the numerical model both physical and numerical experiment indicated that the toe movement over time δ xtoe is non linear under both no tide and tidal conditions in more details the response of the 5 isohaline toe in absence of tides was slower than for the 50 and 95 isohalines with the latter having the fastest response a significantly reduced toe retreat distance was observed fig 4a for the tidal conditions as compared to no tide opposite to no tide conditions in tidal conditions the response of the simulated 5 isohaline toe was faster than for the 50 and 95 isohaline toes freshwater injections in tidal conditions also led to a much larger δ xtoe for the 5 isohaline than that of 50 and 95 isohaline as indicated by fig 4b the increase of toe with increasing injection rate is slower under tidal conditions than when there are no tides in other words in tidal condition larger injection rates were needed to achieve the same δ xtoe as in no tide condition for example to achieve a δ xtoe of 45 cm in the lab the injection rate should be increased from 1 127 m3 d in no tide conditions to 1 987 m3 d 76 3 increase in tidal conditions the toe response under varying injection rate was observed to be nonlinear and could be fitted by logarithmic functions fig 4b whereby the increase in toe retreat with increasing injection rate slowed down for high injection rates following freshwater injection an overshoot phenomenon was also observed in the numerical simulations in tidal conditions fig 4a that is the toes initially moved back towards the sea boundary but later moved back inland this overshoot phenomenon is more obvious in fig 5 a which specifically plots the δ xtoe evolution of the 50 isohaline at different injection locations fig 5a also indicates that the magnitude of the overshoot increases with increasing upstream distance from injection well i e from iw1 to iw7 the depth of injection iw1 to iw3 however shows much smaller effect on the overshoot it was found that the overshoot was more marked when the injection rate was higher fig 5b for example the overshoot distance decreased from 9 124 cm to 1 758 cm when the injection rate was decreased from 2 4 m3 d to 1 6 m3 d fig 5a also shows that the δ xtoe 50 isohaline decreased with increasing injection depth and with increasing injection distance from sea boundary unfortunately this overshoot phenomenon indicated by numerical simulation results was not confirmed by the lab experiments possibly because of the freshwater seawater sharp interface narrow mixing zone produced by the dye tracer 3 3 spatial configuration of usp temporal variations of salinity distributions near the coastline are shown in fig 6 which specifically focus on the variation of the shape of the usp over time under the influence of tides and injection of 2 4 m3 d at well iw1 as widely acknowledged usp changes during a tidal cycle all of the sub figures in fig 6 displayed the usp when the sea level rose to the average sea level similarly to the results displayed in fig 3 the tidal fluctuations produced a thick mixing zone and a large usp before the injection was applied fig 6a with the 50 isohaline indicating a relatively narrow freshwater discharge zone fig 6b shows that after 2 tidal cycles following injection the usp contracted compared to the conditions shown in fig 6a the usp contraction was mainly vertical with no obvious contraction in the horizontal direction further increasing contraction in both horizontal and vertical directions became more evident after longer injection durations fig 6c e which display the salinity distributions after four six and eight tidal cycles the shape of the usp in fig 6f fig 6g and fig 6h are relatively similar suggesting that a quasi steady state was reached after 10 tidal cycles however the lower seawater wedge as tracked using the 50 isohaline was still retreating back towards the coastal boundary seaward side after 20 cycles the usp thickness and toe length defined as tusp and xtoe in fig 1a were further used as a quantitative indicator of respectively usp and toe length change over time after injection the rate of change of δtusp the retreat thickness of usp by injection and δ xtoe marked by δusp δtusp t1 δtusp t1 t1 t2 and δsw δxtoe t1 δxtoe t1 t1 t2 during injection is shown in fig 7 a which indicates a non linear response of δtusp and the δ xtoe over time could be fitted by logarithmic functions δ αln t β where α and β are the coefficients if the absolute value of δ is taken as a measure of the rapidity of response to injection the larger δ 17 06 for usp and smaller δ 10 93 for δ xtoe indicate that the response of usp was more rapid than the response of the lower seawater wedge which is consistent with the results observed in fig 6 the variation of δtusp over time as obtained from the numerical simulation results is shown in fig 7b similarly to the lower seawater wedge the usp response to freshwater injection shows an overshoot phenomenon that is the usp thickness first rapidly decreased after injection was started which was followed by a small expansion fig 7b also indicates that freshwater injection at shallow depth led to a larger δtusp than at larger depths furthermore injections near the coastline inhibited the development of usp that is unsurprisingly injections at shallow depths i e iw3 and near the coastline i e iw1 would be more effective at controlling the development of usp 3 4 effect of tidal conditions the effect of different tidal amplitudes and periods on the dynamics of both the seawater wedge and usp under freshwater injection were numerically investigated input values considering injection of 2 4 m3 d at iw1 are shown in table 2 for a fixed tidal period of 240 s increasing tidal amplitudes led to an increasing δ xtoe for low salinity isohaline i e the tracked 5 isohaline as shown in fig 8 but a decreased δ xtoe for medium and high salinity isohalines i e 50 and 95 furthermore an overshoot phenomenon for all isohalines 5 50 and 95 was also observed and was particularly evident at higher tidal amplitudes for isohalines 50 and 95 which were initially pushed back by the injection but intruded landward then the final toe length marked by the 50 and 95 isohalines were even larger i e further inland negative δxtoe values after four hours of injection than the toe length before injection when the tidal amplitudes were set at 6 cm fig 8 also shows that the decrease of the usp thickness 50 isohaline following freshwater injection was larger for larger tidal amplitudes the effect of the tidal period on toe length and usp thickness are shown in fig 9 the tidal amplitudes in this section were all set at 5 cm it was clear that the increased tidal periods led to a smaller δ xtoe for the 5 isohaline but larger δ xtoe for 50 and 95 isohalines fig 8 and fig 9 also shows that the toe length overshoot phenomenon was more obvious for high salinity seaward isohalines i e 50 and 95 than for lower concentration landward isohalines i e 5 specifically the toe length overshoot for the 5 isohaline could only be seen when the tidal amplitude was set at 6 cm but the overshoot of the 95 isohaline was obvious even when the tidal amplitude was set as lower as 3 cm the sensitivity of injection driven toe length and usp thickness tracked by the 50 isohaline under different tidal conditions was also examined using numerical simulations and results are shown in fig 10 note that negative values of variation rates of tidal amplitudes the variation rate of tidal amplitudes between two scenarios was defined as a1 a2 a1 when the tidal amplitude a1 was applied to scenario s1 and a2 was applied to scenario s2 tidal periods δ xtoe and δ tusp mean a decrease of values consistently to the lab experiment results shown fig 8 and fig 9 and increasing variation rate of tidal amplitudes led to a linear increase of variation rate of δtusp and decrease of variation rate of δ xtoe tracked by the 50 isohaline a unit increase of tidal amplitudes resulted in an increase in about 4 2 units for δtusp and a decrease of about 2 3 units of δ xtoe increasing tidal periods also led to a linear increase of both δtusp and δ xtoe a unit increase of tidal periods led to an increase of about 3 6 units for δtusp and about 1 1 units for δ xtoe fig 10 also indicates that the variation of tidal amplitude and tidal period has a larger influence on the variation of the usp than the toe length 4 discussion artificial freshwater recharge is an efficient method in controlling seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers previous mar studies in coastal aquifers simplified the seaward boundary as a static condition defined by the mean sea level neglecting sea level oscillations driven by tides pu et al 2021 armanuos et al 2019 armanuos et al 2020 hussain et al 2019 lu et al 2017 luyun et al 2011 bouri and dhia 2010 yet other studies that also used laboratory experiments and or numerical simulations indicated that tidal oceanic oscillations significantly affect the salinity distributions and groundwater flow dynamics in coastal aquifers li et al 2000 robinson et al 2014 2018 xin et al 2011 2014 wilson et al 2015 xin et al 2018 xiao et al 2019 yang et al 2022 panjehfouladgaran and mahdi rajabi 2022 suk et al 2022 this suggested that tides may affect the performance of freshwater injection wells for use in controlling seawater intrusion to address this knowledge gap physical sandbox experiments combined with numerical models were conducted in a lab scale analogue of unconsolidated coastal aquifer in accordance with previous studies the numerical simulations indicated that fluctuating seawater levels formed a relatively thick shallow mixing zone of seawater and freshwater saline recirculation cell and reduced seawater intrusion extent the saline wedge significantly compared to the nontidal case kuan et al 2012 xin et al 2011 2014 wilson et al 2015 xin et al 2018 yang et al 2022 panjehfouladgaran and mahdi rajabi 2022 suk et al 2022 as demonstrated by kuan et al 2012 the reduced seawater intrusion extent could be attribute to the presence of usp which shifted the fresh groundwater discharge zone seaward to the low tide mark and thus restricted the intrusion of the saltwater wedge under tidal conditions injection wells that have been located and designed without considering tides would be further away from the seawater wedge leading to reduced efficiency for seawater intrusion in addition it is shown that the amplitude and period of tides dictate the distance of retreat of saltwater intrusion following injection thus tidal fluctuations should be considered for future design of freshwater injection wells due to the complexity of water and salt migration processes some of the derived results are counterintuitive for example the final simulated toe lengths tracked by the 50 and 95 isohalines were shown to be larger than before freshwater injection when the tidal amplitudes were set at 6 cm this could be attributed to the change of usp under injection condition according to previous studies the presence of usp produced by tides pushed the discharge zone of freshwater towards the sea kuan et al 2012 xin et al 2011 xin et al 2014 however the narrowing of the usp induced by freshwater injection would weaken this effect on the freshwater discharge zone and thus lead to the redistribution of salinity in seawater wedge also the obvious overshoot phenomenon in higher amplitude tidal conditions could also contribute to that counterintuitive result nevertheless more studies should be conducted to further examine this particular phenomenon the overshoot phenomenon has been observed in many previous studies of sea level rise and seawater intrusion under no tide conditions chang et al 2011 lu and werner 2013 morgan et al 2013 2015 watson et al 2010 specifically morgan et al 2013 confirmed through using sand tank model that the overshoot is a measurable physical process this was also observed in studies of seawater intrusion and retreat process that considered tides yu et al 2019 consistent with the results of yu et al 2019 we found that the overshoot phenomenon weakens when reducing tidal amplitude and strengthen when reducing tidal period we further found that this overshoot phenomenon weakens with decreasing injection rate and distance between injection well and coastal line the overshoot phenomenon was shown to reduce the effectiveness of artificial freshwater recharge in controlling seawater intrusion i e artificial freshwater recharge will be more effective in coastal aquifers with lower tide amplitudes in addition a short distance between coastline and injection well reduced the influence of the overshoot phenomenon on the effectiveness of freshwater injection evidently a larger injection rate leads to a larger retreat distance of the seawater toe but prolongs the overshoot phenomenon which reduces the effectiveness of freshwater injection therefore the larger retreat distances and larger overshoot distances induced by larger injection rate also need further optimization in practice the toe isohaline contours were used as quantitative indicators to describe seawater intrusion some authors used the 50 isohaline fang et al 2021a zheng et al 2021 morgan et al 2013 kuan et al 2012 while others used the 25 isohaline kaleris and ziogas 2013 wu et al 2020 our results suggest that tracking a single isohaline cannot accurately describe the seawater retreat process induced by artificial freshwater injection in the tidally affected coastal aquifer especially in these aquifers with higher tidal amplitudes in which the overshoot phenomenon would push the high concentration isohaline intrusion further inland after a long time injection but with little effect on the low concentration isohalines thus several toe isohalines across low to high concentration should be considered to comprehensively determine the performance of injection wells in controlling seawater intrusion practically long term monitoring of width and concentration range of the saltwater transition zone is needed to better test the performance of injection wells in controlling seawater intrusion because of the prolonged duration of the overshoot phenomenon affecting by high concentration isohalines mao et al 2006 indicated that density differences and tidal forcing lead to more complex hydrodynamic patterns in gently dipping beaches than in steeply dipping or vertical beaches for which the sloping beach enhances the effect of tides on coastal groundwater dynamics flow and solute transport yu et al 2019a yu et al 2019b demonstrated that a low angle dipping beach led to a wider usp associated with a wider intertidal zone yu et al 2019a yu et al 2019b also shows that larger hydraulic conductivity leads to a larger usp consistently with previous works kuan et al 2012 the expansion of the usp was shown in the present work to influence the seawater intrusion toe length in the lower part of the coastal aquifer whereby larger usp causes submarine groundwater discharge and saltwater wedge to migrate further offshore the variation of spatial configuration of the usp formed by tides should be considered when test the performance of artificial freshwater injection according to our knowledge this has not attracted enough attention in the development of approaches for controlling of seawater intrusion and the current study provides a contribution to fill this gap in addition the different response time of lower seawater wedge toe and usp to freshwater well injection suggested that multilayer injection wells installations could be considered in future studies to further optimize seawater intrusion control while minimizing the amount of injected freshwater we must highlight some limitations relating to the two dimensionality of the physical and numerical experiments conducted in this study indeed in a three dimensional aquifer a larger injection rate would be needed to move the seawater toe because of the additional flow component in the lateral direction in 3d geng and michael 2021 indicated that the existence of a groundwater flow component along the shore increases the variability of terrestrial groundwater travel length and travel time prior to discharge into the ocean the natural movement of groundwater along the shore in a three dimensional aquifer would also decrease the effectiveness of the artificial freshwater injection in mitigating seawater intrusion 5 conclusions lab scale experiments coupled with numerical simulations were conducted to examine the effect of tides on the effectiveness of artificial freshwater injection in controlling seawater intrusion in an unconfined coastal aquifer key conclusions are a tide significantly decreased the effectiveness of artificial freshwater recharge in controlling seawater intrusion in coastal aquifer in the given example freshwater injection rates should be increased by 76 to achieve the same retreat distance of seawater wedge toe as in the absence of tides b in presence of tides freshwater injection produces a narrower freshwater seawater mixing zone causing offshore migration of the low concentration isohalines but minor effect on high concentration isohaline c an overshoot phenomenon was observed in the numerical models just after injection which had more effect on high concentration isohalines than on lower concentration isohalines the phenomenon increased with increased injection rates increased distance between injection well and coastal line increased tidal amplitudes and shorter periods the phenomenon can further decrease the effectiveness of freshwater injection in controlling seawater intrusion d the response contraction of the upper saline plume to freshwater injection was more rapid and more sensitive to the variation of tidal conditions than the response of the lower seawater wedge e the toe retreat distance under freshwater injection is different and in some cases opposite for high and low concentration isohalines therefore both high and low isohaline should be tracked to best determine the performance of injection wells in controlling seawater intrusion this work highlights the important of considering tides on the retreat of seawater intrusion using freshwater injection because of the altered flow dynamic and salinity distribution accurately evaluation of effectiveness is of great important for the protection of groundwater resources and alleviation of groundwater contaminant in coastal aquifer thus further studies to examine more factors and be conducted in larger field scale are still needed to extend the application of study results in the future despite this study has provided a useful assessment of the effectiveness of artificial freshwater injection in coastal aquifers affected by tides credit authorship
