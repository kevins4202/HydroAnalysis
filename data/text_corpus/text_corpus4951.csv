24755,cyanobacteria blooms especially those involving microcystis are an increasing problem worldwide complex pathways between temperature and nutrient loads are thought to be the major drivers leading to microcystis dominance in freshwater systems in this paper microcystis dominance in a mediterranean hypereutrophic reservoir is studied over a period of three years a structural equation model sem was developed to delineate the main pathways responsible for microcystis dominance the model results showed that direct temperature effects appear to be the primary driving force behind microcystis growth and dominance nonetheless indirect temperature effects captured through pathways representing water column stratification and internal nutrient release also influenced microcystis while direct nutrient pathways were significant they were less important than temperature effects likely due to the eutrophic nature of the reservoir and microcystis high affinity and storage capabilities for phosphorus internal nutrient loads were shown to be the main driver sustaining high nutrient concentrations in the reservoir the model was able to explain 50 of the observed variability in microcystis biovolume 81 of the variation in surface tp and 46 of the variation in stratification magnitude overall the developed sem proved to be an effective tool towards capturing and quantifying the complex causal relationships leading to the dominance of microcystis in a hypereutrophic semi arid mediterranean reservoir keywords structural equation modeling microcystis cyanobacteria eutrophication 1 introduction recent decades have seen a dramatic increase in reported blooms of cyanobacteria species in fresh waterbodies worldwide particularly in response to increased eutrophication and a warming climate carey et al 2012 kosten et al 2012 paerl and paul 2012 schindler 2006 smith et al 2006 strumpf et al 2012 although naturally occurring cyanobacteria tend to out compete other algae groups when conditions are amenable particularly at higher temperatures and in waters with sufficient nutrient inputs davis et al 2009 dokulil and teubner 2000 downing et al 2001 elliott 2012 o neil et al 2012 paerl and otten 2013 robarts and zohary 1987 microcystis species in particular have been reported as successful competitors in freshwater systems under high temperature conditions blottière et al 2014 carey et al 2012 kosten et al 2012 paerl et al 2011 robarts and zohary 1987 reducing diversity in the algae community and leading to deteriorated conditions of the affected waterbodies on a global scale of primary concern are impacts related to lowered oxygen concentrations and hypoxia fish kills noxious odors and an increase in toxins release by microcystis and other cyanobacteria into the environment carpenter et al 1998 dittmann and wiegand 2006 dodds et al 2009 falconer 1996 merel et al 2013 niamien ebrottie et al 2015 paerl et al 2001 2011 much is known about the key environmental factors that generally promote the growth and dominance of microcystis including high optimal growing temperatures a stable water column long water residence times and high nutrient concentrations particularly phosphorus jacoby et al 2000 jiang et al 2008 michalak et al 2013 molot et al 2014 paerl and otten 2013 robarts and zohary 1987 schindler 2006 moreover its strong competitive abilities in relation to other freshwater algae groups are also known to be important factors these include its ability to buffer ph above neutrality to live in high temperature environments to uptake and internally store nutrients to regulate buoyance in order to reach different water column layers to inhibit the growth of other algae species through allelopathic effects and to form colonies and toxins that both limit predation carey et al 2012 chaffin et al 2012 chung et al 2014 dokulil and teubner 2000 miller et al 2013 niamien ebrottie et al 2015 paerl et al 2011 wagner and adrian 2009 studies to date have focused on assessing the direct effect of environmental variables on microcystis proliferation including temperature carey et al 2012 o neil et al 2012 robarts and zohary 1987 wagner and adrian 2009 nutrients downing et al 2001 trimbee and prepas 1987 xu et al 2010 2015 and light chaffin et al 2012 dokulil and teubner 2000 jiang et al 2008 yet accounting for the complex direct and indirect interactions between these variables has often been suggested to be an important step towards better understanding microcystis dynamics bista et al 2014 dokulil and teubner 2000 kosten et al 2012 o neil et al 2012 the use of a structural equation modeling sem framework jӧreskog 1973 keesling 1972 wiley 1973 provides an opportunity to adopt a systems based approach towards examining the relationship between interrelated response variables and their predictors through a network of direct and indirect pathways sems have gained increasing prominence within the limnological field over the last decade with a number of studies using this method to model eutrophication arhonditsis et al 2007 2006 liu et al 2010 salmaso 2011 stomp et al 2011 in this paper a sem is developed to predict microcystis biovolume changes in a semi arid hyper eutrophic reservoir in relation to measured physiochemical drivers the model is then used to assess the 1 the importance of direct and indirect temperature effects on microcystis biovolume 2 the interaction between temperature and nutrient inputs and 3 the relative importance of allochthonous and autochthonous nutrient loads in sustaining growth moreover the sem model highlighted important processes specific to semi arid water bodies particularly the impact of water level fluctuations on reservoir nutrient cycling 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area qaraoun reservoir 33 34 n 35 42 e altitude 840 m is the largest freshwater body in lebanon it was constructed in 1959 to provide water for hydroelectric power generation irrigation recreation and domestic water recreational activities along the shores provide income to local communities and a small fishing community also exists on the reservoir the reservoir is situated in the semi arid bekaa valley of central lebanon fig 1 the major source of water into the reservoir is the litani river the longest internal river in the country and lebanon s most economically important river development alternatives incorporated 2005 earth link advanced resources development 2011 the climate of the area is typical of the mediterranean with hot and dry summers contrasting moderately cold and wet winters average precipitation within the basin is 600 mm year falling mostly in the winter months december to march snow also accumulates on the mountains on either side of the bekaa valley and contributes to the litani river flow the average flow of the litani river over the entire study period was 2 5 m3 s with the highest flows up to 30 m3 s occurring in the spring season and flows decreasing to zero during late summer and early fall the mean water residence time in the reservoir is around 0 77 years fadel et al 2014 meanwhile the size of the contributing catchment to the reservoir is around 1600 km2 the reservoir s surface area fluctuates between 4 and 11 km2 sometimes within a single year depending on the seasonal precipitation patterns seasonal water recharge and dam discharge rates deutsch and alameddine 2019 given the semi arid nature of the area the drainage ratio i e the ratio of catchment area to surface area of the reservoir is higher than what is typical for man made reservoirs walter et al 2020 reservoir depths vary spatially with the deepest section near the dam exceeding 45 m median lake depths fluctuate between 10 and 20 m depending on seasonal water level changes the qaraoun reservoir has suffered from eutrophication starting in the mid 1980s yet median summer chlorophyll a concentrations have more than doubled since then 30 µg l in the 1980s to 150 µg l post 2010 while the mean secchi disk depth sdd dropped from 1 5 m in the early 1990s to less than 0 75 m post 2010 deutsch and alameddine 2019 during the study period we observed that surface water temperatures in the reservoir ranged between 7 0 and 31 c surface orthophosphate po4 levels showed large spatio temporal variability with levels varying between below 0 01 to as high as 0 38 mg l bottom po4 concentrations were generally elevated during the summer due to internal loading from anoxic sediments their levels in the summer reached values as high as 0 68 mg l surface tp concentrations ranged between 0 01 and 4 7 mg l while bottom tp levels varied between 0 01 and 4 5 mg l bottom tp levels were generally higher than those at the surface particularly during summer stratified periods chlorophyll a concentrations in qaraoun ranged from as low as 3 5 µg l in the winter up to 5502 1 µg l recorded during a summer microcystis bloom blooms were primarily caused by cyanobacteria species namely microcystis aeruginosa and aphanizomenon flos aquae microcystis and to a lesser extent aphanizomenon dominated the algae community in all but the winter months suppressing eukaryotic growth in warmer seasons microcystis formed monospecific blooms during all three summers of the study period aphizominon blooms were also common especially in early spring and late fall 2 2 data collection and analysis in situ data from the reservoir were collected between july 4 2013 and october 6 2015 at intervals of approximately three weeks for a total of 34 sampling dates sampling frequencies were lower in the winter months due to poor weather conditions on the reservoir initially the sampling stations were positioned along the north south and east west axes of the reservoir in order to capture any spatial variability in water quality variables fig 1 starting september 9 2014 samples were only taken along the north south center line of the reservoir due to drought conditions and reservoir area shrinkage two additional sampling points were added along the north south center line of the reservoir from this date recently an ultrasonic cyanobacterial treatment system has been deployed on the reservoir making more recent data from the reservoir not representative of its natural conditions two water samples were taken from each monitoring station with a depth greater than 10 m one 10 20 cm below the water surface and one 4 m from the bottom of the reservoir using a van dorn depth sampler and a ysi exo2 sonde only surface samples were collected from shallow stations given the observed temporal changes in reservoir water level station depths m were recorded for each sampling date water temperature c was measured in the field the ysi exo2 sonde was used to capture complete vertical temperature profiles across stations vertical temperature profiles were used to determine the mixed layer depth zm the magnitude of lake stratification at each station was defined in terms of the difference between surface and bottom water temperatures c dissolved oxygen do mg l was measured in the field initially with a hanna hi 9143 autocal dissolved oxygen meter and then with the ysi exo2 sonde water ph was measured using an orion researcher micro processor ph meter total dissolved solids tds and conductivity were both measured using a portable cole palmer td conductivity meter additionally secchi disk depth sdd m was measured at each station and was converted to euphotic zone depth zs by multiplying the measurements by the 2 81 french et al 1982 reservoir volume m3 for each sampling date was estimated using the bathymetry data and georeferenced landsat 7 and 8 images deutsch and alameddine 2019 litani river flows m3 s were obtained from the litani river authority with the mean flow of the 14 days prior to the sampling date used in the subsequent analyses laboratory analyses of both surface and bottom water samples were completed within 48 h of sample collection nutrient analyses were conducted colorimetrically for ammonia nh3 nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 orthophosphate po4 and total phosphorus tp using a hach dr 4000 spectrophotometer all laboratory procedures were performed in accordance with the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater baird et al 2012 the degree of phosphorus limitation in the reservoir was determined based on the threshold ratio reported by bergstrӧm 2010 for dissolved inorganic nitrogen to total phosphors din tp the din tp ratios corresponding to a 25 and 75 probability of p limitation were defined at ratios of 1 5 and 3 4 respectively for phytoplankton analysis 500 ml water samples were taken at approximately 10 20 cm below the water surface at each sampling station samples were immediately preserved using 5 ml of lugal s solution baird et al 2012 the algae were then sedimented inside sampling chambers for at least two weeks to concentrate them supernatent was siphoned off leaving 25 30 ml of concentrated sample that was stored in vials for up to 6 months for microscope analysis two 0 1 ml subsamples were removed from these vials and placed on each of the two counting grids of a marienfeld malasez counting chamber using 400x magnification three 0 25 mm by 5 mm strips were counted per grid six strips total per sample with the algae organism not colony used as the unit of measure adapted from baird et al 2012 identification was made to the genus level organism volume per genus was then calculated using eq 2 where o the number of organisms counted per genus per sample l the length of each strip in mm d the depth of each strip in mm w the width of each strip in mm and s the number of strips counted per sample 2 o r g a n i s m s m l o 1000 m m 3 l d w s as the single celled microcystis units were difficult to count when they were in colony formation vials were placed in a tube shaker for one minute to break colonies apart joung et al 2006 samples were then placed into a bio rad tc10 automated cell counter producing results in organisms ml all phytoplankton results were converted to 1000 organisms ml for subsequent analysis to limit differences in variance between algae biovolume and all other variables 2 3 structural equation modeling there are many modeling options that can be used to model microcystis in addition to sems these include numerical models chung et al 2014 robson and hamilton 2004 rowe et al 2016 neural networks chan et al 2007 jeong et al 2006 li et al 2007 regression based analysis yu et al 2014 agent based modeling wang et al 2017 bayesian networks moe et al 2016 and ensemble models shamshirband et al 2019 in this paper we opted to use the sem with observed variables path modeling method to develop a statistical model that predicts microcystis biovolume in the study area sems are theory oriented and capable of representing hypotheses about causal networks while permitting for model interpretation even in the presence of a large number of predictors and responses with complex causal connections grace et al 2010 sem is an a priori method where our knowledge of a system s structure is used to pre conceptualize a model based on hypothesized underlying mechanisms between the modeled variables this is particularly important for systems that are poorly monitored where a priori knowledge from other systems is used to provide an initial candidate model that is tested and refined by the collected system specific data perhaps the most distinguishing feature of sem is its emphasis on estimating causal effects through the study of path relations as such it focuses on understanding and simultaneously evaluating both direct and indirect pathways within the complex network of interacting environmental variable these features make sems well suited for exploring multiple hypotheses about the different processes operating in a system grace et al 2010 the null hypothesis h0 in sem assumes that the covariance matrix implied in this conceptual model σ θ is equal to the observed covariance matrix of the data itself σ θ or 3 h 0 σ σ θ where θ is a vector of model parameters as such in sems we strive to accept the null hypothesis which confirms the model s ability to explain the patterns observed in the data grace 2006 mccune and grace 2002 the model was fit by minimizing the difference between the model predicted covariances and the data implied covariance structure exogenous variables in the sem are similar to independent regression variables while endogenous variables are dependent and have their values predicted by the exogenous variables within the model sems have been used both in confirmatory and exploratory approaches grace 2006 exploratory analysis as used in this paper includes alteration of the initial theoretical model to improve the fit between the model and the data grace 2006 mccune and grace 2002 an initial sem conceptual model was developed based on the existing literature and on initial data exploration boxplots and regression analyses it is shown in fig 2 the model includes direct paths from surface temperature and surface tp to microcystis biovolume both water temperature and surface tp are known to directly increase microcystis growth and reproduction rates in freshwater systems bista et al 2014 bridgeman et al 2012 carey et al 2012 davis et al 2009 dokulil and teubner 2000 downing et al 2001 jacoby et al 2000 kosten et al 2012 michalak et al 2013 robarts and zohary 1987 schindler 1977 xie et al 2003 xu et al 2010 note that phosphorus is expected to play a more critical role than nitrogen in limiting microcystis growth in qaraoun reservoir given that the reservoir is mostly phosphorus limited 88 of sample points showed a 75 chance of p limitation based on bergstrӧm s equation bergstrӧm 2010 versus 3 of sample points that showed a 75 chance of n limitation the choice of the phosphorus species that best represents phosphorus loads in the model is a function of the temporal scale of the study while soluble reactive phosphorus srp or po4 represents instantaneous bioavailable phosphorus the lag time between microcystis response and changes in po4 levels shows a weak correlation for instance during most microcystis blooms po4 concentrations in the reservoir will be close to zero given that the available po4 would have been taken up by the bloom tp on the other hand better represents the amount of phosphorus available within the system over a longer time period as such it tends to correlate better with the algae growth response nevertheless the use of tp as a predictor suffers from the intrinsic correlation between tp and algae biovolume given the presence of the former within the algal cells the use of po4 to model algal growth is often limited to mechanistic models that are run on fine time steps burger et al 2008 lindim et al 2015 in the qaraoun resevoir the correlation between surface water temperature and the microcystis biovolume was found to be strong and statistically significant 0 41 p value 0 05 while the correlation between surface tp and microcystis biovolume was weaker 0 14 p value 0 08 an indirect link between temperature and microcystis was also included in the model in the form of a pathway mediated by both the magnitude of stratification and surface tp this path represents the mechanism of restricted internal nutrient loading under a stratified water column which can in turn lead to nutrient depletion in epilimnion waters elliott 2012 wagner and adrian 2009 wetzel 2001 zohary and ostrovsky 2011 further surface tp concentrations were predicted as a function of both bottom tp representing internal loading mechanisms and river flow representing external loading although surface tp and bottom tp can be highly correlated in shallow areas and or in regions with no stratification a strong thermocline is expected to reduce this association under stratification nutrients from the sediment are released into the hypoxic waters with the rate of diffusion across the thermocline governed by the intensity of stratification river flow in the model was calculated as the mean flow for 14 days prior to the sampling date in order to account for time lag effects on external nutrient inputs also typical of semi arid zone water bodies the reservoir showed significant variability in reservoir volume and depth over the study period particularly in 2014 during severe drought conditions where a number of sample stations shifted from being stratified and deep to shallow and mixed over the course of the summer season as such a binary station depth variable was included in the model the decision to introduce station depth as a binary variable was driven by the fact that stations that were deeper than the thermocline experience stratification which increases the depletion of surface water nutrients while stations with shallower depths have a well mixed water column note that considering station depth as a continuous variable would have assumed that its impacts on the endogenous variables were linear in nature station depth as a binary exogenous variable is coded and interpreted as a dummy variable in sem arhonditsis et al 2006 grace 2006 with their covariance assessed using pearson s formula rosseel 2012 pearson s correlation between a dichotomous and a continuous variable is commonly referred to as the point biserial correlation chalmers 2018 crocker and algina 1986 mcdonald 2013 other options for assessing correlations include the use tetrachoric or polychoric correlation coefficients yet both were not suitable for our sem model given that we only had one categorical variable and the model lacked any endogenous categorical variables stations located in shallow waters less than 10 m were coded as 0 and stations in deeper sections 10 m or greater were coded as 1 a direct link was included from station depth to stratification to highlight the role that fluctuating station depths plays in determining stratification a directed link was also added from station depth to surface tp as we expect larger fluxes of nutrients reaching surface waters in shallow areas shallow lakes that are highly productive often experience localized bottom hypoxia due to high rates of decomposition of sedimented organic material kosten et al 2012 visser et al 2016 which when combined with the higher bottom temperatures in the shallow sections are responsible for increased nutrient release into the water column through temperature stimulated mineralization sondergaard et al 2003 wagner and adrian 2009 finally a direct pathway from station depth to microcystis biovolume was added as shallow areas are expected to have a more favorable balance between nutrients from internal loading and the light environment thereby increasing productivity chung et al 2014 miller et al 2013 wagner and adrian 2009 prior to analysis skewness mccune and grace 2002 tests were run to assess the distributional assumptions of the variables microcystis biovolume as well as both surface and bottom tp were natural logarithm transformed to improve the fit of the linear relationships assessed in the sem given the presence of zero values in the microcystis biovolume it was square root transformed the model was fit using the lavaan package rosseel 2012 in the software r r core team 2015 other sem software that could have been used include lisrel eqs mplus and amos all lavaan model runs were also mimicked under mplus to guarantee concurrence of results the maximum likelihood estimator was used to fit the model by minimizing the differences between the observed data covariance and the model predicted covariances given that sem is an a priori method acceptance of the null hypothesis was set at p value 0 05 p values 0 05 indicate that the model implied covariance matrix and the data implied covariance structure are sufficiently similar mccune and grace 2002 this is generally tested with the χ2 statistic when sample size is less than 200 schumacker and lomax 2004 several fit indices were also used to ensure model adequacy kline 1998 these included 1 the comparative fit index cfi which compares the specified model with a baseline model where all variables are assumed to be uncorrelated good model fit when cfi 0 9 2 the tucker lewis index tli which is similar to the cfi but has a stronger penalty for model complexity good model fit when tli 0 9 and 3 the root mean square error of approximation rmsea which estimates the fit of the model relative to a saturated model of the population good model fit when rmsea 0 1 once the initial model was tested modification indices were used to assess possible solutions to any discrepancies between the initial model and the data modification indices are calculated based on the expected decrease in the χ2 statistic given the addition of new model pathways grace 2006 mccune and grace 2002 modifications were only considered if they did not contradict ecological theory arhonditsis et al 2006 once the final model was established individual path significances were determined by dividing the path coefficient by its standard error with the resulting values tested using the t test path coefficients with t test p values 0 05 were considered significant non significant paths were retained if the model itself showed adequate fit to the data grace 2006 finally bootstrapping with 1000 boostrap draws was performed to assess the robustness of the overall model fit 3 results the initial conceptual sem did not adequately fit the data χ2 30 7 df 6 p value 0 0001 cfi 0 94 tli 0 85 rmsea 0 17 n 139 modification indices showed a need for a negative direct pathway from stratification magnitude to microcystis biovolume and another negative pathway from microcystis biovolume back to surface tp the suggested negative link between stratification magnitude and microcystis is at odds with several studies that reported that microcystis benefits from stratification through its ability to regulate buoyancy and thus migrate between high light surface waters and nutrient rich bottom waters under stable water column conditions bonnet and poulin 2002 carey et al 2012 chung et al 2014 heo and kim 2004 o neil et al 2012 thomas and walsby 1985 nonetheless there is evidence that several physical factors can reduce the effectiveness of microcystis buoyancy regulation chung et al 2014 dokulil and teubner 2000 visser et al 2016 wagner and adrian 2009 the ratio of the mixed layer depth to the euphotic depth zm zs has been established as an important factor impacting the advantage incurred by microcystis buoyancy regulation in stratified systems chung et al 2014 dokulil and teubner 2000 visser et al 2016 if the mixed layer is too deep or if the euphotic depth is too shallow as is the case in highly productive waters microcystis will be exposed to large fluctuations in photon irradiance which negatively impacts its growth reynolds et al 1987 several studies have pointed to a zm zs threshold of 2 5 3 above which light limitation reduces cyanobacterial biovolume in stratified areas heo and kim 2004 visser et al 2016 in the qaraoun reservoir analysis of the vertical temperature profile showed that 83 of the stratified stations had a zm zs 2 5 we also found that mixed layer depth had a significant negative correlation with microcystis biovolume in our study r 0 44 p value 0 03 additionally several studies have reported that turbulent mixing by winds can hinder the vertical migration of buoyant microcystis by disrupting the water column stability and therefore can induce light or nutrient limitation to the microcystis depending on their position in the water column cha et al 2014 chung et al 2014 heo and kim 2004 huisman et al 2004 scavia et al 2014 visser et al 2016 wind speeds as low as 2 4 m s have been reported to impair microcystis bloom formation in many systems blottière et al 2014 chaffin et al 2012 chung et al 2014 reynolds et al 1987 in the reservoir average daily summer wind speeds regularly exceed 6 m s with maximum daily winds often exceeding 11 m s data obtained from houche al oumara weather station 35 km north of qaraoun reservoir suggesting a high degree of summer turbulent mixing in the upper water column given the observed patterns of zm zs mixed layer depth and wind speed we conclude that stratification conditions in the reservoir were largely not amenable towards fully realizing the buoyance regulation advantage for microcystis as such the proposed negative sem pathway from stratification magnitude to microcystis biovolume was accepted and interpreted as an indication of increased light limitation and difficulty in maintaining the right balance between light and nutrient requirements the second suggested link by the modification indices is the addition of a negative reciprocal pathway from microcystis to surface tp this addition changes the model from recursive with causal links all in one direction to non recursive where two endogenous variables are determined from each other a closer examination of the bidirectional pathway shows that the positive path from surface tp to microcystis is stronger in magnitude than the negative path from microcystis to surface tp refer to fig 3 in the paper and to table 2 these two pathways capture two different mechanisms the positive path represents the natural affinity of microcystis to capture and store phosphorus which leads to higher algae cell growth meanwhile the negative pathway from microcystis to tp represent the net impact of sedimentation losses on surface nutrient concentrations through the sinking of dead microcystis cells and their byproducts following blooms microcystis are also known to have superior phosphorus storage mechanisms carey et al 2012 dokulil and teubner 2000 whitton 2012 and to undergo relatively little cell decomposition during the sedimentation process oliver et al 1985 reynolds et al 1981 takamura and yasuno 1988 thereby effectively removing stored phosphorus from the euphotic water column microcystis cell sedimentation rates are generally a function of nutrient and light limitations including self shading during bloom events competition and other adverse environmental factors that contribute to cell death in the water column reynolds 2006 sigee et al 2007 with the magnitude of loss rates increasing both during and after a bloom event cires et al 2013 sigee et al 2007 takamura and yasuno 1988 verspagen et al 2005 wormer et al 2011 zohary et al 2012 additionally the recursive link between microcystis biovolume and surface tp supports the consideration of defining a joint distribution for the two variables rather than to describe them individually through univariate distributions the advantages of defining bivariate distributions for highly correlated variables was highlighted by cha et al 2016 across several freshwater and estuarine systems sems are constrained to the adoption of univariate distributions for all endogenous variables note that this recursive link is also an artifact of the intrinsic correlation between tp and algae biovolume given the presence of the former within the algal cells the fit between the modified sem and the data proved satisfactory for predicting microcystis biovolume χ2 7 85 df 4 p value 0 1 cfi 0 99 tli 0 96 rmsea 0 08 n 139 there was generally a strong agreement between the model predicted covariance matrix and the observed data covariance matrix table 1 with 25 of the 28 matrix moments demonstrating low residual covariances 1 in their standardized form residual covariances divided by their standard error arhonditsis et al 2006 the bootstrap results also confirmed the robustness of the model the overall p value on the bootstrapped chi squared tests for model fit was 0 01 indicating that 99 of all bootstrapped models had chi square test statistics smaller than or as large as the fitted model note that a smaller chi squared value implies a stronger evidence that the covariance matrix implied in the conceptual model σ θ is equivalent to the observed covariance matrix in the data itself fig 3 shows the graphical representation of the final sem model all model pathways were found to be significant p value 0 05 except for the path between river flow and surface tp and the one linking station depth to microcystis biovolume the r2 for each of the endogenous parameters in fig 3 was calculated as 1 minus that standardized error variances where the error variances are the portions residuals of each predicted variable not accounted for within the model grace 2006 in general the model explained 49 9 of the observed variation in microcystis biovolume as well as 81 0 of the variation in surface tp and 45 5 of the variation in stratification magnitude fig 3 also displays the standardized path coefficients for the sem pathways standardized coefficients are generated by multiplying the unstandardized path coefficients obtained from the sem estimation procedure by the ratio of the standard deviation of the explanatory variable to the standard deviation of the predicted variable along each pathway arhonditsis et al 2006 standardized coefficients are therefore expressed in standard deviation units and thus are more easily comparable for assessing the relative strength of different sem pathways grace and bollen 2005 based on the model microcystis biovolume was found to be most strongly associated with the direct surface temperature pathway showing a standardized regression coefficient of 0 79 temperature also showed a relatively smaller indirect impact on microcystis through its effect on the magnitude of stratification in the reservoir which in turn negatively affected both surface tp and microcystis biovolume the strength of these combined indirect pathways from surface temperature to microcystis in standardized units is 0 30 0 25 0 30 0 29 0 37 0 11 and therefore the total effects of surface temperature on microcystis biovolume in our model is 0 79 0 11 0 68 the effect of surface tp on microcystis biovolume was not mediated by any other variable in the sem and the standardized direct path coefficient of 0 37 is noticeably less than the calculated total temperature effect microcystis also had a reciprocal albeit relatively smaller standardized coefficient 0 18 effect on surface tp such that while it is itself being stimulated by increased phosphorus loads it was simultaneously removing tp from surface waters it is also apparent that internal loading via bottom tp standardized coefficient 0 82 had a more significant impact on surface tp concentrations in our model than external loading via river flow finally station depth had a stronger positive influence on stratification magnitude standardized coefficient 0 56 than did temperature standardized coefficient 0 30 station depth also negatively impacted surface tp concentrations standardized coefficient 0 11 largely due to the strong and stable stratification occurring in the deeper sections of the reservoir strong stratification leads to reducing leakage of nutrients from the hypolimium to the epilimnion meanwhile the relationship between station depth and microcystis biovolumes was negative but not significant several studies across several lakes and reservoirs have reported that shallow areas tend to have higher nutrient concentrations and greater cyanobacterial growth rates as compared to deeper sections chung et al 2014 miller et al 2013 wagner and adrian 2009 unstandardized path coefficients which are the subject of the significance tests associated with the regression pathways in an sem are shown in table 2 unstandardized coefficients are expressed in the original units of the variables and represent the mean influence of the predictors on the response variables using the notation from table 2 microcystis biovolume can be predicted

inputs a temperature increase of 5 c above the median from 21 5 to 26 5 c is expected to increase the median microcystis biovolume from 19 050 to 40 250 organisms ml in deep stations station depth 1 and from 26 590 to 50 930 organisms ml for shallow stations station depth 0 if stratification magnitude is assumed to increase by 5 c from 2 to 7 c alongside the 5 c surface temperature increase then the median microcystis biovolume is predicted to increase marginally to reach 27 510 organisms ml in the deep stations finally holding temperature and stratification magnitude constant at their median values a change in surface tp from 0 23 mg l to 0 73 mg l is expected to increase microcystis biovolume to 28 780 organisms ml in deep stations and to 37 910 organisms ml in shallow stations the combination of the higher temperature 26 5 c and elevated surface phosphorus concentrations 0 73 mg l is predicted to yield a microcystis biovolume of 66 210 organisms ml in shallow stations 4 discussion 4 1 general phytoplankton and reservoir dynamics qaraoun reservoir has experienced cyanobacteria blooms across all seasons over the three years of this study this is a clear continuation of a pattern first reported by atoui et al 2013 it signals deteriorating conditions and the amplification of cultural eutrophication the phytoplankton community over the study period was dominated by microcystis and to a lesser extent aphanizomenon both appearing to be strongly affected by seasonal temperature patterns the dynamics of the two dominant cyanobacterial genus in this study shows that aphanizomenon tends to be more common in spring and fall co blooming with microcystis while microcystis tends to dominate as monospecific blooms over the warmest sampling dates recent work on qaraoun reservoir has noted that microcystis dominated over the hottest sampling dates fadel et al 2015 this is to be expected as microcystis s optimum growth occurs between 25 32 c carey et al 2012 jiang et al 2008 liu et al 2011 o neil et al 2012 paerl and huisman 2009 robarts and zohary 1987 4 2 direct and indirect temperature effects on microcystis biovolume many studies have documented the importance of temperature for microcystis growth blottière et al 2014 carey et al 2012 davis et al 2009 kosten et al 2012 liu et al 2011 robarts and zohary 1987 wu et al 2016 but it is often unclear whether direct or indirect temperature effects dominate the use of sem as a modeling technique allowed us to better resolve this question with direct temperature effects playing the major role in controlling microcystis biovolumes in qaraoun reservoir direct temperature mechanisms include enhanced photosynthetic and growth rates enhanced specific respiration and carbohydrate metabolism better nutrient uptake capacities and higher rates of intercellular nutrient assimilation carey et al 2012 davis et al 2009 robarts and zohary 1987 higher optimum growth temperatures for microcystis also gives them a competitive advantage over other cyanobacterial species and eukaryotic algae dokulil and teubner 2000 jiang et al 2008 kosten et al 2012 o neil et al 2012 as discussed above indirect temperature effects on microcystis were also apparent in our sem model but were significantly less important than the direct effects indirect temperature effects reported in the literature act primarily through increasing stratification magnitude which may limit internal loading across a strong thermocline visser et al 2016 wagner and adrian 2009 as expected surface tp was found to be negatively affected by the presence of stronger stratification in the sem whereby flow of nutrients from a hypoxic and nutrient rich hypolimnion to the nutrient depleted epilimnion was hindered culminating in a negative feedback on microcystis biovolume elliott 2012 wetzel 2001 zohary and ostrovsky 2011 cyanobacteria are also known to have higher requirements for trace elements as compared to eukaryotic algae dokulil and teubner 2000 jiang et al 2008 and therefore separation from nutrient rich bottom waters can have a broader consequence than the tp modeled in our sem the negative relationship from stratification magnitude to microcystis growth as mediated by surface tp in the sem model is evidenced in the qaraoun reservoir whereby blooms tend to occur in the fall after stratification ceases and reservoir turnover increases nutrient pools in surface waters stronger stratification is often thought to improve the stability of the water column chung et al 2014 kosten et al 2012 mcdonald and lehman 2013 o neil et al 2012 allowing buoyancy regulating species like microcystis to successfully migrate between nutrient rich bottom waters and light rich surface waters to optimize their growth rates bonnet and poulin 2002 carey et al 2012 dokulil and teubner 2000 kosten et al 2012 miller et al 2013 o neil et al 2012 robarts and zohary 1987 this pathway was significant in our model but showed a negative association likely as a result of other water column and basin level variables acting on this relationship microcystis require a shallow mixed layer to fully take advantage of their buoyancy capabilities chung et al 2014 reynolds et al 1987 wagner and adrian 2009 when mixed layers are too deep particularly when associated with a shallow euphotic depth microcystis may be less able to move and take advantage of the nutrient rich hypolimnion while also obtaining sufficient photon irradiance to avoid light restrictions to growth chung et al 2014 dokulil and teubner 2000 heo and kim 2004 visser et al 2016 wagner and adrian 2009 lake models have shown that phytoplankton biomass will initially increase with greater mixing depth up until a depth is reached where nutrient limitations are replaced by light limitations with biomass decreasing after this point visser et al 2016 note that other cyanobacteria species have been found to be more tolerant to longer and deeper stratification periods than microcystis reynolds et al 1987 wagner and adrian 2009 high winds seen in the summer months over qaraoun reservoir can also detract from microcystis buoyancy advantage through turbulent mixing that both destabilizes surface water layers and increases mixed layer depths in strongly stratified areas cha et al 2014 chung et al 2014 heo and kim 2004 huisman et al 2004 scavia et al 2014 visser et al 2016 the model results showed that the magnitude of stratification was more strongly influenced by station depth than by water temperature basin morphology and uncharacteristically dry conditions during much of our study period meant that large areas of the reservoir became too shallow to strongly stratify as water levels dropped strong annual and interannual fluctuations in water column depth are also characteristic of many semi arid water bodies that experience seasonal precipitation patterns and high evapotranspiration rates under high temperature regimes bai et al 2011 dantas et al 2011 naselli flores et al 2007 thornton and rast 1989 in the qaraoun reservoir only the deeper stations 10 m deep saw increased stratification magnitude as the summer proceeded leading to lower tp and microcystis biovolumes similar patterns have been documented in other studies with shallow areas showing higher nutrient concentrations and greater cyanobacterial growth rates chung et al 2014 miller et al 2013 wagner and adrian 2009 given the productivity of the study reservoir shallow areas are expected to occasionally experience low oxygen levels conducive to nutrient release while also providing a more favorable balance between nutrient concentrations and light resources than deeper sections kosten et al 2012 visser et al 2016 frequent alteration between mixed and stratified conditions in shallow lakes or in lakes with fluctuating water column depths can further stimulate phosphorus release rates from the sediment which improves conditions for microcystis growth sondergaard et al 2003 wagner and adrian 2009 4 3 nutrient loads and their effects on microcystis biovolume given the strength of the pathways from temperature to microcystis biovolume relative to the pathway pointing from surface tp it is apparent that temperature and perhaps light are generally more limiting to microcystis growth than are nutrient concentrations in our study nutrient loads to the reservoir tend to be high as evidenced by its hypereutrophic state although reduced po4 concentrations over summer growth periods do indicate periods of phosphorus limitation when all bio available phosphorus is uptaken under heavy algae cell growth rates microcystis are known to be strong competitors for nutrients and for phosphorus in particular o neil et al 2012 whitton 2012 which may also explain the relatively weaker surface tp to microcystis pathway in the sem microcystis generally has a high affinity for and ability to store phosphorus carey et al 2012 molot et al 2014 meaning that it can withstand periods of nutrient deficiency under fluctuating concentrations in the reservoir this high affinity uptake and phosphorus sequestration may also explain tp removal from surface waters by microcystis in the reciprocal sem pathway where sedimentation losses of dead cells acts to reduce surface nutrient concentrations carey et al 2012 cires et al 2013 dokulil and teubner 2000 o neil et al 2012 sigee et al 2007 takamura and yasuno 1988 finally the ability of microcystis to regulate their buoyancy may also help them avoid nutrient limitation as they may be able to access hypolimnion nutrient stores at times when the mixed layer depths are stable and shallow bonnet and poulin 2002 carey et al 2012 chung et al 2014 the developed sem also provided an opportunity to better understand the relative importance of different nutrient loading mechanisms for the reservoir internal loading through the direct pathway from bottom tp to surface tp was found to be much stronger than the river flow pathway that represents external loads internal loading is promoted by anoxia mediated sediment p release from the phosphorus rich sediments pettersson 1998 sondergaard et al 2003 wetzel 2001 during the summer growth period internal nutrient loads in shallow sections are readily available for microcystis while nutrients from the deeper sections appear to escape the hypolimnion and reach the epilimnion when the water column is disturbed by internal turbulence caused by such factors as winds in the qaraoun reservoir there is little to no external loading sources during the summer months and therefore any new phosphorus to the system during that period comes from internal sources despite the strong stratification of the system we believe that the insignificant link between the external load river flow and surface tp was due to the ephemeral flow patterns of the litani river river flows from the litani qaraoun reservoir s largest tributary are generally strongest in the winter and early spring flows in the summer months are low and can stop completely during low precipitation snow years and due to over pumping for irrigation external nutrient loads from the river likely contribute to the reservoir s overall nutrient status on an annual time step whereby high winter and spring river nutrient loads are expected to settle in the lake bed and replenish sediment stores when temperatures are still too low to promote microcystis growth and nutrient uptake sediment bound nutrients then fuel the summer cyanobacterial blooms in the form of internal loads this delay in the response to external loads has been well documented in lake erie where late summer cyanobacteria blooms were strongly correlated to tp loads entering the lake in march through june obenour et al 2014 strumpf et al 2012 lindim et al 2015 also found that late summer and fall phytoplankton blooms in the lower havel riverine lakes germany were related to phosphorus accumulated in the sediment from spring external loads more research is needed to fully understand sediment nutrient fluxes in qaraoun reservoir and to relate them to the seasonal loading from the litani river 4 4 implications for microcystis management management of microcystis blooms in qaraoun reservoir will require careful steps given the results of this study with ambient temperatures increasing and higher temperatures expected to persist for longer periods of the year under projected climate change alameddine et al 2018 deutsch and alameddine 2019 el samra et al 2018 fayad 2013 microcystis growth rates and dominance over other cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae in the reservoir is expected to worsen climate predictions for the region also include an increased frequency of drought events leading towards a shallower reservoir and the prevalence of polymictic conditions alameddine et al 2018 el samra et al 2018 fayad 2013 given that controlling the reservoir s temperature is not possible managing the reservoir s microcystis blooms under a warming climate has to focus on controlling internal nutrient loads including significant reductions in the external loads that appear to continuously replenish the sediment stores michalak et al 2013 wagner and adrian 2009 with the high sediment stores in the reservoir and nutrient fluxes from legacy nutrient sources in the contributing basin watershed level nutrient management is not expected to have an immediate effect on reservoir water quality chen et al 2018 pettersson 1998 and thus managers should be control the expectations of system recovery following the implementation of basin level point and non point source pollution management jeppesen et al 2005 reported that the recovery of 35 monitored lakes took 10 to 15 years following external nutrient load reductions due to internal phosphorus loading from legacy sources in reservoirs like the qaraoun that experience seasonal stratification legacy sediment phosphorus loading were found to remain an important driver of eutrophication for 20 to 70 years following the implementation of nutrient reduction measures at the watershed level carpenter 2005 schippers et al 2006 public disillusion with perceived failures of investments aimed at controlling watershed nutrient pollution initiatives has been reported across many lakes and reservoirs chen et al 2018 5 conclusions and future work structural equation modeling proved an effective tool towards understanding the complex causal relationships leading to the dominance of microcystis by quantifying co occurring direct and indirect environmental pathways in summary changes in surface water temperatures were found to play a pivotal role in controlling microcystis in the highly eutrophic semi arid qaraoun reservoir indirect temperature effects through stratification were also apparent although these pathways were found to be less important than the direct temperature link in our model reservoir depth also strongly influenced stratification patterns in the reservoir with consequences for semi arid water bodies that typically experience higher degrees of water volume fluctuations than their temperate counterparts the relatively weaker link between tp and microcystis in the sem is likely a result of the hypereutrophic nature of the system where temperature and light seem to play a stronger role in limiting growth than nutrients and may also be due to microcystis s high affinity for and ability to sequester phosphorus when epilimnion conditions do become limiting finally internal loading appeared to be the major nutrient source for strong summer microcystis blooms in the reservoir although high winter river flow rates typical of the mediterranean semi arid zone contribute strongly towards building up these sediment stores on an annual basis overall the developed sem model structure coincides with reported observations and conclusion made from lakes and reservoirs across greece papadimitriou et al 2013 vardaka et al 2005 italy naselli flores and barone 2005 naselli flores et al 2007 and spain romo et al 2013 while the sem demonstrated the importance of temperature nutrients and reservoir depth in controlling microcystis in the qaraoun reservoir future work should focus on assessing other pathways light limitation was hypothesized to contribute to the negative relationship between stratification and microcystis biovolume in our model yet it merits a direct assessment through the measurement of photon irradiance levels within the mixed layer light limitation should also be assessed with regards to the daily vertical migrations of microcystis in the water column bonnet and poulin 2002 visser et al 2016 wallace and hamilton 1999 additionally future work should develop the model further by incorporating a sediment nutrient flux model given the importance of the internal loading pathway in our sem this work will require sediment sampling in order to better characterize the roles that iron and oxidative reactive potential play in phosphorus sequestration in the sediment phosphates are known to be released from sediment iron complexes under low redox conditions or when high sediment sulfide concentrations precipitate insoluble iron sulfides and release the iron bound phosphates gachter and muller 2003 orihel et al 2015 sondergaard et al 2001 similarly the influence of zooplankton grazing on microcystis and its dominance with regards to other algae groups should be explored in future work hambright et al 2007 stein et al 1995 moreover while we expect that the developed sem provides a robust conceptual model that improves our understanding of microcystis dynamics as a function of a set of important salient physio chemical forcings in hypereutrophic semi arid reservoirs the full transferability of the model to other similar systems was not assessed similar to other modeling frameworks we envisage that while the model s structure will prove robust when transferred to other systems the relative strength of the paths and their coefficients will be system specific future work should focus on developing a multilevel hierarchical sem that would allow for the concurrent accounting of inter system and intra system model predictors the development of multilevel hierarchical sems is still at its early stages rosseel 2012 but it has shown promise lefcheck 2016 2019 finally future research should also expand on the knowledge gained through sem by exploring determinants of cyanobacterial dominance through other statistical modeling methods sems are very effective in defining causal relationships in complex systems anderson and vastag 2004 grace 2006 and were particularly helpful for qaraoun reservoir where limited previous research meant that our initial modeling objective was largely to empirically test theoretically derived causal relationships nonetheless sems are not traditionally strong predictive tools and are unable to perform system diagnoses both of which are important for future management efforts gupta and kim 2008 integrating our sem with a bayesian network model could provide a useful avenue for improving predictive and diagnostic outcomes of our modeling effort gupta and kim 2008 moe et al 2016 particularly once light and internal loading pathways are better defined in bayesian networks results are also represented as a probability of occurrence of different events or states which are more easily interpretable by water managers

24755,cyanobacteria blooms especially those involving microcystis are an increasing problem worldwide complex pathways between temperature and nutrient loads are thought to be the major drivers leading to microcystis dominance in freshwater systems in this paper microcystis dominance in a mediterranean hypereutrophic reservoir is studied over a period of three years a structural equation model sem was developed to delineate the main pathways responsible for microcystis dominance the model results showed that direct temperature effects appear to be the primary driving force behind microcystis growth and dominance nonetheless indirect temperature effects captured through pathways representing water column stratification and internal nutrient release also influenced microcystis while direct nutrient pathways were significant they were less important than temperature effects likely due to the eutrophic nature of the reservoir and microcystis high affinity and storage capabilities for phosphorus internal nutrient loads were shown to be the main driver sustaining high nutrient concentrations in the reservoir the model was able to explain 50 of the observed variability in microcystis biovolume 81 of the variation in surface tp and 46 of the variation in stratification magnitude overall the developed sem proved to be an effective tool towards capturing and quantifying the complex causal relationships leading to the dominance of microcystis in a hypereutrophic semi arid mediterranean reservoir keywords structural equation modeling microcystis cyanobacteria eutrophication 1 introduction recent decades have seen a dramatic increase in reported blooms of cyanobacteria species in fresh waterbodies worldwide particularly in response to increased eutrophication and a warming climate carey et al 2012 kosten et al 2012 paerl and paul 2012 schindler 2006 smith et al 2006 strumpf et al 2012 although naturally occurring cyanobacteria tend to out compete other algae groups when conditions are amenable particularly at higher temperatures and in waters with sufficient nutrient inputs davis et al 2009 dokulil and teubner 2000 downing et al

of the affected waterbodies on a global scale of primary concern are impacts related to lowered oxygen concentrations and hypoxia fish kills noxious odors and an increase in toxins release by microcystis and other cyanobacteria into the environment carpenter et al 1998 dittmann and wiegand 2006 dodds et al 2009 falconer 1996 merel et al 2013 niamien ebrottie et al 2015 paerl et al 2001 2011 much is known about the key environmental factors that generally promote the growth and dominance of microcystis including high optimal growing temperatures a stable water column long water residence times and high nutrient concentrations particularly phosphorus jacoby et al 2000 jiang et al 2008 michalak et al 2013 molot et al 2014 paerl and otten 2013 robarts and zohary 1987 schindler 2006 moreover its strong competitive abilities in relation to other freshwater algae groups are also known to be important factors these include its ability to buffer ph above neutrality to live in high temperature environments to uptake and internally store nutrients to regulate buoyance in order to reach different water column layers to inhibit the growth of other algae species through allelopathic effects and to form colonies and toxins that both limit predation carey et al 2012 chaffin et al 2012 chung et al 2014 dokulil and teubner 2000 miller et al 2013 niamien ebrottie et al

a systems based approach towards examining the relationship between interrelated response variables and their predictors through a network of direct and indirect pathways sems have gained increasing prominence within the limnological field over the last decade with a number of studies using this method to model eutrophication arhonditsis et al 2007 2006 liu et al 2010 salmaso 2011 stomp et al 2011 in this paper a sem is developed to predict microcystis biovolume changes in a semi arid hyper eutrophic reservoir in relation to measured physiochemical drivers the model is then used to assess the 1 the importance of direct and indirect temperature effects on microcystis biovolume 2 the interaction between temperature and nutrient inputs and 3 the relative importance of allochthonous and autochthonous nutrient loads in sustaining growth moreover the sem model highlighted important processes specific to semi arid water bodies particularly the impact of water level fluctuations on reservoir nutrient cycling 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area qaraoun reservoir 33 34 n 35 42 e altitude 840 m is the largest freshwater body in lebanon it was constructed in 1959 to provide water for hydroelectric power generation irrigation recreation and domestic water recreational activities along the shores provide income to local communities and a small fishing community also exists on the reservoir the reservoir is situated in the semi arid bekaa valley of central lebanon fig 1 the major source of water into the reservoir is the litani river the longest internal river in the country and lebanon s most economically important river development alternatives incorporated 2005 earth link advanced resources development 2011 the climate of the area is typical of the mediterranean with hot and dry summers contrasting moderately cold and wet winters average precipitation within the basin is 600 mm year falling mostly in the winter months december to march snow also accumulates on the mountains on either side of the bekaa valley and contributes to the litani river flow the average flow of the litani river over the entire study period was 2 5 m3 s with the highest flows up to 30 m3 s occurring in the spring season and flows decreasing to zero during late summer and early fall the mean water residence time in the reservoir is around 0 77 years fadel et al 2014 meanwhile the size of the contributing catchment to the reservoir is around 1600 km2 the reservoir s surface area fluctuates between 4 and 11 km2 sometimes within a single year depending on the seasonal precipitation patterns seasonal water recharge and dam discharge rates deutsch and alameddine 2019 given the semi arid nature of the area the drainage ratio i e the ratio of catchment area to surface area of the reservoir is higher than what is typical for man made reservoirs walter et al 2020 reservoir depths vary spatially with the deepest section near the dam exceeding 45 m median lake depths fluctuate between 10 and 20 m depending on seasonal water level changes the qaraoun reservoir has suffered from eutrophication starting in the mid 1980s yet median summer chlorophyll a concentrations have more than doubled since then 30 µg l in the 1980s to 150 µg l post 2010 while the mean secchi disk depth sdd dropped from 1 5 m in the early 1990s to less than 0 75 m post 2010 deutsch and alameddine 2019 during the study period we observed that surface water temperatures in the reservoir ranged between 7 0 and 31 c surface orthophosphate po4 levels showed large spatio temporal variability with levels varying between below 0 01 to as high as 0 38 mg l bottom po4 concentrations were generally elevated during the summer due to internal loading from anoxic sediments their levels in the summer reached values as high as 0 68 mg l surface tp concentrations ranged between 0 01 and 4 7 mg l while bottom tp levels varied between 0 01 and 4 5 mg l bottom tp levels were generally higher than those at the surface particularly during summer stratified periods chlorophyll a concentrations in qaraoun ranged from as low as 3 5 µg l in the winter up to 5502 1 µg l recorded during a summer microcystis bloom blooms were primarily caused by cyanobacteria species namely microcystis aeruginosa and aphanizomenon flos aquae microcystis and to a lesser extent aphanizomenon dominated the algae community in all but the winter months suppressing eukaryotic growth in warmer seasons microcystis formed monospecific blooms during all three summers of the study period aphizominon blooms were also common especially in early spring and late fall 2 2 data collection and analysis in situ data from the reservoir were collected between july 4 2013 and october 6 2015 at intervals of approximately three weeks for a total of 34 sampling dates sampling frequencies were lower in the winter months due to poor weather conditions on the reservoir initially the sampling stations were positioned along the north south and east west axes of the reservoir in order to capture any spatial variability in water quality variables fig 1 starting september 9 2014 samples were only taken along the north south center line of the reservoir due to drought conditions and reservoir area shrinkage two additional sampling points were added along the north south center line of the reservoir from this date recently an ultrasonic cyanobacterial treatment system has been deployed on the reservoir making more recent data from the reservoir not representative of its natural conditions two water samples were taken from each monitoring station with a depth greater than 10 m one 10 20 cm below the water surface and one 4 m from the bottom of the reservoir using a van dorn depth sampler and a ysi exo2 sonde only surface samples were collected from shallow stations given the observed temporal changes in reservoir water level station depths m were recorded for each sampling date water temperature c was measured in the field the ysi exo2 sonde was used to capture complete vertical temperature profiles across stations vertical temperature profiles were used to determine the mixed layer depth zm the magnitude of lake stratification at each station was defined in terms of the difference between surface and bottom water temperatures c dissolved oxygen do mg l was measured in the field initially with a hanna hi 9143 autocal dissolved oxygen meter and then with the ysi exo2 sonde water ph was measured using an orion researcher micro processor ph meter total dissolved solids tds and conductivity were both measured using a portable cole palmer td conductivity meter additionally secchi disk depth sdd m was measured at each station and was converted to euphotic zone depth zs by multiplying the measurements by the 2 81 french et al 1982 reservoir volume m3 for each sampling date was estimated using the bathymetry data and georeferenced landsat 7 and 8 images deutsch and alameddine 2019 litani river flows m3 s were obtained from the litani river authority with the mean flow of the 14 days prior to the sampling date used in the subsequent analyses laboratory analyses of both surface and bottom water samples were completed within 48 h of sample collection nutrient analyses were conducted colorimetrically for ammonia nh3 nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 orthophosphate po4 and total phosphorus tp using a hach dr 4000 spectrophotometer all laboratory procedures were performed in accordance with the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater baird et al 2012 the degree of phosphorus limitation in the reservoir was determined based on the threshold ratio reported by bergstrӧm 2010 for dissolved inorganic nitrogen to total phosphors din tp the din tp ratios corresponding to a 25 and 75 probability of p limitation were defined at ratios of 1 5 and 3 4 respectively for phytoplankton analysis 500 ml water samples were taken at approximately 10 20 cm below the water surface at each sampling station samples were immediately preserved using 5 ml of lugal s solution baird et al 2012 the algae were then sedimented inside sampling chambers for at least two weeks to concentrate them supernatent was siphoned off leaving 25 30 ml of concentrated sample that was stored in vials for up to 6 months for microscope analysis two 0 1 ml subsamples were removed from these vials and placed on each of the two counting grids of a marienfeld malasez counting chamber using 400x magnification three 0 25 mm by 5 mm strips were counted per grid six strips total per sample with the algae organism not colony used as the unit of measure adapted from baird et al 2012 identification was made to the genus level organism volume per genus was then calculated using eq 2 where o the number of organisms counted per genus per sample l the length of each strip in mm d the depth of each strip in mm w the width of each strip

were placed in a tube shaker for one minute to break colonies apart joung et al 2006 samples were then placed into a bio rad tc10 automated cell counter producing results in organisms ml all phytoplankton results were converted to 1000 organisms ml for subsequent analysis to limit differences in variance between algae biovolume and all other variables 2 3 structural equation modeling there are many modeling options that can be used to model microcystis in addition to sems these include numerical models chung et al 2014 robson and hamilton 2004 rowe et al 2016 neural networks chan et al 2007 jeong et al 2006 li et al 2007 regression based analysis yu et al 2014 agent based modeling wang et al 2017 bayesian networks moe et al 2016 and ensemble models shamshirband et al 2019 in this paper we opted to use the sem with observed variables path modeling method to develop a statistical model that predicts microcystis biovolume in the study area sems are theory oriented and capable of representing hypotheses about causal networks while permitting for model interpretation even in the presence of a large number of predictors and responses with complex causal connections grace et al 2010 sem is an a priori method where our knowledge of a system s structure is used to pre conceptualize a model based on hypothesized underlying mechanisms between the modeled variables this is particularly important for systems that are poorly monitored where a priori knowledge from other systems is used to provide an initial candidate model that is tested and refined by the collected system specific data perhaps the most distinguishing feature of sem is its emphasis on estimating causal effects through the study of path relations as such it focuses on understanding and simultaneously evaluating both direct and indirect pathways within the complex network of interacting environmental variable these features make sems well suited for exploring multiple hypotheses about the different processes operating in a system grace et al 2010 the null hypothesis h0 in sem assumes that the covariance matrix implied in this conceptual model σ θ is equal to the observed covariance matrix of the data itself σ θ or 3 h 0 σ σ θ where θ is a vector of model parameters as such in sems we strive to accept the null hypothesis which confirms the model s ability to explain the patterns observed in the data grace 2006 mccune and grace 2002 the model was fit by minimizing the difference between the model predicted covariances and the data implied covariance structure exogenous variables in the sem are similar to independent regression variables while endogenous variables are dependent and have their values predicted by the exogenous variables within the model sems have been used both in confirmatory and exploratory approaches grace 2006 exploratory analysis as used in this paper includes alteration of the initial theoretical model to improve the fit between the model and the data grace 2006 mccune and grace 2002 an initial sem conceptual model was developed based on the existing literature and on initial data exploration boxplots and regression analyses it is shown in fig 2 the model includes direct paths from surface temperature and surface tp to microcystis biovolume both water temperature and surface tp are known to directly increase microcystis growth and reproduction rates in freshwater systems bista et al 2014 bridgeman et al 2012 carey et al 2012 davis et al 2009 dokulil and teubner 2000 downing et al 2001 jacoby et al 2000 kosten et al 2012 michalak et al 2013 robarts and zohary 1987 schindler 1977 xie et al 2003 xu et al 2010 note that phosphorus is expected to play a more critical role than nitrogen in limiting microcystis growth in qaraoun reservoir given that the reservoir is mostly phosphorus limited 88 of sample points showed a 75 chance of p limitation based on bergstrӧm s equation bergstrӧm 2010 versus 3 of sample points that showed a 75 chance of n limitation the choice of the phosphorus species that best represents phosphorus loads in the model is a function of the temporal scale of the study while soluble reactive phosphorus srp or po4 represents instantaneous bioavailable phosphorus the lag time between microcystis response and changes in po4 levels shows a weak correlation for instance during most microcystis blooms po4 concentrations in the reservoir will be close to zero given that the available po4 would have been taken up by the bloom tp on the other hand better represents the amount of phosphorus available within the system over a longer time period as such it tends to correlate better with the algae growth response nevertheless the use of tp as a predictor suffers from the intrinsic correlation between tp and algae biovolume given the presence of the former within the algal cells the use of po4 to model algal growth is often limited to mechanistic models that are run on fine time steps burger et al 2008 lindim et al 2015 in the qaraoun resevoir the correlation between surface water temperature and the microcystis biovolume was found to be strong and statistically significant 0 41 p value 0 05 while the correlation between surface tp and microcystis biovolume was weaker 0 14 p value 0 08 an indirect link between temperature and microcystis was also included in the model in the form of a pathway mediated by both the magnitude of stratification and surface tp this path represents the mechanism of restricted internal nutrient loading under a stratified water column which can in turn lead to nutrient depletion in epilimnion waters elliott 2012 wagner and adrian 2009 wetzel 2001 zohary and ostrovsky 2011 further surface tp concentrations were predicted as a function of both bottom tp representing internal loading mechanisms and river flow representing external loading although surface tp and bottom tp can be highly correlated in shallow areas and or in regions with no stratification a strong thermocline is expected to reduce this association under stratification nutrients from the sediment are released into the hypoxic waters with the rate of diffusion across the thermocline governed by the intensity of stratification river flow in the model was calculated as the mean flow for 14 days prior to the sampling date in order to account for time lag effects on external nutrient inputs also typical of semi arid zone water bodies the reservoir showed significant variability in reservoir volume and depth over the study period particularly in 2014 during severe drought conditions where a number of sample stations shifted from being stratified and deep to shallow and mixed over the course of the summer season as such a binary station depth variable was included in the model the decision to introduce station depth as a binary variable was driven by the fact that stations that were deeper than the thermocline experience stratification which increases the depletion of surface water nutrients while stations with shallower depths have a well mixed water column note that considering station depth as a continuous variable would have assumed that its impacts on the endogenous variables were linear in nature station depth as a binary exogenous variable is coded and interpreted as a dummy variable in sem arhonditsis et al 2006 grace 2006 with their covariance assessed using pearson s formula rosseel 2012 pearson s correlation between a dichotomous and a continuous variable is commonly referred to as the point biserial correlation chalmers 2018 crocker and algina 1986 mcdonald 2013 other options for assessing correlations include the use tetrachoric or polychoric correlation coefficients yet both were not suitable for our sem model given that we only had one categorical variable and the model lacked any endogenous categorical variables stations located in shallow waters less than 10 m were coded as 0 and stations in deeper sections 10 m or greater were coded as 1 a direct link was included from station depth to stratification to highlight the role that fluctuating station depths plays in determining stratification a directed link was also added from station depth to surface tp as we expect larger fluxes of nutrients reaching surface waters in shallow areas shallow lakes that are highly productive often experience localized bottom hypoxia due to high rates of decomposition of sedimented organic material kosten et al 2012 visser et al 2016 which when combined with the higher bottom temperatures in the shallow sections are responsible for increased nutrient release into the water column through temperature stimulated mineralization sondergaard et al 2003 wagner and adrian 2009 finally a direct pathway from station depth to microcystis biovolume was added as shallow areas are expected to have a more favorable balance between nutrients from internal loading and the light environment thereby increasing productivity chung et al 2014 miller et al 2013 wagner and adrian 2009 prior to analysis skewness mccune and grace 2002 tests were run to assess the distributional assumptions of the variables microcystis biovolume as well as both surface and bottom tp were natural logarithm transformed to improve the fit of the linear relationships assessed in the sem given the presence of zero values in the microcystis biovolume it was square root transformed the model was fit using the lavaan package rosseel 2012 in the software r r core team 2015 other sem software that could have been used include lisrel eqs mplus and amos all lavaan model runs were also mimicked under mplus to guarantee concurrence of results the maximum likelihood estimator was used to fit the model by minimizing the differences between the observed data covariance and the model predicted covariances given that sem is an a priori method acceptance of the null hypothesis was set at p value 0 05 p values 0 05 indicate that the model implied covariance matrix and the data implied covariance structure are sufficiently similar mccune and grace 2002 this is generally tested with the χ2 statistic when sample size is less than 200 schumacker and lomax 2004 several fit indices were also used to ensure model adequacy kline 1998 these included 1 the comparative fit index cfi which compares the specified model with a baseline model where all variables are assumed to be uncorrelated good model fit when cfi 0 9 2 the tucker lewis index tli which is similar to the cfi but has a stronger penalty for model complexity good model fit when tli 0 9 and 3 the root mean square error of approximation rmsea which estimates the fit of the model relative to a saturated model of the population good model fit when rmsea 0 1 once the initial model was tested modification indices were used to assess possible solutions to any discrepancies between the initial model and the data modification indices are calculated based on the expected decrease in the χ2 statistic given the addition of new model pathways grace 2006 mccune and grace 2002 modifications were only considered if they did not contradict ecological theory arhonditsis et al 2006 once the final model was established individual path significances were determined by dividing the path coefficient by its standard error with the resulting values tested using the t test path coefficients with t test p values 0 05 were considered significant non significant paths were retained if the model itself showed adequate fit to the data grace 2006 finally bootstrapping with 1000 boostrap draws was performed to assess the robustness of the overall model fit 3 results the initial conceptual sem did not adequately fit the data χ2 30 7 df 6 p value 0 0001 cfi 0 94 tli 0 85 rmsea 0 17 n 139 modification indices showed a need for a negative direct pathway from stratification magnitude to microcystis biovolume and another negative pathway from microcystis biovolume back to surface tp the suggested negative link between stratification magnitude and microcystis is at odds with several studies that reported that microcystis benefits from stratification through its ability to regulate buoyancy and thus migrate between high light surface waters and nutrient rich bottom waters under stable water column conditions bonnet and poulin 2002 carey et al 2012 chung et al 2014 heo and kim 2004 o neil et al 2012 thomas and walsby 1985 nonetheless there is evidence that several physical factors can reduce the effectiveness of microcystis buoyancy regulation chung et al 2014 dokulil and teubner 2000 visser et al 2016 wagner and adrian 2009 the ratio of the mixed layer depth to the euphotic depth zm zs has been established as an important factor impacting the advantage incurred by microcystis buoyancy regulation in stratified systems chung et al 2014 dokulil and teubner 2000 visser et al 2016 if the mixed layer is too deep or if the euphotic depth is too shallow as is the case in highly productive waters microcystis will be exposed to large fluctuations in photon irradiance which negatively impacts its growth reynolds et al 1987 several studies have pointed to a zm zs threshold of 2 5 3 above which light limitation reduces cyanobacterial biovolume in stratified areas heo and kim 2004 visser et al 2016 in the qaraoun reservoir analysis of the vertical temperature profile showed that 83 of the stratified stations had a zm zs 2 5 we also found that mixed layer depth had a significant negative correlation with microcystis biovolume in our study r 0 44 p value 0 03 additionally several studies have reported that turbulent mixing by winds can hinder the vertical migration of buoyant microcystis by disrupting the water column stability and therefore can induce light or nutrient limitation to the microcystis depending on their position in the water column cha et al 2014 chung et al 2014 heo and kim 2004 huisman et al 2004 scavia et al 2014 visser et al 2016 wind speeds as low as 2 4 m s have been reported to impair microcystis bloom formation in many systems blottière et al 2014 chaffin et al 2012 chung et al 2014 reynolds et al 1987 in the reservoir average daily summer wind speeds regularly exceed 6 m s with maximum daily winds often exceeding 11 m s data obtained from houche al oumara weather station 35 km north of qaraoun reservoir suggesting a high degree of summer turbulent mixing in the upper water column given the observed patterns of zm zs mixed layer depth and wind speed we conclude that stratification conditions in the reservoir were largely not amenable towards fully realizing the buoyance regulation advantage for microcystis as such the proposed negative sem pathway from stratification magnitude to microcystis biovolume was accepted and interpreted as an indication of increased light limitation and difficulty in maintaining the right balance between light and nutrient requirements the second suggested link by the modification indices is the addition of a negative reciprocal pathway from microcystis to surface tp this addition changes the model from recursive with causal links all in one direction to non recursive where two endogenous variables are determined from each other a closer examination of the bidirectional pathway shows that the positive path from surface tp to microcystis is stronger in magnitude than the negative path from microcystis to surface tp refer to fig 3 in the paper and to table 2 these two pathways capture two different mechanisms the positive path represents the natural affinity of microcystis to capture and store phosphorus which leads to higher algae cell growth meanwhile the negative pathway from microcystis to tp represent the net impact of sedimentation losses on surface nutrient concentrations through the sinking of dead microcystis cells and their byproducts following blooms microcystis are also known to have superior phosphorus storage mechanisms carey et al 2012 dokulil and teubner 2000 whitton 2012 and to undergo relatively little cell decomposition during the sedimentation process oliver et al 1985 reynolds et al 1981 takamura and yasuno 1988 thereby effectively removing stored phosphorus from the euphotic water column microcystis cell sedimentation rates are generally a function of nutrient and light limitations including self shading during bloom events competition and other adverse environmental factors that contribute to cell death in the water column reynolds 2006 sigee et al 2007 with the magnitude of loss rates increasing both during and after a bloom event cires et al 2013 sigee et al 2007 takamura and yasuno 1988 verspagen et al 2005 wormer et al 2011 zohary et al 2012 additionally the recursive link between microcystis biovolume and surface tp supports the consideration of defining a joint distribution for the two variables rather than to describe them individually through univariate distributions the advantages of defining bivariate distributions for highly correlated variables was highlighted by cha et al 2016 across several freshwater and estuarine systems sems are constrained to the adoption of univariate distributions for all endogenous variables note that this recursive link is also an artifact of the intrinsic correlation between tp and algae biovolume given the presence of the former within the algal cells the fit between the modified sem and the data proved satisfactory for predicting microcystis biovolume χ2 7 85 df 4 p value 0 1 cfi 0 99 tli 0 96 rmsea 0 08 n 139 there was generally a strong agreement between the model predicted covariance matrix and the observed data covariance matrix table 1 with 25 of the 28 matrix moments demonstrating low residual covariances 1 in their standardized form residual covariances divided by their standard error arhonditsis et al 2006 the bootstrap results also confirmed the robustness of the model the overall p value on the bootstrapped chi squared tests for model fit was 0 01 indicating that 99 of all bootstrapped models had chi square test statistics smaller than or as large as the fitted model note that a smaller chi squared value implies a stronger evidence that the covariance matrix implied in the conceptual model σ θ is equivalent to the observed covariance matrix in the data itself fig 3 shows the graphical representation of the final sem model all model pathways were found to be significant p value 0 05 except for the path between river flow and surface tp and the one linking station depth to microcystis biovolume the r2 for each of the endogenous parameters in fig 3 was calculated as 1 minus that standardized error variances where the error variances are the portions residuals of each predicted variable not accounted for within the model grace 2006 in general the model explained 49 9 of the observed variation in microcystis biovolume as well as 81 0 of the variation in surface tp and 45 5 of the variation in stratification magnitude fig 3 also displays the standardized path coefficients for the sem pathways standardized coefficients are generated by multiplying the unstandardized path coefficients obtained from the sem estimation procedure by the ratio of the standard deviation of the explanatory variable to the standard deviation of the predicted variable along each pathway arhonditsis et al 2006 standardized coefficients are therefore expressed in standard deviation units and thus are more easily comparable for assessing the relative strength of different sem pathways grace and bollen 2005 based on the model microcystis biovolume was found to be most strongly associated with the direct surface temperature pathway showing a standardized regression coefficient of 0 79 temperature also showed a relatively smaller indirect impact on microcystis through its effect on the magnitude of stratification in the reservoir which in turn negatively affected both surface tp and microcystis biovolume the strength of these combined indirect pathways from surface temperature to microcystis in standardized units is 0 30 0 25 0 30 0 29 0 37 0 11 and therefore the total effects of surface temperature on microcystis biovolume in our model is 0 79 0 11 0 68 the effect of surface tp on microcystis biovolume was not mediated by any other variable in the sem and the standardized direct path coefficient of 0 37 is noticeably less than the calculated total temperature effect microcystis also had a reciprocal albeit relatively smaller standardized coefficient 0 18 effect on surface tp such that while it is itself being stimulated by increased phosphorus loads it was simultaneously removing tp from surface waters it is also apparent that internal loading via bottom tp standardized coefficient 0 82 had a more significant impact on surface tp concentrations in our model than external loading via river flow finally station depth had a stronger positive influence on stratification magnitude standardized coefficient 0 56 than did temperature standardized coefficient 0 30 station depth also negatively impacted surface tp concentrations standardized coefficient 0 11 largely due to the strong and stable stratification occurring in the deeper sections of the reservoir strong stratification leads to reducing leakage of nutrients from the hypolimium to the epilimnion meanwhile the relationship between station depth and microcystis biovolumes was negative but not significant several studies across several lakes and reservoirs have reported that shallow areas tend to have higher nutrient concentrations and greater cyanobacterial growth rates as compared to deeper sections chung et al 2014 miller et al 2013 wagner and adrian 2009 unstandardized path coefficients which are the subject of the significance tests associated with the regression pathways in an sem are shown in table 2 unstandardized coefficients are expressed in the original units of the variables and represent the mean influence of the predictors on the response variables using the notation from table 2 microcystis biovolume can be predicted using the following equation 4 m i c r o c y s t i s i υ 3 γ 1 t e m p i γ 7 d e p t h i β 9 ln t p s u r f i β 10 s t r a t i f i c a t i o n m a g n i t u d e i ζ 3 ζ 3 n 0 ψ 3 where ln t p s u r f

inputs a temperature increase of 5 c above the median from 21 5 to 26 5 c is expected to increase the median microcystis biovolume from 19 050 to 40 250 organisms ml in deep stations station depth 1 and from 26 590 to 50 930 organisms ml for shallow stations station depth 0 if stratification magnitude is assumed to increase by 5 c from 2 to 7 c alongside the 5 c surface temperature increase then the median microcystis biovolume is predicted to increase marginally to reach 27 510 organisms ml in the deep stations finally holding temperature and stratification magnitude constant at their median values a change in surface tp from 0 23 mg l to 0 73 mg l is expected to increase microcystis biovolume to 28 780 organisms ml in deep stations and to 37 910 organisms ml in shallow stations the combination of the higher temperature 26 5 c and elevated surface phosphorus concentrations 0 73 mg l is predicted to yield a microcystis biovolume of 66 210 organisms ml in shallow stations 4 discussion 4 1 general phytoplankton and reservoir dynamics qaraoun reservoir has experienced cyanobacteria blooms across all seasons over the three years of this study this is a clear continuation of a pattern first reported by atoui et al 2013 it signals deteriorating conditions and the amplification of cultural eutrophication the phytoplankton community over the study period was dominated by microcystis and to a lesser extent aphanizomenon both appearing to be strongly affected by seasonal temperature patterns the dynamics of the two dominant cyanobacterial genus in this study shows that aphanizomenon tends to be more common in spring and fall co blooming with microcystis while microcystis tends to dominate as monospecific blooms over the warmest sampling dates recent work on qaraoun reservoir has noted that microcystis dominated over the hottest sampling dates fadel et al 2015 this is to be expected as microcystis s optimum growth occurs between 25 32 c carey et al 2012 jiang et al 2008 liu et al 2011 o neil et al 2012 paerl and huisman 2009 robarts and zohary 1987 4 2 direct and indirect temperature effects on microcystis biovolume many studies have documented the importance of temperature for microcystis growth blottière et al 2014 carey et al 2012 davis et al 2009 kosten et al 2012 liu et al 2011 robarts and zohary 1987 wu et al 2016 but it is often unclear whether direct or indirect temperature effects dominate the use of sem as a modeling technique allowed us to better resolve this question with direct temperature effects playing the major role in controlling microcystis biovolumes in qaraoun reservoir direct temperature mechanisms include enhanced photosynthetic and growth rates enhanced specific respiration and carbohydrate metabolism better nutrient uptake capacities and higher rates of intercellular nutrient assimilation carey et al 2012 davis et al 2009 robarts and zohary 1987 higher optimum growth temperatures for microcystis also gives them a competitive advantage over other cyanobacterial species and eukaryotic algae dokulil and teubner 2000 jiang et al 2008 kosten et al 2012 o neil et al 2012 as discussed above indirect temperature effects on microcystis were also apparent in our sem model but were significantly less important than the direct effects indirect temperature effects reported in the literature act primarily through increasing stratification magnitude which may limit internal loading across a strong thermocline visser et al 2016 wagner and adrian 2009 as expected surface tp was found to be negatively affected by the presence of stronger stratification in the sem whereby flow of nutrients from a hypoxic and nutrient rich hypolimnion to the nutrient depleted epilimnion was hindered culminating in a negative feedback on microcystis biovolume elliott 2012 wetzel 2001 zohary and ostrovsky 2011 cyanobacteria are also known to have higher requirements for trace elements as compared to eukaryotic algae dokulil and teubner 2000 jiang et al 2008 and therefore separation from nutrient rich bottom waters can have a broader consequence than the tp modeled in our sem the negative relationship from stratification magnitude to microcystis growth as mediated by surface tp in the sem model is evidenced in the qaraoun reservoir whereby blooms tend to occur in the fall after stratification ceases and reservoir turnover increases nutrient pools in surface waters stronger stratification is often thought to improve the stability of the water column chung et al 2014 kosten et al 2012 mcdonald and lehman 2013 o neil et al 2012 allowing buoyancy regulating species like microcystis to successfully migrate between nutrient rich bottom waters and light rich surface waters to optimize their growth rates bonnet and poulin 2002 carey et al 2012 dokulil and teubner 2000 kosten et al 2012 miller et al 2013 o neil et al 2012 robarts and zohary 1987 this pathway was significant in our model but showed a negative association likely as a result of other water column and basin level variables acting on this relationship microcystis require a shallow mixed layer to fully take advantage of their buoyancy capabilities chung et al 2014 reynolds et al 1987 wagner and adrian 2009 when mixed layers are too deep particularly when associated with a shallow euphotic depth microcystis may be less able to move and take advantage of the nutrient rich hypolimnion while also obtaining sufficient photon irradiance to avoid light restrictions to growth chung et al 2014 dokulil and teubner 2000 heo and kim 2004 visser et al 2016 wagner and adrian 2009 lake models have shown that phytoplankton biomass will initially increase with greater mixing depth up until a depth is reached where nutrient limitations are replaced by light limitations with biomass decreasing after this point visser et al 2016 note that other cyanobacteria species have been found to be more tolerant to longer and deeper stratification periods than microcystis reynolds et al 1987 wagner and adrian 2009 high winds seen in the summer months over qaraoun reservoir can also detract from microcystis buoyancy advantage through turbulent mixing that both destabilizes surface water layers and increases mixed layer depths in strongly stratified areas cha et al 2014 chung et al 2014 heo and kim 2004 huisman et al 2004 scavia et al 2014 visser et al 2016 the model results showed that the magnitude of stratification was more strongly influenced by station depth than by water temperature basin morphology and uncharacteristically dry conditions during much of our study period meant that large areas of the reservoir became too shallow to strongly stratify as water levels dropped strong annual and interannual fluctuations in water column depth are also characteristic of many semi arid water bodies that experience seasonal precipitation patterns and high evapotranspiration rates under high temperature regimes bai et al 2011 dantas et al 2011 naselli flores et al 2007 thornton and rast 1989 in the qaraoun reservoir only the deeper stations 10 m deep saw increased stratification magnitude as the summer proceeded leading to lower tp and microcystis biovolumes similar patterns have been documented in other studies with shallow areas showing higher nutrient concentrations and greater cyanobacterial growth rates chung et al 2014 miller et al 2013 wagner and adrian 2009 given the productivity of the study reservoir shallow areas are expected to occasionally experience low oxygen levels conducive to nutrient release while also providing a more favorable balance between nutrient concentrations and light resources than deeper sections kosten et al 2012 visser et al 2016 frequent alteration between mixed and stratified conditions in shallow lakes or in lakes with fluctuating water column depths can further stimulate phosphorus release rates from the sediment which improves conditions for microcystis growth sondergaard et al 2003 wagner and adrian 2009 4 3 nutrient loads and their effects on microcystis biovolume given the strength of the pathways from temperature to microcystis biovolume relative to the pathway pointing from surface tp it is apparent that temperature and perhaps light are generally more limiting to microcystis growth than are nutrient concentrations in our study nutrient loads to the reservoir tend to be high as evidenced by its hypereutrophic state although reduced po4 concentrations over summer growth periods do indicate periods of phosphorus limitation when all bio available phosphorus is uptaken under heavy algae cell growth rates microcystis are known to be strong competitors for nutrients and for phosphorus in particular o neil et al 2012 whitton 2012 which may also explain the relatively weaker surface tp to microcystis pathway in the sem microcystis generally has a high affinity for and ability to store phosphorus carey et al 2012 molot et al 2014 meaning that it can withstand periods of nutrient deficiency under fluctuating concentrations in the reservoir this high affinity uptake and phosphorus sequestration may also explain tp removal from surface waters by microcystis in the reciprocal sem pathway where sedimentation losses of dead cells acts to reduce surface nutrient concentrations carey et al 2012 cires et al 2013 dokulil and teubner 2000 o neil et al 2012 sigee et al 2007 takamura and yasuno 1988 finally the ability of microcystis to regulate their buoyancy may also help them avoid nutrient limitation as they may be able to access hypolimnion nutrient stores at times when the mixed layer depths are stable and shallow bonnet and poulin 2002 carey et al 2012 chung et al 2014 the developed sem also provided an opportunity to better understand the relative importance of different nutrient loading mechanisms for the reservoir internal loading through the direct pathway from bottom tp to surface tp was found to be much stronger than the river flow pathway that represents external loads internal loading is promoted by anoxia mediated sediment p release from the phosphorus rich sediments pettersson 1998 sondergaard et al 2003 wetzel 2001 during the summer growth period internal nutrient loads in shallow sections are readily available for microcystis while nutrients from the deeper sections appear to escape the hypolimnion and reach the epilimnion when the water column is disturbed by internal turbulence caused by such factors as winds in the qaraoun reservoir there is little to no external loading sources during the summer months and therefore any new phosphorus to the system during that period comes from internal sources despite the strong stratification of the system we believe that the insignificant link between the external load river flow and surface tp was due to the ephemeral flow patterns of the litani river river flows from the litani qaraoun reservoir s largest tributary are generally strongest in the winter and early spring flows in the summer months are low and can stop completely during low precipitation snow years and due to over pumping for irrigation external nutrient loads from the river likely contribute to the reservoir s overall nutrient status on an annual time step whereby high winter and spring river nutrient loads are expected to settle in the lake bed and replenish sediment stores when temperatures are still too low to promote microcystis growth and nutrient uptake sediment bound nutrients then fuel the summer cyanobacterial blooms in the form of internal loads this delay in the response to external loads has been well documented in lake erie where late summer cyanobacteria blooms were strongly correlated to tp loads entering the lake in march through june obenour et al 2014 strumpf et al 2012 lindim et al 2015 also found that late summer and fall phytoplankton blooms in the lower havel riverine lakes germany were related to phosphorus accumulated in the sediment from spring external loads more research is needed to fully understand sediment nutrient fluxes in qaraoun reservoir and to relate them to the seasonal loading from the litani river 4 4 implications for microcystis management management of microcystis blooms in qaraoun reservoir will require careful steps given the results of this study with ambient temperatures increasing and higher temperatures expected to persist for longer periods of the year under projected climate change alameddine et al 2018 deutsch and alameddine 2019 el samra et al 2018 fayad 2013 microcystis growth rates and dominance over other cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae in the reservoir is expected to worsen climate predictions for the region also include an increased frequency of drought events leading towards a shallower reservoir and the prevalence of polymictic conditions alameddine et al 2018 el samra et al 2018 fayad 2013 given that controlling the reservoir s temperature is not possible managing the reservoir s microcystis blooms under a warming climate has to focus on controlling internal nutrient loads including significant reductions in the external loads that appear to continuously replenish the sediment stores michalak et al 2013 wagner and adrian 2009 with the high sediment stores in the reservoir and nutrient fluxes from legacy nutrient sources in the contributing basin watershed level nutrient management is not expected to have an immediate effect on reservoir water quality chen et al 2018 pettersson 1998 and thus managers should be control the expectations of system recovery following the implementation of basin level point and non point source pollution management jeppesen et al 2005 reported that the recovery of 35 monitored lakes took 10 to 15 years following external nutrient load reductions due to internal phosphorus loading from legacy sources in reservoirs like the qaraoun that experience seasonal stratification legacy sediment phosphorus loading were found to remain an important driver of eutrophication for 20 to 70 years following the implementation of nutrient reduction measures at the watershed level carpenter 2005 schippers et al 2006 public disillusion with perceived failures of investments aimed at controlling watershed nutrient pollution initiatives has been reported across many lakes and reservoirs chen et al 2018 5 conclusions and future work structural equation modeling proved an effective tool towards understanding the complex causal relationships leading to the dominance of microcystis by quantifying co occurring direct and indirect environmental pathways in summary changes in surface water temperatures were found to play a pivotal role in controlling microcystis in the highly eutrophic semi arid qaraoun reservoir indirect temperature effects through stratification were also apparent although these pathways were found to be less important than the direct temperature link in our model reservoir depth also strongly influenced stratification patterns in the reservoir with consequences for semi arid water bodies that typically experience higher degrees of water volume fluctuations than their temperate counterparts the relatively weaker link between tp and microcystis in the sem is likely a result of the hypereutrophic nature of the system where temperature and light seem to play a stronger role in limiting growth than nutrients and may also be due to microcystis s high affinity for and ability to sequester phosphorus when epilimnion conditions do become limiting finally internal loading appeared to be the major nutrient source for strong summer microcystis blooms in the reservoir although high winter river flow rates typical of the mediterranean semi arid zone contribute strongly towards building up these sediment stores on an annual basis overall the developed sem model structure coincides with reported observations and conclusion made from lakes and reservoirs across greece papadimitriou et al 2013 vardaka et al 2005 italy naselli flores and barone 2005 naselli flores et al 2007 and spain romo et al 2013 while the sem demonstrated the importance of temperature nutrients and reservoir depth in controlling microcystis in the qaraoun reservoir future work should focus on assessing other pathways light limitation was hypothesized to contribute to the negative relationship between stratification and microcystis biovolume in our model yet it merits a direct assessment through the measurement of photon irradiance levels within the mixed layer light limitation should also be assessed with regards to the daily vertical migrations of microcystis in the water column bonnet and poulin 2002 visser et al 2016 wallace and hamilton 1999 additionally future work should develop the model further by incorporating a sediment nutrient flux model given the importance of the internal loading pathway in our sem this work will require sediment sampling in order to better characterize the roles that iron and oxidative reactive potential play in phosphorus sequestration in the sediment phosphates are known to be released from sediment iron complexes under low redox conditions or when high sediment sulfide concentrations precipitate insoluble iron sulfides and release the iron bound phosphates gachter and muller 2003 orihel et al 2015 sondergaard et al 2001 similarly the influence of zooplankton grazing on microcystis and its dominance with regards to other algae groups should be explored in future work hambright et al 2007 stein et al 1995 moreover while we expect that the developed sem provides a robust conceptual model that improves our understanding of microcystis dynamics as a function of a set of important salient physio chemical forcings in hypereutrophic semi arid reservoirs the full transferability of the model to other similar systems was not assessed similar to other modeling frameworks we envisage that while the model s structure will prove robust when transferred to other systems the relative strength of the paths and their coefficients will be system specific future work should focus on developing a multilevel hierarchical sem that would allow for the concurrent accounting of inter system and intra system model predictors the development of multilevel hierarchical sems is still at its early stages rosseel 2012 but it has shown promise lefcheck 2016 2019 finally future research should also expand on the knowledge gained through sem by exploring determinants of cyanobacterial dominance through other statistical modeling methods sems are very effective in defining causal relationships in complex systems anderson and vastag 2004 grace 2006 and were particularly helpful for qaraoun reservoir where limited previous research meant that our initial modeling objective was largely to empirically test theoretically derived causal relationships nonetheless sems are not traditionally strong predictive tools and are unable to perform system diagnoses both of which are important for future management efforts gupta and kim 2008 integrating our sem with a bayesian network model could provide a useful avenue for improving predictive and diagnostic outcomes of our modeling effort gupta and kim 2008 moe et al 2016 particularly once light and internal loading pathways are better defined in bayesian networks results are also represented as a probability of occurrence of different events or states which are more easily interpretable by water managers

24756,managing the spread of parasite populations is a ubiquitous challenge for managers of natural and farmed systems a specific current example are sea lice parasitic marine organisms that live on both wild and farmed salmon sp posing a persistent challenge to aquaculture operations in high latitude countries lice reproduce with pelagic larvae that spread in the water column meaning that fish farm sites are connected to one another as a result of their relative location and the response of the organism to the environment much work has investigated population connectivity for specific systems using computational models that link the physical and biological processes affecting larval transport however although probability and frequency of dispersal events may be calculated the specific implications for outbreaks on sites is not entirely clear we therefore used population models to describe the stage structured dynamics of connected sea lice population networks with the goal of establishing the critical connection strength probability of successful dispersal for occurrence of an outbreak our initial investigation deals with the case of self infection of a single isolated population vital rates of life cycle stages respond to temperature and as a consequence so does critical connectivity a dispersal success probability of around 0 01 is required for sea lice population development at the optimal temperature although this is dependent on parameterisation the analysis is extended to networks of sites interacting via dispersal and we show how fallow sites can lead to substantial reductions in population growth rates our results provide an important and to date missing component in assessment of the environmental impact of marine aquaculture sites they provide a basis upon which site operators and regional planners can appraise specific developments in the context of their surroundings and may provide a means for future development of adaptive management strategies keywords sea lice connectivity population model metapopulation aquaculture parasite management 1 introduction managing the spread of parasite populations is a ubiquitous challenge for managers of natural and farmed systems gajadhar et al 2006 mennerat et al 2010 owing to their deleterious impacts on hosts such organisms can provide a direct constraint on sustainable production in agriculture and aquaculture reducing health of farmed species costello 2006 sayers and sweeney 2005 and requiring costly management interventions costello 2009 as a result elevated threats to wild populations of conservation interest are possible bjørn et al 2001 potentially in addition to broader environmental impacts as a result of control measures which are applied by managers molento 2009 interconnections between farms themselves either due to natural links or aspects of the management process and with the surrounding environment means that effective management of this challenge depends on understanding processes operating at both local and geographic scales a current example is provided by the case of the global salmon production industry and the challenge of sea lice sea lice are parasitic copepods johnson and albright 1991b the control of which is a primary management issue in all regions where salmon are farmed and the cause of ongoing debate on the sustainability of the industry while lice occur naturally and were observed before the development of large scale aquaculture aquaculture sites provide a high density of host fish and as such can provide ideal locations for the development of outbreaks in lice abundance costello 2006 lice affect the health and welfare of farmed fish damaging skin and other soft tissues leading to a wide range of health issues johnson et al 2004 tully and nolan 2002 if left unchecked lice can lead to mortality of juvenile fish heuch et al 2005 morton and routledge 2005 due to the relative sizes of the host populations butler 2002 managing lice abundances on farm sites is also essential in limiting impacts on wild fish populations a range of methods are employed in controlling lice abundances on farm sites historically these have principally involved medication of fish using either bath or in feed treatments however these are costly to apply costello 2009 furthermore development of resistance molento 2009 torrissen et al 2013 and the impacts that chemicals have on the benthic environment bloodworth et al 2019 has increased interest in non medicinal approaches to lice control such measures include physical barriers heat or freshwater based treatments and spatially coordinated production cycles and fallow periods code of good practice management group 2011 guarracino et al 2018 the development and expansion of the salmon industry is a topic of ongoing debate defining the risks posed by new and existing farms in terms of their potential contribution to lice outbreaks is challenging due to the many confounding factors involved in the observed abundances at particular sites there is a need for simple metrics identifying whether a proposed development is likely to result in unacceptable impacts more broadly it is necessary to identify areas where production should be scaled back or may be sustainably increased in order to maximise the effectiveness of treatments for sea lice both medicinal and non medicinal and to optimise regional management of farm sites it is also necessary to understand the population dynamic process of the parasite which can inform us how treatments will influence and interact as a consequence several different types of simulation models have been implemented in order to investigate sea lice populations groner et al 2014 2016 used matrix models to provide a representation of stage structured lice populations investigating the role of temperature and salinity in population dynamics via their impact of transition and mortality rates another approach is the use of delay differential equations revie et al 2005 rittenhouse et al 2016 stien et al 2005 which offer a potentially more flexible and realistic but less analytically tractable representation of stage durations frazer et al 2012 used a host parasite model to investigate outbreaks omitting time delays but incorporating regional host density as a parameter influencing dynamics these population models incorporate a level of external and or self infection at farms which is frequently assumed constant producing identical dynamics at every farm or within groups of farms in practice farms are not isolated from one another lice larvae are released into the water column and disperse pelagically this means that lice pressure may be dependent on local farm proximity and environmental conditions elghafghuf et al 2020 kristoffersen et al 2014 2013 or pairwise larval connectivity between neighbouring sites adams et al 2016 cantrell et al 2018 johnsen et al 2016 salama et al 2017 such results can be incorporated directly into population models producing spatial variation in dynamics e g adams et al 2015 or linked with site counts to allow forecasting of lice abundances aldrin et al 2019 sandvik et al 2016 they may also be used directly to inform areas for spatially coordinated management of sites adams et al 2016 rabe et al 2020 however work to date has not described the contributions that individual sites might make to outbreaks in either general or specific scenarios and it has not been possible to define at what point connectivity between sites or groups of sites reaches an unacceptable level to tackle this question we built upon existing work using matrix population models to describe the development of connected networks of sea lice populations considering initially the case of a single site we were able to derive the critical rate of self infection that leads to population growth and show how this varies with water temperature we then extended the model to account for networks of multiple sites considering the cases where connectivity is equal randomly distributed or has a defined structure results for the multi site model mirror those of the single site model with critical connectivity relating to the sum of incoming connections at a site finally we investigated the impacts of management actions reducing larval production and fallowing on a specified network of sites showing routes to limiting sea lice population growth our results are of general applicability while providing novel and much needed insights into the relevance of inter site connections for sea lice population dynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 stage structure of lice populations the life history of l salmonis is generally described using a sequence of stages this study follows other recent work groner et al 2014 revie et al 2005 stien et al 2005 in structuring the lice population into 7 stages 1 egg 2 pre infective including nauplius 1 and 2 3 infective copepodid 4 chalimus including chalimus 1 and 2 5 pre adult 6 non gravid adult and 7 gravid egg bearing adult stage fig 1 shows the life cycle of the sea louse distinguishing between attached and pelagic dispersing stages and providing an overview of the model process 2 2 matrix population model for a single site a matrix population model mpm was used caswell 2001 to describe the dynamics of the stage structured population of lice within a site this iterates the matrix equation 1 n t 1 m n t where nt is a vector representing the density of lice in each stage at time t and m is a matrix describing the transition rates between population stages that is 2 n t 1 n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 n 5 n 6 n 7 t 1 p 1 0 0 0 0 0 r c g 1 p 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 g 2 p 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 g 3 p 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 g 4 p 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 g 5 p 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 g 6 p 7 n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 n 5 n 6 n 7 t pi is the probability that lice in a particular stage remain in that stage while gi is the transition rate of individuals of stage i to stage i 1 lice in stage 7 produce eggs at rate r which is multiplied by c the probability of successful dispersal the critical value of c was a primary focus of this study the largest eigenvalue of matrix m λ gives the asymptotic growth rate of the population caswell 2001 the stage transition rate gi is a product of γi the proportion of individuals that grow from stage i to i 1 at each timestep and σi the survival factor within that stage 3 g i σ i γ i the parameter γ i is calculated as 1 t t o t i where t t o t i is the mean period of time that lice spend in stage i the remaining fraction of individuals that did not grow 1 γi stays in its original stage and is similarly exposed to the probability of survival σi 4 p i σ i 1 γ i the reproduction rate r is a product of the number of eggs a single individual in stage 7 can produce per time step and the survival rate within that stage σ 7 5 r f σ 7 in our model we set σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 1 such that no mortality occurs in stages 1 3 instead the reproduction rate was multiplied by a value c which defines the overall probability that lice successfully pass through the dispersing larval stages this parameter is produced as an output from studies of larval dispersal and is normally referred to as connectivity for attached stage survival rates we investigated two scenarios firstly we used parameters derived from the best fit values obtained by revie et al 2005 for scottish sites over a full production cycle their study used fixed stage durations τ i 15 20 20 days for chalimus pre adult and adult stages respectively and obtained fitted stage survival fractions s 4 0 642 chalimus and s 5 6 0 973 pre adults and adults daily mortality rates were then calculated as b i ln s i τ i we calculated corresponding σ i 1 b i giving σ 4 0 970 σ 5 0 998 and σ 6 0 997 to 3 s f revie et al 2005 fixed σ 7 0 942 a second set of parameters was obtained from survival rates derived from experimental work presented by stien et al 2005 σ 4 0 990 σ 5 0 950 and σ 6 σ 7 0 980 we calculated results both including and excluding the additional stage transitional mortality observed by tucker et al 2000 survival rate between chalimus and pre adult 0 440 applied as an extra multiplier to g 4 2 3 temperature dependence the life history parameters of l salmonis have been shown to be dependent on temperature and salinity stien et al 2005 with consequent impacts on population dynamics groner et al 2014 2016 in this study we incorporated variation in temperature the total time spent in each stage which leads to estimated stage transition rates gi defined above may usefully be considered the sum of a minimal time τi t and a development time ηi t 6 t t o t i t τ i t η i t in previous work stien et al 2005 it was shown that minimal time in a stage τ was dependent on temperature according to a bêlehrádek function 7 τ t β 1 t 10 β 1 β 2 2 development time η is the time an individual needs to physiologically change to the next stage after τ using data from previous studies bjørn and finstad 1998 finstad et al 2000 grimnes and jakobsen 1996 johnson and albright 1991a tucker et al 2000 we estimated η via regression to a second order polynomial function of temperature r core team 2020 8 η i t a 0 a 1 t a 2 t 2 the values of intersect and slope are different for each stage and can be found in table 1 there is no minimal time per stage or development time for the transition of stage 3 to stage 4 in our model as this transition is considered to be dependent on finding a host for settlement the transition from stage 6 to 7 is considered independent of temperature with an average of 10 days revie et al 2005 the number of eggs produced in an egg string has previously been shown to be dependent on temperature according to an exponential quadratic relationship samsing et al 2016 9 f t exp 5 6 0 43 ln t t c 0 78 ln t t c 2 sea lice lay eggs in strings producing two strings at a time we assumed a 50 50 ratio of males to female and modelled female lice alone which cancels out the multiplication by 2 the number of eggs produced per day was found by dividing f t by the average time required to produce an egg string this can be estimated as 15 days mustafa et al 2000 for both parameter scenarios we also considered the impact of temperature dependent settlement of larvae defined as a proportion 4 2 t 17 100 after tucker et al 2000 2 4 single site calculation we first considered a single site that is isolated from any others dispersing lice spend several days moving freely in the water column in the case of a single site the only possible option for larvae is self infection or no infection the probability of which we refer to as si thus c s i in eq 2 given values of pi and gi si the critical level of si for positive population growth λ 1 with n stages is calculated with the characteristic equation of matrix m see supporting information s1 10 s i i 1 n p i 1 r i 1 n 1 g i si varies with temperature we therefore generated matrices m for a single site for values of c s i from 0 0001 to 0 5 and values of t from 4 to 18 degrees using both sets of survival rate parameters we calculated the largest eigenvalue for each matrix and plotted the results on contour plots 2 5 multi site population model dispersal models estimate the overall probability of a released louse infecting a particular site incorporating the effects of mortality and the risk of not finding a suitable host the probability of a louse larva dispersing between a particular pair of sites i and j is known as their connectivity c i j adams et al 2016 for a network of n sites these are generally contained within a connectivity matrix c with a row for each source site i and a column for each destination site j 11 c c 1 1 c 1 n c 2 1 c 2 n c n 1 c n n self infection si probabilities for each site are found on the leading diagonal s i i c i i in the operation of the model these connection probabilities introduce transfer of population density between sites between the gravid female 7 and egg 1 stages 1 the single site model may be generalised to describe a metapopulation consisting of multiple sites by incorporating the redistribution of larvae between sites according to the connectivity matrix we decomposed the matrix m into components representing the fate of established individuals m and the reproductive rate h respectively that is 12 m p 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 g 1 p 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 g 2 p 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 g 3 p 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 g 4 p 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 g 5 p 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 g 6 p 7 h 0 0 0 0 0 0 r 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 in the case of two sites linked by a connectivity matrix of size 2 2 we can then write 13 n 1 n 2 t 1 m 1 0 0 m 2 c 1 1 h 1 c 2 1 h 1 c 1 2 h 2 c 2 2 f 2 n 1 n 2 t i 2 m c t h n 1 n 2 t where i 2 is a 2 2 identity matrix is the tensor product and ct is the transposed connectivity matrix the formulation extends naturally to describe arbitrary sized networks of sites and similarly to the single site case population growth is summarised by the dominant eigenvalue of the bracketed matrix caswell 2001 we calculated eigenvalues of the matrix i 2 m c h describing multi site networks under three site scenarios i choosing random between site connectivity values but fixing each site s total influx the sum of each column of c ii fixing mean site influx but allowing variations between sites random permutations of all values in the connectivity matrix and iii applying a connectivity matrix derived from larval dispersal simulations adams et al 2016 for an example network of 12 sites fig 2 in cases i and ii we tested networks of sites with between 1 and 100 sites and plotted eigenvalues with respect to total or mean site influx over the range 0 0 1 and temperature over the range 4 18 degrees centigrade in case iii we first tested the reduction in reproduction or connectivity required to prevent population growth over the same temperature range secondly we removed individual sites one at a time and in small groups to investigate resulting changes to the overall network eigenvalue in all scenarios we made the assumption that the same temperatures were experienced at all sites meaning growth survival and reproduction rates were unchanged between them 2 6 temporal simulations to test the validity of the eigenvalue calculation we also ran temporal simulations using the same generated matrices numerically iterating eq 13 to produce timeseries of population density for all sites and stages for these simulations temperature was fixed at 10 c site population parameters were those derived from stien et al 2005 connectivity matrices were generated according to case ii noted above fixing mean site influx sum of incoming connections but allowing variation between sites a range of network sizes was tested from 1 to 100 sites influx values used in these simulations were guided by the critical thresholds determined from plots of eigenvalues generated previously we considered values above close to and below the predicted threshold for population growth 2 7 computer code computer code allowing calculation of population eigenvalues temporal development of connected populations and the described management scenarios is provided in supporting information s2 matlab code 3 results 3 1 isolated population in the single population case results from the two different parameter sources were very similar with revie et al 2005 parameters predicting population growth over a slightly broader range of temperatures at a given si value fig 3 a b across the optimal temperature for lice growth between 8 14 c the critical level of si was slightly below 0 01 incorporating temperature dependent settlement led to a higher critical si value due to the reduced settlement and a narrower window of temperatures for growth at a particular si value fig 3c d at the optimal temperature for lice growth between 12 14 c critical si was approximately 0 025 applying a linear as opposed to quadratic relationship between temperature and population development rates did not alter the minimum critical si level but led to elevated eigenvalues at high temperatures not shown 3 2 multi site metapopulations when total or mean site influx sum of self and external infection rates was held fixed our investigations of multi site networks with randomly generated connectivity matrices found no impact of increasing the number of sites and only minor fluctuations in network eigenvalue in response to altering the distribution of connectivity values between sites results are not shown as the plots are essentially identical to fig 3 only by changing the total or mean connectivity between sites equivalent to altering si value for the single site scenario was a change in eigenvalue seen fig 4 shows eigenvalues for a 12 site metapopulation connected using a connectivity matrix derived from larval dispersal simulations eigenvalues were calculated for the metapopulation indicating population growth for the network at all temperatures greater than 6 c applying a linear scaling factor to the reproductive output of all sites indicated that a reduction in reproductive output to around 1 10th to 1 20th of its original value was required to prevent an increasing population of lice at the optimum temperature for growth fig 5 shows the impact of removing specific sites on the overall eigenvalue of the connected metapopulation for the specific example network used above our results suggested that it is not possible to completely eliminate population growth in this particular metapopulation by site removal alone in general individual sites in the network self infected sufficiently to ensure population growth however substantial reductions c25 were possible through the removal of particular sites removing site 2 or better site 3 in isolation led to a reduction in the eigenvalue removing both sites together gave no benefit above that of removing site 3 alone but additionally removing sites 4 and 5 produced a further modest benefit 3 3 temporal simulations iteration of eq 13 yielded timeseries describing population density of connected networks of sites as expected increasing the average rate of dispersal between sites led to an increasing population growth rate as this increases values c i j and hence the dominant eigenvalue of the bracketed matrix in the equation networks with average values of site influx sum of incoming connections below 0 0075 had population densities which declined over the full simulation while networks above this threshold had population densities which increased over time fig 6 this effect was independent of the number of sites in the network on the condition that average influx remained the same this threshold is very close to that determined visually from plots of eigenvalues for the same population matrices 4 discussion this manuscript has described a model for the description of a connected metapopulation linking representation of population stage structure groner et al 2014 2016 and temperature dependent vital rates angilletta et al 2004 bjørn and finstad 1998 finstad et al 2000 gillooly et al 2001 grimnes and jakobsen 1996 johnson and albright 1991a tucker et al 2000 with population connectivity adams et al 2016 this allowed us to calculate critical self infection values for population persistence at a single site over a range of temperatures and to demonstrate how the results extend to networks of many sites we considered basic management strategies in the form of a percentage reduction in reproductive output and the removal of sites from the system to our knowledge this is the first published study placing results of biophysical transport models for sea lice within the context of critical thresholds for population dynamics in our consideration of an isolated single site we found minimum critical self infection rates of between 0 01 and 0 03 depending on whether settlement was considered to be temperature dependent in addition to attached stage development rates to place this into context if one assumes a constant mortality rate during dispersal of 0 01 hr 1 amundrud and murray 2009 and 40 days to develop to the infective copepodid stage samsing et al 2019 in warm summer water temperatures of 14 c a maximum of around 50 of the released lice would be available for settlement predicted self infection probabilities well above the threshold are frequently observed in models of larval dispersal and indeed were observed in the matrix used here the level of self infection required to ensure population growth is therefore very low relative to the level that may exist in reality explaining why a lice challenge is observed in real site networks although it should be borne in mind that connection probabilities incorporated in population models should incorporate settlement success connection probability is just one way that biophysical models calculate links between sites with some authors instead computing metrics based on time aggregated particle densities in proximity to sites cantrell et al 2018 sandvik et al 2020 in such cases it would be necessary to determine a relationship between infection pressure and inter site connectivity to make use of the results presented here we tested the model using parameters from two independent parameter sources the parameters obtained by revie et al 2005 when fitting a delay differential equation model to farm data and the empirically derived parameters presented by stien et al 2005 our results were very similar for both sets of parameters giving no substantial alteration to the predicted critical minimum self infection level the former parameterisation produced a broader range of temperatures over which population growth would be expected at a given rate of site influx due to the altered balance lice survival between stages the temperature dependence relationships themselves were based on a limited number of data points which may limit the accuracy of our population responses to variation in temperature however the fitted functions are simple and an alteration to the specific detail of the functions is unlikely to qualitatively change the results considered as a whole the models indicate clear potential for exponential population growth is present across a broad range of the temperatures which are suitable for farming salmon extending the model to describe multiple sites was carried out in two stages firstly an exploration of the effects of adding sites varying mean infection pressure per site and redistributing connectivity values between sites to simulate a wide range of network connection scenarios was carried out this demonstrated quite clearly that there was no impact of increasing the number of sites per se rather it was the average total infection pressure on each site equivalent to self infection pressure in the single site case that governed the dynamics this coincides with the results of aldrin et al 2019 that outbreaks are more closely linked to the distance between sites than how many there are as such prediction of population growth at a particular site that is part of a larger network may be handled in the same way as that in an isolated site in a connected network therefore sites with total influx greater than the critical self infection rate for a particular temperature would also be predicted to experience population growth applying the derived population matrices to generate timeseries of abundance instead of eigenvalues yielded very similar results population growth appeared to take place at a slightly lower threshold than that predicted by the eigenvalue calculations though the difference was marginal this demonstrates the applicability of the eigenvalue method in summarising the development of both single and multi site populations the second component of the metapopulation investigation applied a connectivity matrix for 12 sites on the west coast of scotland estimated using a larval dispersal model the levels of connectivity between the sites ensured a prediction of population growth at all temperatures greater than 6 c encompassing the annual temperature range experienced in that locality our calculations showed that reproduction or equivalently connectivity would have to be reduced by at least an order of magnitude to prevent population growth in practice this might be achieved by a range of methods cleaner fish skiftesvik et al 2013 providing steady grazing of lice might be one option while physical barrier technologies such as skirts or snorkels oppedal et al 2017 would be another periodic chemical treatments have a temporary effect of reducing lice numbers but abundances of a connected network of sites will always increase between treatment events if no other management is in place site removal scenarios demonstrated that a reduction in overall population growth rate might be achieved by removal or fallow of well chosen sites in common with previous work adams et al 2015 which used a different model based on delay differential equations the results suggest that sites with the highest influx are the most important for metapopulation growth and the selection of candidate sites for removal should be made on this basis rather than outflux the sum of outgoing connections from a site in our example the highest influx sites were sites 3 and 5 and it was these that had the greatest impact on the metapopulation eigenvalue not site 2 the highest outflux site in this example it was not possible to eliminate population growth achieve a metapopulation eigenvalue less than 1 via site removal alone as the predicted level of self infection and overall influx for almost all the sites was too high nevertheless a 25 reduction in the difference between the baseline eigenvalue and 1 at the optimum lice growth temperature and nearly 33 at 8 c could be significant in efforts to control lice numbers this approach provides a firmer basis for the implementation of management units like the existing farm management areas in scotland code of good practice management group 2011 or management zones in norway guarracino et al 2018 based on specific connectivity thresholds which may be derived geographically using transport models adams et al 2016 such thresholds may vary between areas depending on the local oceanographic conditions temperature and salinity and also between times of the year more detailed investigation of these characteristics using combined biophysical models will be essential if we are to enable ongoing development of the industry in a sustainable manner it may also yield strategies for adaptive management of sites such as shifting firebreaks and variable deployment of physical barriers every locality is different but the presented methods enable analysis and comprehension of the combined impacts of the biophysical processes affecting a particular site or set of sites they contextualise the large body of work investigating larval dispersal of lice between farm sites making a clear distinction between those dispersal pathways which are important to monitor and control and those which are less important finally while the presented methods have direct implications for the management of salmon aquaculture sites they can equally be applied to any scenario involving the control of a connected population network understanding the connectivity and resulting dynamics of these metapopulations can therefore pay great dividends in preventing outbreaks and managing epidemics credit

24756,managing the spread of parasite populations is a ubiquitous challenge for managers of natural and farmed systems a specific current example are sea lice parasitic marine organisms that live on both wild and farmed salmon sp posing a persistent challenge to aquaculture operations in high latitude countries lice reproduce with pelagic larvae that spread in the water column meaning that fish farm sites are connected to one another as a result of their relative location and the response of the organism to the environment much work has investigated population connectivity for specific systems using computational models that link the physical and biological processes affecting larval transport however although probability and frequency of dispersal events may be calculated the specific implications for outbreaks on sites is not entirely clear we therefore used population models to describe the stage structured dynamics of connected sea lice population networks with the goal of establishing the critical connection strength probability of successful dispersal for occurrence of an outbreak our initial investigation deals with the case of self infection of a single isolated population vital rates of life cycle stages respond to temperature and as a consequence so does critical connectivity a dispersal success probability of around 0 01 is required for sea lice population development at the optimal temperature although this is dependent on parameterisation the analysis is extended to networks of sites interacting via dispersal and we show how fallow sites can lead to substantial reductions in population growth rates our results provide an important and to date missing component in assessment of the environmental impact of marine aquaculture sites they provide a basis upon which site operators and regional planners can appraise specific developments in the context of their surroundings and may provide a means for future development of adaptive management strategies keywords sea lice connectivity population model metapopulation aquaculture parasite management 1 introduction managing the spread of parasite populations is a ubiquitous challenge for managers of natural and farmed systems gajadhar et al 2006 mennerat et al 2010 owing to their deleterious impacts on hosts such organisms can provide a direct constraint on sustainable production in agriculture and aquaculture reducing health of farmed species costello 2006 sayers and sweeney 2005 and requiring costly management interventions costello 2009 as a result elevated threats to wild populations of conservation interest are possible bjørn et al 2001 potentially in addition to broader environmental impacts as a result of control measures which are applied by managers molento 2009 interconnections between farms themselves either due to natural links or aspects of the management process and with the surrounding environment means that effective management of this challenge depends on understanding processes operating at both local and geographic scales a current example is provided by the case of the global salmon production industry and the challenge of sea lice sea lice are parasitic copepods johnson and albright 1991b the control of which is a primary management issue in all regions where salmon are farmed and the cause of ongoing debate on the sustainability of the industry while lice occur naturally and were observed before the development of large scale aquaculture aquaculture sites provide a high density of host fish and as such can provide ideal locations for the development of outbreaks in lice abundance costello 2006 lice affect the health and welfare of farmed fish damaging skin and other soft tissues leading to a wide range of health issues johnson et al 2004 tully and nolan 2002 if left unchecked lice can lead to mortality of juvenile fish heuch et al 2005 morton and routledge 2005 due to the relative sizes of the host populations butler 2002 managing lice abundances on farm sites is also essential in limiting impacts on wild fish populations a range of methods are employed in controlling lice abundances on farm sites historically these have principally involved medication of fish using either bath or in feed treatments however these are costly to apply costello 2009 furthermore development of resistance molento 2009 torrissen et al 2013 and the impacts that chemicals have on the benthic environment bloodworth et al 2019 has increased interest in non medicinal approaches to lice control such measures include physical barriers heat or freshwater based treatments and spatially coordinated production cycles and fallow periods code of good practice management group 2011 guarracino et al 2018 the development and expansion of the salmon industry is a topic of ongoing debate defining the risks posed by new and existing farms in terms of their potential contribution to lice outbreaks is challenging due to the many confounding factors involved in the observed abundances at particular sites there is a need for simple metrics identifying whether a proposed development is likely to result in unacceptable impacts more broadly it is necessary to identify areas where production should be scaled back or may be sustainably increased in order to maximise the effectiveness of treatments for sea lice both medicinal and non medicinal and to optimise regional management of farm sites it is also necessary to understand the population dynamic process of the parasite which can inform us how treatments will influence and interact as a consequence several different types of simulation models have been implemented in order to investigate sea lice populations groner et al 2014 2016 used matrix models to provide a representation of stage structured lice populations investigating the role of temperature and salinity in population dynamics via their impact of transition and mortality rates another approach is the use of delay differential equations revie et al 2005 rittenhouse et al 2016 stien et al 2005 which offer a potentially more flexible and realistic but less analytically tractable representation of stage durations frazer et al 2012 used a host parasite model to investigate outbreaks omitting time delays but incorporating regional host density as a parameter influencing dynamics these population models incorporate a level of external and or self infection at farms which is frequently assumed constant producing identical dynamics at every farm or within groups of farms in practice farms are not isolated from one another lice larvae are released into the water column and disperse pelagically this means that lice pressure may be dependent on local farm proximity and environmental conditions elghafghuf et al 2020 kristoffersen et al 2014 2013 or pairwise larval connectivity between neighbouring sites adams et al 2016 cantrell et al 2018 johnsen et al 2016 salama et al 2017 such results can be incorporated directly into population models producing spatial variation in dynamics e g adams et al 2015 or linked with site counts to allow forecasting of lice abundances aldrin et al 2019 sandvik et al 2016 they may also be used directly to inform areas for spatially coordinated management of sites adams et al 2016 rabe et al 2020 however work to date has not described the contributions that individual sites might make to outbreaks in either general or specific scenarios and it has not been possible to define at what point connectivity between sites or groups of sites reaches an unacceptable level to tackle this question we built upon existing work using matrix population models to describe the development of connected networks of sea lice populations considering initially the case of a single site we were able to derive the critical rate of self infection that leads to population growth and show how this varies with water temperature we then extended the model to account for networks of multiple sites considering the cases where connectivity is equal randomly distributed or has a defined structure results for the multi site model mirror those of the single site model with critical connectivity relating to the sum of incoming connections at a site finally we investigated the impacts of management actions reducing larval production and fallowing on a specified network of sites showing routes to limiting sea lice population growth our results are of general applicability while providing novel and much needed insights into the relevance of inter site connections for sea lice population dynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 stage structure of lice populations the life history of l salmonis is generally described using a sequence of stages this study follows other recent work groner et al 2014 revie et al 2005 stien et al 2005 in structuring the lice population into 7 stages 1 egg 2 pre infective including nauplius 1 and 2 3 infective copepodid 4 chalimus including chalimus 1 and 2 5 pre adult 6 non gravid adult and 7 gravid egg bearing adult stage fig 1 shows the life cycle of the sea louse distinguishing between attached and pelagic dispersing stages and providing an overview of the model process 2 2 matrix population model for a single site a matrix population model mpm was used caswell 2001 to describe the dynamics of the stage structured population of lice within a site this iterates the matrix equation 1 n t 1 m n t where nt is a vector representing the density of lice in each stage at time t and m is a matrix describing the transition rates between population stages that is 2 n t 1 n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 n 5 n 6 n 7 t 1 p 1 0 0 0 0 0 r c g 1 p 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 g 2 p 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 g 3 p 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 g 4 p 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 g 5 p 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 g 6 p 7 n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 n 5 n 6 n 7 t pi is the probability that lice in a particular stage remain in that stage while gi is the transition rate of individuals of stage i to stage i 1 lice in stage 7 produce eggs at rate r which is multiplied by c the probability of successful dispersal the critical value of c was a primary focus of this study the largest eigenvalue of matrix m λ gives the asymptotic growth rate of the population caswell 2001 the stage transition rate gi is a product of γi the proportion of individuals that grow from stage i to i 1 at each timestep and σi the survival factor within that stage 3 g i σ i γ i the parameter γ i is calculated as 1 t t o t i where t t o t i is the mean period of time that lice spend in stage i the remaining fraction of individuals that did not grow 1 γi stays in its original stage and is similarly exposed to the probability of survival σi 4 p i σ i 1 γ i the reproduction rate r is a product of the number of eggs a single individual in stage 7 can produce per time step and the survival rate within that stage σ 7 5 r f σ 7 in our model we set σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 1 such that no mortality occurs in stages 1 3 instead the reproduction rate was multiplied by a value c which defines the overall probability that lice successfully pass through the dispersing larval stages this parameter is produced as an output from studies of larval dispersal and is normally referred to as connectivity for attached stage survival rates we investigated two scenarios firstly we used parameters derived from the best fit values obtained by revie et al 2005 for scottish sites over a full production cycle their study used fixed stage durations τ i 15 20 20 days for chalimus pre adult and adult stages respectively and obtained fitted stage survival fractions s 4 0 642 chalimus and s 5 6 0 973 pre adults and adults daily mortality rates were then calculated as b i ln s i τ i we calculated corresponding σ i 1 b i giving σ 4 0 970 σ 5 0 998 and σ 6 0 997 to 3 s f revie et al 2005 fixed σ 7 0 942 a second set of parameters was obtained from survival rates derived from experimental work presented by stien et al 2005 σ 4 0 990 σ 5 0 950 and σ 6 σ 7 0 980 we calculated results both including and excluding the additional stage transitional mortality observed by tucker et al 2000 survival rate between chalimus and pre adult 0 440 applied as an extra multiplier to g 4 2 3 temperature dependence the life history parameters of l salmonis have been shown to be dependent on temperature and salinity stien et al 2005 with consequent impacts on population dynamics groner et al 2014 2016 in this study we incorporated variation in temperature the total time spent in each stage which leads to estimated stage transition rates gi defined above may usefully be considered the sum of a minimal time τi t and a development time ηi t 6 t t o t i t τ i t η i t in previous work stien et al 2005 it was shown that minimal time in a stage τ was dependent on temperature according to a bêlehrádek function 7 τ t β 1 t 10 β 1 β 2 2 development time η is the time an individual needs to physiologically change to the next stage after τ using data from previous studies bjørn and finstad 1998 finstad et al 2000 grimnes and jakobsen 1996 johnson and albright 1991a tucker et al 2000 we estimated η via regression to a second order polynomial function of temperature r core team 2020 8 η i t a 0 a 1 t a 2 t 2 the values of intersect and slope are different for each stage and can be found in table 1 there is no minimal time per stage or development time for the transition of stage 3 to stage 4 in our model as this transition is considered to be dependent on finding a host for settlement the transition from stage 6 to 7 is considered independent of temperature with an average of 10 days revie et al 2005 the number of eggs produced in an egg string has previously been shown to be dependent on temperature according to an exponential quadratic relationship samsing et al 2016 9 f t exp 5 6 0 43 ln t t c 0 78 ln t t c 2 sea lice lay eggs in strings producing two strings at a time we assumed a 50 50 ratio of males to female and modelled female lice alone which cancels out the multiplication by 2 the number of eggs produced per day was found by dividing f t by the average time required to produce an egg string this can be estimated as 15 days mustafa et al 2000 for both parameter scenarios we also considered the impact of temperature dependent settlement of larvae defined as a proportion 4 2 t 17 100 after tucker et al 2000 2 4 single site calculation we first considered a single site that is isolated from any others dispersing lice spend several days moving freely in the water column in the case of a single site the only possible option for larvae is self infection or no infection the probability of which we refer to as si thus c s i in eq 2 given values of pi and gi si the critical level of si for positive population growth λ 1 with n stages is calculated with the characteristic equation of matrix m see supporting information s1 10 s i i 1 n p i 1 r i 1 n 1 g i si varies with temperature we therefore generated matrices m for a single site for values of c s i from 0 0001 to 0 5 and values of t from 4 to 18 degrees using both sets of survival rate parameters we calculated the largest eigenvalue for each matrix and plotted the results on contour plots 2 5 multi site population model dispersal models estimate the overall probability of a released louse infecting a particular site incorporating the effects of mortality and the risk of not finding a suitable host the probability of a louse larva dispersing between a particular pair of sites i and j is known as their connectivity c i j adams et al 2016 for a network of n sites these are generally contained within a connectivity matrix c with a row for each source site i and a column for each destination site j 11 c c 1 1 c 1 n c 2 1 c 2 n c n 1 c n n self infection si probabilities for each site are found on the leading diagonal s i i c i i in the operation of the model these connection probabilities introduce transfer of population density between sites between the gravid female 7 and egg 1 stages 1 the single site model may be generalised to describe a metapopulation consisting of multiple sites by incorporating the redistribution of larvae between sites according to the connectivity matrix we decomposed the matrix m into components representing the fate of established individuals m and the reproductive rate h respectively that is 12 m p 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 g 1 p 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 g 2 p 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 g 3 p 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 g 4 p 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 g 5 p 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 g 6 p 7 h 0 0 0 0 0 0 r 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 in the case of two sites linked by a connectivity matrix of size 2 2 we can then write 13 n 1 n 2 t 1 m 1 0 0 m 2 c 1 1 h 1 c 2 1 h 1 c 1 2 h 2 c 2 2 f 2 n 1 n 2 t i 2 m c t h n 1 n 2 t where i 2 is a 2 2 identity matrix is the tensor product and ct is the transposed connectivity matrix the formulation extends naturally to describe arbitrary sized networks of sites and similarly to the single site case population growth is summarised by the dominant eigenvalue of the bracketed matrix caswell 2001 we calculated eigenvalues of the matrix i 2 m c h describing multi site networks under three site scenarios i choosing random between site connectivity values but fixing each site s total influx the sum of each column of c ii fixing mean site influx but allowing variations between sites random permutations of all values in the connectivity matrix and iii applying a connectivity matrix derived from larval dispersal simulations adams et al 2016 for an example network of 12 sites fig 2 in cases i and ii we tested networks of sites with between 1 and 100 sites and plotted eigenvalues with respect to total or mean site influx over the range 0 0 1 and temperature over the range 4 18 degrees centigrade in case iii we first tested the reduction in reproduction or connectivity required to prevent population growth over the same temperature range secondly we removed individual sites one at a time and in small groups to investigate resulting changes to the overall network eigenvalue in all scenarios we made the assumption that the same temperatures were experienced at all sites meaning growth survival and reproduction rates were unchanged between them 2 6 temporal simulations to test the validity of the eigenvalue calculation we also ran temporal simulations using the same generated matrices numerically iterating eq 13 to produce timeseries of population density for all sites and stages for these simulations temperature was fixed at 10 c site population parameters were those derived from stien et al 2005 connectivity matrices were generated according to case ii noted above fixing mean site influx sum of incoming connections but allowing variation between sites a range of network sizes was tested from 1 to 100 sites influx values used in these simulations were guided by the critical thresholds determined from plots of eigenvalues generated previously we considered values above close to and below the predicted threshold for population growth 2 7 computer code computer code allowing calculation of population eigenvalues temporal development of connected populations and the described management scenarios is provided in supporting information s2 matlab code 3 results 3 1 isolated population in the single population case results from the two different parameter sources were very similar with revie et al 2005 parameters predicting population growth over a slightly broader range of temperatures at a given si value fig 3 a b across the optimal temperature for lice growth between 8 14 c the critical level of si was slightly below 0 01 incorporating temperature dependent settlement led to a higher critical si value due to the reduced settlement and a narrower window of temperatures for growth at a particular si value fig 3c d at the optimal temperature for lice growth between 12 14 c critical si was approximately 0 025 applying a linear as opposed to quadratic relationship between temperature and population development rates did not alter the minimum critical si level but led to elevated eigenvalues at high temperatures not shown 3 2 multi site metapopulations when total or mean site influx sum of self and external infection rates was held fixed our investigations of multi site networks with randomly generated connectivity matrices found no impact of increasing the number of sites and only minor fluctuations in network eigenvalue in response to altering the distribution of connectivity values between sites results are not shown as the plots are essentially identical to fig 3 only by changing the total or mean connectivity between sites equivalent to altering si value for the single site scenario was a change in eigenvalue seen fig 4 shows eigenvalues for a 12 site metapopulation connected using a connectivity matrix derived from larval dispersal simulations eigenvalues were calculated for the metapopulation indicating population growth for the network at all temperatures greater than 6 c applying a linear scaling factor to the reproductive output of all sites indicated that a reduction in reproductive output to around 1 10th to 1 20th of its original value was required to prevent an increasing population of lice at the optimum temperature for growth fig 5 shows the impact of removing specific sites on the overall eigenvalue of the connected metapopulation for the specific example network used above our results suggested that it is not possible to completely eliminate population growth in this particular metapopulation by site removal alone in general individual sites in the network self infected sufficiently to ensure population growth however substantial reductions c25 were possible through the removal of particular sites removing site 2 or better site 3 in isolation led to a reduction in the eigenvalue removing both sites together gave no benefit above that of removing site 3 alone but additionally removing sites 4 and 5 produced a further modest benefit 3 3 temporal simulations iteration of eq 13 yielded timeseries describing population density of connected networks of sites as expected increasing the average rate of dispersal between sites led to an increasing population growth rate as this increases values c i j and hence the dominant eigenvalue of the bracketed matrix in the equation networks with average values of site influx sum of incoming connections below 0 0075 had population densities which declined over the full simulation while networks above this threshold had population densities which increased over time fig 6 this effect was independent of the number of sites in the network on the condition that average influx remained the same this threshold is very close to that determined visually from plots of eigenvalues for the same population matrices 4 discussion this manuscript has described a model for the description of a connected metapopulation linking representation of population stage structure groner et al 2014 2016 and temperature dependent vital rates angilletta et al 2004 bjørn and finstad 1998 finstad et al 2000 gillooly et al 2001 grimnes and jakobsen 1996 johnson and albright 1991a tucker et al 2000 with population connectivity adams et al 2016 this allowed us to calculate critical self infection values for population persistence at a single site over a range of temperatures and to demonstrate how the results extend to networks of many sites we considered basic management strategies in the form of a percentage reduction in reproductive output and the removal of sites from the system to our knowledge this is the first published study placing results of biophysical transport models for sea lice within the context of critical thresholds for population dynamics in our consideration of an isolated single site we found minimum critical self infection rates of between 0 01 and 0 03 depending on whether settlement was considered to be temperature dependent in addition to attached stage development rates to place this into context if one assumes a constant mortality rate during dispersal of 0 01 hr 1 amundrud and murray 2009 and 40 days to develop to the infective copepodid stage samsing et al 2019 in warm summer water temperatures of 14 c a maximum of around 50 of the released lice would be available for settlement predicted self infection probabilities well above the threshold are frequently observed in models of larval dispersal and indeed were observed in the matrix used here the level of self infection required to ensure population growth is therefore very low relative to the level that may exist in reality explaining why a lice challenge is observed in real site networks although it should be borne in mind that connection probabilities incorporated in population models should incorporate settlement success connection probability is just one way that biophysical models calculate links between sites with some authors instead computing metrics based on time aggregated particle densities in proximity to sites cantrell et al 2018 sandvik et al 2020 in such cases it would be necessary to determine a relationship between infection pressure and inter site connectivity to make use of the results presented here we tested the model using parameters from two independent parameter sources the parameters obtained by revie et al 2005 when fitting a delay differential equation model to farm data and the empirically derived parameters presented by stien et al 2005 our results were very similar for both sets of parameters giving no substantial alteration to the predicted critical minimum self infection level the former parameterisation produced a broader range of temperatures over which population growth would be expected at a given rate of site influx due to the altered balance lice survival between stages the temperature dependence relationships themselves were based on a limited number of data points which may limit the accuracy of our population responses to variation in temperature however the fitted functions are simple and an alteration to the specific detail of the functions is unlikely to qualitatively change the results considered as a whole the models indicate clear potential for exponential population growth is present across a broad range of the temperatures which are suitable for farming salmon extending the model to describe multiple sites was carried out in two stages firstly an exploration of the effects of adding sites varying mean infection pressure per site and redistributing connectivity values between sites to simulate a wide range of network connection scenarios was carried out this demonstrated quite clearly that there was no impact of increasing the number of sites per se rather it was the average total infection pressure on each site equivalent to self infection pressure in the single site case that governed the dynamics this coincides with the results of aldrin et al 2019 that outbreaks are more closely linked to the distance between sites than how many there are as such prediction of population growth at a particular site that is part of a larger network may be handled in the same way as that in an isolated site in a connected network therefore sites with total influx greater than the critical self infection rate for a particular temperature would also be predicted to experience population growth applying the derived population matrices to generate timeseries of abundance instead of eigenvalues yielded very similar results population growth appeared to take place at a slightly lower threshold than that predicted by the eigenvalue calculations though the difference was marginal this demonstrates the applicability of the eigenvalue method in summarising the development of both single and multi site populations the second component of the metapopulation investigation applied a connectivity matrix for 12 sites on the west coast of scotland estimated using a larval dispersal model the levels of connectivity between the sites ensured a prediction of population growth at all temperatures greater than 6 c encompassing the annual temperature range experienced in that locality our calculations showed that reproduction or equivalently connectivity would have to be reduced by at least an order of magnitude to prevent population growth in practice this might be achieved by a range of methods cleaner fish skiftesvik et al 2013 providing steady grazing of lice might be one option while physical barrier technologies such as skirts or snorkels oppedal et al 2017 would be another periodic chemical treatments have a temporary effect of reducing lice numbers but abundances of a connected network of sites will always increase between treatment events if no other management is in place site removal scenarios demonstrated that a reduction in overall population growth rate might be achieved by removal or fallow of well chosen sites in common with previous work adams et al 2015 which used a different model based on delay differential equations the results suggest that sites with the highest influx are the most important for metapopulation growth and the selection of candidate sites for removal should be made on this basis rather than outflux the sum of outgoing connections from a site in our example the highest influx sites were sites 3 and 5 and it was these that had the greatest impact on the metapopulation eigenvalue not site 2 the highest outflux site in this example it was not possible to eliminate population growth achieve a metapopulation eigenvalue less than 1 via site removal alone as the predicted level of self infection and overall influx for almost all the sites was too high nevertheless a 25 reduction in the difference between the baseline eigenvalue and 1 at the optimum lice growth temperature and nearly 33 at 8 c could be significant in efforts to control lice numbers this approach provides a firmer basis for the implementation of management units like the existing farm management areas in scotland code of good practice management group 2011 or management zones in norway guarracino et al 2018 based on specific connectivity thresholds which may be derived geographically using transport models adams et al 2016 such thresholds may vary between areas depending on the local oceanographic conditions temperature and salinity and also between times of the year more detailed investigation of these characteristics using combined biophysical models will be essential if we are to enable ongoing development of the industry in a sustainable manner it may also yield strategies for adaptive management of sites such as shifting firebreaks and variable deployment of physical barriers every locality is different but the presented methods enable analysis and comprehension of the combined impacts of the biophysical processes affecting a particular site or set of sites they contextualise the large body of work investigating larval dispersal of lice between farm sites making a clear distinction between those dispersal pathways which are important to monitor and control and those which are less important finally while the presented methods have direct implications for the management of salmon aquaculture sites they can equally be applied to any scenario involving the control of a connected population network understanding the connectivity and resulting dynamics of these metapopulations can therefore pay great dividends in preventing outbreaks and managing epidemics credit

24757,globally species ranges are shifting in response to climate change for black mangrove avicennia germinans fewer severe freeze events in a warming climate facilitate poleward range expansion into temperate coastal salt marshes however propagules that disperse into marshes encounter biotic interactions e g predation that affect their survival and subsequent forest development to better understand the relative roles of climate predation and propagule dispersal in shaping a germinans range expansion we developed a stage based population model that tested forest stand establishment and survival under differing scenarios of freeze regime predation pressure and propagule dispersal predation parameters were developed from a field experiment that tested propagule density predation intensity relationships for purple marsh crab sesarma reticulatum which showed proportional propagule consumption decreased with increased propagule density model outcomes demonstrated all measures of mangrove stand development and regeneration decreased with increased freeze and predation intensities modulated by propagule dispersal density and frequency regenerating stands were more likely to recover from freezes under a reduced freeze regime compared to a historical freeze regime but moderate and high predation intensities hindered stand development and recovery across freeze regimes maintaining a regenerating stand generally required recurring dispersal events while several studies have investigated the individual effects of freezes predation pressure and dispersal on mangrove ranges our model is the first effort of which we are aware that quantifies the combined effects of all three controls the model can thus serve as a tool for understanding patterns of a germinans range

al 2011 pecl et al 2017 walther et al 2002 changes primarily occur where warming temperatures support range shifts at poleward and elevational range limits in the northern hemisphere species boundaries have shifted poleward by an average 6 1 km or higher in elevation by 6 1 m per decade parmesan 2006 parmesan and yohe 2003 yet even as populations of species respond to a changing climate they do so in the context of biotic interactions and dispersal mechanisms that aid or restrict boundary shifts biotic interactions together with environmental conditions define a species niche space and determine whether species survival exceeds mortality while dispersal mechanisms determine whether a species can reach environments within its ecological niche boulangeat et al 2012 holt 2009 hutchinson 1957 sexton et al 2009 soberon and peterson 2005 wiens 2011 accounting for the relative contributions of all three ecological factors is critical for predicting whether species can adjust their ranges to maintain sustainable populations under a changing climate one of the most visible examples of a climate driven range shift is the poleward expansion of mangrove forests cavanaugh et al 2018 2014 osland et al 2018 2017a 2013 saintilan et al 2014 mangroves which are sensitive to freeze events and generally restricted to latitudes with tropical and subtropical climates have responded to past periods of warming and cooling via range expansion and contraction osland et al 2017a during the warm climate of the eocene avicennia were present in arctic siberia above 72 n suan et al 2017 and during the global cooling of the pleistocene mangrove populations retreated toward the equator sherrod and mcmillan 1985 globally latitudinal limits of mangroves are correlated with the winter positions of the 20 c sea surface temperature isotherm duke et al 1998 on a regional scale frequency and intensity of severe freezes and or precipitation minima mark range limits cavanaugh et al 2014 osland et al 2017b saintilan et al 2014 the occurrence of fewer severe freezes at poleward range limits in recent decades has facilitated mangrove encroachment into temperate coastal regions dominated by salt marsh osland et al 2019 2013 however rates at which mangrove forests are expanding vary across regions suggesting that non climatic factors such as biotic interactions and propagule dispersal mediate expansion at poleward range limits cavanaugh et al 2018 studies of mangrove expansion have focused on encroachment at the interface of established forest and salt marsh guo et al 2013 mckee and rooth 2008 patterson et al 1993 rogers et al 2005 simpson et al 2013 yando et al 2016 indeed the majority of mangrove propagules drop in the immediate vicinity of parent trees promoting radiating patterns of encroachment into salt marsh adjacent to established forest duke 2001 sousa et al 2007 however mangroves also depend on long distance dispersal to expand their ranges most mangroves produce buoyant propagules capable of traveling far distances carried by tides ocean currents and storm surges to substrate uninhabited by mangroves clarke 1993 duke et al 1998 van der stocken et al 2019 van der stocken and menemenlis 2017 when propagules disperse into salt marsh biotic interactions ranging from facilitative to competitive between mangrove seedlings and salt marsh plants

predation and herbivory by salt marsh fauna restricting mangrove establishment in salt marshes with favorable abiotic conditions langston et al 2017a patterson et al 1997 peterson and bell 2018 this study examined the effects of climate freeze regime biotic control propagule predation and propagule dispersal on the establishment of avicennia germinans black mangrove into salt marsh along the big bend coast of florida usa fig 1 the big bend is a relatively undeveloped region that marks the northernmost limit of a germinans on florida s west coast the largest populations of a germinans occur in cedar key and waccasassa bay and near anclote key small stands and individuals are scattered in adjacent salt marshes propagules seedlings and saplings can be found in salt marshes several kilometers from larger regenerating stands between 1980 and 2015 mangrove coverage in the big bend expanded north by 0 04 km y 1 and has increased by 10 100 within latitudinal zones spanning the region giri et al 2016 freeze regime i e freeze severity and frequency is the climatic control restricting poleward range expansion of a germinans along the big bend moderate freezes occur most years generally causing leaf damage from which trees can recover on the rare occasion a moderate freeze may cause low rates of mortality for seedlings saplings and young trees osland et al 2015 severe freeze events cause varying rates of damage and mortality to a germinans populations depending on freeze temperature and frequency cavanaugh et al 2014 osland et al 2019 osland et al 2015 all life stages from propagule to old tree are vulnerable to severe freezes pickens and hester 2011 from 1895 to 1996 17 severe freezes occurred along the coast of the southeastern us including a set of consecutive severe freezes multiple severe freezes occurring in two or more consecutive years which are especially damaging to a germinans populations osland et al 2017a stevens et al 2006 historically one set of consecutive severe freezes occurs every hundred years stevens et al 2006 the last set of consecutive severe freezes in the southeast occurred in the 1980s and coverage of a germinans has increased steadily since osland et al 2013 stevens et al 2006 as a germinans encroaches into temperate salt marshes in the big bend it faces local predation pressure by fauna namely sesarma species grapsidae which are common and abundant in salt marshes along the eastern and southeastern coasts of the us bertness et al 2009 subrahmanyam et al 1976 in previous studies we found that propagule predation by s reticulatum purple marsh crab was the predominant control on a germinans colonization in a big bend salt marsh as well as on islands of freshwater forest converting to salt marsh when abiotic conditions were favorable and propagule density was low 10 m 2 langston et al 2017a 2017b propagule predation is routinely documented in mangrove forests in tropical climates as a prevalent biotic control on avicennia populations bosire et al 2005 mcguinness 1997 smith et al 1989 souza and sampaio 2011 van nedervelde et al 2015 however predation as a biotic control restricting poleward range expansion of a germinans into salt marsh has been largely overlooked to help fill this gap we developed a stage based population model to evaluate the relative effects of freeze regime predation and propagule dispersal on a germinans expansion into salt marshes along the big bend and as a generalizable tool for application elsewhere while quantifying the relative effects of freezes predation and dispersal would be most accurately quantified through field experiments and long term field observations these endeavors would require experiments spanning large spatial and temporal scales 100s of kilometers over decades to centuries modeling approaches based on both empirical and mechanistic understanding of ecosystem components can be used to gain insight about system dynamics when direct observation and experimentation are unfeasible e g brown et al 2013 gustafson 2013 for example models are especially useful for predicting long term trends such as ecological succession population growth and species range shifts in response to large scale or high intensity drivers of change e g burton et al 2010 langston et al 2020 park et al 2019 pearlstine et al 1985 while no model can perfectly capture real life dynamics a well formulated model can be a useful tool for testing hypotheses and predicting outcomes jørgensen 1994 numerous models have been used to evaluate environmental factors e g climate nutrients light water resources or biotic factors e g inter and intraspecific competition on population dynamics and distributions of mangroves berger and hildenbrandt 2000 chen and twilley 1998 osland et al 2013 park et al 2019 record et al 2013 among the existing population models are two stage based models developed for other avicennia species clarke 1995 delgado et al 1999 however we are unaware of any modeling efforts that explicitly account for climatic biotic and dispersal controls on a germinans establishment here we present results of a stage based model that combines episodic freeze and propagule dispersal events with predation rates informed by field experimentation and life table probabilities for a germinans model results demonstrate the interactive effects of freezes predation and dispersal on the local establishment of mangrove forests in salt marsh which can inform regional patterns and rates of poleward mangrove expansion along the big bend moreover our model serves as a generalizable tool that can be parameterized to predict regional population responses of other plant species to abiotic and biotic stressors and dispersal mechanisms 2 methods 2 1 field experiment to parameterize predation in the model we conducted a field experiment investigating the relationship between propagule dispersal density and predation intensity in salt marshes not adjacent to stands of a germinans the experiment was conducted in november 2016 in a salt marsh dominated by juncus roemarianus black needlerush at the withlacoochee gulf preserve in yankeetown fl propagules were collected from nearby cedar key fl we set out propagules in three density treatments 1 25 and 100 m 2 and recorded propagule mortality from predation for 23 days six replicates of each density treatment were randomly placed in a grid of 3 6 plots in the marsh each plot consisted of nine 1 m2 subplots arranged in a square with the center subplot as the experimental unit and surrounding subplots serving as buffers between the experimental unit and the surrounding marsh matrix fig 2 all propagules in the 1 m 2 treatment plots were tethered to the marsh surface using 20 cm strands of monofilament tied to landscape stakes 10 propagules in each 25 and 100 m 2 plots were tethered the remaining propagules were scattered randomly within the subplots only propagules in the center subplots were monitored and they were marked with an x to distinguish them from propagules in buffer subplots propagules were monitored on days 1 through 5 7 9 11 14 and 23 during monitoring events we counted all propagules in center subplots and recorded how many were viable i e showed no visible signs of damage or decay we assumed missing tethered and non tethered propagules were eaten to quantify s reticulatum density we counted burrows within each center subplot using the description in bertness et al 2009 we conceptually equated propagule dispersal with mast seeding events and evaluated the functional response of s reticulatum to propagule density as described by the predator satiation hypothesis psh holling 1959a 1959b we hypothesized that s reticulatum behavior would be consistent with a type ii functional response i e we expected s reticulatum to consume all propagules when propagule density was low and consume a decreasing portion under increased propagule densities data from the non caged treatment 10 propagules m 2 reported in langston et al 2017a were included in the data analysis as an additional treatment density we fit type i ii and iii psh responses to our results using a levenberg marquardt nonlinear least squares algorithm morin 1999 in r v 3 4 0 3 4 4 r core team 2018 2 2 model 2 2 1 model structure we developed a stage based population model quantifying the combined effects of freeze intensity and frequency predation intensity and propagule dispersal density and frequency on a germinans forest stand development the model tracked densities of seven life stages on an annual time step for 100 years fig 3 as propagules grew into trees probabilities of remaining in the same life stage developing into the next life stage succumbing to miscellaneous causes of mortality crowding and propagule production determined rates of stand development as modified by the effects of freeze regime predation and propagule dispersal the spatial extent of the model was not geographically explicit rather the model domain represented a generic 100 m2 area of habitable salt marsh i e low elevation marsh with sufficient precipitation and tidal inundation allowing us to focus on the relative roles of climate predation and dispersal freeze regimes reflected the historical regime of the past 100 years and a hypothetical regime of reduced frequency driven by climate warming predation was informed by field data on s reticulatum densities and propagule predation rates propagule dispersal densities and frequencies represented variation in dispersal with respect to distance from the parent population and storm driven dispersal events the model was developed in r v 3 4 0 3 4 4 r core team 2018 using the simecol package petzoldt and rinke 2007 2 2 2 state variables the model included densities of seven life stages of a germinans propagule seedling with cotyledons seedling without cotyledons sapling young tree mid age tree and old tree fig 3 table 1 these life stages followed those used in a population model of a marina developed by clarke 1995 propagules either dispersed into the model domain or were produced by trees that developed within the model population over time seedlings with cotyledons represented newly established seedlings with attached cotyledons based on field observations viable propagules that settle onto substrate reach this stage within the same year seedlings without cotyledons represented a later seedling stage that can persist for multiple time steps saplings represented individuals that developed from seedlings but had not reached reproductive maturity young mid age and old trees produced propagules life stages were defined by differences in annual probabilities of developing into the next life stage recruiting remaining in the same life stage remaining mortality density maxima and propagule production rather than by size i e height biomass 2 2 3 life stage probabilities because stage based models for a germinans are absent in the literature we developed life stage probabilities using stage based models for a marina and a bicolor clarke 1995 delgado et al 1999 we modified probabilities from these studies based on field observations from previous studies on a germinans and to create separate probabilities of mortality from freeze events and predation changes in life stage densities were calculated for each time step using the general equation 1 d x i d t x i r i x i 1 m i 1 where xi is the population density of life stage i ri is the probability of individuals remaining in that life stage xi 1 is the population density of the previous life stage and mi 1 is the probability of individuals from the previous life stage recruiting to the next life stage no propagules or seedling with cotyledons from the previous time step remained in the next they either recruited to the next life stage or died propagules recruited to seedlings with cotyledons during the same time step in which they dispersed into the model domain or were produced by trees in the model population the probability of mortality from miscellaneous causes i e causes other than crowding freezes or predation was the difference of 1 ri mi 1 miscellaneous causes of mortality accounted for rot desiccation uprooting herbivory on older seedlings saplings and trees competition with salt marsh plants and local disturbances such as lightning because we assumed the model domain represented favorable conditions for establishment mortality from miscellaneous causes was relatively low table 1 this category also included propagule loss from dispersal out of the model domain mortality probabilities from crowding i e density maxima freeze events and predation were applied after first applying eq 1 2 2 4 density maxima density maxima were applied to all life stages except propagules to account for mortality from crowding and shading table 1 seedling densities of avicennia species range from 140 to 330 m 2 jimenez et al 1985 we set a maximum density of 150 m 2 100 m 2 for seedlings with cotyledons and 50 m 2 for seedlings without cotyledons assuming the density threshold would be higher for younger seedlings maximum density for saplings was 0 34 m 2 consistent with the mean sapling density from a 6 year study of a bicolor delgado et al 1999 we set a maximum tree density of 0 21 m 2 tree density data for a germinans stands in the southeastern us are lacking in the literature hence our estimate is similar to tree densities reported for a germinans dominated stands in french guiana which ranged from 0 05 0 2 m 2 proisy et al 2000 we divided tree density equally among tree stages 0 07 m 2 for young mid age and old trees however total tree density did not exceed 0 1 m 2 in our model simulations consistent with the density at which a marina trees stabilized in the stage based model by clarke 1995 2 2 5 freeze regimes we modeled three regimes of freeze frequency and intensity historical reduced and none fig 3 table 1 historical and reduced freeze regimes included moderate severe and consecutive severe freeze events modeled as stochastic events that caused varying rates of mortality across life stages only one freeze event occurred in a given time step moderate freezes represented events in which temperatures range between 0 c and 6 5 c for under 24 hours pickens and hester 2011 though moderate freezes generally cause leaf damage from which individuals can recover on rare occasions they can cause low rates of mortality for older seedlings and shorter trees which we assumed to be equivalent to saplings and young trees osland et al 2015 pickens and hester 2011 severe freezes represented events in which temperatures reach 6 5 c for at least 24 hours causing mortality to non propagule life stages and preventing regeneration in the subsequent year pickens and hester 2011 stevens et al 2006 consecutive severe freezes represented multiple severe freezes occurring in two or more consecutive years these events caused 98 mortality across all non propagule life stages consistent with reported mortality from consecutive freezes along the big bend in the 1980s montague and odum 1997 the historical freeze regime reflected historical climate conditions along the big bend as derived from published studies table 1 and included 15 moderate freezes 14 severe freezes and a single set of consecutive severe freezes over a period of 100 years for simplicity consecutive severe freezes were modeled as a single event occurring in one time step the reduced freeze regime included 8 moderate and 8 severe freeze events for both historical and reduced freeze regimes the timing of freezes was randomized and ten unique freeze time series were generated for each to evaluate the effects of both freeze intensity and timing on different developmental stages of the forest stand 2 2 6 predation we used the ratio of crabs to propagules as a relative measure of crab density to test different predation intensities ranging from none 0 1 low 0 1 1 moderate 0 5 1 and high 1 1 using a predator to prey ratio is recommended when evaluating the functional response of a predator which occurs on short time scales of minutes or hours and the effect of predation on prey population dynamics which occurs over years arditi and ginzburg 1989 berryman 1992 ratios were calculated from field experiment results and previously collected field data propagule mortality probabilities from predation were calculated using a non linear least squares regression of propagules consumed versus crab to propagule ratios 2 p s 1 1 e a x where ps is the probability of propagule mortality from predation by s reticulatum a is the regression coefficient predation rate and x is the ratio of crabs to propagules predation intensity was held constant within each predation scenario during previous field experiments langston et al 2017a and unpublished data we observed that seedlings with cotyledons were also vulnerable to predation though less so than propagules accordingly we also applied the predation equation to seedlings with cotyledons using a predation coefficient half that of the predation coefficient used for propagules fig 3 2 2 7 propagule dispersal and production propagule density at each time step was calculated as 3 x p p d p y p m p o where xp is total propagule density pd is the density of propagules dispersing into the model domain and py pm and po are propagule densities produced by young mid age and old trees within the model population fig 3 three scenarios of propagule dispersal density were applied low 1 m 2 medium 10 m 2 and high 100 m 2 and each was modeled at three dispersal frequencies once first time step only low 10 dispersal events randomly occurring over 100 years and high annual dispersal low and medium dispersal densities at infrequent frequencies represented propagule delivery by tides and currents from non adjacent mangrove forests high dispersal density at infrequent frequencies reflected pulse events such as storms which might deliver high densities of propagules to a new location high frequency high density scenarios represented tidal delivery from a neighboring forest in close proximity rates of propagule production were based on modeled rates and field measurements of a marina clarke 1995 clarke 1992 and varied by tree stage propagule production was modeled as a uniform random process during each time step with old trees able to produce more propagules 5300 than mid age trees 3000 which could produce more than young trees 100 2 2 8 model scenarios forest stand development depended on an initial dispersal density of propagules densities of the other life stages developed over time from propagule dispersal events and propagule production within the population fig 3 scenarios varied by freeze regime historical reduced no freezes predation pressure 0 0 1 0 5 and 1 crab propagule 1 dispersal frequency 0 01 0 1 and 1 yr 1 and dispersal density 1 10 100 propagules m 2 for a total of 108 scenarios fig 3 table 1 these scenarios represent a broad range of probable conditions in salt marshes along the big bend into which propagules could disperse for each scenario we developed 10 unique time series of freeze events generated from a uniform random distribution for the historical and reduced freeze regimes for each freeze time series we ran the model 1000 times allowing dispersal timing and rates of propagule production to vary stochastically also based on uniform distributions according to the frequencies described above this yielded a total of 1 080 000 simulations 108 scenarios 10 freeze time series 1000 dispersal and propagule production time series results for each of the 108 scenarios were summarized using three population metrics 1 mean probability of a regenerating stand developing i e probability of tree density 0 2 mean peak tree density over time young mid age and old trees combined and 3 mean number of years with a regenerating stand this combination of metrics described the probability of a stand sustaining itself via propagule production maximum tree density reached over 100 years and how long a regenerating stand persisted under each modeled scenario respectively 2 2 9 sensitivity analysis finally we conducted a sensitivity analysis sa to identify model sensitivity to the 25 parameters summarized in table 1 rather than testing the model one parameter at a time we evaluated model sensitivity by grouping together parameters associated with specific population control processes including miscellaneous mortality mm propagule production pp density maxima dm predation mortality pm and mortality from freeze intensities fm as well as a best and worst case scenario across parameters table 2 for all parameter sets relevant parameter values within each group were modified 20 of original values and all other parameters maintained their original values the best and worst case parameter sets consisted of simultaneously changing all parameters by 20 to favor or hinder population development respectively this approach of bundling parameters allowed us to parsimoniously identify the population control processes that had the greatest influence on model results model sensitivity was assessed for each primary model output 3 results 3 1 field experiment percent of propagules consumed during the field experiment differed between density treatments f2 15 228 2 p value 0 001 as expected all propagules in 1 m 2 plots were consumed and more propagules in 25 m 2 plots were consumed than in 100 m 2 plots percent of viable propagules decreased over time more slowly at higher propagule densities fig 4 a by day 23 more than half 55 3 7 sd of propagules in 25 m 2 plots and a quarter 25 11 2 sd of propagules in 100 m 2 plots were absent or partially depredated as expected the relationship between predation and propagule density was best described by a type ii functional response r2 0 96 fig 4b however a type iii response in which peak consumption occurs at an intermediate density fit nearly as well r2 0 95 a type i response in which there is no relationship between predation intensity and propagule density was the poorest fit r2 0 72 percent of propagules consumed increased rapidly with greater crab to propagule ratios fig 4c the coefficient from the regression equation that best fit the data was used as the predation coefficient a in eq 2 to quantify predation intensity in the population model table 1 3 2 model we first present four selected model runs to illustrate the range of population responses to freezes predation and dispersal fig 5 each example highlights the mean 1 sd results for a single freeze time series driven by stochastic differences in dispersal timing and rates of propagule production across 1000 runs figure 5a shows results for a population subjected to a historical freeze regime no predation and an initial high density 100 m 2 dispersal event the mean population reached a total density of 13 7 m 2 including all life stages and tree density young mid age and old of 0 07 m 2 before being decimated by consecutive and individual severe freezes that occurred between years 25 and 30 from which the population did not recover fig 5a in contrast a population subjected to a reduced freeze regime and mild predation intensity 0 1 crab propagule and supported by infrequent 0 1 y 1 low density 1 m 2 dispersal events survived all severe freeze events and reached a mean total peak density of 11 2 m 2 including a tree density of 0 05 m 2 by year 100 though with considerable variance in propagule and seedling densities fig 5b under a reduced freeze regime and moderate predation intensity 0 5 crab propagule a population receiving infrequent medium density 10 m 2 deliveries of propagules had a mean total density of 0 17 m 2 and was unable to develop into a regenerating stand i e life stages did not advance beyond sapling fig 5c finally a population subjected to high predation intensity 1 crab propagule no freezes and annual high density 100 m 2 dispersal events developed into a low density regenerating stand peak total density of 1 63 m 2 tree density 0 05 m 2 fig 5d among all 108 scenarios 57 always supported the development of a regenerating forest stand probability 1 11 sometimes did 0 probability 1 and 40 never did probability 0 fig 6 a for these scenarios in which regenerating forests always or sometimes developed peak tree density fig 6b and mean number of years the stand supported regenerating trees fig 6c varied with respect to all three controls under a historical freeze regime i e bottom three rows in all panels of fig 6 22 out of 36 scenarios could support regenerating stands fig 6a with likelihoods ranging from very low to 100 in these regenerating stands mean peak tree density ranged from 0 008 to 0 059 m 2 and trees were present for 1 to 91 9 years mean 63 3 out of 100 simulated years fig 6b c stands did not develop under any predation intensity when dispersal was limited to a single low density 1 m 2 event when predation intensity was moderate 0 5 at least infrequent dispersal events 0 1 y 1 of medium density 10 m 2 were required for a population to become a regenerating stand scenarios with a historical freeze regime and high predation intensity had the least favorable conditions of the 108 scenarios specifically annual high density 100 m 2 dispersal events were required for a population to become a regenerating stand under this combination of biotic and abiotic constraints under a reduced freeze regime fig 6 middle three rows regenerating stands developed under the same scenarios as under a historical freeze regime but the probability of developing into a regenerating stand in scenarios with a single dispersal event or infrequent dispersal events was higher fig 6a among regenerating stands tree densities ranged from 0 01 to 0 076 m 2 and were present for 1 to 96 years mean 83 7 fig 6b c in scenarios with no freezes fig 6 top three rows regenerating stands developed in 24 out of 36 scenarios fig 6a regenerating stands always developed when predation intensity was 0 these scenarios provided the most favorable conditions for mangrove population development without freezes or predation tree densities ranged from 0 066 to 0 082 m 2 and were present for 84 to 96 years mean 93 7 fig 6b c under mild predation intensity 0 1 regenerating stands did not develop when dispersal was limited to an initial low density event under moderate predation intensity 0 5 a regenerating population developed from annual dispersal at all propagule densities tree density was lowest 0 01 m 2 under moderate predation with annual low density dispersal events in scenarios of high predation intensity the population required annual high density dispersal events to support regenerating trees it reached a peak tree density of 0 031 m 2 that was present for 84 of 100 simulation years spatial interpretations of stand densities that developed under these modeled scenarios illustrate how canopy layers and areal coverage of life stage densities would appear in the field fig 7 for example a mangrove stand that developed within a 100 m2 area under the most favorable conditions i e top left cell in fig 6 would become a closed canopy stand with all life stages occupying canopy layers by year 100 fig 7a for comparison visualizations of mangrove stands from the scenarios presented in fig 5b d are included in fig 7b d because the model is not spatially explicit and does not include sizes or heights of life stages the spatial interpretations in fig 7 are for illustrative purposes only sensitivity analysis revealed that 20 differences in parameter values affected model outcomes variably as a function of target model output population control process and specific model scenario changes in the distribution of scenarios always sometimes or never developing regenerating stands for sa parameter sets compared to the original parameter set were relatively small and aligned with expected directions of change i e increased probabilities for parameter sets that decreased mortality and vice versa fig 8 a shifts in successful regeneration were smallest under reduced density maxima parameters dm 20 which showed no change and largest for changes in predation mortality pm parameters which yielded 7 additional scenarios with 100 probability and 4 additional scenarios with 0 probability for pm 20 and pm 20 respectively for the best case parameter set there were 11 additional scenarios with 100 probability an increase of 19 and the worst case parameter set had 9 additional scenarios with 0 probability an increase of 22 across all scenarios mean peak tree density was most sensitive to density maxima parameters increasing and decreasing by 18 under dm 20 and dm 20 respectively and least sensitive to propagule production pp parameters 1 change fig 8b best and worst case parameter sets caused a 53 increase and 34 decrease in peak tree density respectively the number of years a regenerating stand was present was most sensitive to predation mortality pm parameters increasing by 10 and decreasing by 8 under pm 20 and pm 20 respectively but insensitive to both propagule production pp and density maxima dm parameters 1 change fig 8c best and worst case parameter sets yielded a 25 increase and 16 decrease respectively in mean number of years with a regenerating stand variation in sa outcomes illustrated by the error bars in fig 8b c was driven by scenario specific responses to changes in parameters summarized in the appendix the greatest sensitivity was for scenarios that converted among always sometimes and never supporting regenerating populations with subsequently large effects on peak tree density and years with a regenerating stand appendix 4 discussion 4 1 biotic interactions quantifying propagule predation the relationship between predation and propagule density suggests that extant densities of s reticulatum in the big bend region can consume only a limited number of propagules from when they settle onto substrate to when they establish as seedlings fig 4a typically propagules either succumb to mortality or establish within 7 to 21 days once they are stranded on substrate mckee 1995 osborne and smith 1990 patterson et al 1997 at a low propagule density 1 m 2 s reticulatum were able to consume all available propagules during the experiment within 23 days consistent with a previous study in which s reticulatum depredated 99 of propagules at a low density 10 m 2 in 12 days in big bend salt marsh langston et al 2017a assuming long distance dispersal generally delivers a germinans propagules in low densities clarke 1993 nathan et al 2008 nathan and casagrandi 2004 most propagules dispersing into salt marsh are likely to be depredated in most years where s reticulatum or other predators exhibiting type ii or type iii responses are present at higher propagule densities s reticulatum may either be satiated before all propagules are consumed or not have enough time to consume all propagules before they establish fig 4b holling 1959a b propagule survival and subsequent forest stand establishment thus likely depend on occasional high density dispersal events by storms or by tides and currents repeatedly delivering propagules to the same area of marsh within a season peterson and bell 2012 van der stocken et al 2019 in this way the ability of mangroves to produce high densities of propagules adapted for long distance dispersal may offer similar evolutionary benefits as mast seeding when high density dispersal events synchronize delivery of propagules from many individuals to an area populated by a predator some propagules can escape predation potentially initiating a new forest stand critically in settings where even a single propagule survives to reproductive maturity which can occur in as few as 5 years clarke 1995 subsequent propagule production supports both local stand expansion and the potential for additional distal colonization 4 2 biotic abiotic interactions connecting freezes predation and dispersal our model results demonstrated that freezes predation and dispersal were important population controls individually and collectively on a germinans stand development freezes particularly single and consecutive severe freezes were pulse disturbances that caused sporadic drops in overall population density fig 5 predation was a constant stressor on propagules and young seedlings in the model population reducing their probability of recruiting to later life stages when both freezes and predation acted on the model population they exacerbated the individual stress of each control on stand development including the probability of regeneration tree density and stand duration fig 6 dispersal events moderated freeze and predation intensities by delivering pulses of propagules that aided recovery from freezes and increased the density of propagules available for recruitment historically severe freeze events have caused intermittent mortality of a germinans and suppressed propagule production along the big bend montague and odum 1997 pickens and hester 2011 stevens et al 2006 the series of consecutive severe freezes in the 1980s caused 98 mortality to mangrove stands in cedar key fl and a recent single severe freeze in 2018 caused mangrove mortality across the southeastern us ranging from 4 75 depending on local minimum freeze temperature montague and odum 1997 osland et al 2019 our model results demonstrated that single and consecutive severe freezes that occurred under the historical freeze regime drastically reduced population density the frequency of repeated severe freezes limited life stage development and recovering stand density without a large propagule supply or dispersal events following severe freezes a stand could not establish even without the added stress of predation fig 6 under a reduced freeze regime the population was more likely to survive scenarios with more limited propagule supply and reach greater stand densities that were present for more years longer time periods between freeze events allows a population to develop stand complexity i e support different life stages with varying degrees of resistance to freezes figs 5 7 increase stand density and reach a regenerating stage potentially boosting its resilience to future severe freezes osland et al 2015 though a reduced freeze regime creates a favorable environment for a germinans expansion on a regional scale successful establishment of individual populations also depends on local conditions including biotic interactions cavanaugh et al 2018 he and silliman 2016 predation was a strong biotic control on the model population increased predation intensity greatly reduced the probabilities of stand regeneration across freeze regimes fig 6 by reducing propagule and seedling supply predation exacerbated the effects of freezes on the model population low intensity predation slowed population recovery from severe freezes indicated by decreased tree density and stand duration figs 5 6 7 whereas high intensity predation generally prevented population recovery from severe freezes we expect predation intensity across big bend salt marshes to vary depending on local densities of propagule predators relative to propagule supply which would in turn influence patterns and rates of mangrove expansion within the region salt marsh invertebrates such as s reticulatum tend to have spatially and seasonally patchy distributions dictated by temperature tidal cycle soil and local flora and fauna composition evin and talley 2002 rader 1984 the few reported propagule predation rates in the region range from low to high langston et al 2017a patterson et al 1997 peterson and bell 2018 hence our parameters for predation by s reticulatum were representative of predation by a generic predator or suite of predators exhibiting type ii or type iii responses across a density gradient this approach can easily be modified for other specific salt marsh fauna via additional field studies avicennia germinans relies on passive propagule dispersal to expand into new locations within its ecological niche higgins and richardson 1999 nathan et al 2008 sousa et al 2007 van der stocken et al 2019 van der stocken and menemenlis 2017 our model demonstrated that propagule dispersal was also critical in moderating climate and predation controls on a population establishing in a new location fig 6 in other words the model population s resilience to freezes and predation depended on propagule dispersal density and frequency our results show that populations of a germinans supported by frequent high density dispersal events have the best chance of establishing in salt marsh under all freeze and predation scenarios suggesting that mangrove expansion most often occurs via dispersal from neighboring regenerating stands single or infrequent low density dispersal events into big bend salt marshes i e long distance dispersal via tides and ocean currents are less likely to initiate a regenerating stand especially when subject to the combined effects of freezes and predation however even if low density dispersal rarely creates new mangrove stands it is still a viable means of population expansion in fact long distance propagule dispersal has played a critical role in establishing global mangrove distributions lo et al 2014 nettel and dodd 2007 we found single or infrequent high density propagule dispersal i e dispersal via storm surge would likely be sufficient to establish a new stand depending on local predation pressure fig 6 storm surge has been recognized as a dispersal mechanism shaping spatial patterns of mangroves in south florida jiang et al 2014 2012 given that increased frequency and intensity of coastal storms is expected due to climate change storm surge may become an increasingly important mechanism for a germinans expansion not only in terms of propagule delivery to new locations but also in providing large densities of propagules that can withstand high rates of predation and develop into stands resilient to severe freeze events 4 3 model assumptions and sensitivity the goal of this work was to create a relatively simple population model to better understand the individual and interactive effects of freezes predation and dispersal on a germinans expansion in big bend salt marshes to maintain model simplicity and focus on the interactive effects of freezes predation and dispersal we assumed a salt marsh setting that otherwise met environmental ecological and physiological requirements for a germinans survival we excluded other stochastic climatic events like storms and droughts as causes of mortality we referenced storms only as mechanisms for delivering high densities of propagules to the model domain since tropical storms are known to damage or destroy stands of mangroves in florida and the caribbean cahoon et al 2003 smith et al 1994 smith et al 2009 and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency due to climate change excluding them as a source of mortality potentially overestimates modeled probabilities of a germinans establishment droughts as drivers of hypersaline conditions are less likely to be a major source of mortality along the big bend which is less vulnerable to changing rainfall regimes than freeze regimes resulting from climate change osland et al 2016 we also did not explicitly model biotic interactions between mangroves and salt marsh plants instead positive effects e g propagule trapping were implied in the probability of propagule recruitment and negative effects e g competition were implied in miscellaneous mortality rates for propagules and seedlings guo et al 2013 mckee et al 2007 peterson and bell 2012 while relatively simple our model still had 25 parameters table 1 with values derived from the literature and the field study presented here understanding model sensitivity to these parameters is important both for interpreting results and guiding future research into parameters associated with the greatest sensitivity cariboni et al 2007 we found that different model outputs were more or less sensitive to parameter sets associated with different ecological processes for example the likelihood of developing a regenerating forest was most sensitive to variation in parameters describing propagule predation i e the two predation coefficients in table 1 followed by parameters associated with miscellaneous mortality seven parameters controlling mortality unrelated to crowding freezing or predation at each life stage fig 8a these results highlight the role of predation pressure as a primary filter for forest establishment langston et al 2017a osborne and smith 1990 smith et al 1989 and are reflective of our empirically derived relationship between crab density and proportion of propagules consumed which transitions very rapidly from 0 to 100 fig 4c small changes in this parameter can drive large changes in proportional propagule consumption for a given crab density suggesting that site specific studies should be used to parameterize propagule predation sensitivity to miscellaneous mortality rates even though they were relatively low also motivates further study of how to incorporate this lumped parameter into models that consider mortality from multiple specific causes peak tree densities were also sensitive to miscellaneous mortality but even more so to density maxima six parameters controlling maximum density for each life stage excluding propagules fig 8b and this outcome follows directly from the model structure which limited densities at a fixed ceiling while these density maxima parameters were selected from the literature they were derived from a number of avicennia species as well as a germinans growing in different regions better characterizing a germinans forest structure in the southeastern us remains an important knowledge gap for years that a regenerating forest was present results were most sensitive to predation and miscellaneous mortalities a combination of the likelihood that forests establish at all i e predation mortality and direct mortality across all life stages miscellaneous mortality in general all model outputs were only moderately sensitive to variation in parameters describing freeze mortality likely because freezes while potentially catastrophic are relatively rare compared to the potential for yearly mortality from all other causes for all outputs the model was insensitive to variation in parameters that controlled maximum propagule production likely because stochastic variation from sampling a uniform distribution bounded by 0 and a maximum propagule production value swamped variation driven by relatively small increases or decreases in those maxima finally the parameter sensitivities reported here are likely conservatively large estimates since unique freeze dispersal and propagule production time series were randomly generated for all model runs both original and sa parameter sets which could inflate differences between the two sets of results it is also important to note that figure 8 summarizes sa results across all 108 scenarios representing average differences between base and sa parameter sets for each individual scenario for many scenarios that either always or never developed regenerating stands model outputs were largely insensitive to input parameter variation regardless of which ecological process they represented this is evidenced in the many zero values in the appendix in contrast for scenarios that sometimes developed a regenerating stand as well as those that transitioned between always sometimes and never supporting reproduction differences between original and sa parameter sets could be quite large e g dark red and green entries in the appendix it is in these transitional scenarios where freezes predation and dispersal patterns yield varying ecological outcomes that reducing parameter uncertainty is most critical 4 4 looking ahead a reduced freeze regime appears to be underway along the big bend coast the lack of consecutive severe freezes in the past 30 years and infrequent individual severe freezes are facilitating the poleward expansion of a germinans in the region meanwhile local conditions are dictating the establishment of new stands as rates and patterns of a germinans expansion into salt marsh depend on predation and propagule dispersal our findings highlight the importance of incorporating the individual and collective effects of climate biotic interactions and dispersal into research on poleward mangrove expansion we present this model as an easily parameterized tool that can be combined with future field studies and remote sensing efforts

24757,globally species ranges are shifting in response to climate change for black mangrove avicennia germinans fewer severe freeze events in a warming climate facilitate poleward range expansion into temperate coastal salt marshes however propagules that disperse into marshes encounter biotic interactions e g predation that affect their survival and subsequent forest development to better understand the relative roles of climate predation and propagule dispersal in shaping a germinans range expansion we developed a stage based population model that tested forest stand establishment and survival under differing scenarios of freeze regime predation pressure and propagule dispersal predation parameters were developed from a field experiment that tested propagule density predation intensity relationships for purple marsh crab sesarma reticulatum which showed proportional propagule consumption decreased with increased propagule density model outcomes demonstrated all measures of mangrove stand development and regeneration decreased with increased freeze and predation intensities modulated by propagule dispersal density and frequency regenerating stands were more likely to recover from freezes under a reduced freeze regime compared to a historical freeze regime but moderate and high predation intensities hindered stand development and recovery across freeze regimes maintaining a regenerating stand generally required recurring dispersal events while several studies have investigated the individual effects of freezes predation pressure and dispersal on mangrove ranges our model is the first effort of which we are aware that quantifies the combined effects of all three controls the model can thus serve as a tool for understanding patterns of a germinans range expansion in the big bend and other regions under future warming keywords big bend bottom up coastal forest ecological controls population model top down 1 introduction in recent decades global climate change has driven large scale changes in species distributions across taxonomic groups in terrestrial and marine ecosystems across all major regions of the world e g burrows et al 2011 chen et al 2011 pecl et al 2017 walther et al 2002 changes primarily occur where warming temperatures support range shifts at poleward and elevational range limits in the northern hemisphere species boundaries have shifted poleward by an average 6 1 km or higher in elevation by 6 1 m per decade parmesan 2006 parmesan and yohe 2003 yet even as populations of species respond to a changing climate they do so in the context of biotic interactions and dispersal mechanisms that aid or restrict boundary shifts biotic interactions together with environmental conditions define a species niche space and determine whether species survival exceeds mortality while dispersal mechanisms determine whether a species can reach environments within its ecological niche boulangeat et al 2012 holt 2009 hutchinson 1957 sexton et al 2009 soberon and peterson 2005 wiens 2011 accounting for the relative contributions of all three ecological factors is critical for predicting whether species can adjust their ranges to maintain sustainable populations under a changing climate one of the most visible examples of a climate driven range shift is the poleward expansion of mangrove forests cavanaugh et al 2018 2014 osland et al 2018 2017a 2013 saintilan et al 2014 mangroves which are sensitive to freeze events and generally restricted to latitudes with tropical and subtropical climates have responded to past periods of warming and cooling via range expansion and contraction osland et al 2017a during the warm climate of the eocene avicennia were present in arctic siberia above 72 n suan et al 2017

positions of the 20 c sea surface temperature isotherm duke et al 1998 on a regional scale frequency and intensity of severe freezes and or precipitation minima mark range limits cavanaugh et al 2014 osland et al 2017b saintilan et al 2014 the occurrence of fewer severe freezes at poleward range limits in recent decades has facilitated mangrove encroachment into temperate coastal regions dominated by salt marsh osland et al 2019 2013 however rates at which mangrove forests are expanding vary across regions suggesting that non climatic factors such as biotic interactions and propagule dispersal mediate expansion at poleward range limits cavanaugh et al 2018 studies of mangrove expansion have focused on encroachment at the interface of established forest and salt marsh guo et al 2013 mckee and rooth 2008 patterson et al 1993 rogers et al 2005 simpson et al 2013 yando et al 2016 indeed the majority of mangrove propagules drop in the immediate vicinity of parent trees promoting radiating patterns of encroachment into salt marsh adjacent to established forest duke 2001 sousa et al 2007 however mangroves also depend on long distance dispersal to expand their ranges most mangroves produce buoyant propagules capable of traveling far distances carried by tides ocean currents and storm surges to substrate uninhabited by mangroves clarke 1993 duke et al 1998 van der stocken et al 2019 van der stocken and menemenlis 2017 when propagules disperse into salt marsh biotic interactions ranging from facilitative to competitive between mangrove seedlings and salt marsh plants

study examined the effects of climate freeze regime biotic control propagule predation and propagule dispersal on the establishment of avicennia germinans black mangrove into salt marsh along the big bend coast of florida usa fig 1 the big bend is a relatively undeveloped region that marks the northernmost limit of a germinans on florida s west coast the largest populations of a germinans occur in cedar key and waccasassa bay and near anclote key small stands and individuals are scattered in adjacent salt marshes propagules seedlings and saplings can be found in salt marshes several kilometers from larger regenerating stands between 1980 and 2015 mangrove coverage in the big bend expanded north by 0 04 km y 1 and has increased by 10 100 within latitudinal zones spanning the region giri et al 2016 freeze regime i e freeze severity and frequency is the climatic control restricting poleward range expansion of a germinans along the big bend moderate freezes occur most years generally causing leaf damage from which trees can recover on the rare occasion a moderate freeze may cause low rates of mortality for seedlings saplings and young trees osland et al 2015 severe freeze events cause varying rates of damage and mortality to a germinans populations depending on freeze temperature and frequency cavanaugh et al 2014 osland et al 2019 osland et al 2015 all life stages from propagule to old tree are vulnerable to severe freezes pickens and hester 2011 from 1895 to 1996 17 severe freezes occurred along the coast of the southeastern us including a set of consecutive severe freezes multiple severe freezes occurring in two or more consecutive years which are especially damaging to a germinans populations osland et al 2017a stevens et al 2006 historically one set of consecutive severe freezes occurs every hundred years stevens et al 2006 the last set of consecutive severe freezes in the southeast occurred in the 1980s and coverage of a germinans has increased steadily since osland et al 2013 stevens et al 2006 as a germinans encroaches into temperate salt marshes in the big bend it faces local predation pressure by fauna namely sesarma species grapsidae which are common and abundant in salt marshes along the eastern and southeastern coasts of the us bertness et al 2009 subrahmanyam et al 1976 in previous studies we found that propagule predation by s reticulatum purple marsh crab was the predominant control on a germinans colonization in a big bend salt marsh as well as on islands of freshwater forest converting to salt marsh when abiotic conditions were favorable and propagule density was low 10 m 2 langston et al 2017a 2017b propagule predation is routinely documented in mangrove forests in tropical climates as a prevalent biotic control on avicennia populations bosire et al 2005 mcguinness 1997 smith et al 1989 souza and sampaio 2011 van nedervelde et al 2015 however predation as a biotic control restricting poleward range expansion of a germinans into salt marsh has been largely overlooked to help fill this gap we developed a stage based population model to evaluate the relative effects of freeze regime predation and propagule dispersal on a germinans expansion into salt marshes along the big bend and as a generalizable tool for application elsewhere while quantifying the relative effects of freezes predation and dispersal would be most accurately quantified through field experiments and long term field observations these endeavors would require experiments spanning large spatial and temporal scales 100s of kilometers over decades to centuries modeling approaches based on both empirical and mechanistic understanding of ecosystem components can be used to gain insight about system dynamics when direct observation and experimentation are unfeasible e g brown et al 2013 gustafson 2013 for example models are especially useful for predicting long term trends such as ecological succession population growth and species range shifts in response to large scale or high intensity drivers of change e g burton et al 2010 langston et al 2020 park et al 2019 pearlstine et al 1985 while no model can perfectly capture real life dynamics a well formulated model can be a useful tool for testing hypotheses and predicting outcomes jørgensen 1994 numerous models have been used to evaluate environmental factors e g climate nutrients light water resources or biotic factors e g inter and intraspecific competition on population dynamics and distributions of mangroves berger and hildenbrandt 2000 chen and twilley 1998 osland et al 2013 park et al 2019 record et al 2013 among the existing population models are two stage based models developed for other avicennia species clarke 1995 delgado et al 1999 however we are unaware of any modeling efforts that explicitly account for climatic biotic and dispersal controls on a germinans establishment here we present results of a stage based model that combines episodic freeze and propagule dispersal events with predation rates informed by field experimentation and life table probabilities for a germinans model results demonstrate the interactive effects of freezes predation and dispersal on the local establishment of mangrove forests in salt marsh which can inform regional patterns and rates of poleward mangrove expansion along the big bend moreover our model serves as a generalizable tool that can be parameterized to predict regional population responses of other plant species to abiotic and biotic stressors and dispersal mechanisms 2 methods 2 1 field experiment to parameterize predation in the model we conducted a field experiment investigating the relationship between propagule dispersal density and predation intensity in salt marshes not adjacent to stands of a germinans the experiment was conducted in november 2016 in a salt marsh dominated by juncus roemarianus black needlerush at the withlacoochee gulf preserve in yankeetown fl propagules were collected from nearby cedar key fl we set out propagules in three density treatments 1 25 and 100 m 2 and recorded propagule mortality from predation for 23 days six replicates of each density treatment were randomly placed in a grid of 3 6 plots in the marsh each plot consisted of nine 1 m2 subplots arranged in a square with the center subplot as the experimental unit and surrounding subplots serving as buffers between the experimental unit and the surrounding marsh matrix fig 2 all propagules in the 1 m 2 treatment plots were tethered to the marsh surface using 20 cm strands of monofilament tied to landscape stakes 10 propagules in each 25 and 100 m 2 plots were tethered the remaining propagules were scattered randomly within the subplots only propagules in the center subplots were monitored and they were marked with an x to distinguish them from propagules in buffer subplots propagules were monitored on days 1 through 5 7 9 11 14 and 23 during monitoring events we counted all propagules in center subplots and recorded how many were viable i e showed no visible signs of damage or decay we assumed missing tethered and non tethered propagules were eaten to quantify s reticulatum density we counted burrows within each center subplot using the description in bertness et al 2009 we conceptually equated propagule dispersal with mast seeding events and evaluated the functional response of s reticulatum to propagule density as described by the predator satiation hypothesis psh holling 1959a 1959b we hypothesized that s reticulatum behavior would be consistent with a type ii functional response i e we expected s reticulatum to consume all propagules when propagule density was low and consume a decreasing portion under increased propagule densities data from the non caged treatment 10 propagules m 2 reported in langston et al 2017a were included in the data analysis as an additional treatment density we fit type i ii and iii psh responses to our results using a levenberg marquardt nonlinear least squares algorithm morin 1999 in r v 3 4 0 3 4 4 r core team 2018 2 2 model 2 2 1 model structure we developed a stage based population model quantifying the combined effects of freeze intensity and frequency predation intensity and propagule dispersal density and frequency on a germinans forest stand development the model tracked densities of seven life stages on an annual time step for 100 years fig 3 as propagules grew into trees probabilities of remaining in the same life stage developing into the next life stage succumbing to miscellaneous causes of mortality crowding and propagule production determined rates of stand development as modified by the effects of freeze regime predation and propagule dispersal the spatial extent of the model was not geographically explicit rather the model domain represented a generic 100 m2 area of habitable salt marsh i e low elevation marsh with sufficient precipitation and tidal inundation allowing us to focus on the relative roles of climate predation and dispersal freeze regimes reflected the historical regime of the past 100 years and a hypothetical regime of reduced frequency driven by climate warming predation was informed by field data on s reticulatum densities and propagule predation rates propagule dispersal densities and frequencies represented variation in dispersal with respect to distance from the parent population and storm driven dispersal events the model was developed in r v 3 4 0 3 4 4 r core team 2018 using the simecol package petzoldt and rinke 2007 2 2 2 state variables the model included densities of seven life stages of a germinans propagule seedling with cotyledons seedling without cotyledons sapling young tree mid age tree and old tree fig 3 table 1 these life stages followed those used in a population model of a marina developed by clarke 1995 propagules either dispersed into the model domain or were produced by trees that developed within the model population over time seedlings with cotyledons represented newly established seedlings with attached cotyledons based on field observations viable propagules that settle onto substrate reach this stage within the same year seedlings without cotyledons represented a later seedling stage that can persist for multiple time steps saplings represented individuals that developed from seedlings but had not reached reproductive maturity young mid age and old trees produced propagules life stages were defined by differences in annual probabilities of developing into the next life stage recruiting remaining in the same life stage remaining mortality density maxima and propagule production rather than by size i e height biomass 2 2 3 life stage probabilities because stage based models for a germinans are absent in the literature we developed life stage probabilities using stage based models for a marina and a bicolor clarke 1995 delgado et al 1999 we modified probabilities from these studies based on field observations from previous studies on a germinans and to create separate probabilities of mortality from freeze events and predation changes in life stage densities were calculated for each time step using the general equation 1 d x i d t x i r i x i 1 m i 1 where xi is the population density of life stage i ri is the probability of individuals remaining in that life stage xi 1 is the population density of the previous life stage and mi 1 is the probability of individuals from the previous life stage recruiting to the next life stage no propagules or seedling with cotyledons from the previous time step remained in the next they either recruited to the next life stage or died propagules recruited to seedlings with cotyledons during the same time step in which they dispersed into the model domain or were produced by trees in the model population the probability of mortality from miscellaneous causes i e causes other than crowding freezes or predation was the difference of 1 ri mi 1 miscellaneous causes of mortality accounted for rot desiccation uprooting herbivory on older seedlings saplings and trees competition with salt marsh plants and local disturbances such as lightning because we assumed the model domain represented favorable conditions for establishment mortality from miscellaneous causes was relatively low table 1 this category also included propagule loss from dispersal out of the model domain mortality probabilities from crowding i e density maxima freeze events and predation were applied after first applying eq 1 2 2 4 density maxima density maxima were applied to all life stages except propagules to account for mortality from crowding and shading table 1 seedling densities of avicennia species range from 140 to 330 m 2 jimenez et al 1985 we set a maximum density of 150 m 2 100 m 2 for seedlings with cotyledons and 50 m 2 for seedlings without cotyledons assuming the density threshold would be higher for younger seedlings maximum density for saplings was 0 34 m 2 consistent with the mean sapling density from a 6 year study of a bicolor delgado et al 1999 we set a maximum tree density of 0 21 m 2 tree density data for a germinans stands in the southeastern us are lacking in the literature hence our estimate is similar to tree densities reported for a germinans dominated stands in french guiana which ranged from 0 05 0 2 m 2 proisy et al 2000 we divided tree density equally among tree stages 0 07 m 2 for young mid age and old trees however total tree density did not exceed 0 1 m 2 in our model simulations consistent with the density at which a marina trees stabilized in the stage based model by clarke 1995 2 2 5 freeze regimes we modeled three regimes of freeze frequency and intensity historical reduced and none fig 3 table 1 historical and reduced freeze regimes included moderate severe and consecutive severe freeze events modeled as stochastic events that caused varying rates of mortality across life stages only one freeze event occurred in a given time step moderate freezes represented events in which temperatures range between 0 c and 6 5 c for under 24 hours pickens and hester 2011 though moderate freezes generally cause leaf damage from which individuals can recover on rare occasions they can cause low rates of mortality for older seedlings and shorter trees which we assumed to be equivalent to saplings and young trees osland et al 2015 pickens and hester 2011 severe freezes represented events in which temperatures reach 6 5 c for at least 24 hours causing mortality to non propagule life stages and preventing regeneration in the subsequent year pickens and hester 2011 stevens et al 2006 consecutive severe freezes represented multiple severe freezes occurring in two or more consecutive years these events caused 98 mortality across all non propagule life stages consistent with reported mortality from consecutive freezes along the big bend in the 1980s montague and odum 1997 the historical freeze regime reflected historical climate conditions along the big bend as derived from published studies table 1 and included 15 moderate freezes 14 severe freezes and a single set of consecutive severe freezes over a period of 100 years for simplicity consecutive severe freezes were modeled as a single event occurring in one time step the reduced freeze regime included 8 moderate and 8 severe freeze events for both historical and reduced freeze regimes the timing of freezes was randomized and ten unique freeze time series were generated for each to evaluate the effects of both freeze intensity and timing on different developmental stages of the forest stand 2 2 6 predation we used the ratio of crabs to propagules as a relative measure of crab density to test different predation intensities ranging from none 0 1 low 0 1 1 moderate 0 5 1 and high 1 1 using a predator to prey ratio is recommended when evaluating the functional response of a predator which occurs on short time scales of minutes or hours and the effect of predation on prey population dynamics which occurs over years arditi and ginzburg 1989 berryman 1992 ratios were calculated from field experiment results and previously collected field data propagule mortality probabilities from predation were calculated using a non linear least squares regression of propagules consumed versus crab to propagule ratios 2 p s 1 1 e a x where ps is the probability of propagule mortality from predation by s reticulatum a is the regression coefficient predation rate and x is the ratio of crabs to propagules predation intensity was held constant within each predation scenario during previous field experiments langston et al 2017a and unpublished data we observed that seedlings with cotyledons were also vulnerable to predation though less so than propagules accordingly we also applied the predation equation to seedlings with cotyledons using a predation coefficient half that of the predation coefficient used for propagules fig 3 2 2 7 propagule dispersal and production propagule density at each time step was calculated as 3 x p p d p y p m p o where xp is total propagule density pd is the density of propagules dispersing into the model domain and py pm and po are propagule densities produced by young mid age and old trees within the model population fig 3 three scenarios of propagule dispersal density were applied low 1 m 2 medium 10 m 2 and high 100 m 2 and each was modeled at three dispersal frequencies once first time step only low 10 dispersal events randomly occurring over 100 years and high annual dispersal low and medium dispersal densities at infrequent frequencies represented propagule delivery by tides and currents from non adjacent mangrove forests high dispersal density at infrequent frequencies reflected pulse events such as storms which might deliver high densities of propagules to a new location high frequency high density scenarios represented tidal delivery from a neighboring forest in close proximity rates of propagule production were based on modeled rates and field measurements of a marina clarke 1995 clarke 1992 and varied by tree stage propagule production was modeled as a uniform random process during each time step with old trees able to produce more propagules 5300 than mid age trees 3000 which could produce more than young trees 100 2 2 8 model scenarios forest stand development depended on an initial dispersal density of propagules densities of the other life stages developed over time from propagule dispersal events and propagule production within the population fig 3 scenarios varied by freeze regime historical reduced no freezes predation pressure 0 0 1 0 5 and 1 crab propagule 1 dispersal frequency 0 01 0 1 and 1 yr 1 and dispersal density 1 10 100 propagules m 2 for a total of 108 scenarios fig 3 table 1 these scenarios represent a broad range of probable conditions in salt marshes along the big bend into which propagules could disperse for each scenario we developed 10 unique time series of freeze events generated from a uniform random distribution for the historical and reduced freeze regimes for each freeze time series we ran the model 1000 times allowing dispersal timing and rates of propagule production to vary stochastically also based on uniform distributions according to the frequencies described above this yielded a total of 1 080 000 simulations 108 scenarios 10 freeze time series 1000 dispersal and propagule production time series results for each of the 108 scenarios were summarized using three population metrics 1 mean probability of a regenerating stand developing i e probability of tree density 0 2 mean peak tree density over time young mid age and old trees combined and 3 mean number of years with a regenerating stand this combination of metrics described the probability of a stand sustaining itself via propagule production maximum tree density reached over 100 years and how long a regenerating stand persisted under each modeled scenario respectively 2 2 9 sensitivity analysis finally we conducted a sensitivity analysis sa to identify model sensitivity to the 25 parameters summarized in table 1 rather than testing the model one parameter at a time we evaluated model sensitivity by grouping together parameters associated with specific population control processes including miscellaneous mortality mm propagule production pp density maxima dm predation mortality pm and mortality from freeze intensities fm as well as a best and worst case scenario across parameters table 2 for all parameter sets relevant parameter values within each group were modified 20 of original values and all other parameters maintained their original values the best and worst case parameter sets consisted of simultaneously changing all parameters by 20 to favor or hinder population development respectively this approach of bundling parameters allowed us to parsimoniously identify the population control processes that had the greatest influence on model results model sensitivity was assessed for each primary model output 3 results 3 1 field experiment percent of propagules consumed during the field experiment differed between density treatments f2 15 228 2 p value 0 001 as expected all propagules in 1 m 2 plots were consumed and more propagules in 25 m 2 plots were consumed than in 100 m 2 plots percent of viable propagules decreased over time more slowly at higher propagule densities fig 4 a by day 23 more than half 55 3 7 sd of propagules in 25 m 2 plots and a quarter 25 11 2 sd of propagules in 100 m 2 plots were absent or partially depredated as expected the relationship between predation and propagule density was best described by a type ii functional response r2 0 96 fig 4b however a type iii response in which peak consumption occurs at an intermediate density fit nearly as well r2 0 95 a type i response in which there is no relationship between predation intensity and propagule density was the poorest fit r2 0 72 percent of propagules consumed increased rapidly with greater crab to propagule ratios fig 4c the coefficient from the regression equation that best fit the data was used as the predation coefficient a in eq 2 to quantify predation intensity in the population model table 1 3 2 model we first present four selected model runs to illustrate the range of population responses to freezes predation and dispersal fig 5 each example highlights the mean 1 sd results for a single freeze time series driven by stochastic differences in dispersal timing and rates of propagule production across 1000 runs figure 5a shows results for a population subjected to a historical freeze regime no predation and an initial high density 100 m 2 dispersal event the mean population reached a total density of 13 7 m 2 including all life stages and tree density young mid age and old of 0 07 m 2 before being decimated by consecutive and individual severe freezes that occurred between years 25 and 30 from which the population did not recover fig 5a in contrast a population subjected to a reduced freeze regime and mild predation intensity 0 1 crab propagule and supported by infrequent 0 1 y 1 low density 1 m 2 dispersal events survived all severe freeze events and reached a mean total peak density of 11 2 m 2 including a tree density of 0 05 m 2 by year 100 though with considerable variance in propagule and seedling densities fig 5b under a reduced freeze regime and moderate predation intensity 0 5 crab propagule a population receiving infrequent medium density 10 m 2 deliveries of propagules had a mean total density of 0 17 m 2 and was unable to develop into a regenerating stand i e life stages did not advance beyond sapling fig 5c finally a population subjected to high predation intensity 1 crab propagule no freezes and annual high density 100 m 2 dispersal events developed into a low density regenerating stand peak total density of 1 63 m 2 tree density 0 05 m 2 fig 5d among all 108 scenarios 57 always supported the development of a regenerating forest stand probability 1 11 sometimes did 0 probability 1 and 40 never did probability 0 fig 6 a for these scenarios in which regenerating forests always or sometimes developed peak tree density fig 6b and mean number of years the stand supported regenerating trees fig 6c varied with respect to all three controls under a historical freeze regime i e bottom three rows in all panels of fig 6 22 out of 36 scenarios could support regenerating stands fig 6a with likelihoods ranging from very low to 100 in these regenerating stands mean peak tree density ranged from 0 008 to 0 059 m 2 and trees were present for 1 to 91 9 years mean 63 3 out of 100 simulated years fig 6b c stands did not develop under any predation intensity when dispersal was limited to a single low density 1 m 2 event when predation intensity was moderate 0 5 at least infrequent dispersal events 0 1 y 1 of medium density 10 m 2 were required for a population to become a regenerating stand scenarios with a historical freeze regime and high predation intensity had the least favorable conditions of the 108 scenarios specifically annual high density 100 m 2 dispersal events were required for a population to become a regenerating stand under this combination of biotic and abiotic constraints under a reduced freeze regime fig 6 middle three rows regenerating stands developed under the same scenarios as under a historical freeze regime but the probability of developing into a regenerating stand in scenarios with a single dispersal event or infrequent dispersal events was higher fig 6a among regenerating stands tree densities ranged from 0 01 to 0 076 m 2 and were present for 1 to 96 years mean 83 7 fig 6b c in scenarios with no freezes fig 6 top three rows regenerating stands developed in 24 out of 36 scenarios fig 6a regenerating stands always developed when predation intensity was 0 these scenarios provided the most favorable conditions for mangrove population development without freezes or predation tree densities ranged from 0 066 to 0 082 m 2 and were present for 84 to 96 years mean 93 7 fig 6b c under mild predation intensity 0 1 regenerating stands did not develop when dispersal was limited to an initial low density event under moderate predation intensity 0 5 a regenerating population developed from annual dispersal at all propagule densities tree density was lowest 0 01 m 2 under moderate predation with annual low density dispersal events in scenarios of high predation intensity the population required annual high density dispersal events to support regenerating trees it reached a peak tree density of 0 031 m 2 that was present for 84 of 100 simulation years spatial interpretations of stand densities that developed under these modeled scenarios illustrate how canopy layers and areal coverage of life stage densities would appear in the field fig 7 for example a mangrove stand that developed within a 100 m2 area under the most favorable conditions i e top left cell in fig 6 would become a closed canopy stand with all life stages occupying canopy layers by year 100 fig 7a for comparison visualizations of mangrove stands from the scenarios presented in fig 5b d are included in fig 7b d because the model is not spatially explicit and does not include sizes or heights of life stages the spatial interpretations in fig 7 are for illustrative purposes only sensitivity analysis revealed that 20 differences in parameter values affected model outcomes variably as a function of target model output population control process and specific model scenario changes in the distribution of scenarios always sometimes or never developing regenerating stands for sa parameter sets compared to the original parameter set were relatively small and aligned with expected directions of change i e increased probabilities for parameter sets that decreased mortality and vice versa fig 8 a shifts in successful regeneration were smallest under reduced density maxima parameters dm 20 which showed no change and largest for changes in predation mortality pm parameters which yielded 7 additional scenarios with 100 probability and 4 additional scenarios with 0 probability for pm 20 and pm 20 respectively for the best case parameter set there were 11 additional scenarios with 100 probability an increase of 19 and the worst case parameter set had 9 additional scenarios with 0 probability an increase of 22 across all scenarios mean peak tree density was most sensitive to density maxima parameters increasing and decreasing by 18 under dm 20 and dm 20 respectively and least sensitive to propagule production pp parameters 1 change fig 8b best and worst case parameter sets caused a 53 increase and 34 decrease in peak tree density respectively the number of years a regenerating stand was present was most sensitive to predation mortality pm parameters increasing by 10 and decreasing by 8 under pm 20 and pm 20 respectively but insensitive to both propagule production pp and density maxima dm parameters 1 change fig 8c best and worst case parameter sets yielded a 25 increase and 16 decrease respectively in mean number of years with a regenerating stand variation in sa outcomes illustrated by the error bars in fig 8b c was driven by scenario specific responses to changes in parameters summarized in the appendix the greatest sensitivity was for scenarios that converted among always sometimes and never supporting regenerating populations with subsequently large effects on peak tree density and years with a regenerating stand appendix 4 discussion 4 1 biotic interactions quantifying propagule predation the relationship between predation and propagule density suggests that extant densities of s reticulatum in the big bend region can consume only a limited number of propagules from when they settle onto substrate to when they establish as seedlings fig 4a typically propagules either succumb to mortality or establish within 7 to 21 days once they are stranded on substrate mckee 1995 osborne and smith 1990 patterson et al 1997 at a low propagule density 1 m 2 s reticulatum were able to consume all available propagules during the experiment within 23 days consistent with a previous study in which s reticulatum depredated 99 of propagules at a low density 10 m 2 in 12 days in big bend salt marsh langston et al 2017a assuming long distance dispersal generally delivers a germinans propagules in low densities clarke 1993 nathan et al 2008 nathan and casagrandi 2004 most propagules dispersing into salt marsh are likely to be depredated in most years where s reticulatum or other predators exhibiting type ii or type iii responses are present at higher propagule densities s reticulatum may either be satiated before all propagules are consumed or not have enough time to consume all propagules before they establish fig 4b holling 1959a b propagule survival and subsequent forest stand establishment thus likely depend on occasional high density dispersal events by storms or by tides and currents repeatedly delivering propagules to the same area of marsh within a season peterson and bell 2012 van der stocken et al 2019 in this way the ability of mangroves to produce high densities of propagules adapted for long distance dispersal may offer similar evolutionary benefits as mast seeding when high density dispersal events synchronize delivery of propagules from many individuals to an area populated by a predator some propagules can escape predation potentially initiating a new forest stand critically in settings where even a single propagule survives to reproductive maturity which can occur in as few as 5 years clarke 1995 subsequent propagule production supports both local stand expansion and the potential for additional distal colonization 4 2 biotic abiotic interactions connecting freezes predation and dispersal our model results demonstrated that freezes predation and dispersal were important population controls individually and collectively on a germinans stand development freezes particularly single and consecutive severe freezes were pulse disturbances that caused sporadic drops in overall population density fig 5 predation was a constant stressor on propagules and young seedlings in the model population reducing their probability of recruiting to later life stages when both freezes and predation acted on the model population they exacerbated the individual stress of each control on stand development including the probability of regeneration tree density and stand duration fig 6 dispersal events moderated freeze and predation intensities by delivering pulses of propagules that aided recovery from freezes and increased the density of propagules available for recruitment historically severe freeze events have caused intermittent mortality of a germinans and suppressed propagule production along the big bend montague and odum 1997 pickens and hester 2011 stevens et al 2006 the series of consecutive severe freezes in the 1980s caused 98 mortality to mangrove stands in cedar key fl and a recent single severe freeze in 2018 caused mangrove mortality across the southeastern us ranging from 4 75 depending on local minimum freeze temperature montague and odum 1997 osland et al 2019 our model results demonstrated that single and consecutive severe freezes that occurred under the historical freeze regime drastically reduced population density the frequency of repeated severe freezes limited life stage development and recovering stand density without a large propagule supply or dispersal events following severe freezes a stand could not establish even without the added stress of predation fig 6 under a reduced freeze regime the population was more likely to survive scenarios with more limited propagule supply and reach greater stand densities that were present for more years longer time periods between freeze events allows a population to develop stand complexity i e support different life stages with varying degrees of resistance to freezes figs 5 7 increase stand density and reach a regenerating stage potentially boosting its resilience to future severe freezes osland et al 2015 though a reduced freeze regime creates a favorable environment for a germinans expansion on a regional scale successful establishment of individual populations also depends on local conditions including biotic interactions cavanaugh et al 2018 he and silliman 2016 predation was a strong biotic control on the model population increased predation intensity greatly reduced the probabilities of stand regeneration across freeze regimes fig 6 by reducing propagule and seedling supply predation exacerbated the effects of freezes on the model population low intensity predation slowed population recovery from severe freezes indicated by decreased tree density and stand duration figs 5 6 7 whereas high intensity predation generally prevented population recovery from severe freezes we expect predation intensity across big bend salt marshes to vary depending on local densities of propagule predators relative to propagule supply which would in turn influence patterns and rates of mangrove expansion within the region salt marsh invertebrates such as s reticulatum tend to have spatially and seasonally patchy distributions dictated by temperature tidal cycle soil and local flora and fauna composition evin and talley 2002 rader 1984 the few reported propagule predation rates in the region range from low to high langston et al 2017a patterson et al 1997 peterson and bell 2018 hence our parameters for predation by s reticulatum were representative of predation by a generic predator or suite of predators exhibiting type ii or type iii responses across a density gradient this approach can easily be modified for other specific salt marsh fauna via additional field studies avicennia germinans relies on passive propagule dispersal to expand into new locations within its ecological niche higgins and richardson 1999 nathan et al 2008 sousa et al 2007 van der stocken et al 2019 van der stocken and menemenlis 2017 our model demonstrated that propagule dispersal was also critical in moderating climate and predation controls on a population establishing in a new location fig 6 in other words the model population s resilience to freezes and predation depended on propagule dispersal density and frequency our results show that populations of a germinans supported by frequent high density dispersal events have the best chance of establishing in salt marsh under all freeze and predation scenarios suggesting that mangrove expansion most often occurs via dispersal from neighboring regenerating stands single or infrequent low density dispersal events into big bend salt marshes i e long distance dispersal via tides and ocean currents are less likely to initiate a regenerating stand especially when subject to the combined effects of freezes and predation however even if low density dispersal rarely creates new mangrove stands it is still a viable means of population expansion in fact long distance propagule dispersal has played a critical role in establishing global mangrove distributions lo et al 2014 nettel and dodd 2007 we found single or infrequent high density propagule dispersal i e dispersal via storm surge would likely be sufficient to establish a new stand depending on local predation pressure fig 6 storm surge has been recognized as a dispersal mechanism shaping spatial patterns of mangroves in south florida jiang et al 2014 2012 given that increased frequency and intensity of coastal storms is expected due to climate change storm surge may become an increasingly important mechanism for a germinans expansion not only in terms of propagule delivery to new locations but also in providing large densities of propagules that can withstand high rates of predation and develop into stands resilient to severe freeze events 4 3 model assumptions and sensitivity the goal of this work was to create a relatively simple population model to better understand the individual and interactive effects of freezes predation and dispersal on a germinans expansion in big bend salt marshes to maintain model simplicity and focus on the interactive effects of freezes predation and dispersal we assumed a salt marsh setting that otherwise met environmental ecological and physiological requirements for a germinans survival we excluded other stochastic climatic events like storms and droughts as causes of mortality we referenced storms only as mechanisms for delivering high densities of propagules to the model domain since tropical storms are known to damage or destroy stands of mangroves in florida and the caribbean cahoon et al 2003 smith et al 1994 smith et al 2009 and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency due to climate change excluding them as a source of mortality potentially overestimates modeled probabilities of a germinans establishment droughts as drivers of hypersaline conditions are less likely to be a major source of mortality along the big bend which is less vulnerable to changing rainfall regimes than freeze regimes resulting from climate change osland et al 2016 we also did not explicitly model biotic interactions between mangroves and salt marsh plants instead positive effects e g propagule trapping were implied in the probability of propagule recruitment and negative effects e g competition were implied in miscellaneous mortality rates for propagules and seedlings guo et al 2013 mckee et al 2007 peterson and bell 2012 while relatively simple our model still had 25 parameters table 1 with values derived from the literature and the field study presented here understanding model sensitivity to these parameters is important both for interpreting results and guiding future research into parameters associated with the greatest sensitivity cariboni et al 2007 we found that different model outputs were more or less sensitive to parameter sets associated with different ecological processes for example the likelihood of developing a regenerating forest was most sensitive to variation in parameters describing propagule predation i e the two predation coefficients in table 1 followed by parameters associated with miscellaneous mortality seven parameters controlling mortality unrelated to crowding freezing or predation at each life stage fig 8a these results highlight the role of predation pressure as a primary filter for forest establishment langston et al 2017a osborne and smith 1990 smith et al 1989 and are reflective of our empirically derived relationship between crab density and proportion of propagules consumed which transitions very rapidly from 0 to 100 fig 4c small changes in this parameter can drive large changes in proportional propagule consumption for a given crab density suggesting that site specific studies should be used to parameterize propagule predation sensitivity to miscellaneous mortality rates even though they were relatively low also motivates further study of how to incorporate this lumped parameter into models that consider mortality from multiple specific causes peak tree densities were also sensitive to miscellaneous mortality but even more so to density maxima six parameters controlling maximum density for each life stage excluding propagules fig 8b and this outcome follows directly from the model structure which limited densities at a fixed ceiling while these density maxima parameters were selected from the literature they were derived from a number of avicennia species as well as a germinans growing in different regions better characterizing a germinans forest structure in the southeastern us remains an important knowledge gap for years that a regenerating forest was present results were most sensitive to predation and miscellaneous mortalities a combination of the likelihood that forests establish at all i e predation mortality and direct mortality across all life stages miscellaneous mortality in general all model outputs were only moderately sensitive to variation in parameters describing freeze mortality likely because freezes while potentially catastrophic are relatively rare compared to the potential for yearly mortality from all other causes for all outputs the model was insensitive to variation in parameters that controlled maximum propagule production likely because stochastic variation from sampling a uniform distribution bounded by 0 and a maximum propagule production value swamped variation driven by relatively small increases or decreases in those maxima finally the parameter sensitivities reported here are likely conservatively large estimates since unique freeze dispersal and propagule production time series were randomly generated for all model runs both original and sa parameter sets which could inflate differences between the two sets of results it is also important to note that figure 8 summarizes sa results across all 108 scenarios representing average differences between base and sa parameter sets for each individual scenario for many scenarios that either always or never developed regenerating stands model outputs were largely insensitive to input parameter variation regardless of which ecological process they represented this is evidenced in the many zero values in the appendix in contrast for scenarios that sometimes developed a regenerating stand as well as those that transitioned between always sometimes and never supporting reproduction differences between original and sa parameter sets could be quite large e g dark red and green entries in the appendix it is in these transitional scenarios where freezes predation and dispersal patterns yield varying ecological outcomes that reducing parameter uncertainty is most critical 4 4 looking ahead a reduced freeze regime appears to be underway along the big bend coast the lack of consecutive severe freezes in the past 30 years and infrequent individual severe freezes are facilitating the poleward expansion of a germinans in the region meanwhile local conditions are dictating the establishment of new stands as rates and patterns of a germinans expansion into salt marsh depend on predation and propagule dispersal our findings highlight the importance of incorporating the individual and collective effects of climate biotic interactions and dispersal into research on poleward mangrove expansion we present this model as an easily parameterized tool that can be combined with future field studies and remote sensing efforts

24758,the use of dynamic systems models by scientists managers and policy makers is becoming more common due to the increasingly complex nature of ecological and socio economic problems unfortunately most scientific training in the life sciences only includes dynamic modeling as elective supplementary courses at a beginners level which is not conducive to generating the expertise needed to properly develop test and learn from dynamic modeling approaches and risks utilization of poor quality models and adoption of unreliable recommendations the objective of this paper is to fill part of that gap particularly regarding model experimentation by summarizing key concepts in experimental design for simulation experiments and illustrating hands on examples of experiments needed for developing a deeper understanding of complex dynamic systems the experiments include extreme conditions testing sensitivity analyses of model behaviors given variation in both parameter values and graphical table functions and what if experiments e g counterfactual trajectories boundary adequacy tests and intervention threshold experiments each experimental example describes the theoretical foundation of the test illustrates its application using an ecological systems model and increases in degree of difficulty from novice to advanced skill levels by doing so we demonstrate consistent scientific means to glean valuable insights about the model s structure behavior link uncover any unforeseen model flaws or incorrect formulations and enhance the confidence validity of the model for its intended use graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dynamic modeling experimental design sensitivity analysis what if analysis systems simulation system dynamics 1 introduction mathematical models particularly dynamic systems models are quantitative descriptions of the natural and social processes underlying the functions and patterns observed in the real world models have become increasingly useful for scientists managers and policy makers due to their ability to capture complex natural and socio economic processes and the couplings between them and present them in a way that inspires scientific creativity improves management decision making informs policy making processes and critiques or enlightens prevailing mental models meadows and robinson 1985 sterman 1994 sterman 2002 despite this growing interest in and use of dynamic modeling approaches most scientific training in the life sciences only includes modeling and simulation of such systems as elective or minor courses at a beginners level or are applied to problems with a narrow model boundary or scope e g single to a few system processes rather than interactions between ecologic environmental agricultural and economic elements which may limit accumulation of diverse modeling expertise in such fields the general lack of scientific training needed to generate capable expertise to properly develop test and learn from dynamic modeling approaches can lead to poor quality models that produce unreliable management recommendations especially in systems that cannot be reasonably physically studied or tested because of spatial or temporal limitations because of this growing gap resources are needed to aid scientists in improving their proficiency in model development and use the aim of this paper is to fill part of that gap particularly regarding model experimentation typically the modeling process encompasses five key steps 1 problem articulation boundary definition identification of reference mode behaviors establishment of relevant time horizons and statement of modeling objectives 2 dynamic hypothesis formation and conceptual model development e g causal maps subsystem diagrams etc 3 quantitative model development whereby equations parameters initial conditions and decision rules are specified to arrive at a simulate able model 4 model evaluation or testing whereby developers inspect model structures and outputs to estimate its overall performance towards the model goals which often includes comparison of model generated data to observed data extreme condition and or sensitivity testing etc and 5 policy strategy design and evaluation whereby modelers specify scenarios of interest often stated as what if questions and implement scientific replicable experiments aimed at answering the models objectives and crafting effective management interventions or policy recommendations sterman 2000 this process is iterative in nature where knowledge gained in one stage can be used to update and improve model components at other stages or in subsequent revision processes grant et al 1997 ford 1999 sterman 2000 model testing step 4 above is particularly important since the results of this stage are used to evaluate model performance and behavior validate use of the model as well as quantify the uncertainties weaknesses or shortcomings identified throughout the modeling process forrester and senge 1980 barlas 1989a and 1989b within the model testing stage modelers typically rely on comparisons of model generated data with observed data from the real world system although intuitive and illustratively simple to interpret successful behavior mode reproduction can be a misleading indicator of model strength since some models may reproduce similar reference modes equally well but can create significant discrepancies in output behaviors with even miniscule changes in model structure or parameter values rahmandad and sterman 2008 while it is true that no model is perfect i e it cannot perfectly represent the real world system and its behaviors failure to fully understand the range of possible behavior modes a model may exhibit and why it exhibits them or to appreciate the model s weaknesses limits the learning process and bypasses opportunities for model improvement this could become problematic since identification of high leverage management or policy changes step 5 above may not be observable if a model is lacking key information links feedback processes or structural elements that could have easily been included if recognized step 4 above recognizing model limitations and knowledge gaps are important steps in admiring the problem at hand and appreciating its complexity particularly in light of the complex dynamic nature of the systems being studied such as ecological or agricultural systems grant et al 1997 dalton 1975 turner et al 2016 unfortunately experimental model testing is an overlooked step of the modeling process peterson and eberlein 1994 kleijnen et al 2005 many tests that should be completed are abandoned after checking the model s ability to replicate historical data sterman 2002 and our intuitions about the cause and effect relationships even in simple systems is extremely poor sterman 1994 cronin et al 2009 sterman 2009 therefore it is critically important when developing and evaluating a dynamic model one should incorporate a variety of scientific tests aimed at measuring the robustness of the model to significant parameter value or structure alterations develop a deeper understanding of system s structure and evaluate alternative system states arising from varying management decision rules learning to effectively design and implement a variety of such experiments is a useful addition to any modeling practitioner s tool box as it would aid in multiple stages of the modeling process e g model boundary identification hypothesis formation overall model evaluation and interpretation of key model insights and hedge against bias or faulty inferences about model validity the objective of this paper is to summarize some concepts central to the design of experiments specifically simulation experiments and the common tests useful for developing a deeper understanding of complex dynamic systems this is a valuable contribution for the systems modeling fields on the whole since much of the development of these tests reside in business management and operations research literature to facilitate the diffusion of and improvement in using these model experiments for ecological and agricultural model applications concepts from traditional experimental design are translated into important considerations for design of simulation experiments sections 2 and 3 readers interested in the theory and methodology underlying these selected simulation experiments are encouraged to start here then several illustrative examples are provided and discussed section 4 readers interested more in the application of the modeling experiments may start here and reference the theoretical sections as needed the paper concludes with brief comments about the proper development and use of systems models 2 design of experiments basic framework and key terminology the main tenets of traditional design of experiments doe include control replication and randomization experiments are investigations where the system under study is under the control of the investigator meaning that subjects of the investigation nature of treatments or manipulations and measurement procedures are all set or designed by the experimenter cox and reid 2000 with experimental controls investigators should account for potential sources of error and variability through systematic doe sanchez 2005 replication or repetition to gain more data is required to obtain more precise results e g narrower confidence intervals while randomization i e random order of experimental treatments such that one s performance does not depend on another guards against the possible insertion of investigator biases in system response to treatments cavazzuti 2013 sanchez 2005 both replication and randomization are requirements of good doe in order to avoid systematic errors as well as estimate the magnitude of random errors cox and reid 2000 in performing doe and assuming the problem at hand is well defined modeling step 1 the experimenter chooses factors or variables or parameters in which to vary and the design space or range that each factor is allowed to vary within cavazzuti 2013 factors may be qualitative quantitative discrete or continuous in nature in practice the number and nature of parameters treatment values or ranges and replications are selected based on what can be afforded by the investigators in terms of inputs e g treatments outputs dependent variables and goals e g objective functions the latter two are also called response variables while the former may be referred to as the sample space a scenario or design point is a combination of values for all factors kleijnen et al 2005 effective doe increases the efficiency of an investigation by limiting or eliminating trial and error treatment strategies and avoiding confounding results that make implementation or adoption of findings difficult kleijnen et al 2005 some traditional doe designs include randomized complete block full and fractional factorial central composite box behnken plackett burman taguchi latin hypercube sequential bifurcation and frequency based among many others the purpose is not to review these designs in depth but simply acknowledge the diversity of useful designs available depending on the problem at hand 1 1 interested readers are encouraged to see references cited in this section for in depth reviews of these procedures below some variations of these designs are shown in the applications specific to modeling dynamic systems lastly doe should be viewed through the context of not only the environment that an experiment takes place e g field soil animals etc but also the context of the experimenter because no experiment exists unless someone has asked a particular question found no suitable answer and thought it was important enough to invest the time and resources to carry out pearce 1983 in the terms of dynamic systems models experimenter context can include both the modeling or programming language one uses to carry out an experiment about the real world as well as the experimenter s own mental model peterson and eberlein 1994 3 design of simulation experiments the doe is an essential but often overlooked step in the modeling process specifically steps 4 and 5 defined above pearce 1983 kleijnen et al 2005 peterson and eberlein 1994 many important tests are never done or investigators simply stop with replication of historical data sterman 2002 still worse unplanned hit or miss experimentation can often be frustrating inefficient and ultimately unhelpful kelton and barton 2003 this can be extremely problematic since the boundaries of our mental models and the inferences we make about complex dynamic systems tends to be deficient sterman 1994 simulation models can be used to mimic complex systems but can be manipulated in ways that are too slow too costly unethical or simply impossible to complete in the real world peck 2004 sterman 2002 for example it may be too slow or costly to perform a grazing management study across an entire area of interest e g whole ranch county or watershed scales or test the impact of redesigning an irrigation district delivery system likewise when involving scarce resources e g ground water or surface water dependent systems or threatened or endangered species it may be viewed as unethical to proceed with the degree of manipulation needed for traditional experimentation models can therefore be used to represent such systems and allow for experimentation and learning about the real world given such constraints often in traditional doe the number of variables selected is small and their range of variability restricted due to social or economic constraints e g limited time labor and budgets biologic ecologic or ethical limitations modern modeling platforms overcome these experimental constraints given their ability to simulate systems across time and space rapidly and without consequences intended or otherwise to the real world although model experiments are generally free of the constraints encountered when conducting real world experiments the same general principles apply namely design of treatments and controls randomization or estimation of uncertainty in the system sample size considerations and replicability so others can repeat and extend experiments elsewhere sterman 2000 peck 2004 kennedy 2019 additionally model experiments should be conducted in a reflective and iterative manner so that testing uncovers model flaws challenges assumptions and encourages critique and improvement in mental models and real world systems fig 1 sterman 2000 by doing so simulation speeds up and strengthens the learning process stimulates improvement in both mental and formal models improves our intuition about system dynamics and because the complex nature of dynamic systems makes simulation the only practical way to test models sterman 1994 sterman 2002 although there is variability in the descriptions of simulation experiments due to nuances in alternative modeling paradigms there are at least three common shared purposes for design and use of simulation experiments i evaluate the robustness of the system model ii developing depth of system understanding and iii comparing effectiveness of alternative assumptions decision rules or policies ford 1999 sterman 2000 kleijnen et al 2005 however it is important to recognize that there are a variety of other tests useful for model calibration and evaluation such as behavior reproduction tests oliva 2003 martinez moyano and richardson 2013 that are typical of many modeling applications across skill levels in addition there are highly advanced model development and analysis procedures such as bootstrapping for parameter value confidence interval estimation and hypothesis testing purpose i and ii above dogan 2007 feedback loop dominance and eigenvalue elasticity analysis purpose ii above oliva 2015 oliva 2016 naumov and oliva 2018 kampmann and oliva 2020 or integration of behavioral economic theory into dynamic decision making frameworks employed in models purpose iii above langarudi and bar on 2018 mohaghegh and größler 2020 that require the most expert modeling skill and a combination of mathematical or programming software applications each of these are beyond the scope of this paper here we focus on a non exhaustive but comprehensive set of experimental tests to aid in the three purposes described above and that progress in difficulty to guide users from novice to advanced skill levels 2 2 an important note here is that tests applied to dynamic models can be used to assess more than one objective for example an extreme condition test which is a kind of sensitivity test may be used to assess model equations and behavior under extreme conditions as well as to uncertain parameter values and the overall model structure i e are physical laws conformed to are the decision rules of actors representative given extreme conditions 3 1 experiments for system robustness to extreme conditions much knowledge and information about the real world pertains to the behaviors and consequences given extreme conditions that if incorporated into a model results in improved model performance both in and out of the normal operating region forrester and senge 1980 therefore models should possess internal robustness meaning that the behaviors produced by the model should be realistic even when extreme input parameter or decision rules are imposed on the model sterman 2000 extreme condition experiments may be implemented as switches turning variables on or off or step or pulse functions with inordinately high or low values relative to the model s standard formulation minus infinity zero plus infinity forrester and senge 1980 extreme condition tests are one of the most important experiments to consider during the model evaluation and testing stage because a it is a powerful experiment for uncovering flaws in the model and b it enhances model utility for analyzing how a system operates outside its normal region forrester and senge 1980 martinez monyano and richardson 2013 interpretation of extreme conditions test results depends on the application at hand but should follow rules of logic and reasoning regarding possible and realistic real world behaviors for example plant production cannot occur without water for evapotranspiration a water reservoir cannot store negative volumes of water and small holder livestock herd sizes cannot go below zero likewise with unlimited water plant production should reach its biological limit and then cease to grow unlimited rainfall will fill the reservoir to its capacity at which point it begins to overflow and livestock herd sizes may grow under favorable conditions but be subject to their available feed resources i e if forage resource and stored feed levels become static herd sizes should cease to grow the extreme condition test aids in identification of model flaws and inconsistencies and therefore the mental models of those in the system as such extreme condition tests act as model reality checks peterson and eberlien 1994 3 2 experiments for developing depth of system understanding all models include some degree of uncertainty due to assumptions made about parameter values causal relationships the model structure itself and errors in input data leinweber 1979 hekimoǧlu and barlas 2016 therefore experiments are required to develop depth of understanding about the particular system of interest there are many ways these tests can be done including the use of step ramp or pulse functions as well as sensitivity analyses forrester and senge 1980 barlas 2007 sensitivity experiments particularly behavior mode or multiple mode sensitivity tests are a principal method used to shed light on the possible dynamics distribution and uncertainties of different behaviors that may arise from a given system tank neilson 1980 forrester and senge 1980 saltelli et al 2000 behavior sensitivity tests identify whether or not shifts in model parameter values or relationships including graphical or table functions can create different behavior modes or cause the model to fail previously passed behavior tests forrester and senge 1980 the latter is an important feature of policy analysis described below when experimenting with uncertain parameter values a sample design must be constructed which specifies the number of simulations to include in the sensitivity tests as well as the range assigned to each parameter value preferably twice as large as statistical or judgmental considerations suggest ford and flynn 2005 hekimoǧlu and barlas 2016 sterman 2000 although parameter values may be altered one variable at a time it is recommended that multiple parameters be adjusted simultaneously in order to analyze their combined effect on model output hekimoǧlu and barlas 2016 and that any interdependencies may be identified ford and flynn 2005 when conducting sensitivity experiments it is critical to identify which type of sensitivity is being measured numerical sensitivity where a change in assumptions results in changes in numerical results behavior mode sensitivity where a change in assumptions changes the model s patterns of behavior or policy sensitivity where a change in assumption reverses the impacts of a proposed decision sterman 2000 each method described below outlines useful ways of measuring numerical behavioral and policy sensitivity due to the nature of simulation in general all models express numerical sensitivity therefore one objective of sensitivity experiments is to identify which inputs or parameters have the largest effect on model output or state variables ford and flynn 2005 demonstrate a statistical screening procedure for multivariate sensitivity analysis based on the correlation coefficient cc ranging from 1 to 1 typically denoted r given as 1 r σ x i x y i y σ x i x 2 σ y i y 2 where r represents the cc xi and x are the point values of the independent variable at time i and the mean x value and yi and y are the point values for the dependent value at time i and the mean y value for each unit of time in the simulation a cc is estimated for the each independent variable on the dependent variable which can be used to identify possible interdependencies i e when input variables in the real world vary dependently with one another in which model adjustments to account for relationships may be necessary the cc also allows one to rank the most influential factors on a given state variable using this approach facilitates estimation of tolerance intervals with a given confidence level hahn and meeker 1991 van belle 2002 although sensitivity experiments on parameter values are necessary in order to understand the effect individual or groups of parameters have on a particular model such tests must be complemented with sensitivity experiments of graphical table functions which are common in dynamic systems models ford 1999 eker et al 2014 graphical functions represent the relationship between two variables one the independent and one the dependent variable deaton and winebrake 2000 eker et al 2014 3 3 graphical functions are also called table functions and are often parameterized as a series of x y coordinates representing the relationship between an input variable x and the response y that is used elsewhere in a model they are useful especially when real world relationships between two variables are known to exist but where specific analytic equations are unknown although if analytic equations are known from prior research these are often included as graphical functions because of the subjectivity associated with graphical functions there is added uncertainty in model outputs eker et al 2014 eker et al 2014 extended a method by hearne 2010 to generate alternative functional forms of graphical functions in an automated matter to facilitate graphical function sensitivity experiments based on perturbation theory the method uses distortion functions multiplied by the model s original graphical function to arrive at alternative nonlinear relationships between independent and dependent variables distortion functions are composed of independent parameters that create alternative functional forms and are easy to test experimentally using the same procedures as those used to test parameter value sensitivity eker et al 2014 the simplest distortion function triangular is given by h x p m 1 m x c p c 2 c a x p b x p where m represents the maximum deviation from 1 ranging from 1 to 1 and p is the point where this deviation occurs ranging from 0 to 1 different combinations of distortion function parameter values result in different table function shapes distortion functions may be linear triangular or nonlinear sine or cubic in nature however triangular functions are most easily controlled and interpreted especially using scatter plots and correlation coefficients eker et al 2014 lastly hekimoǧlu and barlas 2016 demonstrate using traditional sensitivity analysis a means to differentiate changes in model behavior modes and quantify behavioral sensitivity outcomes behavior modes are most simply defined as the pattern over time expressed in the variable of interest see appendix fig a1 the primary behavior modes are zero constant linear growth decline exponential growth decline goal seeking growth decline s shaped growth decline growth and decline or decline and growth and oscillation with without growth decline walrave 2016 when identifying shifts in behavior mode a behavior pattern measure must be specified and created in the model for further analysis given the lack of automated means to identify and measure behavior mode changes after selecting input parameters their ranges of values and conducting the sensitivity experiment individual trial results are screened by visual inspection of the output data and grouped into those that exhibit similar behavior modes next pattern measures are estimated e g growth rates periods or amplitudes of oscillations peak point of a boom bust cycle etc and regressed against standardized input parameter values of the sensitivity trials i e by 3 x x σ x where x represents the nonstandardized parameter value and x and σx are the mean and standard deviation of parameter values 4 4 standardizing is a means to rescale data input or output to achieve a mean of zero and standard deviation of one standardardization is important when variable or parameter scales differ often the case in multivariate model sensitivity analysis and by transforming the numerical data we add precision and stability and reduce multicollinearity issues using standardized parameter values improves interpretation of regression results kleijnen 1995 regression outputs can then be used to examine the nature of influence and rank of importance of each parameter on the behavior pattern which can shed light on potential high leverage parameters in the model for example t tests indicate significance while the signs of the regression coefficients indicate the direction of correlation or polarity between the parameter and the behavior measure assuming parameter values used in sensitivity came from independent distributions 3 3 experiments for comparing appropriateness of alternative assumptions and effectiveness of new decision rules or policies counterfactuals or what ifs whereas the above experiments are generally conducted by varying parameter values or functions experiments for comparing the appropriateness of new assumptions or effectiveness of new management decisions or policies to achieve desired system behaviors are conducted through manipulating components of the model structure itself such experiments are also called intervention studies changed behavior prediction tests boundary adequacy tests or policy sensitivity tests forrester 1961 forrester and senge 1980 often these take the form of designing what if experiments which include system improvement and boundary adequacy tests via creation of additional model structure forrester and senge 1980 morecroft 1988 martinez moyano and richardson 2013 what if experiments are typically performed using ad hoc adjustments of key model parameters e g repenning 2001 walrave et al 2011 as well as functional values functional shapes and forms of decision equations barlas 2007 boundary adequacy experiments are uniquely important because they test whether or not modification of the model boundary assumptions would change policy recommendations arrived at in the original analysis forrester and senge 1980 when future input values or forcing functions are highly uncertain these tests may be applied retrospectively i e backcasting to analyze how counterfactual trajectories in key model structures would alter behaviors observed in the known past srinivasan 2015 gunda et al 2018 when inputs or forcing functions have an estimated trajectory or distribution models can be run into the future or past to forecast or backcast potential system responses to the alternative assumptions or conditions once alternative scenario decisions or conditions are simulated the effectiveness of proposed system changes can then be measured to identify the degree of change in model behavior as a result of the alternative assumption or scenario yücel and barlas 2015 in order to quantify potential effects of system improvements one may examine what if questions through the analysis of intervention thresholds i e the minimum intervention size and implementation time that results in the desired behavior change walrave 2016 using atomic behavior patterns and their associated threshold indicators 5 5 a summary of these are illustrated in the appendix i e the point where a model behavior shifts from one atomic behavior pattern to another often observed using the first and or second derivatives a model is iteratively tested using pre determined intervention sizes and times which represent the what if questions of a proposed new policy until the intervention threshold is reached or the entire search space has been simulated i e where no intervention thresholds were identified using the resulting simulation data an intervention threshold graph may be constructed to indicate the required intervention size at a given time to create the desired shift in behavior pattern walrave 2016 this approach can be implemented using sensitivity analysis described above but where the nature of the intervention its size and time applied to the model are sensitivity inputs parameters lastly given the problem oriented nature of systems analysis modeling generally aims to identify remedies to problems system improvement tests seek to identify whether or not the modeling process or the policies or strategies identified by the model experiments actually led to improvements in the real world s system structure and behavior sterman 2000 martinez moyano and richardson 2013 ideally intervention studies should follow good experimental design protocols with control and treatment groups if possible or with natural experiments comparing the results from those who changed behaviors as a result of the modeling process with those who did not participate sterman 2000 oliva 2019 3 4 preparing a model for laboratory testing notes on model calibration evaluation validation before the experimental examples are illustrated it is important to realize that before a model is tested it must provide an adequate representation of the problem at hand this is often captured in a dynamic hypothesis dh which is a working theory about how a system s structure of decision rules and feedback processes generate and perpetuate the problematic behavior of interest richardson and pugh 1981 sterman 2000 the dh should link observable patterns of behavior to micro level structures ecologic environmental socioeconomic decision making etc forrester 1985 morecroft 1983 a model as a laboratory should translate the dh into a quantitative working model therefore experimental design and testing is only as good the dh oliva 2003 a model calibration process should be used as a test of the dh to ensure that the model captures the observed behaviors with the right structure oliva 2003 there are several means in which to build confidence in a model and its dh prior to experimental testing including hand calibration automated calibration see oliva 2003 for example and statistical evaluation to observed behaviors tedeschi 2006 and bennett et al 2013 provide reviews of statistical evaluation techniques useful for comparing model predictions with observed data from the real system bennet et al 2013 also provide a general procedure for model evaluation the critical questions one should answer during the model development and calibration phase include 1 does the model accurately capture the dh 2 which data can will be used for calibration versus evaluation 3 do the expected patterns correspond to those in the real world and 4 is the model precise accurate or both tedeschi 2006 upon successful model development one should have adequate knowledge of the model s performance i e its strengths and accuracy weaknesses and sources of errors to be able to properly interpret results of model hypothesis testing although model validation is beyond the scope of this paper it is a concept that all modelers must consider validation is the process of establishing confidence in a model such that it can be used for its particular purpose forrester and senge 1980 although some hold that model validity equates to truth of the model many in the field of systems analysis hold that confidence is a better arbiter of validity because there is no feasible way to prove a model absolutely and completely represents reality forrester and senge 1980 tedeschi 2006 whether one adopts truth or confidence as their model validation criterion it is clear that neither can be achieved without adequate model experimentation judging the validity of a model without having done the basic experimental tests described below exposes the investigator to tremendous risk since it will be nearly impossible for them to correctly infer the full range of possible behaviors and outcomes given the dynamic nature of our ecological agricultural and social systems 4 model application experimentation examples with discussion to enhance the adoption use and documentation of simulation experiments for both novice and advanced modelers alike we demonstrate and discuss each of the experiments described above using a moderately complex dynamic systems model the model was developed based on a common problem in irrigated agricultural systems that rely on surface water supplies for their water sources in such systems surface water flows are diverted from a river source to provide irrigation water to cropland however surface water diversions often has deleterious effects to native ecosystems in terms of both habitats and individual species through the reduction in baseline water supply that the ecosystem has relied upon for its growth and development in addition irrigation diversions can escalate the impact of shrinking water availability for the ecosystem depending on the season of year which can coincide with when water use by native ecosystems is greatest type of irrigation system used e g conveyance structures for delivery and return flows as well as the type of irrigation application such as drip flood sprinkler all influence the infiltration recharge runoff and return flow dynamics and cost effectiveness of diversion e g marginal cost of water and infrastructure level of public subsidy supporting the system etc water diversions not used for agriculture are often transferred to municipal and industrial uses that have grown in conjunction with population growth and economic expansion unfortunately degradation of native ecosystems has precipitated a range of losses or reductions in ecosystem functions that support human well being but whose economic values have not been well captured for decision makers the tension placed on stakeholders in these systems continue to rise due to the array economic political and social interests at play the case study model profiled below captures the trade off between agricultural water diversions from a river source and the ecologic consequences to a wildlife refuge that also relies on water from the river fig 2 an expanded model illustration and supporting model files are provided the appendix fig a2 the purpose of the model is to generate insight for policy makers about the trade offs between a surface water supplied irrigation system and a native wildlife refuge that resides downstream from the diversion point and surrounding croplands and identify possible management strategies that balance the economic benefit of irrigation without compromising the sustainability of the wildlife refuge 4 1 dynamic hypothesis and model overview the wildlife refuge is dependent on water from the river to support native ecosystem plants and the native animals that rely on those plants for survival as water from the river source is diverted to agricultural use river flow is reduced which slows the growth of ecosystem plants and threatens the native animal population fig 3 the model includes five state variables crops profits ecosystem plants native animals and irrigation diversion level and their associated rate functions for growth decomposition or harvesting grazing loss reproduction and mortality and adjustments to the irrigation diversion amounts fig 2 information links that complete the biological feedback loops include the production rate of plants animal reproduction rates a forage availability index i e the ratio of native animals to ecosystem plants which drives the animal mortality rate and the growth index for crops i e high growth rates when total biomass is low which slowly reduces as plants reach maturity and associated planting and harvesting times the major socio economic information links include the effect of profitability on planting density and planting density on irrigation diversion rates e g when profitability is enhanced farmers raise planting density due to the additional crop biomass irrigation diversions are also raised to support plant growth additional parameters include estimates for crop water demand irrigation efficiency mean river flow grazing demand of the native animals on ecosystem plants crop prices crop planting costs as well as the initial investment and discount rate needed to determine the net present value npv of the agricultural water use the model executable in the freely downloadable vensim ple modeling environment 6 6 www vensim com free download is provided in the appendix material along with microsoft excel templates for data analysis so that readers can download and examine the model and replicate the experiments presented an earlier version of the model was developed and presented in grant et al 1997 but has been updated here to include three important feedback loops not included in the original model two management related feedbacks and one biophysical feedback 1 as the net annual returns for cropping increase the planting volume of the next year s crop also increases positive feedback denoted r1 in fig 2 2 as the planting volume increases so does the irrigation diversion amount needed to support the crop positive feedback denoted r2 in fig 2 and 3 as the number of native animals declines pressure is applied through conservationists effort to limit diversions from the river to agriculture negative feedback denoted loop b in fig 2 to illustrate the experimental tests described above that serve to i evaluate system robustness ii develop depth of system understanding and iii compare effectiveness of alterative assumptions decisions or policies we designed and subjected the model to a variety of experiments table 1 including extreme conditions where the hypothesis is that the model performs in logical and reasonable ways that conform to all physical and scientific laws sensitivity analyses of model behavior given variation in parameter values and graphical functions where the hypotheses are that certain parameters or functions will have greater influence on the behavior of the model than others and what if analyses where the hypotheses are that altering certain assumptions decision rules or management strategies in the system will correct the problematic behavior each section that follows provides a description of how each test was implemented in the model the results of each experiment and how it is interpreted within the context of the purpose of the model a summary of the rationale for each test and common obstacles encountered during implementation is provided table 2 these tests were chosen for several reasons they provided a comprehensive suite of tests useful for confidence building in both the model and the modeler model evaluation and insight generation they align with the core tests defined by forrester and senge 1980 they provided a relatively straightforward scheme moving from novice to advanced skill levels and importantly all could completed without the need for external coding or additional software outside of most dynamic modeling platforms 4 2 robustness to extreme conditions system structures should permit examination of extreme combinations of states or parameter values in order to implement extreme conditions tests one must be familiar with the structural elements of the system state variables transfer functions information converters and variables representing time based parameters to be able to trace the implications of hypothetical extreme values of variables including values known to be far outside the range of known historical or possible values to determine the plausibility of the model s response forrester and senge 1980 here we examine extreme conditions tests applied to several key parameters river flow the primary physical exogenous i e arising from outside the model boundary input to the system calibrated to 100 c f s irrigation efficiency the fraction of applied irrigation water that is productively consumed by the crop taking on a dimensionless value from zero to one calibrated to 0 5 and ecosystem plant decomposition rate which regulates the volume of plant biomass due to metabolic costs and eventual senescence and death taking on a dimensionless value between 0 and 1 calibrated to 0 375 irrigation efficiency is also a significant factor influencing the surface water return flow rate back to the refuge here the volume of applied irrigation water not consumed by the crop returns to the surface water source that supplies the native animal refuge in the simplest mathematical form 4 rfr rf iwd rtf 5 rtf iwd iwd ie where rfr is the river flow to the refuge rf is the upstream river flow iwd is the irrigation water diverted rtf is the return flow rate and ie is the irrigation efficiency therefore monitoring the responses to changed irrigation efficiency provides an additional check on the internal consistency of the model structure abnormally high flow rates did lead to small increases in ecosystem plants earlier in the growing season which was able to support slightly greater native animal population fig 4 a and b but did not significantly alter the overall behavior patterns on the other hand cutting river flow to zero c f s led to an eventual collapse in ecosystem plants the stock of existing biomass became depleted by month 30 due to no new plant growth combined with monthly biomass losses from decomposition and consumption by native animals because of the loss in ecosystem plants the native animal population also collapses near month 36 importantly neither ecosystem plants nor native animals fall below zero due to the first order negative feedback loops not arbitrary constraints set by the modeler that govern the outflow of each stock i e physical inventories cannot be negative if the desired outflow is greater than the level of the stock first order negative feedback controls will regulate the outflow such that the outflow rate cannot exceed the existing stock value consider a bathtub example without any inflow and the drain or outflow open a full bath tub will drain water a function of gravity and the height of the water in the tub as the height of water declines to zero the outflow rate also declines to zero at which point the stock of water in the tub is empty even though the drain is open and gravitational force is still applied not including this kind of regulating feedback is a common pitfall among beginning modelers manipulating irrigation efficiency up to 100 of applied irrigation water led to a number of significant outcomes fig 4c and d first the 50 improvement in irrigation efficiency led to a 400 increase in crop production initially this may look unreasonable however the modeler should examine such behaviors and be able to link them to the model structure from which they arose fig 2 in this case improving irrigation efficiency 100 meant no water losses during irrigation i e all water applied was converted into crop production because of the increase in production and therefore crop profitability in the first year the strength of the two reinforcing loops in fig 2 driven by profit s effect on planting density and planting density s effect on irrigation diversion levels were greatly enhanced leading to greater planting densities and irrigation application levels with greater plant densities greater water applications and no water losses in the production system crop production grew until reaching its maximum potential by month 36 fig 4c with irrigation efficiency at 100 the delayed return flows to the river source were eliminated with reduced stream flows to the refuge and the resulting loss of ecosystem plants the native animal population declines until its complete loss by month 72 fig 4d on the other hand when irrigation efficiency is set to 0 i e no irrigation water applied is converted to crop growth all applications become return flows crop production was unsustainable overlaying the x axis in fig 4c and there was no change in the native animal population fig 4d since whatever water applied was returned to the river source and supported ecosystem plant growth needed by the native animals the reduction in ecosystem plant decomposition rate to 0 created significant differences in ecosystem plants and native animals compared to the base case with no decomposition the stock of ecosystem plants was able to grow up to its biological limit subject only to losses via consumption by native animals fig 4e the native animal population no longer subject to the seasonal variability in food supply therefore grew in conjunction with the growth in ecosystem plants reaching a new equilibrium population near 45 animals by month 60 fig 4f any consumptive losses in ecosystem plants by native animals were easily compensated for by new growth the important insights that these experiments provide the modeler are to check that the model structure obeys basic biophysical laws populations and plant biomasses can t be negative neither can they grow forever extreme conditions tests illuminate whether or not a model conforms to such laws additionally when a model expresses a high degree of feedback such as the feedbacks stemming from irrigation applications and their influence on return flows such tests force the modeler to be able to explain the resulting behavior in terms of the existing model structure when results do not conform to basic scientific laws or result in behaviors that can t be explained clearly by the existing model structure which is a reflection of the dynamic hypothesis the modeler should reconcile the discrepancy by revising the dynamic hypothesis model structure or both appendix section 3 1 provides several examples of failed extreme conditions tests often encountered in early stages by more novice modelers 4 3 developing depth of system understanding to develop depth of system understanding experiments that examine the various behavior modes that the model can create and the strength of influence that various model parameters have on creating those behavior patterns are needed here we illustrate several behavioral sensitivity tests by experimenting with alternative parameter values or functions including graphical functions to analyze their influence on the resulting model behavior these include varying parameter behaviors rather than their values multivariate sensitivity analysis graphical function sensitivity analysis and analysis of behavior modes i e behavior pattern measures 4 3 1 behavioral sensitivity to model parameters the first experimental examples demonstrate changing single parameters in unique ways via giving them dynamic rather than static values over the course of a simulation because of the importance of river flow as the primary water input for the ecosystem plants and native animals in the refuge as well as the crop production system fig 2 we illustrate three experimental tests of the model using step pulse and ramp functions to vary the river flow input values into the system each of these tests are also applicable to other parts of the system e g crop production economics and ecosystem components but due to space considerations only tests of river flow are presented here first using a step function we implement a step volume change to river flow at a given step time such that 6 river flow 100 t s t e p t i m e 100 s t e p v o l u m e t s t e p t i m e where t represents time step time 120 months and step volume is equal to 50 c f s but is adjustable based on user input for smaller or larger step changes including potential reductions in river flow for negative values of step volume 7 7 in the vensim modeling environment this may be achieved a number of ways but is best implemented with use of the step function step step volume step time the resulting behaviors of the river flow step experiment illustrate several immediate and delayed responses to changes in flow behavior fig 5 a due to the immediate increase in available water 150 of base river flow and no delay in irrigation diversion and application during the growing season crop production was enhanced nearly 50 fig 5b in a similar fashion ecosystem plants immediately recovered from the reduction created by diversions in the base case river flow and actually reach a new peak in primary productivity approximately 20 000 tons compared to 15 000 tons or an increase of 33 prior to irrigation diversion fig 5c the reason for the disproportionate response in crop production and ecosystem plants are due to the disproportionate change in total inflows received by each area recall that the base river inflow was 100 c f s irrigation diversions were 30 of the flow irrigation efficiency was 50 and water not consumed by the crops became return flow back to the river source in response to the step change in river flow the total inflow available for crop production increased 67 i e new waer available base water available base water available or 50 cfs 50 30 cfs 50 30 cfs 50 25 cfs 15 cfs 15 cfs 66 7 on the other hand total inflows to the refuge only increased 47 i e 125 cfs 85 cfs 85 cfs 40 cfs 85 cfs 47 finally the native animal population does recover to its equilibrium level of 25 head albeit with a delay of 160 months fig 5d unlike the immediate plant response to water observed in crop production and ecosystem plants which are subject to delays of less than one year in their growth capacities native animals are subject to biological delays for gestation and birth which lengthen the recovery time for the general population because of this delay the recovery in native animals is not a sharp one point in time increase but an s shaped growth pattern from the reduced state back to the natural population level in a similar fashion we can utilize a pulse function to periodically increase or decrease a particular rate or parameter values at a desired interval pulse time in this case a pulse is used to reduce river flow by 50 during the ecosystem plant s growing season in three year intervals to mimic the natural occurrence of drought conditions the base case without irrigation is used here in order to more effectively observe what changes if any occur in native animals which may not be perceptible given the influence of irrigation diversions shown in previous sections the droughts begin at the start of the growing season month of year 4 midway through the simulation t 180 months which mathematically can be expressed as 7 river flow 100 t p s t 100 p v t p s t and 8 pv τ t n 1 2 n π sin n π τ t cos 2 π n t p s t τ 2 d c where pv is the pulse volume t is time pst is the pulse start time equal to 184 months i e month 180 being the start of the 16th year plus four months to arrive at the start of the natural growing season pulse time τ is 6 months and pulse period t is 36 months the pulse in the above function produces a sequence of re occurring events representing drought via the use of a square wave function where the pulse width is 6 months the space width is 30 months and the cycle time is 36 i e duty cycle 16 67 the square wave functions yields a value of 1 when the wave is positive or 0 when it is not thus in order to simulate the pulse of a particular volume the square wave is multiplied by an auxiliary variable representing the desired change dc i e in this case 50 c f s fig 6 a 8 8 in the vensim modeling environment this can be simulated via the pulse train function pulse train start time pulse width cycle time end time desired pulse volume similar to the step experiment above the pulse experiment reducing river flow by 50 yielded both immediate and delayed responses clearly in the years with drought ecosystem plants were negatively affected but do recover in subsequent years following each drought fig 6b native animals are also negatively affected but due to the biological delays inherent in the population drought effects in one year compound into the future for example the reduction in ecosystem plants during the first drought pulse results in diminishing the native animals nearly 50 but the plants are able to fully recover in the following years before the next drought occurs whereas native animals only improve to a mean of 17 5 animals a 30 reduction for their starting population because of the lengthened recovery time in native animals the effect of each subsequent drought is amplified and reinforces the native animal population to a new albeit lower equilibrium level fig 6c the result is a change in behavior pattern from a sustained oscillatory behavior to one that is a declining goal seeking damped oscillation the third test demonstrates a ramp function which alters a parameter value from a static value to one that takes on a particular slope positive or negative for a particular time span in this case river flow increases 0 3 c f s per unit of time beginning at 120 months mathematically this is expressed as 9 9 in the vensim modeling environment this function is most easily implemented use the ramp function ramp ramp slope ramp time end time 9 river flow 100 t r a m p t i m e 100 r a m p s l o p e t r a m p t i m e t r a m p t i m e where t is time ramp time is 120 months and ramp slope is 0 3 given the above ramp slope and time inputs river flow increased from 100 c f s at month 120 to 175 c f s by month 360 fig 7 a due to the gradual increase in available water crop production grew linearly in step with river flow fig 7b while ecosystem plants exhibited more of goal seeking growth behavior up to its maximum productive potential near 20 000 tons fig 7c because the recovery delay of ecosystem plants takes around 180 months from 120 to 300 in fig 7 and the reproductive delays of native animals described above the native animal population exhibits an exponential growth pattern where each subsequent gain in population although initially small compounds into the future fig 7d however since ecosystem plants do reach a point where growth no longer occurs a reasonable follow up test would be to extend the simulation out beyond 360 months to identify at what point if any the native animal and crop production behavior patterns shift from exponential and linear growth to some other behavior patterns most likely goal seeking tests of these types aid the modeler in understanding how model structure produces unique behavior modes given a dynamic input these are especially valuable for management or policy related questions due to the fact that most dynamic models have the ability to exhibit multiple behavior modes which makes it possible to examine potential interactions between modes or how different decision rules lead to particular behavior patterns forrester and senge 1980 appendix section 3 2 provides examples of failed step pulse and ramp experiments that would necessitate mental and quantitative model revision 4 3 2 sensitivity analysis with graphical functions the second set of experiments illustrate graphical function sensitivity analyses in this case two key graphical functions warranted investigation native animal mortality rate a graphical function based on per capita forage availability effect on mortality b1 in fig 2 and crop profit effect on planting density r1 in fig 2 because mortality rate directly influences the native animal population and does not feed back to the cropping system we only examine the effect of altered mortality rates on the animal population on the other hand the influence of expected planting density reaches beyond the cropping system to second and third order effects on the ecosystem plants and native animals therefore we examine crop system financial performance via the net present value or npv of irrigation which integrates crop production and economic prices and costs as well as the native animal population each of these graphical functions were manipulated using the distortion function procedure outlined by eker et al 2014 after hearne 2010 illustrated with two simple examples in fig 8 although there are an array of alternative distortion functions one may use to manipulate the graphical function here we employ the one of the simplest a single point triangular distortion eq 2 in order to minimize additional model variables required for the experiment while maintaining a distortion that is easily interpretable for a full discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of variable distortion function possibilities see eker et al 2014 to complete the sensitivity analysis 100 simulations were completed for each graphical function by varying the maximum deviation m from 1 to 1 and point of maximum departure p from 0 to 1 see eq 2 10 10 tests were implemented in vensim modeling environment using the built in monte carlo simulation feature with the following specifications number of simulations 100 noise seed 1234 latin hypercube sampling with random uniform distribution of input parameter values for the most part the model was insensitive to changes in graphical functions fig 9 altering the mortality rate function revealed primarily only one behavior pattern decline and goal seeking fig 9a with only three out of the 100 simulations producing a markedly different ending population size examining the native animal mean and standard deviations showed that the monthly variation in population was demonstrably low relative to changes in the mortality rate graphical function fig 9b similar results were observed for changes in expected planting density fig 9c and d only two out of 100 simulations produced a significantly different outcome for both native animals and npv of irrigation fig 9e and f following ford and flynn 2005 correlation coefficients cc were calculated between the inputs m and p with the observed output data in native animals and npv of irrigation ending cc values shown in table 3 increasing the magnitude of the departure m from the original graphical functions for mortality rate resulted in smaller native animals populations indicated by negative polarity in the sign of the cc increasing the point of departure p also had a negative but weaker influence on native animals this may also be intuited given the slope of the graphical function fig 8b given that larger departure values on per capita forage availability will raise mortality rate i e smaller per capita forage availability larger mortality rate smaller native animal population similar effects on native animals were observed given m and p distortions on expected planting density conversely larger departures had a positive influence on the npv of irrigation i e greater planting density greater crop production and harvest greater crop profit greater npv graphical functions and their particular shapes are often the most debated functions during model development and overlooked parameter values during model testing given the extraordinary range of possibilities that graphical functions can take on it is important that the model withstand alternative graphical forms all models express numerical sensitivity to changes in parameter values but models should be able to produce the behavior mode described in the dynamic hypothesis for a wide range of parameter values including graphical functions 4 3 3 sensitivity of behavior patterns the final sensitivity analysis demonstrated here pertains to multivariate tests using statistical screening ford and flynn 2005 and behavior pattern measures hekimoǧlu and barlas 2016 to facilitate both tests one set of 11 parameters and their ranges were specified table 4 and simulated for 100 model runs a form of monte carlo simulation to observe the resulting behaviors in key system variables native animals ecosystem plants total crop harvest the npv of irrigation and several key behavior pattern measures for native animals described below native animals ecosystem plants and total crop harvest were chosen because these were the key stocks of the model that in the real world are most likely to be measured and monitored given the problem at hand while npv of irrigation an auxiliary variable was chosen given that it integrates the outcomes that arise from the interrelated nature of the model s agriculture ecologic and economic components table 4 unfortunately comprehensive sensitivity analysis of all uncertain parameters over their entire range of possible values is for most practical purposes impossible sterman 2000 given this constraint parameters used for sensitivity testing must be selected for typically by identifying those you suspect hypothesize are both highly uncertain and likely to be influential those that are not entirely under control of decision makers but must be managed if a desired outcome is to be achieved which parameters are deemed most important to decision making by working with stakeholders or problem owners defining worst and best case scenarios about the problem at hand and then backing into variables needed to create such scenarios or some combination of the above sterman 2000 in this particular case sensitivity input variables were selected based on their hypothesized uncertainty and influence on the system and those that although not entirely within control of stakeholders are key factors that must be managed if a solution is to be reached table 4 the statistical screening approach was used to evaluate the relative strength and polarity of each parameter on the key variable output behaviors where the input and output values are regressed for each time unit of the simulation varying these input parameter values simultaneously created much more variability in system behavior modes fig 10 relative to the previous sensitivity tests described above first both total crop harvest and npv of irrigation which express linear growth behavior modes indicated a clear shift or break between profitable and unprofitable combinations of inputs fig 10a and c however in general both total harvest and npv of irrigation grew linearly fig 10b and d on the other hand ecosystem plants and native animals expressed several behavior modes fig 10e and g in general exhibiting a goal seeking decline behavior mode fig 10f and h examination of the ending cc values between input parameters and system stocks indicate the relative strength and polarity of the link from inputs to model behavior positive cc values indicate positive polarity negative cc values indicate negative polarity while values closer to 0 indicate relative weaker degree of influence and values closer to 1 or 1 indicating stronger degree of influence on the system behavior the two variables with the strongest influence across the entire system were base water diversions and irrigation efficiency ccs ranging from 0 76 to 0 58 table 5 the next most influential variables included base crop planting density and price per ton of crop ccs ranging from 0 29 to 0 27 the remaining input parameters held relatively weak influence on system behaviors cc values between 0 15 and 0 15 a key insight of the cc analysis that corroborates the dynamic hypothesis as well as previous model testing is the polarity between agricultural components total crop harvest and the ecosystem ecosystem plants and native animals for the most part parameters that have a positive polarity influence on agricultural components expressed a negative polarity influence on ecosystem components and vice versa the value of the cc analysis is that it illustrates and quantifies the trade offs between the agricultural and ecological components in this system lastly one may notice the annual cycle in ecosystem plants and native animals which is driven by the annual growth season in plants and the resulting balance with native animals however the trajectory of their behaviors does not express this annual oscillation since the overall behavior pattern changes depending on whether or not the growth was greater than or equal to decomposition and grazing in which case plants are stable if not they decline or if births were greater than or equal to deaths in which case animals are stable if not animals decline therefore in this case the cc values would not be significantly different if the cycle point varies at the end of the simulation i e the trajectory or spread in cc values would not be different only the ending point values however in more cyclical or oscillatory systems one may examine the behavior pattern of the cc itself to understand how the cc between inputs and behavior patterns evolve over the course of the simulation ford and flynn 2005 to take statistical screening a step further and complete the behavior pattern measures analysis the same parameters and ranges of values were used but rather than observing changes in specific system variables we observe the resulting changes in the output of behavior pattern measures in this case for native animals after visually screening the sensitivity results we observe that native animals expressed several behavior modes 1 goal seeking decline and growth to a new equilibrium 2 goal seeking decline to a reduced population 3 goal seeking collapse defined as population levels below three animals which effectively eliminates any possibility of successful species reproduction and 4 linear decline fig 10g and h generic behavior modes shown in the appendix fig a1 after grouping the data based on visually classifying the behavior patterns we specify pattern measures that differentiate each unique pattern equilibrium level pattern 1 n 39 defined as the mean native animals at the final month inflection point and inflection level pattern 2 n 12 defined by the largest value of the first derivative of mean animals and the level of animals at that point time to collapse pattern 3 n 43 defined at the time at which native animals falls below three and slope pattern 4 n 6 defined as the difference between initial and final native animals divided by the final simulation time following hekimoǧlu and barlas 2016 simulation runs were grouped by behavior pattern pattern measures were estimated from each simulation run values were standardized eq 3 and then input parameters were regressed to behavior pattern measures for each behavior pattern regression equations using the eleven parameters in table 5 were built to examine the effects that each had on the key output behavior pattern measure table 6 regression results indicate the most significant parameters that lead to a particular behavior pattern the regression equations for the two most common behavior patterns goal seeking decline with growth to equilibrium n 39 goal

pattern 2 described above since no significant parameters were identified or for slope used for pattern 4 described above due to inadequate sample size it was not surprising that no significant parameters were identified in the case of behavior pattern 2 which is the same generic behavior pattern as pattern 4 goal seeking collapse the most significant parameter in goal seeking collapse base water diversion rate also had the lowest p values for both behavior pattern measures for pattern 2 therefore we may infer that the primary behavior mode expressed by the model is goal seeking decline n 12 pattern 2 43 pattern 3 55 total goal seeking decline but that significant collapse is not induced unless the base water diversion rate reaches a high enough threshold in the equilibrium case base crop planting density base water diversions irrigation efficiency and price per ton all significantly influenced the equilibrium population size the native animal population was able to achieve importantly all significant factors possessed negative polarities for example greater planting density water diversions irrigation efficiency or crop price lead to lower equilibrium levels in native animals this logically follows due to the trade off between the agricultural system productivity and ecosystem productivity given feedback processes influencing the allocation of resources the other major behavior pattern was goal seeking decline to a nonviable population where the behavior pattern measure was the time to collapse in this case the only significant factor was base water diversion while other important variables were annual infrastructure costs and discount rate insignificance of other factors indicate less importance in creating the observed behavior pattern results from both the statistical screening and behavior mode sensitivity analysis are summarized in table 7 key input parameters are ranked based on their influence and polarity on either maintaining a higher equilibrium of native animals versus the time to collapse in native animals in the goal seeking collapse case 4 4 comparative analysis of alternative assumptions decision rules or policies counterfactuals or what ifs whereas the tests to this point have dealt with examining robustness and developing depth of system understanding both of which primarily reside in model development and evaluation stages of the modeling process the remaining tests focus on effectively using a model to generate insights needed for constructing and advocating for policy or strategy recommendations generating model insights via alternative assumptions decision rules or policies can take the form of counterfactual trajectory analyses boundary adequacy tests on model behavior and policy recommendations or intervention studies each of which can be formulated using what if experiments these experiments provide opportunities to examine how emergent pressures arise or can be mitigated for whether or not the effects of additional model structure in biophysical decision making spatial components or the interactions among them changes the final model results and management recommendations and to estimate the risk associated with adopting particularly new decisions or policies forrester and senge 1980 we illustrate three such tests by posing specific what if questions aimed at generating management insights via counterfactual trajectories boundary adequacy and intervention thresholds 4 4 1 counterfactual trajectories counterfactual trajectories involve altering the basic model assumptions or conditions in ways that are either known to be wrong haven t been observed in the historical record or were not assumed important enough during model development to be included in the model structure a counterfactual trajectory is therefore a quantifiable and rigorous thought experiment a key assumption of the model presented here is that there has been and will be a consistent reliable surface water source based on existing information calibrated to a long run mean of 100 c f s a reasonable hypothesis would be that the insights generated by the model would be significantly different if a counterfactual condition regarding incoming surface water flows were used therefore we posed the following what if question what if the river flow assumptions 100 c f s across the time horizon of simulation are incorrect an alternative assumption is that river flow is highly variable due to climate and watershed characteristics varying from zero i e no flow is the worst drought years to 125 c f s representing the occasional wet years of exceptional precipitation to test this counterfactual assumption in the model minimum zero c f s maximum 125 c f s and standard deviations 75 c f s in river flow rate were added to the model as auxiliary variable inputs to river flow river flow rf recall as an input to eq 4 then becomes a random function 10 rf n μ σ 2 where μ is the mean river flow 100 c f s and σ is the expected standard deviation in flow rate 11 11 in the vensim modeling environment the built in function random normal can be used such as random normal river flow min river flow max river flow mean river flow standard deviation river flow seed value including the seed value provides means for adequate comparisons across simulations because the seed provides unique random sequence of values for each unique seed value using this alternative assumption we generate a dynamic rather than static trajectory in river flow fig 11 a due to the river flow variability irrigation diversion rates during the growing season are less reliable fig 11b leading to a decline in crop production fig 11c this is due to the economic response in the agricultural sector which alters cropping intensity based on changes in profitability loop r1 in fig 2 the more profitable the agricultural sector the greater investment in agriculture leading to greater crop intensity the less profitable lesser investment and intensity this feedback contributes to the gradual decline in crop production as the intensity of production lessens over time ecosystem plants responded annually changes in flow fig 11d but because of habitat loss during droughts and in the most sensitive parts of the year the native animal population declines fig 11e finally the npv of irrigation never approached breakeven since crop production declines revenues were not able to recoup costs of irrigation fig 11f what management or policy recommendations would be altered given this counterfactual assumption in river flow first altering flows to include both wet and dry year cycles does not alleviate the pressure to the native animal population as any benefit of improved habitat and per capita forage availability experienced during wet years is not enough to overcome the losses in dry years therefore the management and policy concerns for the native population remains regardless of the flow assumptions compared here however new management pressures arise in the agricultural sector given the collapse in crop production and economic failure of investing in the irrigation system if given the alternative river flow trajectory collapse in the agricultural sector is expected policy makers would be faced with the trade off of either not approving the investment if being analyzed prospectively halting crop production before the irrigation investment npv worsens after the first 10 years if being analyzed retrospectively or creating support mechanisms for the agricultural sector such that it is less susceptible to reductions in river flow e g insurance that offsets annual losses improvements in irrigation efficiency the first two responses would lead to improvements in native animal population since irrigation diversion would cease but would ensure a non viable agricultural sector in the third response the decline in native animal population would only accelerate since irrigation diversions would not be as responsive to changes in river flow under an insurance scheme or because of the reduction in return flows to the refuge under improved irrigation efficiency therefore given these counterfactual river flow assumptions management and policy pressures arising due to agricultural collapse would erode conservation oriented efforts to balance irrigation economics and the wildlife refuge under the original static river flow assumption reductions in base water diversion rate and irrigation efficiency were pinpointed as the most significant factors conducive of sustaining a stable native animal population table 4 counterfactual trajectories such as these aid in examining the trade offs and consequences of alternative assumptions appendix section 3 4 provides an example of a failed counterfactual tests 4 4 2 boundary adequacy testing boundary adequacy testing can be used in the context of model structure is the model boundary appropriate given the model purpose behavior can new model structure be conceptualized that significantly alters its behavior or policy how does modifying the model boundary alter policy recommendations forrester and senge 1980 here we focus on model boundary tests in the context of behavior and policy recommendations the current model boundary fig 2 encompasses the wildlife refuge that is habitat for the ecosystem plants and native animals the surrounding cropland and the river flow that supplies surface water diversions for irrigation a relevant boundary adequacy test would be expansion of the model boundary to include a new state stock variable capable of expressing its own unique dynamics after adding the new structure we can then examine how the expanded model may influence the problem of interest in this case we expand the model boundary by asking what if the watershed constructed a reservoir system for irrigation deliveries that would help regulate river flow and avoid the effects caused by seasonal river flow diversions for irrigation the hypothesis here would be that the reservoir would help redistribute the water supply from the non growing season to the growing season thereby reducing the impact of irrigation to the refuge to complete this test additional model structure was added representing reservoir storage and release fig 12 a in the added structure a certain percentage of river flow 30 is diverted for storage with the remainder immediately released for the ecosystem 70 the diversions enter a reservoir storage which incurs losses due to natural leakage and evaporation 0 001 and through downstream releases releases downstream are a function of the reservoir release time capturing average residence time of water in storage 12 months plus the water released for irrigation during the crop growing season i e no water for irrigation is released during the non growing season since no new agronomic assumptions are included in this scenario once water for irrigation is delivered it remains subject to the same irrigation efficiencies and return flow rates as the base case by storing water during the non growing season and releasing it throughout the year we hypothesize that a different behavior pattern will arise in the native animal population the resulting behavior patterns given the expanded model boundary are then compared to the behaviors prior to model boundary expansion adding the reservoir storage and release structure did improve the native animal population size relative to 30 direct surface water diversions for irrigation but did not change the overall behavior pattern fig 12b this is a strong test of the model boundary that due to the resulting behavior in native animals strengthens confidence in the original boundary if the test resulted in a different behavior mode in native animals reexamining the original model structure and its links to the native animal population would be warranted an additional boundary experiment includes examining alternative policy recommendations that would arise given the expanded model boundary and structure representing reservoir storage first we identify the management recommendation concerning irrigation diversions under the original model boundary and given the policy goal is to achieve a stable native animal population in equilibrium that still allows for profitable crop production we then identify the management recommendation under the expanded model boundary and compare that to the original recommendation in order to identify these points the base water diversion rate used for determining irrigation was manipulated by hand until the policy goal conditions were reached under the original model boundary the base water diversion rate found to balance native animals without jeopardizing crop production and profitability was 25 of river flows without any reservoir storage potential fig 13 a incoming river flow to the refuge is anchored to the total river flow 100 c f s in the non growing season but is subject to large declines during the growing season to as low as 70 c f s when the refuge needs water the most fig 13b due to return flows the incoming flow to the refuge peaks over 100 c f s but the marginal benefit of the additional flow is negligible since it occurs after the primary growing season ecosystem plants with the reduction in incoming river flows during the growing season declines to a peak of 12 000 tons fig 13c while crop production peaks at 2 000 tons fig 13d the goal to maintain a viable native animal population and a profitable agricultural system is achieved with mean animals ending at 15 head fig 13e and npv of irrigation ending above 200 000 fig 13f under the expanded model boundary the storage water diversion rate i e the percentage of river flow diverted to storage found to balance native animals without jeopardizing crop production and profitability was also 25 given that diversion rate reservoir storage would need to be capable of storing between 40 000 and 50 000 acre feet of water fig 13a because the river flow is being redistributed with storage the incoming flow to the refuge was anchored at 75 rather than 100 c f s fig 13b however the refuge receives more water during the growing season up to 90 c f s due to the releases from storage combined with return flows from the irrigation system this leads to a more stable ecosystem plant community fig 13c and greater irrigation levels supportive of almost double crop production fig 13d with a more stable plant community native animals reach equilibrium near 20 head 33 compared to the original recommendation above the npv of irrigation reached over 800 000 or a 400 increase over the original recommendation due to increased crop productivity as observed here the expanded model boundary would lead to significantly different management recommendations appendix section 3 4 provides examples of failed boundary adequacy tests one might encounter 4 4 3 determination of intervention thresholds finally we estimate the intervention thresholds i e the minimum intervention size and intervention time that results in the desired behavior change for the native species population as shown in fig 3 the atomic behavior pattern exhibited by the native animal population given irrigation diversions is goal seeking decline the desired post intervention behavior would be s shaped growth which would reflect a population that increases up to a new equilibrium level equal to the baseline population prior to irrigation diversion potential behavior shown appendix fig a1 assume that construction of the reservoir system described in the previous section would not be approved due to other social environmental and economic concerns e g rural community relocation fish habitat connectivity uncertain npv due to regulatory and litigation costs other possible interventions include reintroducing new animals once the population declines below a population threshold determined by the policy makers or importing feed resources as supplement to offset losses in ecosystem plants both of these interventions are unfortunately low leverage we can infer from the previous experiments the chain of causality driving native animal population declines the feedback process between ecosystem plants regulated by river flow and native animals via per capita forage availability declines in native animal population are a symptom of the problem which at the structural level arises where river flow supplies the refuge reintroducing animals or supplying feed resource supplementation are symptomatic solutions which may work only in the short term and at a very high cost to the system appendix section 3 4 provides the simulation evidence for these a more fundamental solution would be address the problem at the refuge level for example what if rather than focusing on symptomatic solutions of the native animal population via policy interventions that prop up the population investment is made in expanding the wildlife refuge under such a scenario effort may be made to improve the surrounding habitat for the population and expand the wildlife refuge thereby increasing the per capita forage availability in order to implement this test a refuge expansion intervention function is added to the model similar to the step equation in eq 6 where a specified refuge expansion rate zero to 100 and refuge expansion time are determined the refuge expansion intervention applies to the stock of ecosystem plants based on the refuge expansion rate e g a 100 refuge expansion rate would double the size of the current refuge expanding the suitable habitat would create additional land costs but with greater forage availability for native animals we would hypothesize that the behavior pattern of native animals is shifted from a decline oriented behavior to one of s shaped growth and stabilization to test this hypothesis and identify the minimum intervention needed for returning the native animal population back to its initial state mean 25 animals we apply a latin grid experimental design similar to the sensitivity tests in section 4 3 3 with the input parameters being refuge expansion rate ranging from zero no expansion to one doubling the refuge size in increments of 0 01 and refuge expansion time ranging from 120 months to 240 months in increments of 1 2 months this latin grid experimental design 100 100 resulted in 10 000 simulations one for every unique combination of refuge expansion rate and refuge expansion time 12 12 in the vensim modeling environment these simulations were completed in under five minutes with the grid selection based on refuge expansion rate the 10 year or 120 month period for refuge intervention time was not evenly distributed therefore the simulation results were matched to the nearest whole month the latin grid design is preferred over monte carlo simulation in this case because of the explicit interest in identifying the specific intervention size and time that results in the desired behavior pattern use of monte carlo simulation risks duplicating certain input values or at least very near combinations of values and does not guarantee that all possible combinations of input values will be sampled a latin grid design ensures all possible combinations of input values are sampled and although computationally intensive is still more efficient than the required sample size to achieve the necessary input combinations using monte carlo simulation following walrave 2016 an indicator value was specified to determine if the desired behavior shift was achieved in this case the indicator variable used was the moving average of native animals and its first derivative 13 13 the natural behavior mode for native animals is oscillation but with the onset of irrigation the overall pattern becomes goal seeking decline however the infinitesimal changes in native animals even under goal seeking decline still express oscillations albeit with smaller and smaller amplitudes because the first derivative of oscillatory behavior modes is misleading we use the first derivative of the moving average of the stock walrave 2017 mean native animals was chosen as the behavior pattern measure given that the behavior of native animals inherently oscillates due to annual reproduction and mortality dynamics and because the oscillation can grow or decline as ecosystem conditions change such as it does with the onset of irrigation i e the population does not oscillate around a stable fixed point using the moving average smooths out these oscillations resulting in a behavior where the signs of the first and second derivatives are quite stable under goal seeking decline the value of the first derivative of mean native animals is negative and under goal seeking growth it is positive therefore we monitor the number of sign changes in the first derivative of mean native animals from negative to positive if a change in sign does occur we then identify if the mean population size reaches its desired level prior to irrigation 25 animals the results of the intervention experiment are shown in fig 14 including the percentile intervals and intervention threshold graph percentile intervals display the percentage of simulations falling within a particular range at a given point in time as expected ecosystem plants increased as a result of refuge expansion fig 14a with over half of the intervention combinations resulting in peaks up to 21 000 tons due to the additional land costs involved with improving the surrounding habitat and expanding the refuge the npv of irrigation does decline but even the most extreme outcomes result in positive npv near 100 000 fig 14b importantly these two outcomes illustrate that the intervention strategy does expand the refuge and can do so without financially taxing the system to an unprofitable level the behavior pattern changes in the native animal population resulting from the intervention combination were much more dynamic relative to ecosystem plants and npv of irrigation fig 14c nearly half of the simulations made no shift in behavior pattern 40 of all simulations of the 60 of simulations that did create a behavior pattern shift from goal seeking decline to s shaped growth only 9 achieved a mean native animal population of 25 animals using the resulting simulation data an interventions threshold graph was constructed to illustrate the combination of minimum refuge intervention sizes and refuge intervention times that would be required to achieve an s shaped growth to equilibrium of at least 25 animals fig 14d in order to shift the behavior pattern from decline to growth the minimum refuge intervention size was 39 in month 120 increasing up to 50 in month 240 denoted as ẋ 0 any refuge intervention size below 39 would not reverse the native animal population decline in order to restore the native animal population denoted as ẋ 0 ӯ 25 the minimum refuge intervention size would have to be at least 79 at month 120 up to 95 by month 186 after month 186 the intervention size would have to be more than double the size of the current refuge over 1 on fig 14d outside the range of values performed in the experiment the resulting graphs indicate the minimum combination of intervention inputs needed to create a shift the dominant feedback processes i e tipping point from goal seeking decline negative feedback to s shaped growth positive feedback an important note regarding intervention thresholds such as these is that the intervention combinations included in the experiment had dissimilar incubation times due to a fixed end point of the simulation at 360 months because of this novel behavior characteristics may be exhibited beyond month 360 that would not be observable with a fixed final simulation time but could be included under a dynamic final simulation time 5 conclusion dynamic systems models are increasingly used by scientists managers and policy makers due to the growing complexity and interdependency of problems that persist in ecologic and socio economic systems coupled to this is the growing awareness that when confronted with such complexity our human intuition rarely properly infers the underlying dynamics driving decision making and its outcomes formal mathematical models are therefore essential tools for improving our understanding and decision making in the face of such complexity the above experimental examples illustrate a number of key tests with increasing degree of difficulty from novice to advanced skill levels any investigator can and should perform in order to evaluate and test their particular model each of the experiments demonstrate several key lessons 1 that model experiments help uncover unforeseen flaws or incorrect formulations including flaws in our own mental models since all models are based on our mental representations of a given problem or system 2 that good model experiments provide a means to glean valuable insights about the structure and behavior of a model and 3 model experiments enhance the confidence validity of the model for its intended use especially after the iterative process of identifying errors or flaws in model structure or behavior updating and improving our mental model and then revising the formal simulation model in turn the comprehensive suite of tests explored is not an exhaustive list of model testing procedures as there a number of other advanced methods for understanding uncertain parameter values identifying dominant feedback structures and testing alternative decision making theories although insightful such tests are beyond the skill level of novice modelers and depending on the problem and objective of the model the insights generated may not be important to the issue or efficient to attain given the required investment in time and resources novices should be aware of what expert modelers will recognize from the experiments and discussion presented above that model development and experimentation is an iterative process often requiring numerous iterations of experimentation analysis and revision to both mental and simulation models fig 1 the experimental results and discussion in this paper are the final product of that iterative process in early stages of development a model will not perform adequately when exposed to the barrage of tests outlined above and novices will soon find errors or omissions in model structure that lead to implausible or unexpected behaviors that require explanation and correction the model presented above was exposed to numerous rounds of revision and correction prior to passing the model behavior experiments then it was exposed to comprehensive sensitivity analyses after adequately withstanding the sensitivity tests the model moved forward to the more complex experiments dealing with alternative assumptions and structure novices should not be discouraged when their models fail any of these tests along the reiterative modeling process failing any one test can be expected and provides the needed feedback to the modeler about which model component needs to be improved prior to looking for strategy or policy insights to guide decision making the increasing interest in and more frequent application of systems models by ecologists agriculturalists and natural resource managers is a positive indicator of the recognition of modeling as a valuable tool to better understand and manage the complex dynamic systems that we operate in employing such models has the potential to increase our understanding of the many poorly understood feedback processes that must be well managed if such systems are to function as society desires if researchers who begin or are currently using systems modeling approaches do not have at least a basic understanding of the highly iterative systems analysis process or of the fundamental experimental tests that are required to build confidence that the resulting model is trustworthy to be used the potential for making management and policy recommendations based on fundamentally flawed analyses i e incorrect and unreliable model recommendations is high this paper provides a basic introduction and guide to experimental testing of a developed model in order to build confidence that the model is capable of providing robust insight into a given problem by providing this guide we hope that more modelers will be better prepared to build evaluate and test their models such that the resulting model generated insights will be more capable of mitigating unintended consequences or improving desired functions of the complex ecological or natural resource systems we are tasked with managing declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

over time are indicators of the underlying feedback processes that interact to produce the observed behavior pattern of a particular variable of interest in a system from a systems thinking perspective these feedback processes are often simplified into single loop positive reinforcing or negative balancing processes perceived to be the dominant parameters or feedback structure unfortunately without a rigorous quantitative analysis identification of the most influential parameters and feedback structure is spurious at best therefore it is important to be able to

data file of the intervention thresholds results fig a2 provides an expanded conceptual model of fig 2 in the paper for additional details regarding auxiliary variables included around the core feedback structure 3 examples of common model revisions made during iterative model testing process one may observe that the model presented in the paper successfully passed all of the performed tests as noted in the text modeling is an iterative process the presented results being the end of a longer series of experimentation and model revision in order to illustrate how these techniques and tests work together in practice in an iterative model development testing and revision process this appendix section provides examples of situations where the model either mental or quantitative failed a test and therefore required revision of the model the revisions here are meant to illustrate common mistakes that many particularly beginners may encounter not an exhaustive protocol for model error identification 3 1 extreme conditions tests there are several common errors or mistakes one may find when the extreme conditions test is failed consider the example from section 4 3 1 where river flow is increased from 100 c f s to 150 c f s and the resulting behavior pattern observed in ecosystem plants and native animals is runaway exponential growth fig a3 a and b in order to correct this we may inspect the stock flow and auxiliary structures around ecosystem plants and native animals we may find that we originally parameterized the graphical function ecosystem growth rate with a minimum value of 0 002 at 20 000 tons of ecosystem plants because many dynamic modeling programs default to extrapolation of graphical functions at the end points for input values beyond the parameterized range having a positive value for the growth rate at the estimated biophysical maximum value of 20 000 tons means that for any value of ecosystem plants above 20 000 tons defaults to a 0 002 growth rate per month fig a3 panel c leading to greater ecosystem plants subject to the same 0 002 growth rate per month this leads to the runaway growth behavior in fig a3 panel a the native animal population without any forage limitation also grows in conjunction with ecosystem plants fig a3 panel b by adjusting the ecosystem growth rate to 0 at the biophysical maximum for the habitat in the refuge 20 000 tons means that any values of ecosystem plants above 20 000 tons will default to 0 for the growth rate fig a3 panel d and therefore ecosystem plants will cease to grow exponentially suppose that change is made and we expect to see the problem corrected in the model yet we still observe runaway exponential growth in native animals and runaway exponential decay in ecosystem plants fig a4 we again examine the stock flow and auxiliary variable structures around each variable we find that the resulting behavior pattern is due to grazing loss to ecosystem plants increasing exponentially fig a4 panel a due to the fact that grazing loss is directly proportional to native animals fig a4 panel b in reality we know that ecosystem plants and native animals being a physical quantities cannot take on negative values in the case of ecosystem plants or grow forever despite the fact that there are no resources to do so in the case of native animals further checks of the model reveals that native animals was first parameterized with a static natality values with natality possessing a greater value than the mortality index when natality mortality the result is exponential growth in the population in order to alleviate this issue a dynamic natality rate was developed fig a4 panel c the assumption here would be that if the population declines below the expected equilibrium value of 25 animals the natality rate also declines due to the greater energy requirements for searching for and finding reproductive mates correcting this should bring the dynamic natality rate into equilibrium with the mortality rate a function of the forage availability index fig a2 by doing so native animals and therefore grazing loss will be constrained in addition we don t want ecosystem plants to take on negative values examining the outflows reveals that the model lacked first order negative feedback controls to regulate the stock flow dynamics to be physically conserved in the first instance grazing loss was simply a function of consumption rate native animals x forage consumption per month with the revised model grazing loss is regulated by ecosystem plants such that the grazing cannot exceed the available biomass in the ecosystem plant stock grazing loss min consumption rate ecosystem plants decomposition 3 2 step pulse and ramp functions examining how a model responds to various steps pulses or ramps is an valuable exercise in developing depth of system understanding and like extreme conditions tests helps identify places for model improvement when the simulation results fail to align with expected or observed behaviors in the real world system first consider a step change in planting costs the most significant annual input cost to the irrigation system from 50 to 100 dollars per ton fig a5 panel a due to the increase in cost we would expect profitability to decline leading to feedback sequence of declines in subsequent planting and irrigation rates crop production and finally long term profits however we see that annual costs decline into negative values fig a5 panel b because annual costs are an outflow from cumulative profits fig a2 and stock or state variables are typically difference equations stock inflow outflow when outflows take on negative values they inadvertently increase the value of the stock which in this case is the profitability of the irrigation system since profitability is improved rather and stressed the adjusted crop planting density is continually adjusted up further reinforcing crop profitability r1 in fig a2 the observation that annual costs become negative is clear indication that we erroneously inserted the wrong sign either to the cost function flow or cumulative profit equation stock identifying and reversing the sign so that costs are positive which have a negative effect on profitability corrects the issue in section 4 3 1 a pulse function was applied to river flow in order to mimic periodic drought conditions fig a6 panel a and observe the responses in ecosystem plants and native animals in an earlier iteration of the test suppose we observe that native animals are hardly effected by the loss of ecosystem plants in drought years and that they rebound back to near their long run equilibrium value much too quickly fig a6 panels b and c having previously examined the stock flow structures around ecosystem plants as well as the natality rate in native animals we now examine the forage availability index ecosystem plants native animals influence on mortality rate b1 in fig a2 this graphical function was parameterized using a distribution derived from data collected from the real world system with a mean 200 tons per head corresponding to 14 mortality rate unfortunately this form of graphical function breaks several best modeling practices first graphical functions should not start and end in the same place in this case at 0 mortality rate on the tails of each side of the curve because of the function is parabolic with one side exhibiting a positive slope and another side exhibiting a negative slope interpretation of the polarity of this variable on native animals is confounding because it both accelerates and slows mortality rate depending on which side of the distribution the forage availability index value falls on although some circumstances may call for using a specified distribution which many programs allow via built in function rather than graphical table functions it is questionable here since the estimated mortality rate given the drought conditions only 5 out of the 30 years falls near the right and left bounds of the distribution for mortality rate due to sampling for ecosystem plants that did not accurately account for years of drought graphical functions can indeed be nonlinear but should have either a positive or negative slope not both in this case removing the left tail positive slope of the distribution fig a6 panel e corrects the polarity error resulting in native animals that express a more realistic and expected decline in behavior pattern fig a6 panel f not all model revisions will be in the quantitative model but rather correct model performance that we did not properly intuit should lead us to revise our mental model consider a linear ramp function similar to that applied to river flow in section 4 3 1 but instead applied to irrigation efficiency in the river flow test a linear increase in river flow led to a linear increase in crop production fig 7 and profits this was simple enough to mentally intuit since there was no change in the rate in which water was converted into crop production only the volume of water applied as irrigation however applying a positively sloped ramp change to irrigation efficiency fig a7 panel a increases the rate at which irrigation applications are converted into crop production fig a7 panel b however because of the economic feedback between the cropping system and profitability r1 and r2 in fig a2 greater crop production improves profit signaling for greater planting densities in subsequent years which increases demand for and applications of irrigation water that produces greater crop volumes because of the positively sloped ramp intuitively we may suspect that the linear improvement in irrigation efficiency would lead to linear increases in the cropping system the result however is a nonlinear or exponential increase in water use crop production and profitability due to the underlying feedback processes fig a2 in this particular test the model was operating correctly and helped expose a limitation in our mental model updating our mental models to be more representative of the dynamic and nonlinear nature of the systems we work in although challenging is greatly enhanced by the use of models for this reason 3 3 identification of behavior patterns as described in table 2 one of the common limitations in novice modelers is properly differentiating between alternative behavior patterns given the irrigation wildlife refuge data fig 3 and the atomic behavior patterns fig a1 we can identify the resulting behavior patterns exhibited from the sensitivity analysis or expected patterns of behavior during intervention analysis fig a8 3 4 comparative analysis of alternative assumptions decision rules or policies counterfactuals or what ifs the final set of examples illustrate some iterative model revision steps during counterfactual trajectory analysis boundary adequacy testing and intervention analysis counterfactual trajectories provide a means to examine model behavior under alternative basic assumptions underpinning the model about past or potential future conditions however the failure to adequately envision conditions that are significantly different than the original model assumptions may mislead modelers to conclude that the problem behavior being modeled is robust enough that even under alternative conditions the same behavior patterns are observed this could become particularly problematic when decisions will be based on insights generated from counterfactual tests for example the counterfactual test in section 4 4 1 represented a test for extremely variable river flow distributed from 0 to 125 c f s and illustrated that both the native animals and the irrigation system would be highly vulnerable to long term variability in river flows however if the counterfactual assumptions are more conservative e g river from 60 to 125 c f s fig a9 panel a the resulting behavior patterns in crop production panel b ecosystem plants panel c and native animals panel d would be the same as the observed conditions that motivated the study failure to envision a significantly new set of conditions runs the risk of basing new strategy or policy changes on flawed insights about the range of possible behavior patterns the model expresses boundary adequacy tests require expansion of the model structure to incorporate elements previously not contained in the original endogenous feedback structure of the model this requires creativity to envision and design new model structure failure to do so may lead modelers to look for alternative adjustments to expand model structure for example a stock may be disaggregated into a series of stock flow structures in this case the stock of native animals may be disaggregated into several age classes that progress from younger to older individuals fig a10 panel a unfortunately this does not expand the model boundary only adds specificity to model structure within the existing model boundary simulating the model with the disaggregated native animal stocks leads to an oscillatory behavior pattern in native animals fig a10 panel b and ecosystem plants fig a10 panel c which is not observed in the real world system fig 3 in section 4 1 which may lead one to make erroneous conclusions about the adequacy of the existing model boundary and structure another boundary adequacy pitfall is likely to be insuring that once new model structure is created that the feedback connectivity is correctly linked with the original model structures for example consider the reservoir storage stock flow structure from section 4 4 2 assume that the new structure is correctly formulated and upon simulation the reservoir storage stock indeed behaves the way we would expect fig a11 panel a however the volume of flow entering the river refuge fig 11 panel b remains static and the resulting dynamics in ecosystem plants and native animals fig 11 panels c and d remain unchanged because the reservoir storage capacity is not infinite we know that some water has to be released downstream to the refuge so the fact that river refuge flow is static is a key indicator that not all of the feedback connections have been incorporated yet lastly in searching for interventions to alleviate the systemic root cause of the problem we can test our intuitions about strategies that would work only symptomatically in the short term for example reintroducing animals fig a12 panel a only increases the native animal population for the year they are introduced since the ecosystem plants required to support the population remain unchanged panel b as irrigation water diversion continues to support the base crop production panel c on the other hand supplemental feeding for native animals up to 95 of their forage demand to alleviate pressure on ecosystem plants does work in the short to medium term fig a13 panels a and b but because revision to the water allocation mechanisms that drive both the refuge and irrigation system remain unchanged the irrigation system represented by crop production and adjusted water irrigation level panels c and d is still allowed to grow albeit at a slower rate due to the costs of importing the supplemental feed although feeding works moderately well the long term result of the system is the same as if no feeding would have occurred 
24758,the use of dynamic systems models by scientists managers and policy makers is becoming more common due to the increasingly complex nature of ecological and socio economic problems unfortunately most scientific training in the life sciences only includes dynamic modeling as elective supplementary courses at a beginners level which is not conducive to generating the expertise needed to properly develop test and learn from dynamic modeling approaches and risks utilization of poor quality models and adoption of unreliable recommendations the objective of this paper is to fill part of that gap particularly regarding model experimentation by summarizing key concepts in experimental design for simulation experiments and illustrating hands on examples of experiments needed for developing a deeper understanding of complex dynamic systems the experiments include extreme conditions testing sensitivity analyses of model behaviors given variation in both parameter values and graphical table functions and what if experiments e g counterfactual trajectories boundary adequacy tests and intervention threshold experiments each experimental example describes the theoretical foundation of the test illustrates its application using an ecological systems model and increases in degree of difficulty from novice to advanced skill levels by doing so we demonstrate consistent scientific means to glean valuable insights about the model s structure behavior link uncover any unforeseen model flaws or incorrect formulations and enhance the confidence validity of the model for its intended use graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dynamic modeling experimental design sensitivity analysis what if analysis systems simulation system dynamics 1 introduction mathematical models particularly dynamic systems models are quantitative descriptions of the natural and social processes underlying the functions and patterns observed in the real world models have become increasingly useful for scientists managers and policy makers due to their ability to capture complex natural and socio economic processes and the couplings between them and present them in a way that inspires scientific creativity improves management decision making informs policy making processes and critiques or enlightens prevailing mental models meadows and robinson 1985 sterman 1994 sterman 2002 despite this growing interest in and use of dynamic modeling approaches most scientific training in the life sciences only includes modeling and simulation of such systems as elective or minor courses at a beginners level or are applied to problems with a narrow model boundary or scope e g single to a few system processes rather than interactions between ecologic environmental agricultural and economic elements which may limit accumulation of diverse modeling expertise in such fields the general lack of scientific training needed to generate capable expertise to properly develop test and learn from dynamic modeling approaches can lead to poor quality models that produce unreliable management recommendations especially in systems that cannot be reasonably physically studied or tested because of spatial or temporal limitations because of this growing gap resources are needed to aid scientists in improving their proficiency in model development and use the aim of this paper is to fill part of that gap particularly regarding model experimentation typically the modeling process encompasses five key steps 1 problem articulation boundary definition identification of reference mode behaviors establishment of relevant time horizons and statement of modeling objectives 2 dynamic hypothesis formation and conceptual model development e g causal maps subsystem diagrams etc 3 quantitative model development whereby equations parameters initial conditions and decision rules are specified to arrive at a simulate able model 4 model evaluation or testing whereby developers inspect model structures and outputs to estimate its overall performance towards the model goals which often includes comparison of model generated data to observed data extreme condition and or sensitivity testing etc and 5 policy strategy design and evaluation whereby modelers specify scenarios of interest often stated as what if questions and implement scientific replicable experiments aimed at answering the models objectives and crafting effective management interventions or policy recommendations sterman 2000 this process is iterative in nature where knowledge gained in one stage can be used to update and improve model components at other stages or in subsequent revision processes grant et al 1997 ford 1999 sterman 2000 model testing step 4 above is particularly important since the results of this stage are used to evaluate model performance and behavior validate use of the model as well as quantify the uncertainties weaknesses or shortcomings identified throughout the modeling process forrester and senge 1980 barlas 1989a and 1989b within the model testing stage modelers typically rely on comparisons of model generated data with observed data from the real world system although intuitive and illustratively simple to interpret successful behavior mode reproduction can be a misleading indicator of model strength since some models may reproduce similar reference modes equally well but can create significant discrepancies in output behaviors with even miniscule changes in model structure or parameter values rahmandad and sterman 2008 while it is true that no model is perfect i e it cannot perfectly represent the real world system and its behaviors failure to fully understand the range of possible behavior modes a model may exhibit and why it exhibits them or to appreciate the model s weaknesses limits the learning process and bypasses opportunities for model improvement this could become problematic since identification of high leverage management or policy changes step 5 above may not be observable if a model is lacking key information links feedback processes or structural elements that could have easily been included if recognized step 4 above recognizing model limitations and knowledge gaps are important steps in admiring the problem at hand and appreciating its complexity particularly in light of the complex dynamic nature of the systems being studied such as ecological or agricultural systems grant et al 1997 dalton 1975 turner et al 2016 unfortunately experimental model testing is an overlooked step of the modeling process peterson and eberlein 1994 kleijnen et al 2005 many tests that should be completed are abandoned after checking the model s ability to replicate historical data sterman 2002 and our intuitions about the cause and effect relationships even in simple systems is extremely poor sterman 1994 cronin et al 2009 sterman 2009 therefore it is critically important when developing and evaluating a dynamic model one should incorporate a variety of scientific tests aimed at measuring the robustness of the model to significant parameter value or structure alterations develop a deeper understanding of system s structure and evaluate alternative system states arising from varying management decision rules learning to effectively design and implement a variety of such experiments is a useful addition to any modeling practitioner s tool box as it would aid in multiple stages of the modeling process e g model boundary identification hypothesis formation overall model evaluation and interpretation of key model insights and hedge against bias or faulty inferences about model validity the objective of this paper is to summarize some concepts central to the design of experiments specifically simulation experiments and the common tests useful for developing a deeper understanding of complex dynamic systems this is a valuable contribution for the systems modeling fields on the whole since much of the development of these tests reside in business management and operations research literature to facilitate the diffusion of and improvement in using these model experiments for ecological and agricultural model applications concepts from traditional experimental design are translated into important considerations for design of simulation experiments sections 2 and 3 readers interested in the theory and methodology underlying these selected simulation experiments are encouraged to start here then several illustrative examples are provided and discussed section 4 readers interested more in the application of the modeling experiments may start here and reference the theoretical sections as needed the paper concludes with brief comments about the proper development and use of systems models 2 design of experiments basic framework and key terminology the main tenets of traditional design of experiments doe include control replication and randomization experiments are investigations where the system under study is under the control of the investigator meaning that subjects of the investigation nature of treatments or manipulations and measurement procedures are all set or designed by the experimenter cox and reid 2000 with experimental controls investigators should account for potential sources of error and variability through systematic doe sanchez 2005 replication or repetition to gain more data is required to obtain more precise results e g narrower confidence intervals while randomization i e random order of experimental treatments such that one s performance does not depend on another guards against the possible insertion of investigator biases in system response to treatments cavazzuti 2013 sanchez 2005 both replication and randomization are requirements of good doe in order to avoid systematic errors as well as estimate the magnitude of random errors cox and reid 2000 in performing doe and assuming the problem at hand is well defined modeling step 1 the experimenter chooses factors or variables or parameters in which to vary and the design space or range that each factor is allowed to vary within cavazzuti 2013 factors may be qualitative quantitative discrete or continuous in nature in practice the number and nature of parameters treatment values or ranges and replications are selected based on what can be afforded by the investigators in terms of inputs e g treatments outputs dependent variables and goals e g objective functions the latter two are also called response variables while the former may be referred to as the sample space a scenario or design point is a combination of values for all factors kleijnen et al 2005 effective doe increases the efficiency of an investigation by limiting or eliminating trial and error treatment strategies and avoiding confounding results that make implementation or adoption of findings difficult kleijnen et al 2005 some traditional doe designs include randomized complete block full and fractional factorial central composite box behnken plackett burman taguchi latin hypercube sequential bifurcation and frequency based among many others the purpose is not to review these designs in depth but simply acknowledge the diversity of useful designs available depending on the problem at hand 1 1 interested readers are encouraged to see references cited in this section for in depth reviews of these procedures below some variations of these designs are shown in the applications specific to modeling dynamic systems lastly doe should be viewed through the context of not only the environment that an experiment takes place e g field soil animals etc but also the context of the experimenter because no experiment exists unless someone has asked a particular question found no suitable answer and thought it was important enough to invest the time and resources to carry out pearce 1983 in the terms of dynamic systems models experimenter context can include both the modeling or programming language one uses to carry out an experiment about the real world as well as the experimenter s own mental model peterson and eberlein 1994 3 design of simulation experiments the doe is an essential but often overlooked step in the modeling process specifically steps 4 and 5 defined above pearce 1983 kleijnen et al 2005 peterson and eberlein 1994 many important tests are never done or investigators simply stop with replication of historical data sterman 2002 still worse unplanned hit or miss experimentation can often be frustrating inefficient and ultimately unhelpful kelton and barton 2003 this can be extremely problematic since the boundaries of our mental models and the inferences we make about complex dynamic systems tends to be deficient sterman 1994 simulation models can be used to mimic complex systems but can be manipulated in ways that are too slow too costly unethical or simply impossible to complete in the real world peck 2004 sterman 2002 for example it may be too slow or costly to perform a grazing management study across an entire area of interest e g whole ranch county or watershed scales or test the impact of redesigning an irrigation district delivery system likewise when involving scarce resources e g ground water or surface water dependent systems or threatened or endangered species it may be viewed as unethical to proceed with the degree of manipulation needed for traditional experimentation models can therefore be used to represent such systems and allow for experimentation and learning about the real world given such constraints often in traditional doe the number of variables selected is small and their range of variability restricted due to social or economic constraints e g limited time labor and budgets biologic ecologic or ethical limitations modern modeling platforms overcome these experimental constraints given their ability to simulate systems across time and space rapidly and without consequences intended or otherwise to the real world although model experiments are generally free of the constraints encountered when conducting real world experiments the same general principles apply namely design of treatments and controls randomization or estimation of uncertainty in the system sample size considerations and replicability so others can repeat and extend experiments elsewhere sterman 2000 peck 2004 kennedy 2019 additionally model experiments should be conducted in a reflective and iterative manner so that testing uncovers model flaws challenges assumptions and encourages critique and improvement in mental models and real world systems fig 1 sterman 2000 by doing so simulation speeds up and strengthens the learning process stimulates improvement in both mental and formal models improves our intuition about system dynamics and because the complex nature of dynamic systems makes simulation the only practical way to test models sterman 1994 sterman 2002 although there is variability in the descriptions of simulation experiments due to nuances in alternative modeling paradigms there are at least three common shared purposes for design and use of simulation experiments i evaluate the robustness of the system model ii developing depth of system understanding and iii comparing effectiveness of alternative assumptions decision rules or policies ford 1999 sterman 2000 kleijnen et al 2005 however it is important to recognize that there are a variety of other tests useful for model calibration and evaluation such as behavior reproduction tests oliva 2003 martinez moyano and richardson 2013 that are typical of many modeling applications across skill levels in addition there are highly advanced model development and analysis procedures such as bootstrapping for parameter value confidence interval estimation and hypothesis testing purpose i and ii above dogan 2007 feedback loop dominance and eigenvalue elasticity analysis purpose ii above oliva 2015 oliva 2016 naumov and oliva 2018 kampmann and oliva 2020 or integration of behavioral economic theory into dynamic decision making frameworks employed in models purpose iii above langarudi and bar on 2018 mohaghegh and größler 2020 that require the most expert modeling skill and a combination of mathematical or programming software applications each of these are beyond the scope of this paper here we focus on a non exhaustive but comprehensive set of experimental tests to aid in the three purposes described above and that progress in difficulty to guide users from novice to advanced skill levels 2 2 an important note here is that tests applied to dynamic models can be used to assess more than one objective for example an extreme condition test which is a kind of sensitivity test may be used to assess model equations and behavior under extreme conditions as well as to uncertain parameter values and the overall model structure i e are physical laws conformed to are the decision rules of actors representative given extreme conditions 3 1 experiments for system robustness to extreme conditions much knowledge and information about the real world pertains to the behaviors and consequences given extreme conditions that if incorporated into a model results in improved model performance both in and out of the normal operating region forrester and senge 1980 therefore models should possess internal robustness meaning that the behaviors produced by the model should be realistic even when extreme input parameter or decision rules are imposed on the model sterman 2000 extreme condition experiments may be implemented as switches turning variables on or off or step or pulse functions with inordinately high or low values relative to the model s standard formulation minus infinity zero plus infinity forrester and senge 1980 extreme condition tests are one of the most important experiments to consider during the model evaluation and testing stage because a it is a powerful experiment for uncovering flaws in the model and b it enhances model utility for analyzing how a system operates outside its normal region forrester and senge 1980 martinez monyano and richardson 2013 interpretation of extreme conditions test results depends on the application at hand but should follow rules of logic and reasoning regarding possible and realistic real world behaviors for example plant production cannot occur without water for evapotranspiration a water reservoir cannot store negative volumes of water and small holder livestock herd sizes cannot go below zero likewise with unlimited water plant production should reach its biological limit and then cease to grow unlimited rainfall will fill the reservoir to its capacity at which point it begins to overflow and livestock herd sizes may grow under favorable conditions but be subject to their available feed resources i e if forage resource and stored feed levels become static herd sizes should cease to grow the extreme condition test aids in identification of model flaws and inconsistencies and therefore the mental models of those in the system as such extreme condition tests act as model reality checks peterson and eberlien 1994 3 2 experiments for developing depth of system understanding all models include some degree of uncertainty due to assumptions made about parameter values causal relationships the model structure itself and errors in input data leinweber 1979 hekimoǧlu and barlas 2016 therefore experiments are required to develop depth of understanding about the particular system of interest there are many ways these tests can be done including the use of step ramp or pulse functions as well as sensitivity analyses forrester and senge 1980 barlas 2007 sensitivity experiments particularly behavior mode or multiple mode sensitivity tests are a principal method used to shed light on the possible dynamics distribution and uncertainties of different behaviors that may arise from a given system tank neilson 1980 forrester and senge 1980 saltelli et al 2000 behavior sensitivity tests identify whether or not shifts in model parameter values or relationships including graphical or table functions can create different behavior modes or cause the model to fail previously passed behavior tests forrester and senge 1980 the latter is an important feature of policy analysis described below when experimenting with uncertain parameter values a sample design must be constructed which specifies the number of simulations to include in the sensitivity tests as well as the range assigned to each parameter value preferably twice as large as statistical or judgmental considerations suggest ford and flynn 2005 hekimoǧlu and barlas 2016 sterman 2000 although parameter values may be altered one variable at a time it is recommended that multiple parameters be adjusted simultaneously in order to analyze their combined effect on model output hekimoǧlu and barlas 2016 and that any interdependencies may be identified ford and flynn 2005 when conducting sensitivity experiments it is critical to identify which type of sensitivity is being measured numerical sensitivity where a change in assumptions results in changes in numerical results behavior mode sensitivity where a change in assumptions changes the model s patterns of behavior or policy sensitivity where a change in assumption reverses the impacts of a proposed decision sterman 2000 each method described below outlines useful ways of measuring numerical behavioral and policy sensitivity due to the nature of simulation in general all models express numerical sensitivity therefore one objective of sensitivity experiments is to identify which inputs or parameters have the largest effect on model output or state variables ford and flynn 2005 demonstrate a statistical screening procedure for multivariate sensitivity analysis based on the correlation coefficient cc ranging from 1 to 1 typically denoted r given as 1 r σ x i x y i y σ x i x 2 σ y i y 2 where r represents the cc xi and x are the point values of the independent variable at time i and the mean x value and yi and y are the point values for the dependent value at time i and the mean y value for each unit of time in the simulation a cc is estimated for the each independent variable on the dependent variable which can be used to identify possible interdependencies i e when input variables in the real world vary dependently with one another in which model adjustments to account for relationships may be necessary the cc also allows one to rank the most influential factors on a given state variable using this approach facilitates estimation of tolerance intervals with a given confidence level hahn and meeker 1991 van belle 2002 although sensitivity experiments on parameter values are necessary in order to understand the effect individual or groups of parameters have on a particular model such tests must be complemented with sensitivity experiments of graphical table functions which are common in dynamic systems models ford 1999 eker et al 2014 graphical functions represent the relationship between two variables one the independent and one the dependent variable deaton and winebrake 2000 eker et al 2014 3 3 graphical functions are also called table functions and are often parameterized as a series of x y coordinates representing the relationship between an input variable x and the response y that is used elsewhere in a model they are useful especially when real world relationships between two variables are known to exist but where specific analytic equations are unknown although if analytic equations are known from prior research these are often included as graphical functions because of the subjectivity associated with graphical functions there is added uncertainty in model outputs eker et al 2014 eker et al 2014 extended a method by hearne 2010 to generate alternative functional forms of graphical functions in an automated matter to facilitate graphical function sensitivity experiments based on perturbation theory the method uses distortion functions multiplied by the model s original graphical function to arrive at alternative nonlinear relationships between independent and dependent variables distortion functions are composed of independent parameters that create alternative functional forms and are easy to test experimentally using the same procedures as those used to test parameter value sensitivity eker et al 2014 the simplest distortion function triangular is given by h x p m 1 m x c p c 2 c a x p b x p where m represents the maximum deviation from 1 ranging from 1 to 1 and p is the point where this deviation occurs ranging from 0 to 1 different combinations of distortion function parameter values result in different table function shapes distortion functions may be linear triangular or nonlinear sine or cubic in nature however triangular functions are most easily controlled and interpreted especially using scatter plots and correlation coefficients eker et al 2014 lastly hekimoǧlu and barlas 2016 demonstrate using traditional sensitivity analysis a means to differentiate changes in model behavior modes and quantify behavioral sensitivity outcomes behavior modes are most simply defined as the pattern over time expressed in the variable of interest see appendix fig a1 the primary behavior modes are zero constant linear growth decline exponential growth decline goal seeking growth decline s shaped growth decline growth and decline or decline and growth and oscillation with without growth decline walrave 2016 when identifying shifts in behavior mode a behavior pattern measure must be specified and created in the model for further analysis given the lack of automated means to identify and measure behavior mode changes after selecting input parameters their ranges of values and conducting the sensitivity experiment individual trial results are screened by visual inspection of the output data and grouped into those that exhibit similar behavior modes next pattern measures are estimated e g growth rates periods or amplitudes of oscillations peak point of a boom bust cycle etc and regressed against standardized input parameter values of the sensitivity trials i e by 3 x x σ x where x represents the nonstandardized parameter value and x and σx are the mean and standard deviation of parameter values 4 4 standardizing is a means to rescale data input or output to achieve a mean of zero and standard deviation of one standardardization is important when variable or parameter scales differ often the case in multivariate model sensitivity analysis and by transforming the numerical data we add precision and stability and reduce multicollinearity issues using standardized parameter values improves interpretation of regression results kleijnen 1995 regression outputs can then be used to examine the nature of influence and rank of importance of each parameter on the behavior pattern which can shed light on potential high leverage parameters in the model for example t tests indicate significance while the signs of the regression coefficients indicate the direction of correlation or polarity between the parameter and the behavior measure assuming parameter values used in sensitivity came from independent distributions 3 3 experiments for comparing appropriateness of alternative assumptions and effectiveness of new decision rules or policies counterfactuals or what ifs whereas the above experiments are generally conducted by varying parameter values or functions experiments for comparing the appropriateness of new assumptions or effectiveness of new management decisions or policies to achieve desired system behaviors are conducted through manipulating components of the model structure itself such experiments are also called intervention studies changed behavior prediction tests boundary adequacy tests or policy sensitivity tests forrester 1961 forrester and senge 1980 often these take the form of designing what if experiments which include system improvement and boundary adequacy tests via creation of additional model structure forrester and senge 1980 morecroft 1988 martinez moyano and richardson 2013 what if experiments are typically performed using ad hoc adjustments of key model parameters e g repenning 2001 walrave et al 2011 as well as functional values functional shapes and forms of decision equations barlas 2007 boundary adequacy experiments are uniquely important because they test whether or not modification of the model boundary assumptions would change policy recommendations arrived at in the original analysis forrester and senge 1980 when future input values or forcing functions are highly uncertain these tests may be applied retrospectively i e backcasting to analyze how counterfactual trajectories in key model structures would alter behaviors observed in the known past srinivasan 2015 gunda et al 2018 when inputs or forcing functions have an estimated trajectory or distribution models can be run into the future or past to forecast or backcast potential system responses to the alternative assumptions or conditions once alternative scenario decisions or conditions are simulated the effectiveness of proposed system changes can then be measured to identify the degree of change in model behavior as a result of the alternative assumption or scenario yücel and barlas 2015 in order to quantify potential effects of system improvements one may examine what if questions through the analysis of intervention thresholds i e the minimum intervention size and implementation time that results in the desired behavior change walrave 2016 using atomic behavior patterns and their associated threshold indicators 5 5 a summary of these are illustrated in the appendix i e the point where a model behavior shifts from one atomic behavior pattern to another often observed using the first and or second derivatives a model is iteratively tested using pre determined intervention sizes and times which represent the what if questions of a proposed new policy until the intervention threshold is reached or the entire search space has been simulated i e where no intervention thresholds were identified using the resulting simulation data an intervention threshold graph may be constructed to indicate the required intervention size at a given time to create the desired shift in behavior pattern walrave 2016 this approach can be implemented using sensitivity analysis described above but where the nature of the intervention its size and time applied to the model are sensitivity inputs parameters lastly given the problem oriented nature of systems analysis modeling generally aims to identify remedies to problems system improvement tests seek to identify whether or not the modeling process or the policies or strategies identified by the model experiments actually led to improvements in the real world s system structure and behavior sterman 2000 martinez moyano and richardson 2013 ideally intervention studies should follow good experimental design protocols with control and treatment groups if possible or with natural experiments comparing the results from those who changed behaviors as a result of the modeling process with those who did not participate sterman 2000 oliva 2019 3 4 preparing a model for laboratory testing notes on model calibration evaluation validation before the experimental examples are illustrated it is important to realize that before a model is tested it must provide an adequate representation of the problem at hand this is often captured in a dynamic hypothesis dh which is a working theory about how a system s structure of decision rules and feedback processes generate and perpetuate the problematic behavior of interest richardson and pugh 1981 sterman 2000 the dh should link observable patterns of behavior to micro level structures ecologic environmental socioeconomic decision making etc forrester 1985 morecroft 1983 a model as a laboratory should translate the dh into a quantitative working model therefore experimental design and testing is only as good the dh oliva 2003 a model calibration process should be used as a test of the dh to ensure that the model captures the observed behaviors with the right structure oliva 2003 there are several means in which to build confidence in a model and its dh prior to experimental testing including hand calibration automated calibration see oliva 2003 for example and statistical evaluation to observed behaviors tedeschi 2006 and bennett et al 2013 provide reviews of statistical evaluation techniques useful for comparing model predictions with observed data from the real system bennet et al 2013 also provide a general procedure for model evaluation the critical questions one should answer during the model development and calibration phase include 1 does the model accurately capture the dh 2 which data can will be used for calibration versus evaluation 3 do the expected patterns correspond to those in the real world and 4 is the model precise accurate or both tedeschi 2006 upon successful model development one should have adequate knowledge of the model s performance i e its strengths and accuracy weaknesses and sources of errors to be able to properly interpret results of model hypothesis testing although model validation is beyond the scope of this paper it is a concept that all modelers must consider validation is the process of establishing confidence in a model such that it can be used for its particular purpose forrester and senge 1980 although some hold that model validity equates to truth of the model many in the field of systems analysis hold that confidence is a better arbiter of validity because there is no feasible way to prove a model absolutely and completely represents reality forrester and senge 1980 tedeschi 2006 whether one adopts truth or confidence as their model validation criterion it is clear that neither can be achieved without adequate model experimentation judging the validity of a model without having done the basic experimental tests described below exposes the investigator to tremendous risk since it will be nearly impossible for them to correctly infer the full range of possible behaviors and outcomes given the dynamic nature of our ecological agricultural and social systems 4 model application experimentation examples with discussion to enhance the adoption use and documentation of simulation experiments for both novice and advanced modelers alike we demonstrate and discuss each of the experiments described above using a moderately complex dynamic systems model the model was developed based on a common problem in irrigated agricultural systems that rely on surface water supplies for their water sources in such systems surface water flows are diverted from a river source to provide irrigation water to cropland however surface water diversions often has deleterious effects to native ecosystems in terms of both habitats and individual species through the reduction in baseline water supply that the ecosystem has relied upon for its growth and development in addition irrigation diversions can escalate the impact of shrinking water availability for the ecosystem depending on the season of year which can coincide with when water use by native ecosystems is greatest type of irrigation system used e g conveyance structures for delivery and return flows as well as the type of irrigation application such as drip flood sprinkler all influence the infiltration recharge runoff and return flow dynamics and cost effectiveness of diversion e g marginal cost of water and infrastructure level of public subsidy supporting the system etc water diversions not used for agriculture are often transferred to municipal and industrial uses that have grown in conjunction with population growth and economic expansion unfortunately degradation of native ecosystems has precipitated a range of losses or reductions in ecosystem functions that support human well being but whose economic values have not been well captured for decision makers the tension placed on stakeholders in these systems continue to rise due to the array economic political and social interests at play the case study model profiled below captures the trade off between agricultural water diversions from a river source and the ecologic consequences to a wildlife refuge that also relies on water from the river fig 2 an expanded model illustration and supporting model files are provided the appendix fig a2 the purpose of the model is to generate insight for policy makers about the trade offs between a surface water supplied irrigation system and a native wildlife refuge that resides downstream from the diversion point and surrounding croplands and identify possible management strategies that balance the economic benefit of irrigation without compromising the sustainability of the wildlife refuge 4 1 dynamic hypothesis and model overview the wildlife refuge is dependent on water from the river to support native ecosystem plants and the native animals that rely on those plants for survival as water from the river source is diverted to agricultural use river flow is reduced which slows the growth of ecosystem plants and threatens the native animal population fig 3 the model includes five state variables crops profits ecosystem plants native animals and irrigation diversion level and their associated rate functions for growth decomposition or harvesting grazing loss reproduction and mortality and adjustments to the irrigation diversion amounts fig 2 information links that complete the biological feedback loops include the production rate of plants animal reproduction rates a forage availability index i e the ratio of native animals to ecosystem plants which drives the animal mortality rate and the growth index for crops i e high growth rates when total biomass is low which slowly reduces as plants reach maturity and associated planting and harvesting times the major socio economic information links include the effect of profitability on planting density and planting density on irrigation diversion rates e g when profitability is enhanced farmers raise planting density due to the additional crop biomass irrigation diversions are also raised to support plant growth additional parameters include estimates for crop water demand irrigation efficiency mean river flow grazing demand of the native animals on ecosystem plants crop prices crop planting costs as well as the initial investment and discount rate needed to determine the net present value npv of the agricultural water use the model executable in the freely downloadable vensim ple modeling environment 6 6 www vensim com free download is provided in the appendix material along with microsoft excel templates for data analysis so that readers can download and examine the model and replicate the experiments presented an earlier version of the model was developed and presented in grant et al 1997 but has been updated here to include three important feedback loops not included in the original model two management related feedbacks and one biophysical feedback 1 as the net annual returns for cropping increase the planting volume of the next year s crop also increases positive feedback denoted r1 in fig 2 2 as the planting volume increases so does the irrigation diversion amount needed to support the crop positive feedback denoted r2 in fig 2 and 3 as the number of native animals declines pressure is applied through conservationists effort to limit diversions from the river to agriculture negative feedback denoted loop b in fig 2 to illustrate the experimental tests described above that serve to i evaluate system robustness ii develop depth of system understanding and iii compare effectiveness of alterative assumptions decisions or policies we designed and subjected the model to a variety of experiments table 1 including extreme conditions where the hypothesis is that the model performs in logical and reasonable ways that conform to all physical and scientific laws sensitivity analyses of model behavior given variation in parameter values and graphical functions where the hypotheses are that certain parameters or functions will have greater influence on the behavior of the model than others and what if analyses where the hypotheses are that altering certain assumptions decision rules or management strategies in the system will correct the problematic behavior each section that follows provides a description of how each test was implemented in the model the results of each experiment and how it is interpreted within the context of the purpose of the model a summary of the rationale for each test and common obstacles encountered during implementation is provided table 2 these tests were chosen for several reasons they provided a comprehensive suite of tests useful for confidence building in both the model and the modeler model evaluation and insight generation they align with the core tests defined by forrester and senge 1980 they provided a relatively straightforward scheme moving from novice to advanced skill levels and importantly all could completed without the need for external coding or additional software outside of most dynamic modeling platforms 4 2 robustness to extreme conditions system structures should permit examination of extreme combinations of states or parameter values in order to implement extreme conditions tests one must be familiar with the structural elements of the system state variables transfer functions information converters and variables representing time based parameters to be able to trace the implications of hypothetical extreme values of variables including values known to be far outside the range of known historical or possible values to determine the plausibility of the model s response forrester and senge 1980 here we examine extreme conditions tests applied to several key parameters river flow the primary physical exogenous i e arising from outside the model boundary input to the system calibrated to 100 c f s irrigation efficiency the fraction of applied irrigation water that is productively consumed by the crop taking on a dimensionless value from zero to one calibrated to 0 5 and ecosystem plant decomposition rate which regulates the volume of plant biomass due to metabolic costs and eventual senescence and death taking on a dimensionless value between 0 and 1 calibrated to 0 375 irrigation efficiency is also a significant factor influencing the surface water return flow rate back to the refuge here the volume of applied irrigation water not consumed by the crop returns to the surface water source that supplies the native animal refuge in the simplest mathematical form 4 rfr rf iwd rtf 5 rtf iwd iwd ie where rfr is the river flow to the refuge rf is the upstream river flow iwd is the irrigation water diverted rtf is the return flow rate and ie is the irrigation efficiency therefore monitoring the responses to changed irrigation efficiency provides an additional check on the internal consistency of the model structure abnormally high flow rates did lead to small increases in ecosystem plants earlier in the growing season which was able to support slightly greater native animal population fig 4 a and b but did not significantly alter the overall behavior patterns on the other hand cutting river flow to zero c f s led to an eventual collapse in ecosystem plants the stock of existing biomass became depleted by month 30 due to no new plant growth combined with monthly biomass losses from decomposition and consumption by native animals because of the loss in ecosystem plants the native animal population also collapses near month 36 importantly neither ecosystem plants nor native animals fall below zero due to the first order negative feedback loops not arbitrary constraints set by the modeler that govern the outflow of each stock i e physical inventories cannot be negative if the desired outflow is greater than the level of the stock first order negative feedback controls will regulate the outflow such that the outflow rate cannot exceed the existing stock value consider a bathtub example without any inflow and the drain or outflow open a full bath tub will drain water a function of gravity and the height of the water in the tub as the height of water declines to zero the outflow rate also declines to zero at which point the stock of water in the tub is empty even though the drain is open and gravitational force is still applied not including this kind of regulating feedback is a common pitfall among beginning modelers manipulating irrigation efficiency up to 100 of applied irrigation water led to a number of significant outcomes fig 4c and d first the 50 improvement in irrigation efficiency led to a 400 increase in crop production initially this may look unreasonable however the modeler should examine such behaviors and be able to link them to the model structure from which they arose fig 2 in this case improving irrigation efficiency 100 meant no water losses during irrigation i e all water applied was converted into crop production because of the increase in production and therefore crop profitability in the first year the strength of the two reinforcing loops in fig 2 driven by profit s effect on planting density and planting density s effect on irrigation diversion levels were greatly enhanced leading to greater planting densities and irrigation application levels with greater plant densities greater water applications and no water losses in the production system crop production grew until reaching its maximum potential by month 36 fig 4c with irrigation efficiency at 100 the delayed return flows to the river source were eliminated with reduced stream flows to the refuge and the resulting loss of ecosystem plants the native animal population declines until its complete loss by month 72 fig 4d on the other hand when irrigation efficiency is set to 0 i e no irrigation water applied is converted to crop growth all applications become return flows crop production was unsustainable overlaying the x axis in fig 4c and there was no change in the native animal population fig 4d since whatever water applied was returned to the river source and supported ecosystem plant growth needed by the native animals the reduction in ecosystem plant decomposition rate to 0 created significant differences in ecosystem plants and native animals compared to the base case with no decomposition the stock of ecosystem plants was able to grow up to its biological limit subject only to losses via consumption by native animals fig 4e the native animal population no longer subject to the seasonal variability in food supply therefore grew in conjunction with the growth in ecosystem plants reaching a new equilibrium population near 45 animals by month 60 fig 4f any consumptive losses in ecosystem plants by native animals were easily compensated for by new growth the important insights that these experiments provide the modeler are to check that the model structure obeys basic biophysical laws populations and plant biomasses can t be negative neither can they grow forever extreme conditions tests illuminate whether or not a model conforms to such laws additionally when a model expresses a high degree of feedback such as the feedbacks stemming from irrigation applications and their influence on return flows such tests force the modeler to be able to explain the resulting behavior in terms of the existing model structure when results do not conform to basic scientific laws or result in behaviors that can t be explained clearly by the existing model structure which is a reflection of the dynamic hypothesis the modeler should reconcile the discrepancy by revising the dynamic hypothesis model structure or both appendix section 3 1 provides several examples of failed extreme conditions tests often encountered in early stages by more novice modelers 4 3 developing depth of system understanding to develop depth of system understanding experiments that examine the various behavior modes that the model can create and the strength of influence that various model parameters have on creating those behavior patterns are needed here we illustrate several behavioral sensitivity tests by experimenting with alternative parameter values or functions including graphical functions to analyze their influence on the resulting model behavior these include varying parameter behaviors rather than their values multivariate sensitivity analysis graphical function sensitivity analysis and analysis of behavior modes i e behavior pattern measures 4 3 1 behavioral sensitivity to model parameters the first experimental examples demonstrate changing single parameters in unique ways via giving them dynamic rather than static values over the course of a simulation because of the importance of river flow as the primary water input for the ecosystem plants and native animals in the refuge as well as the crop production system fig 2 we illustrate three experimental tests of the model using step pulse and ramp functions to vary the river flow input values into the system each of these tests are also applicable to other parts of the system e g crop production economics and ecosystem components but due to space considerations only tests of river flow are presented here first using a step function we implement a step volume change to river flow at a given step time such that 6 river flow 100 t s t e p t i m e 100 s t e p v o l u m e t s t e p t i m e where t represents time step time 120 months and step volume is equal to 50 c f s but is adjustable based on user input for smaller or larger step changes including potential reductions in river flow for negative values of step volume 7 7 in the vensim modeling environment this may be achieved a number of ways but is best implemented with use of the step function step step volume step time the resulting behaviors of the river flow step experiment illustrate several immediate and delayed responses to changes in flow behavior fig 5 a due to the immediate increase in available water 150 of base river flow and no delay in irrigation diversion and application during the growing season crop production was enhanced nearly 50 fig 5b in a similar fashion ecosystem plants immediately recovered from the reduction created by diversions in the base case river flow and actually reach a new peak in primary productivity approximately 20 000 tons compared to 15 000 tons or an increase of 33 prior to irrigation diversion fig 5c the reason for the disproportionate response in crop production and ecosystem plants are due to the disproportionate change in total inflows received by each area recall that the base river inflow was 100 c f s irrigation diversions were 30 of the flow irrigation efficiency was 50 and water not consumed by the crops became return flow back to the river source in response to the step change in river flow the total inflow available for crop production increased 67 i e new waer available base water available base water available or 50 cfs 50 30 cfs 50 30 cfs 50 25 cfs 15 cfs 15 cfs 66 7 on the other hand total inflows to the refuge only increased 47 i e 125 cfs 85 cfs 85 cfs 40 cfs 85 cfs 47 finally the native animal population does recover to its equilibrium level of 25 head albeit with a delay of 160 months fig 5d unlike the immediate plant response to water observed in crop production and ecosystem plants which are subject to delays of less than one year in their growth capacities native animals are subject to biological delays for gestation and birth which lengthen the recovery time for the general population because of this delay the recovery in native animals is not a sharp one point in time increase but an s shaped growth pattern from the reduced state back to the natural population level in a similar fashion we can utilize a pulse function to periodically increase or decrease a particular rate or parameter values at a desired interval pulse time in this case a pulse is used to reduce river flow by 50 during the ecosystem plant s growing season in three year intervals to mimic the natural occurrence of drought conditions the base case without irrigation is used here in order to more effectively observe what changes if any occur in native animals which may not be perceptible given the influence of irrigation diversions shown in previous sections the droughts begin at the start of the growing season month of year 4 midway through the simulation t 180 months which mathematically can be expressed as 7 river flow 100 t p s t 100 p v t p s t and 8 pv τ t n 1 2 n π sin n π τ t cos 2 π n t p s t τ 2 d c where pv is the pulse volume t is time pst is the pulse start time equal to 184 months i e month 180 being the start of the 16th year plus four months to arrive at the start of the natural growing season pulse time τ is 6 months and pulse period t is 36 months the pulse in the above function produces a sequence of re occurring events representing drought via the use of a square wave function where the pulse width is 6 months the space width is 30 months and the cycle time is 36 i e duty cycle 16 67 the square wave functions yields a value of 1 when the wave is positive or 0 when it is not thus in order to simulate the pulse of a particular volume the square wave is multiplied by an auxiliary variable representing the desired change dc i e in this case 50 c f s fig 6 a 8 8 in the vensim modeling environment this can be simulated via the pulse train function pulse train start time pulse width cycle time end time desired pulse volume similar to the step experiment above the pulse experiment reducing river flow by 50 yielded both immediate and delayed responses clearly in the years with drought ecosystem plants were negatively affected but do recover in subsequent years following each drought fig 6b native animals are also negatively affected but due to the biological delays inherent in the population drought effects in one year compound into the future for example the reduction in ecosystem plants during the first drought pulse results in diminishing the native animals nearly 50 but the plants are able to fully recover in the following years before the next drought occurs whereas native animals only improve to a mean of 17 5 animals a 30 reduction for their starting population because of the lengthened recovery time in native animals the effect of each subsequent drought is amplified and reinforces the native animal population to a new albeit lower equilibrium level fig 6c the result is a change in behavior pattern from a sustained oscillatory behavior to one that is a declining goal seeking damped oscillation the third test demonstrates a ramp function which alters a parameter value from a static value to one that takes on a particular slope positive or negative for a particular time span in this case river flow increases 0 3 c f s per unit of time beginning at 120 months mathematically this is expressed as 9 9 in the vensim modeling environment this function is most easily implemented use the ramp function ramp ramp slope ramp time end time 9 river flow 100 t r a m p t i m e 100 r a m p s l o p e t r a m p t i m e t r a m p t i m e where t is time ramp time is 120 months and ramp slope is 0 3 given the above ramp slope and time inputs river flow increased from 100 c f s at month 120 to 175 c f s by month 360 fig 7 a due to the gradual increase in available water crop production grew linearly in step with river flow fig 7b while ecosystem plants exhibited more of goal seeking growth behavior up to its maximum productive potential near 20 000 tons fig 7c because the recovery delay of ecosystem plants takes around 180 months from 120 to 300 in fig 7 and the reproductive delays of native animals described above the native animal population exhibits an exponential growth pattern where each subsequent gain in population although initially small compounds into the future fig 7d however since ecosystem plants do reach a point where growth no longer occurs a reasonable follow up test would be to extend the simulation out beyond 360 months to identify at what point if any the native animal and crop production behavior patterns shift from exponential and linear growth to some other behavior patterns most likely goal seeking tests of these types aid the modeler in understanding how model structure produces unique behavior modes given a dynamic input these are especially valuable for management or policy related questions due to the fact that most dynamic models have the ability to exhibit multiple behavior modes which makes it possible to examine potential interactions between modes or how different decision rules lead to particular behavior patterns forrester and senge 1980 appendix section 3 2 provides examples of failed step pulse and ramp experiments that would necessitate mental and quantitative model revision 4 3 2 sensitivity analysis with graphical functions the second set of experiments illustrate graphical function sensitivity analyses in this case two key graphical functions warranted investigation native animal mortality rate a graphical function based on per capita forage availability effect on mortality b1 in fig 2 and crop profit effect on planting density r1 in fig 2 because mortality rate directly influences the native animal population and does not feed back to the cropping system we only examine the effect of altered mortality rates on the animal population on the other hand the influence of expected planting density reaches beyond the cropping system to second and third order effects on the ecosystem plants and native animals therefore we examine crop system financial performance via the net present value or npv of irrigation which integrates crop production and economic prices and costs as well as the native animal population each of these graphical functions were manipulated using the distortion function procedure outlined by eker et al 2014 after hearne 2010 illustrated with two simple examples in fig 8 although there are an array of alternative distortion functions one may use to manipulate the graphical function here we employ the one of the simplest a single point triangular distortion eq 2 in order to minimize additional model variables required for the experiment while maintaining a distortion that is easily interpretable for a full discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of variable distortion function possibilities see eker et al 2014 to complete the sensitivity analysis 100 simulations were completed for each graphical function by varying the maximum deviation m from 1 to 1 and point of maximum departure p from 0 to 1 see eq 2 10 10 tests were implemented in vensim modeling environment using the built in monte carlo simulation feature with the following specifications number of simulations 100 noise seed 1234 latin hypercube sampling with random uniform distribution of input parameter values for the most part the model was insensitive to changes in graphical functions fig 9 altering the mortality rate function revealed primarily only one behavior pattern decline and goal seeking fig 9a with only three out of the 100 simulations producing a markedly different ending population size examining the native animal mean and standard deviations showed that the monthly variation in population was demonstrably low relative to changes in the mortality rate graphical function fig 9b similar results were observed for changes in expected planting density fig 9c and d only two out of 100 simulations produced a significantly different outcome for both native animals and npv of irrigation fig 9e and f following ford and flynn 2005 correlation coefficients cc were calculated between the inputs m and p with the observed output data in native animals and npv of irrigation ending cc values shown in table 3 increasing the magnitude of the departure m from the original graphical functions for mortality rate resulted in smaller native animals populations indicated by negative polarity in the sign of the cc increasing the point of departure p also had a negative but weaker influence on native animals this may also be intuited given the slope of the graphical function fig 8b given that larger departure values on per capita forage availability will raise mortality rate i e smaller per capita forage availability larger mortality rate smaller native animal population similar effects on native animals were observed given m and p distortions on expected planting density conversely larger departures had a positive influence on the npv of irrigation i e greater planting density greater crop production and harvest greater crop profit greater npv graphical functions and their particular shapes are often the most debated functions during model development and overlooked parameter values during model testing given the extraordinary range of possibilities that graphical functions can take on it is important that the model withstand alternative graphical forms all models express numerical sensitivity to changes in parameter values but models should be able to produce the behavior mode described in the dynamic hypothesis for a wide range of parameter values including graphical functions 4 3 3 sensitivity of behavior patterns the final sensitivity analysis demonstrated here pertains to multivariate tests using statistical screening ford and flynn 2005 and behavior pattern measures hekimoǧlu and barlas 2016 to facilitate both tests one set of 11 parameters and their ranges were specified table 4 and simulated for 100 model runs a form of monte carlo simulation to observe the resulting behaviors in key system variables native animals ecosystem plants total crop harvest the npv of irrigation and several key behavior pattern measures for native animals described below native animals ecosystem plants and total crop harvest were chosen because these were the key stocks of the model that in the real world are most likely to be measured and monitored given the problem at hand while npv of irrigation an auxiliary variable was chosen given that it integrates the outcomes that arise from the interrelated nature of the model s agriculture ecologic and economic components table 4 unfortunately comprehensive sensitivity analysis of all uncertain parameters over their entire range of possible values is for most practical purposes impossible sterman 2000 given this constraint parameters used for sensitivity testing must be selected for typically by identifying those you suspect hypothesize are both highly uncertain and likely to be influential those that are not entirely under control of decision makers but must be managed if a desired outcome is to be achieved which parameters are deemed most important to decision making by working with stakeholders or problem owners defining worst and best case scenarios about the problem at hand and then backing into variables needed to create such scenarios or some combination of the above sterman 2000 in this particular case sensitivity input variables were selected based on their hypothesized uncertainty and influence on the system and those that although not entirely within control of stakeholders are key factors that must be managed if a solution is to be reached table 4 the statistical screening approach was used to evaluate the relative strength and polarity of each parameter on the key variable output behaviors where the input and output values are regressed for each time unit of the simulation varying these input parameter values simultaneously created much more variability in system behavior modes fig 10 relative to the previous sensitivity tests described above first both total crop harvest and npv of irrigation which express linear growth behavior modes indicated a clear shift or break between profitable and unprofitable combinations of inputs fig 10a and c however in general both total harvest and npv of irrigation grew linearly fig 10b and d on the other hand ecosystem plants and native animals expressed several behavior modes fig 10e and g in general exhibiting a goal seeking decline behavior mode fig 10f and h examination of the ending cc values between input parameters and system stocks indicate the relative strength and polarity of the link from inputs to model behavior positive cc values indicate positive polarity negative cc values indicate negative polarity while values closer to 0 indicate relative weaker degree of influence and values closer to 1 or 1 indicating stronger degree of influence on the system behavior the two variables with the strongest influence across the entire system were base water diversions and irrigation efficiency ccs ranging from 0 76 to 0 58 table 5 the next most influential variables included base crop planting density and price per ton of crop ccs ranging from 0 29 to 0 27 the remaining input parameters held relatively weak influence on system behaviors cc values between 0 15 and 0 15 a key insight of the cc analysis that corroborates the dynamic hypothesis as well as previous model testing is the polarity between agricultural components total crop harvest and the ecosystem ecosystem plants and native animals for the most part parameters that have a positive polarity influence on agricultural components expressed a negative polarity influence on ecosystem components and vice versa the value of the cc analysis is that it illustrates and quantifies the trade offs between the agricultural and ecological components in this system lastly one may notice the annual cycle in ecosystem plants and native animals which is driven by the annual growth season in plants and the resulting balance with native animals however the trajectory of their behaviors does not express this annual oscillation since the overall behavior pattern changes depending on whether or not the growth was greater than or equal to decomposition and grazing in which case plants are stable if not they decline or if births were greater than or equal to deaths in which case animals are stable if not animals decline therefore in this case the cc values would not be significantly different if the cycle point varies at the end of the simulation i e the trajectory or spread in cc values would not be different only the ending point values however in more cyclical or oscillatory systems one may examine the behavior pattern of the cc itself to understand how the cc between inputs and behavior patterns evolve over the course of the simulation ford and flynn 2005 to take statistical screening a step further and complete the behavior pattern measures analysis the same parameters and ranges of values were used but rather than observing changes in specific system variables we observe the resulting changes in the output of behavior pattern measures in this case for native animals after visually screening the sensitivity results we observe that native animals expressed several behavior modes 1 goal seeking decline and growth to a new equilibrium 2 goal seeking decline to a reduced population 3 goal seeking collapse defined as population levels below three animals which effectively eliminates any possibility of successful species reproduction and 4 linear decline fig 10g and h generic behavior modes shown in the appendix fig a1 after grouping the data based on visually classifying the behavior patterns we specify pattern measures that differentiate each unique pattern equilibrium level pattern 1 n 39 defined as the mean native animals at the final month inflection point and inflection level pattern 2 n 12 defined by the largest value of the first derivative of mean animals and the level of animals at that point time to collapse pattern 3 n 43 defined at the time at which native animals falls below three and slope pattern 4 n 6 defined as the difference between initial and final native animals divided by the final simulation time following hekimoǧlu and barlas 2016 simulation runs were grouped by behavior pattern pattern measures were estimated from each simulation run values were standardized eq 3 and then input parameters were regressed to behavior pattern measures for each behavior pattern regression equations using the eleven parameters in table 5 were built to examine the effects that each had on the key output behavior pattern measure table 6 regression results indicate the most significant parameters that lead to a particular behavior pattern the regression equations for the two most common behavior patterns goal seeking decline with growth to equilibrium n 39 goal

pattern 2 described above since no significant parameters were identified or for slope used for pattern 4 described above due to inadequate sample size it was not surprising that no significant parameters were identified in the case of behavior pattern 2 which is the same generic behavior pattern as pattern 4 goal seeking collapse the most significant parameter in goal seeking collapse base water diversion rate also had the lowest p values for both behavior pattern measures for pattern 2 therefore we may infer that the primary behavior mode expressed by the model is goal seeking decline n 12 pattern 2 43 pattern 3 55 total goal seeking decline but that significant collapse is not induced unless the base water diversion rate reaches a high enough threshold in the equilibrium case base crop planting density base water diversions irrigation efficiency and price per ton all significantly influenced the equilibrium population size the native animal population was able to achieve importantly all significant factors possessed negative polarities for example greater planting density water diversions irrigation efficiency or crop price lead to lower equilibrium levels in native animals this logically follows due to the trade off between the agricultural system productivity and ecosystem productivity given feedback processes influencing the allocation of resources the other major behavior pattern was goal seeking decline to a nonviable population where the behavior pattern measure was the time to collapse in this case the only significant factor was base water diversion while other important variables were annual infrastructure costs and discount rate insignificance of other factors indicate less importance in creating the observed behavior pattern results from both the statistical screening and behavior mode sensitivity analysis are summarized in table 7 key input parameters are ranked based on their influence and polarity on either maintaining a higher equilibrium of native animals versus the time to collapse in native animals in the goal seeking collapse case 4 4 comparative analysis of alternative assumptions decision rules or policies counterfactuals or what ifs whereas the tests to this point have dealt with examining robustness and developing depth of system understanding both of which primarily reside in model development and evaluation stages of the modeling process the remaining tests focus on effectively using a model to generate insights needed for constructing and advocating for policy or strategy recommendations generating model insights via alternative assumptions decision rules or policies can take the form of counterfactual trajectory analyses boundary adequacy tests on model behavior and policy recommendations or intervention studies each of which can be formulated using what if experiments these experiments provide opportunities to examine how emergent pressures arise or can be mitigated for whether or not the effects of additional model structure in biophysical decision making spatial components or the interactions among them changes the final model results and management recommendations and to estimate the risk associated with adopting particularly new decisions or policies forrester and senge 1980 we illustrate three such tests by posing specific what if questions aimed at generating management insights via counterfactual trajectories boundary adequacy and intervention thresholds 4 4 1 counterfactual trajectories counterfactual trajectories involve altering the basic model assumptions or conditions in ways that are either known to be wrong haven t been observed in the historical record or were not assumed important enough during model development to be included in the model structure a counterfactual trajectory is therefore a quantifiable and rigorous thought experiment a key assumption of the model presented here is that there has been and will be a consistent reliable surface water source based on existing information calibrated to a long run mean of 100 c f s a reasonable hypothesis would be that the insights generated by the model would be significantly different if a counterfactual condition regarding incoming surface water flows were used therefore we posed the following what if question what if the river flow assumptions 100 c f s across the time horizon of simulation are incorrect an alternative assumption is that river flow is highly variable due to climate and watershed characteristics varying from zero i e no flow is the worst drought years to 125 c f s representing the occasional wet years of exceptional precipitation to test this counterfactual assumption in the model minimum zero c f s maximum 125 c f s and standard deviations 75 c f s in river flow rate were added to the model as auxiliary variable inputs to river flow river flow rf recall as an input to eq 4 then becomes a random function 10 rf n μ σ 2 where μ is the mean river flow 100 c f s and σ is the expected standard deviation in flow rate 11 11 in the vensim modeling environment the built in function random normal can be used such as random normal river flow min river flow max river flow mean river flow standard deviation river flow seed value including the seed value provides means for adequate comparisons across simulations because the seed provides unique random sequence of values for each unique seed value using this alternative assumption we generate a dynamic rather than static trajectory in river flow fig 11 a due to the river flow variability irrigation diversion rates during the growing season are less reliable fig 11b leading to a decline in crop production fig 11c this is due to the economic response in the agricultural sector which alters cropping intensity based on changes in profitability loop r1 in fig 2 the more profitable the agricultural sector the greater investment in agriculture leading to greater crop intensity the less profitable lesser investment and intensity this feedback contributes to the gradual decline in crop production as the intensity of production lessens over time ecosystem plants responded annually changes in flow fig 11d but because of habitat loss during droughts and in the most sensitive parts of the year the native animal population declines fig 11e finally the npv of irrigation never approached breakeven since crop production declines revenues were not able to recoup costs of irrigation fig 11f what management or policy recommendations would be altered given this counterfactual assumption in river flow first altering flows to include both wet and dry year cycles does not alleviate the pressure to the native animal population as any benefit of improved habitat and per capita forage availability experienced during wet years is not enough to overcome the losses in dry years therefore the management and policy concerns for the native population remains regardless of the flow assumptions compared here however new management pressures arise in the agricultural sector given the collapse in crop production and economic failure of investing in the irrigation system if given the alternative river flow trajectory collapse in the agricultural sector is expected policy makers would be faced with the trade off of either not approving the investment if being analyzed prospectively halting crop production before the irrigation investment npv worsens after the first 10 years if being analyzed retrospectively or creating support mechanisms for the agricultural sector such that it is less susceptible to reductions in river flow e g insurance that offsets annual losses improvements in irrigation efficiency the first two responses would lead to improvements in native animal population since irrigation diversion would cease but would ensure a non viable agricultural sector in the third response the decline in native animal population would only accelerate since irrigation diversions would not be as responsive to changes in river flow under an insurance scheme or because of the reduction in return flows to the refuge under improved irrigation efficiency therefore given these counterfactual river flow assumptions management and policy pressures arising due to agricultural collapse would erode conservation oriented efforts to balance irrigation economics and the wildlife refuge under the original static river flow assumption reductions in base water diversion rate and irrigation efficiency were pinpointed as the most significant factors conducive of sustaining a stable native animal population table 4 counterfactual trajectories such as these aid in examining the trade offs and consequences of alternative assumptions appendix section 3 4 provides an example of a failed counterfactual tests 4 4 2 boundary adequacy testing boundary adequacy testing can be used in the context of model structure is the model boundary appropriate given the model purpose behavior can new model structure be conceptualized that significantly alters its behavior or policy how does modifying the model boundary alter policy recommendations forrester and senge 1980 here we focus on model boundary tests in the context of behavior and policy recommendations the current model boundary fig 2 encompasses the wildlife refuge that is habitat for the ecosystem plants and native animals the surrounding cropland and the river flow that supplies surface water diversions for irrigation a relevant boundary adequacy test would be expansion of the model boundary to include a new state stock variable capable of expressing its own unique dynamics after adding the new structure we can then examine how the expanded model may influence the problem of interest in this case we expand the model boundary by asking what if the watershed constructed a reservoir system for irrigation deliveries that would help regulate river flow and avoid the effects caused by seasonal river flow diversions for irrigation the hypothesis here would be that the reservoir would help redistribute the water supply from the non growing season to the growing season thereby reducing the impact of irrigation to the refuge to complete this test additional model structure was added representing reservoir storage and release fig 12 a in the added structure a certain percentage of river flow 30 is diverted for storage with the remainder immediately released for the ecosystem 70 the diversions enter a reservoir storage which incurs losses due to natural leakage and evaporation 0 001 and through downstream releases releases downstream are a function of the reservoir release time capturing average residence time of water in storage 12 months plus the water released for irrigation during the crop growing season i e no water for irrigation is released during the non growing season since no new agronomic assumptions are included in this scenario once water for irrigation is delivered it remains subject to the same irrigation efficiencies and return flow rates as the base case by storing water during the non growing season and releasing it throughout the year we hypothesize that a different behavior pattern will arise in the native animal population the resulting behavior patterns given the expanded model boundary are then compared to the behaviors prior to model boundary expansion adding the reservoir storage and release structure did improve the native animal population size relative to 30 direct surface water diversions for irrigation but did not change the overall behavior pattern fig 12b this is a strong test of the model boundary that due to the resulting behavior in native animals strengthens confidence in the original boundary if the test resulted in a different behavior mode in native animals reexamining the original model structure and its links to the native animal population would be warranted an additional boundary experiment includes examining alternative policy recommendations that would arise given the expanded model boundary and structure representing reservoir storage first we identify the management recommendation concerning irrigation diversions under the original model boundary and given the policy goal is to achieve a stable native animal population in equilibrium that still allows for profitable crop production we then identify the management recommendation under the expanded model boundary and compare that to the original recommendation in order to identify these points the base water diversion rate used for determining irrigation was manipulated by hand until the policy goal conditions were reached under the original model boundary the base water diversion rate found to balance native animals without jeopardizing crop production and profitability was 25 of river flows without any reservoir storage potential fig 13 a incoming river flow to the refuge is anchored to the total river flow 100 c f s in the non growing season but is subject to large declines during the growing season to as low as 70 c f s when the refuge needs water the most fig 13b due to return flows the incoming flow to the refuge peaks over 100 c f s but the marginal benefit of the additional flow is negligible since it occurs after the primary growing season ecosystem plants with the reduction in incoming river flows during the growing season declines to a peak of 12 000 tons fig 13c while crop production peaks at 2 000 tons fig 13d the goal to maintain a viable native animal population and a profitable agricultural system is achieved with mean animals ending at 15 head fig 13e and npv of irrigation ending above 200 000 fig 13f under the expanded model boundary the storage water diversion rate i e the percentage of river flow diverted to storage found to balance native animals without jeopardizing crop production and profitability was also 25 given that diversion rate reservoir storage would need to be capable of storing between 40 000 and 50 000 acre feet of water fig 13a because the river flow is being redistributed with storage the incoming flow to the refuge was anchored at 75 rather than 100 c f s fig 13b however the refuge receives more water during the growing season up to 90 c f s due to the releases from storage combined with return flows from the irrigation system this leads to a more stable ecosystem plant community fig 13c and greater irrigation levels supportive of almost double crop production fig 13d with a more stable plant community native animals reach equilibrium near 20 head 33 compared to the original recommendation above the npv of irrigation reached over 800 000 or a 400 increase over the original recommendation due to increased crop productivity as observed here the expanded model boundary would lead to significantly different management recommendations appendix section 3 4 provides examples of failed boundary adequacy tests one might encounter 4 4 3 determination of intervention thresholds finally we estimate the intervention thresholds i e the minimum intervention size and intervention time that results in the desired behavior change for the native species population as shown in fig 3 the atomic behavior pattern exhibited by the native animal population given irrigation diversions is goal seeking decline the desired post intervention behavior would be s shaped growth which would reflect a population that increases up to a new equilibrium level equal to the baseline population prior to irrigation diversion potential behavior shown appendix fig a1 assume that construction of the reservoir system described in the previous section would not be approved due to other social environmental and economic concerns e g rural community relocation fish habitat connectivity uncertain npv due to regulatory and litigation costs other possible interventions include reintroducing new animals once the population declines below a population threshold determined by the policy makers or importing feed resources as supplement to offset losses in ecosystem plants both of these interventions are unfortunately low leverage we can infer from the previous experiments the chain of causality driving native animal population declines the feedback process between ecosystem plants regulated by river flow and native animals via per capita forage availability declines in native animal population are a symptom of the problem which at the structural level arises where river flow supplies the refuge reintroducing animals or supplying feed resource supplementation are symptomatic solutions which may work only in the short term and at a very high cost to the system appendix section 3 4 provides the simulation evidence for these a more fundamental solution would be address the problem at the refuge level for example what if rather than focusing on symptomatic solutions of the native animal population via policy interventions that prop up the population investment is made in expanding the wildlife refuge under such a scenario effort may be made to improve the surrounding habitat for the population and expand the wildlife refuge thereby increasing the per capita forage availability in order to implement this test a refuge expansion intervention function is added to the model similar to the step equation in eq 6 where a specified refuge expansion rate zero to 100 and refuge expansion time are determined the refuge expansion intervention applies to the stock of ecosystem plants based on the refuge expansion rate e g a 100 refuge expansion rate would double the size of the current refuge expanding the suitable habitat would create additional land costs but with greater forage availability for native animals we would hypothesize that the behavior pattern of native animals is shifted from a decline oriented behavior to one of s shaped growth and stabilization to test this hypothesis and identify the minimum intervention needed for returning the native animal population back to its initial state mean 25 animals we apply a latin grid experimental design similar to the sensitivity tests in section 4 3 3 with the input parameters being refuge expansion rate ranging from zero no expansion to one doubling the refuge size in increments of 0 01 and refuge expansion time ranging from 120 months to 240 months in increments of 1 2 months this latin grid experimental design 100 100 resulted in 10 000 simulations one for every unique combination of refuge expansion rate and refuge expansion time 12 12 in the vensim modeling environment these simulations were completed in under five minutes with the grid selection based on refuge expansion rate the 10 year or 120 month period for refuge intervention time was not evenly distributed therefore the simulation results were matched to the nearest whole month the latin grid design is preferred over monte carlo simulation in this case because of the explicit interest in identifying the specific intervention size and time that results in the desired behavior pattern use of monte carlo simulation risks duplicating certain input values or at least very near combinations of values and does not guarantee that all possible combinations of input values will be sampled a latin grid design ensures all possible combinations of input values are sampled and although computationally intensive is still more efficient than the required sample size to achieve the necessary input combinations using monte carlo simulation following walrave 2016 an indicator value was specified to determine if the desired behavior shift was achieved in this case the indicator variable used was the moving average of native animals and its first derivative 13 13 the natural behavior mode for native animals is oscillation but with the onset of irrigation the overall pattern becomes goal seeking decline however the infinitesimal changes in native animals even under goal seeking decline still express oscillations albeit with smaller and smaller amplitudes because the first derivative of oscillatory behavior modes is misleading we use the first derivative of the moving average of the stock walrave 2017 mean native animals was chosen as the behavior pattern measure given that the behavior of native animals inherently oscillates due to annual reproduction and mortality dynamics and because the oscillation can grow or decline as ecosystem conditions change such as it does with the onset of irrigation i e the population does not oscillate around a stable fixed point using the moving average smooths out these oscillations resulting in a behavior where the signs of the first and second derivatives are quite stable under goal seeking decline the value of the first derivative of mean native animals is negative and under goal seeking growth it is positive therefore we monitor the number of sign changes in the first derivative of mean native animals from negative to positive if a change in sign does occur we then identify if the mean population size reaches its desired level prior to irrigation 25 animals the results of the intervention experiment are shown in fig 14 including the percentile intervals and intervention threshold graph percentile intervals display the percentage of simulations falling within a particular range at a given point in time as expected ecosystem plants increased as a result of refuge expansion fig 14a with over half of the intervention combinations resulting in peaks up to 21 000 tons due to the additional land costs involved with improving the surrounding habitat and expanding the refuge the npv of irrigation does decline but even the most extreme outcomes result in positive npv near 100 000 fig 14b importantly these two outcomes illustrate that the intervention strategy does expand the refuge and can do so without financially taxing the system to an unprofitable level the behavior pattern changes in the native animal population resulting from the intervention combination were much more dynamic relative to ecosystem plants and npv of irrigation fig 14c nearly half of the simulations made no shift in behavior pattern 40 of all simulations of the 60 of simulations that did create a behavior pattern shift from goal seeking decline to s shaped growth only 9 achieved a mean native animal population of 25 animals using the resulting simulation data an interventions threshold graph was constructed to illustrate the combination of minimum refuge intervention sizes and refuge intervention times that would be required to achieve an s shaped growth to equilibrium of at least 25 animals fig 14d in order to shift the behavior pattern from decline to growth the minimum refuge intervention size was 39 in month 120 increasing up to 50 in month 240 denoted as ẋ 0 any refuge intervention size below 39 would not reverse the native animal population decline in order to restore the native animal population denoted as ẋ 0 ӯ 25 the minimum refuge intervention size would have to be at least 79 at month 120 up to 95 by month 186 after month 186 the intervention size would have to be more than double the size of the current refuge over 1 on fig 14d outside the range of values performed in the experiment the resulting graphs indicate the minimum combination of intervention inputs needed to create a shift the dominant feedback processes i e tipping point from goal seeking decline negative feedback to s shaped growth positive feedback an important note regarding intervention thresholds such as these is that the intervention combinations included in the experiment had dissimilar incubation times due to a fixed end point of the simulation at 360 months because of this novel behavior characteristics may be exhibited beyond month 360 that would not be observable with a fixed final simulation time but could be included under a dynamic final simulation time 5 conclusion dynamic systems models are increasingly used by scientists managers and policy makers due to the growing complexity and interdependency of problems that persist in ecologic and socio economic systems coupled to this is the growing awareness that when confronted with such complexity our human intuition rarely properly infers the underlying dynamics driving decision making and its outcomes formal mathematical models are therefore essential tools for improving our understanding and decision making in the face of such complexity the above experimental examples illustrate a number of key tests with increasing degree of difficulty from novice to advanced skill levels any investigator can and should perform in order to evaluate and test their particular model each of the experiments demonstrate several key lessons 1 that model experiments help uncover unforeseen flaws or incorrect formulations including flaws in our own mental models since all models are based on our mental representations of a given problem or system 2 that good model experiments provide a means to glean valuable insights about the structure and behavior of a model and 3 model experiments enhance the confidence validity of the model for its intended use especially after the iterative process of identifying errors or flaws in model structure or behavior updating and improving our mental model and then revising the formal simulation model in turn the comprehensive suite of tests explored is not an exhaustive list of model testing procedures as there a number of other advanced methods for understanding uncertain parameter values identifying dominant feedback structures and testing alternative decision making theories although insightful such tests are beyond the skill level of novice modelers and depending on the problem and objective of the model the insights generated may not be important to the issue or efficient to attain given the required investment in time and resources novices should be aware of what expert modelers will recognize from the experiments and discussion presented above that model development and experimentation is an iterative process often requiring numerous iterations of experimentation analysis and revision to both mental and simulation models fig 1 the experimental results and discussion in this paper are the final product of that iterative process in early stages of development a model will not perform adequately when exposed to the barrage of tests outlined above and novices will soon find errors or omissions in model structure that lead to implausible or unexpected behaviors that require explanation and correction the model presented above was exposed to numerous rounds of revision and correction prior to passing the model behavior experiments then it was exposed to comprehensive sensitivity analyses after adequately withstanding the sensitivity tests the model moved forward to the more complex experiments dealing with alternative assumptions and structure novices should not be discouraged when their models fail any of these tests along the reiterative modeling process failing any one test can be expected and provides the needed feedback to the modeler about which model component needs to be improved prior to looking for strategy or policy insights to guide decision making the increasing interest in and more frequent application of systems models by ecologists agriculturalists and natural resource managers is a positive indicator of the recognition of modeling as a valuable tool to better understand and manage the complex dynamic systems that we operate in employing such models has the potential to increase our understanding of the many poorly understood feedback processes that must be well managed if such systems are to function as society desires if researchers who begin or are currently using systems modeling approaches do not have at least a basic understanding of the highly iterative systems analysis process or of the fundamental experimental tests that are required to build confidence that the resulting model is trustworthy to be used the potential for making management and policy recommendations based on fundamentally flawed analyses i e incorrect and unreliable model recommendations is high this paper provides a basic introduction and guide to experimental testing of a developed model in order to build confidence that the model is capable of providing robust insight into a given problem by providing this guide we hope that more modelers will be better prepared to build evaluate and test their models such that the resulting model generated insights will be more capable of mitigating

over time are indicators of the underlying feedback processes that interact to produce the observed behavior pattern of a particular variable of interest in a system from a systems thinking perspective these feedback processes are often simplified into single loop positive reinforcing or negative balancing processes perceived to be the dominant parameters or feedback structure unfortunately without a rigorous quantitative analysis identification of the most influential parameters and feedback structure is spurious at best therefore it is important to be able to differentiate between alternative behavior modes via their mathematical indicators e g the first and second derivatives fig a1 2 model documentation included in the supplementary material are a a copy

data file of the intervention thresholds results fig a2 provides an expanded conceptual model of fig 2 in the paper for additional details regarding auxiliary variables included around the core feedback structure 3 examples of common model revisions made during iterative model testing process one may observe that the model presented in the paper successfully passed all of the performed tests as noted in the text modeling is an iterative process the presented results being the end of a longer series of experimentation and model revision in order to illustrate how these techniques and tests work together in practice in an iterative model development testing and revision process this appendix section provides examples of situations where the model either mental or quantitative failed a test and therefore required revision of the model the revisions here are meant to illustrate common mistakes that many particularly beginners may encounter not an exhaustive protocol for model error identification 3 1 extreme conditions tests there are several common errors or mistakes one may find when the extreme conditions test is failed consider the example from section 4 3 1 where river flow is increased from 100 c f s to 150 c f s and the resulting behavior pattern observed in ecosystem plants and native animals is runaway exponential growth fig a3 a and b in order to correct this we may inspect the stock flow and auxiliary structures around ecosystem plants and native animals we may find that we originally parameterized the graphical function ecosystem growth rate with a minimum value of 0 002 at 20 000 tons of ecosystem plants because many dynamic modeling programs default to extrapolation of graphical functions at the end points for input values beyond the parameterized range having a positive value for the growth rate at the estimated biophysical maximum value of 20 000 tons means that for any value of ecosystem plants above 20 000 tons defaults to a 0 002 growth rate per month fig a3 panel c leading to greater ecosystem plants subject to the same 0 002 growth rate per month this leads to the runaway growth behavior in fig a3 panel a the native animal population without any forage limitation also grows in conjunction with ecosystem plants fig a3 panel b by adjusting the ecosystem growth rate to 0 at the biophysical maximum for the habitat in the refuge 20 000 tons means that any values of ecosystem plants above 20 000 tons will default to 0 for the growth rate fig a3 panel d and therefore ecosystem plants will cease to grow exponentially suppose that change is made and we expect to see the problem corrected in the model yet we still observe runaway exponential growth in native animals and runaway exponential decay in ecosystem plants fig a4 we again examine the stock flow and auxiliary variable structures around each variable we find that the resulting behavior pattern is due to grazing loss to ecosystem plants increasing exponentially fig a4 panel a due to the fact that grazing loss is directly proportional to native animals fig a4 panel b in reality we know that ecosystem plants and native animals being a physical quantities cannot take on negative values in the case of ecosystem plants or grow forever despite the fact that there are no resources to do so in the case of native animals further checks of the model reveals that native animals was first parameterized with a static natality values with natality possessing a greater value than the mortality index when natality mortality the result is exponential growth in the population in order to alleviate this issue a dynamic natality rate was developed fig a4 panel c the assumption here would be that if the population declines below the expected equilibrium value of 25 animals the natality rate also declines due to the greater energy requirements for searching for and finding reproductive mates correcting this should bring the dynamic natality rate into equilibrium with the mortality rate a function of the forage availability index fig a2 by doing so native animals and therefore grazing loss will be constrained in addition we don t want ecosystem plants to take on negative values examining the outflows reveals that the model lacked first order negative feedback controls to regulate the stock flow dynamics to be physically conserved in the first instance grazing loss was simply a function of consumption rate native animals x forage consumption per month with the revised model grazing loss is regulated by ecosystem plants such that the grazing cannot exceed the available biomass in the ecosystem plant stock grazing loss min consumption rate ecosystem plants decomposition 3 2 step pulse and ramp functions examining how a model responds to various steps pulses or ramps is an valuable exercise in developing depth of system understanding and like extreme conditions tests helps identify places for model improvement when the simulation results fail to align with expected or observed behaviors in the real world system first consider a step change in planting costs the most significant annual input cost to the irrigation system from 50 to 100 dollars per ton fig a5 panel a due to the increase in cost we would expect profitability to decline leading to feedback sequence of declines in subsequent planting and irrigation rates crop production and finally long term profits however we see that annual costs decline into negative values fig a5 panel b because annual costs are an outflow from cumulative profits fig a2 and stock or state variables are typically difference equations stock inflow outflow when outflows take on negative values they inadvertently increase the value of the stock which in this case is the profitability of the irrigation system since profitability is improved rather and stressed the adjusted crop planting density is continually adjusted up further reinforcing crop profitability r1 in fig a2 the observation that annual costs become negative is clear indication that we erroneously inserted the wrong sign either to the cost function flow or cumulative profit equation stock identifying and reversing the sign so that costs are positive which have a negative effect on profitability corrects the issue in section 4 3 1 a pulse function was applied to river flow in order to mimic periodic drought conditions fig a6 panel a and observe the responses in ecosystem plants and native animals in an earlier iteration of the test suppose we observe that native animals are hardly effected by the loss of ecosystem plants in drought years and that they rebound back to near their long run equilibrium value much too quickly fig a6 panels b and c having previously examined the stock flow structures around ecosystem plants as well as the natality rate in native animals we now examine the forage availability index ecosystem plants native animals influence on mortality rate b1 in fig a2 this graphical function was parameterized using a distribution derived from data collected from the real world system with a mean 200 tons per head corresponding to 14 mortality rate unfortunately this form of graphical function breaks several best modeling practices first graphical functions should not start and end in the same place in this case at 0 mortality rate on the tails of each side of the curve because of the function is parabolic with one side exhibiting a positive slope and another side exhibiting a negative slope interpretation of the polarity of this variable on native animals is confounding because it both accelerates and slows mortality rate depending on which side of the distribution the forage availability index value falls on although some circumstances may call for using a specified distribution which many programs allow via built in function rather than graphical table functions it is questionable here since the estimated mortality rate given the drought conditions only 5 out of the 30 years falls near the right and left bounds of the distribution for mortality rate due to sampling for ecosystem plants that did not accurately account for years of drought graphical functions can indeed be nonlinear but should have either a positive or negative slope not both in this case removing the left tail positive slope of the distribution fig a6 panel e corrects the polarity error resulting in native animals that express a more realistic and expected decline in behavior pattern fig a6 panel f not all model revisions will be in the quantitative model but rather correct model performance that we did not properly intuit should lead us to revise our mental model consider a linear ramp function similar to that applied to river flow in section 4 3 1 but instead applied to irrigation efficiency in the river flow test a linear increase in river flow led to a linear increase in crop production fig 7 and profits this was simple enough to mentally intuit since there was no change in the rate in which water was converted into crop production only the volume of water applied as irrigation however applying a positively sloped ramp change to irrigation efficiency fig a7 panel a increases the rate at which irrigation applications are converted into crop production fig a7 panel b however because of the economic feedback between the cropping system and profitability r1 and r2 in fig a2 greater crop production improves profit signaling for greater planting densities in subsequent years which increases demand for and applications of irrigation water that produces greater crop volumes because of the positively sloped ramp intuitively we may suspect that the linear improvement in irrigation efficiency would lead to linear increases in the cropping system the result however is a nonlinear or exponential increase in water use crop production and profitability due to the underlying feedback processes fig a2 in this particular test the model was operating correctly and helped expose a limitation in our mental model updating our mental models to be more representative of the dynamic and nonlinear nature of the systems we work in although challenging is greatly enhanced by the use of models for this reason 3 3 identification of behavior patterns as described in table 2 one of the common limitations in novice modelers is properly differentiating between alternative behavior patterns given the irrigation wildlife refuge data fig 3 and the atomic behavior patterns fig a1 we can identify the resulting behavior patterns exhibited from the sensitivity analysis or expected patterns of behavior during intervention analysis fig a8 3 4 comparative analysis of alternative assumptions decision rules or policies counterfactuals or what ifs the final set of examples illustrate some iterative model revision steps during counterfactual trajectory analysis boundary adequacy testing and intervention analysis counterfactual trajectories provide a means to examine model behavior under alternative basic assumptions underpinning the model about past or potential future conditions however the failure to adequately envision conditions that are significantly different than the original model assumptions may mislead modelers to conclude that the problem behavior being modeled is robust enough that even under alternative conditions the same behavior patterns are observed this could become particularly problematic when decisions will be based on insights generated from counterfactual tests for example the counterfactual test in section 4 4 1 represented a test for extremely variable river flow distributed from 0 to 125 c f s and illustrated that both the native animals and the irrigation system would be highly vulnerable to long term variability in river flows however if the counterfactual assumptions are more conservative e g river from 60 to 125 c f s fig a9 panel a the resulting behavior patterns in crop production panel b ecosystem plants panel c and native animals panel d would be the same as the observed conditions that motivated the study failure to envision a significantly new set of conditions runs the risk of basing new strategy or policy changes on flawed insights about the range of possible behavior patterns the model expresses boundary adequacy tests require expansion of the model structure to incorporate elements previously not contained in the original endogenous feedback structure of the model this requires creativity to envision and design new model structure failure to do so may lead modelers to look for alternative adjustments to expand model structure for example a stock may be disaggregated into a series of stock flow structures in this case the stock of native animals may be disaggregated into several age classes that progress from younger to older individuals fig a10 panel a unfortunately this does not expand the model boundary only adds specificity to model structure within the existing model boundary simulating the model with the disaggregated native animal stocks leads to an oscillatory behavior pattern in native animals fig a10 panel b and ecosystem plants fig a10 panel c which is not observed in the real world system fig 3 in section 4 1 which may lead one to make erroneous conclusions about the adequacy of the existing model boundary and structure another boundary adequacy pitfall is likely to be insuring that once new model structure is created that the feedback connectivity is correctly linked with the original model structures for example consider the reservoir storage stock flow structure from section 4 4 2 assume that the new structure is correctly formulated and upon simulation the reservoir storage stock indeed behaves the way we would expect fig a11 panel a however the volume of flow entering the river refuge fig 11 panel b remains static and the resulting dynamics in ecosystem plants and native animals fig 11 panels c and d remain unchanged because the reservoir storage capacity is not infinite we know that some water has to be released downstream to the refuge so the fact that river refuge flow is static is a key indicator that not all of the feedback connections have been incorporated yet lastly in searching for interventions to alleviate the systemic root cause of the problem we can test our intuitions about strategies that would work only symptomatically in the short term for example reintroducing animals fig a12 panel a only increases the native animal population for the year they are introduced since the ecosystem plants required to support the population remain unchanged panel b as irrigation water diversion continues to support the base crop production panel c on the other hand supplemental feeding for native animals up to 95 of their forage demand to alleviate pressure on ecosystem plants does work in the short to medium term fig a13 panels a and b but because revision to the water allocation mechanisms that drive both the refuge and irrigation system remain unchanged the irrigation system represented by crop production and adjusted water irrigation level panels c and d is still allowed to grow albeit at a slower rate due to the costs of importing the supplemental feed although feeding works moderately well the long term result of the system is the same as if no feeding would have occurred

grassland ecosystems with a sensitivity of 0 53 gc m 2 yr 1 and 1 06 gc m 2 yr 1 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios respectively warming is more harmful to npp in the grassland adapted to a warmer climate under the rcp4 5 scenario both grassland sites likely experience a variable net ecosystem carbon exchange however the rcp8 5 scenario and accompanying severe warming would turn both grassland sites to net carbon sources by the end of the century decreasing nep by 0 97 gc m 2 yr 1 at the warmer site and by 0 96 gc m 2 yr 1 at the cooler site driven by increased respiration and limited plant growth keywords climate change tall grassland carbon balance ecosystem model the great plains elevated co2 1 introduction grassland ecosystems play a significant role in the global carbon c balance white et al 2000 and are among the most sensitive ecosystems to climate change guo et al 2016 the way in which grassland ecosystems sequester c is largely affected by the patterns of temperature precipitation and atmospheric co2 concentrations anderson 1991 bloor et al 2010 lemmens et al 2008 currently increasing evidence has shown that elevated co2 stimulates c storage leading to the positive feedback of increased vegetation productivity but warming may counteract the beneficial effects of co2 on c sequestration in grassland ecosystems jones and donnelly 2004 despite the importance of c sequestration large uncertainties remain in the projections of future c sequestration and balance by global terrestrial ecosystem models given rising levels of co2 and climate warming cramer et al 2001 hence improved accuracy of ecosystem model predictions is critical to understanding whether the terrestrial biosphere is likely to be a c sink or source thereby determining the nature in which these ecosystems feedback to future climate change ryan et al 2017 growing evidence has shown that both atmospheric warming and co2 levels can simultaneously regulate grassland ecosystem c and water fluxes grünzweig and körner 2001 knapp et al 1993 morgan et al 2004 owensby et al 1997 weng and luo 2008 warming may stimulate enzyme activity and accelerate plant photosynthetic rates saxe et al 2001 however it can exacerbate drought by increasing evapotranspiration et dai 2013 leading to a higher likelihood of drought stress to terrestrial ecosystems ciais et al 2005 on the other hand elevated atmospheric co2 concentrations often increase soil moisture and mitigate plant water stress by reducing leaf stomatal conductance and thereby increasing water use efficiency wue knapp et al 1993 morgan et al 2004 many short term experimental studies have demonstrated that elevated co2 leads to an increase in grassland c sequestration and preferential allocation of the sequestrated c to the roots casella and soussana 1997 cotrufo and gorissen 1997 fitter et al 1999 nitschelm et al 1997 owensby et al 1996 schapendonk et al 1997 a three year experiment in an annual grassland ecosystem in central california showed that doubled atmospheric co2 greatly increased c partitioning to roots but most of the sequestrated c is lost through increased root respiration and exudation hungate et al 1997 niklaus et al 2001 also showed that high rates of long term c sequestration by elevated co2 are not likely because most plants and detritus have a rapid turnover rate therefore it remains uncertain how the interactive effects of future warming and elevated atmospheric co2 influence grassland ecosystem c balance previous studies used the projected 21st century climate from the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 outputs to force vegetation hydrological models and investigated the responses of terrestrial ecosystems to future potential climate changes for example using cmip5 climate outputs to force a coupled soil moisture and vegetation model hufkens et al 2016 concluded that the vegetation coverage of grassland ecosystems in north america will likely increase despite the projected increase in aridity as grassland ecosystems likely experience a future shift of vegetation growth towards both earlier spring emergence and delayed autumn senescence however the model used in hufkens et al 2016 s study does not include the effects of rising atmospheric co2 on photosynthesis which may underestimate the climate change impacts on grassland productivity in water limited environments hence a better understanding of the combined effects of warming and elevated co2 on grassland ecosystem c sequestration will help predict the capability of grassland ecosystems in determining the global c balance under future climate conditions in this study we hypothesized that the projected climate warming and elevated co2 would increase mesic grassland net primary production npp furthermore we hypothesized that mesic grassland ecosystems would maintain a c sink under projected climate warming and elevated co2 conditions to test these hypotheses we incorporated a two layer soil column hydrologic model into a process based terrestrial ecosystem model to simulate the soil hydrological processes more accurately the soil hydrology model was calibrated and validated against in situ soil moisture measurements the biogeochemistry of the model was calibrated using c and nitrogen n fluxes and stocks that are from published literature then the biogeochemistry was validated against measured data from two eddy covariance ec sites in the central great plains usa after that the ecosystem model was driven by climate outputs from five cmip5 climate models to evaluate how projected warming and elevated atmospheric co2 regulate grassland ecosystem c exchanges at these two sites in the 21st century 2 methods 2 1 study sites our study includes two highly productive mesic grassland sites the arm southern great plains control site hereafter referred to arc 35 32 47 4 n 98 2 24 w in oklahoma and the walnut river site

ecosystem model hydro daily 2 layer tem hd 2l the terrestrial ecosystem model tem has been widely used to study ecosystem c cycling under various environmental changes including climate change ozone damage and natural and human induced disturbances in many ecosystems including temperate forest and grassland boreal forest tundra and croplands felzer et al 2011 2009 2007 pan et al 2002 1998 zhuang et al 2003 2002 an updated version tem hydro was developed specifically to simulate carbon nitrogen water interactions by improving the representation of the role of stomatal conductance on transpiration and uptake of co2 and o3 felzer et al 2011 a daily version of tem hydro was further developed for this study to capture the effects of hydroclimatic extremes on ecosystem processes text s1 to better model c4 grasses the values of model parameters half saturation constant were adjusted to account for lower co2 fertilization levels in c4 plants which is based on previous experimental studies felzer et al 2011 kimball 1983 sokolov et al 2008 to better partition the precipitation in mesic grasslands we updated the daily version of tem hydro with a two layer soil hydrology model referred to as tem hd 2l hereafter fig 2 and figure s1 by incorporating aspects of the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1996 1994 which has been widely used in hydrological studies gao et al 2010 troy et al 2008 wang et al 2012 to replace the one layer bucket soil hydrological model in the original tem hydro vörösmarty et al 1989 specifically the vertical water drainage between the two layers and arno baseflow curves todini 1996 are incorporated into tem hd 2l an s curve method approach was designed to allow for dynamic water accessing for photosynthesis and transpiration figure s2 more details of tem hd 2l and the development of the two layer soil hydrology model can be found in the supplementary information text s2 s3 2 3 model calibration and validation 2 3 1 calibration and validation of soil hydrology the two layer soil hydrology model was calibrated by using the depth average in situ volumetric soil moisture vsm measured at 5 cm and 60 cm depths from 2001 to 2010 at the arc site for the calibration mean daily temperature diurnal temperature range precipitation and wind speed were from maurer et al 2002 and the reanalysis solar radiation and specific humidity are from compo et al 2011 table 1 first we chose ranges for the five hydrologic parameters infiltration shape parameter bi pore size distribution index bp maximum subsurface flow dm fraction of maximum subsurface flow ds and fraction of maximum soil moisture ws table s1 text s4 based on the values recommended by liang et al 1994 the tem hd 2l model was then run at the arc site using the 1875 combinations of these five parameters from 2001 to 2010 the combination of parameters with the least rmse between modeled and measured monthly vsm was chosen as the calibrated hydrological parameters the modeled vsm with these calibrated parameters was then validated against the measured vsm from 2001 to 2010 at three other soil moisture monitoring sites in oklahoma fig 1 to ensure the calibration was representative of the study region figure s3 and s4 the rmse between the monthly observed and modeled vsm from 2001 to 2010 was calculated for each site results show that the rmse on monthly vsm for the calibration site is 4 and the average rmse across validation sites is 3 6 0 8 figure s3 the improvement of the simulated primary productivity by the updated two layer soil hydrology model can be found in figure s5 and text s5 the sensitivity of the modeled ecosystem fluxes and stocks can be found in table s2 and text s6 2 3 2 calibration and validation of biogeochemistry the biogeochemistry of tem hd 2l was calibrated based on values of c and n fluxes and stocks from well studied sites calibration of biogeochemistry determines parameter values for the primary c and n fluxes including gpp plant nitrogen uptake net nitrogen mineralization autotrophic respiration and heterotrophic respiration table s3 we used the c flux estimations from xu et al 2013 who studied the production in a grassland site in central oklahoma as the calibration values for the arc site we set the average annual npp at the arc site to 740 gc m 2 by taking the average npp in 2010 and 2011 from xu et al 2013 the gpp was assumed to be twice the npp based on existing measurements in tall grassland ecosystems johnson and matchett 2001 owensby et al 1999 williams et al 2004 the npp and gpp for the wlr site were calibrated against 570 and 1140 gc m 2 respectively based on the c flux estimates from yang et al 2007 we also required c and n stocks for the biogeochemistry calibration because there are no other data sources known to us we used the values of c and n stocks from a well studied tall grassland site in kansas johnson and matchett 2001 daily climate data used for the biogeochemistry calibration at the arc and wlr sites are from 2001 to 2005 and 1995 to 1999 respectively solar radiation and specific humidity used to calculate vapor pressure are from noaa cires 20th century reanalysis database compo et al 2011 temperature precipitation and wind speed are from the maurer et al 2002 climate dataset table 1 land use and land cover were set as tall grassland plant functional type and plant community structure remained constant throughout the calibration time period the final values of the biogeochemistry parameters are also listed in table s3 along with the sensitivity of target c and n variables to these calibrated parameters we tested the ability of tem hd 2l to simulate gpp and et at the two study sites by comparing modeled results with observations from the arc and the wlr ec sites we used monthly level 4 ec data of gpp and latent heat from 2005 to 2006 at the arc site and 2002 2004 at the wlr site respectively according to the data availability eddy covariance level 4 data were already gap filled and aggregated from daily to monthly due to missing monthly data at the arc and wlr site for the non growing months we only used the growing season april to october for model validation 2 4 model inputs and climate scenarios for transient simulations the daily climate projections used to drive tem hd 2l including solar radiation temperature precipitation vapor pressure and wind speed were from five different earth system models esms table 2 in this study they were used to explore the effects of warming and rising atmospheric co2 concentration on tall grassland ecosystem c fluxes among the five esms the hadgem2 es and the gfdl esm2g respectively represent the high and low values of the projected climate in the 21st century and the other three esms are representative of the mid range values of equilibrium climate sensitivity in the cmip5 suite the cmip5 climate data from 2006 to 2099 were downloaded from the maca database http www climatologylab org maca html which was already downscaled and bias corrected livneh et al 2013 the maximum and minimum temperatures were used to generate daily temperature range and specific humidity was used to generate vapor pressure the future period of the maca database was defined as from 2006 to 2099 which we used as our future period daily historical temperature diurnal temperature range precipitation and wind speed were from maurer et al 2002 and the daily reanalysis solar radiation and specific humidity were from compo et al 2011 the historical period was defined from 1961 to 2005 the climate data were uniformly resampled to 0 125 resolution to be consistent with the maurer historical climate data two representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 spanning moderate and extreme projections of climate change were used as a climate forcing for the 21st century the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios result in 521 and 936 ppm atmospheric co2 concentration by 2099 respectively riahi et al 2011 atmospheric co2 concentration data for the two rcp scenarios were downloaded from van vuuren et al 2011 http www iiasa ac at web apps tnt rcpdb land use and land cover were set as tall grassland functional type and plant community structure remained constant through the future period in the tem hd 2l model 2 5 attribution analysis we used a partial correlation analysis to assess the influence of individual environmental variables on the inter annual variations of modeled npp partial correlation has been used by other studies in analyzing the effects of climate variables on modeled ecosystem dynamics motew and kucharik 2013 the environmental variables include annual average vapor pressure deficit vpd mean annual temperature mat annual total precipitation atp and annual average soil moisture sm that were generated by the tem hd 2l based on the daily input climate we first detrended the time series of these variables using the detrend function provided by the pracma package in rstudio 1 2 5033 rstudio team 2019 then a z score was calculated for the modeled npp and for the environmental drivers for standardization purposes which were used in the partial correlation analysis for the period of 2006 2099 we employed the pcor test approach from the r package ppcor partial correlation coefficients rpartial were then calculated between modeled npp and its corresponding set of four driver variables a value of r p a r t i a l 2 was used to determine the most influential climate driver s for each modeled npp to further differentiate the effects of warming and elevated atmospheric co2 on ecosystem productivity we conducted four more simulations in the first of these simulations we allowed all the climate variables temperature precipitation radiation vapor pressure and wind speed to vary but held the co2 concentration constant at 2006 levels for the period 2006 to 2099 referred to as climate only this constant co2 concentration simulation highlights the effect of climate on ecosystem responses in the second simulation we allowed co2 to vary according to the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios and used constant values for the other climate variables referred to as co2 only the constant climate is the detrended daily climate including daily temperature precipitation wind speed radiation and vapor pressure from 1976 to 2005 and was repeated three times as input climate for the period 2006 2099 for this simulation experiment in the third and fourth simulations we allowed other climate variables to vary according to the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios and used 1976 2005 temperature and precipitation repeatedly for the period 2006 2099 referred to as constant temperature and constant precipitation the differences between the transient climate co2 simulation and the climate only co2 only constant temperature and constant precipitation simulations respectively quantify the individual feedback effects of elevated co2 all climate variables temperature and precipitation on ecosystem dynamics 3 results 3 1 model validations strong correlations of r2 0 74 and r2 0 85 exist at the arc site between the monthly observed and simulated gpp and et respectively fig 3 a b the correlations between monthly ec based and modeled gpp and et are r2 0 82 and r2 0 83 respectively at the wlr site fig 3c d the average simulated growing season gpp at the arc site in 2005 and 2006 is 1209 gc m 2yr 1 which is slightly higher than the average ec growing season gpp of 1072 5 gc m 2 yr 1 the average simulated growing season et in 2005 and 2006 is 637 mm yr 1 which is consistent with average eddy covariance growing season et of 622 mm yr 1 at the wlr site the average simulated growing season gpp from 2002 to 2004 was 833 gc m 2 yr 1 which is slightly lower than the average ec modeled growing season gpp of 976 gc m 2 yr 1 compared to the ec based et 545 mm yr 1 the simulated growing season et from 2002 to 2004 is slightly lower at 487 mm yr 1 in general these results show that tem hd 2l reasonably simulates c and water exchanges at the two study sites 3 2 changes in ecosystem npp the cmip5 model averaged npp at the arc site fig 4 shows a consistently decreasing trend from 2006 to 2099 under both rcp scenarios with npp decreased by 60 and 240 gc m 2 yr 1 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively fig 4a c table s4 the decreasing rate under the rcp8 5 scenario slope 2 56 gc m 2 yr 1 is four times of that under the rcp4 5 scenario slope 0 63 gc m 2 yr 1 a large variation exists in the modeled npp among the cmip5 models under both rcp scenarios with the largest variation driven by the miroc esm although the five cmip5 models agree that the modeled npp overall decreases in the 21st century at the arc site at the wlr site cmip5 model averaged npp shows opposite trends between both rcp scenarios npp increases by 62 gc m 2 yr 1 under the rcp4 5 scenario slope 0 66 gc m 2 yr 2 but barely changes under the rcp8 5 scenario slope 0 02 gc m 2 yr 2 by the end of the 21st century fig 4b d table s4 all five cmip5 models show that npp for wlr would increase throughout the 21st century under the rcp4 5 scenario and npp first increases but then decreases during the last two decades in the 21st century under the rcp8 5 scenario 3 3 attribution of npp changes the effects of climate drivers for npp variations are summarized in table 3 at both grassland sites soil moisture shows a dominant effect on grassland productivity under the rcp4 5 scenario while the vpd mainly drives the interannual variations of npp under the rcp8 5 scenario climate only simulations show that warming decreases the long term trend of npp at the two grassland sites without elevated co2 figure s6 text s7 except for wlr under rcp4 5 where it does not change rising atmospheric co2 alone co2 only has positive effects on npp trends at both grassland sites figure s7 text s7 a positive net fertilization effect including feedbacks between elevated co2 and climate on the long term trends of npp is observed at both grassland sites figure s8a table s4 text s8 climatic warming with the feedback of elevated co2 decreases the long term npp trends at both sites in both scenarios figure s9a table s4 text s8 while the changes in precipitation would increase npp trend at the arc site and has a neutral effect on the npp trend at the wlr site figure s10 table s4 text s8 3 4 changes in net ecosystem production net ecosystem production nep is the difference between gpp and total ecosystem respiration which reflects whether an ecosystem stores c nep greater than zero or releases c nep less than zero lovett et al 2006 the modeling results show that grasslands nep in the central great plains would likely vary under future climate conditions fig 5 before 2040 climate variability explained over 95 p 0 05 of the interannual variation in nep amplitude at both grassland sites under both rcp scenarios but the importance of climate on nep amplitude declined over 80 of interannual variation in nep thereafter the increasing difference between model estimates of nep magnitude driven by climate alone and climate plus co2 implies a growing role of elevated co2 in increasing nep amplitude in this region after 2040 especially at the wlr site under the rcp8 5 scenario however due to the co2 saturation effect on c4 pathway photosynthesis the effects of elevated co2 on grassland nep are marginal specifically the model averaged nep at the arc site has an overall larger interannual variation than at the wlr site under both rcp scenarios under the rcp4 5 scenario a variable nep exists at both study sites with a larger amplitude detected at the arc site than at the wlr site fig 5a b the rcp8 5 scenario climate drives a negative nep i e nep less than 100 gc m 2 yr 1 at both grassland sites by the end of the 21st century leading to a generally decreasing trend in nep slope 0 97 gc m 2 yr 1 at the arc and slope 0 96 gc m 2 yr 1 at the wlr p 0 01 fig 5c d this indicates that compared to the rcp4 5 climate the rcp8 5 scenario climate likely drives the grassland ecosystems to become a net c source by the end of the 21st century 3 5 changes in ecosystem respiration the autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration shows different trends at the two study sites under future climate conditions fig 6 the autotrophic respiration at the arc site first increases from 700 gc m 2 yr 1 to 800 gc m 2 yr 1 by 2070 under both rcp scenarios and then decreases to 700 gc m 2 yr 1 and 600 gc m 2 yr 1 under the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively fig 6a at the wlr site autotrophic respiration increases by 100 gc m 2 yr 1 by the 2090s and then slightly decreases by the end of the 21st century under both rcp scenarios fig 6c heterotrophic respiration at the arc site first shows a leveled off trend from 2006 to the 2070s under both rcp scenarios and then decreases by 100 and 200 gc m 2 yr 1 under the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively fig 6b in contrast at the wlr site heterotrophic respiration shows an overall increasing trend under both rcp scenarios fig 6d with a slightly increased rate under the rcp8 5 scenario autotrophic respiration generally demonstrates a larger inter annual variation among the cmip5 models than heterotrophic respiration over time we used a generalized additive model gam model to estimate the non linear relationship of daily respiration to daily temperature in the growing season for each site statistics of the daily respiration show that under both rcp scenarios autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration nonlinearly increases with temperature increases at both study sites fig 7 however when the temperature exceeds 30 c autotrophic respiration respectively decreases and levels off at the arc and the wlr site under the rcp8 5 scenario interestingly the turning point of heterotrophic respiration occurs at different temperatures between the arc 28 c and wlr 30 c sites suggesting that depleted c assimilation rate and soil organic carbon soc figure s11 text s9 can be triggered more easily in a grassland ecosystem adapted to a warmer climate regime figure s12a b text s10 3 6 changes in hydrology the changes in soil hydrology are overall similar at the two study sites under each rcp scenario fig 8 modeled evaporation from the soil at the arc site increases by 20 and 60 mm yr 1 by the end of the 21st century under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively fig 8c it increases by 14 and 59 mm yr 1 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios at the wlr site respectively fig 8d the modeled transpiration also shows an increasing trend at both study sites given the projected climate in the 21st century with around 20 and 90 mm yr 1 increases at the arc and the wlr sites respectively fig 8e f furthermore modeled surface runoff increases by 28 and 20 mm yr 1 at the arc site by the end of the 21st century under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively fig 8g simulated surface runoff respectively increases by 12 and 7 mm yr 1 at the wlr site under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios fig 8h we also found that the frequency of extreme precipitation events 40 mm increases under both rcp scenarios throughout the 21st century figure s13 text s10 which also drives an increasing trend of surface runoff at both grassland sites figure s14 text s10 greater surface runoff driven by extreme rainfall figure s14 and larger et driven by climatic warming figure s9b d together largely reduce soil water availability thereby leading to a declining trend of soil moisture at both grassland sites fig 8 specifically modeled soil moisture in the upper layer decreases by 8 and 11 mm yr 1 at the arc site by the end of the 21st century under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively fig 8i while at the wlr site modeled soil water is a little higher decreasing by 5 and 9 mm yr 1 in 2099 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively fig 8j modeled growing season daily npp under both rcp scenarios nonlinearly increases with increases in soil moisture at both study sites fig 9 however when the soil moisture exceeds 90 mm vsm equivalent to 33 the npp shows a decreasing trend at both sites under both rcp scenarios the npp response to soil moisture at the arc site shows little difference between the two rcp scenarios in addition the responses of npp to soil moisture at the wlr site is generally less sensitive compared to the arc site when soil moisture exceeds 95 mm which indicates that the c sequestration rate at the cooler grassland site is less controlled by soil moisture than at the warmer grassland site given climatic warming conditions 4 discussion this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the responses of npp nep ecosystem respiration and soil hydrological fluxes to projected climate change at two mesic grassland sites in the central u s using a modeling approach we found that modeled future npp at the two grassland sites is regulated by similar environmental factors with dominant controlling effects of soil moisture under the mild warming known as low emission scenario and warming induced atmospheric drying under the severe known as high emission warming scenario we also found that grassland ecosystems likely become a net c source in the 21st century because enhanced ecosystem respiration as a result of the warming would exceed the ecosystem primary productivity affected by both warming and elevated co2 4 1 grassland ecosystem responses to warming and elevated co2 the responses of grassland ecosystems to the interaction between elevated co2 and warming are likely the net result of multiple responses previous studies have demonstrated that grassland ecosystems do not respond to a consistent elevated co2 environment suggesting that the long term effects of co2 on ecosystems are more likely to occur through some indirect effects such as changes in tissue chemistry soil moisture and species composition than through direct changes in production dukes et al 2005 reich et al 2018 in this study we identified that at both grassland sites in the central great plains the net fertilization effect of co2 on npp is largely canceled out by the enhanced vpd induced from warming table 3 indicating warming induced physiological stress severely damage the plant growth fig 4 s6 and s9 the direct physiological stress of warming on vegetation production has been demonstrated by many studies norby and luo 2004 shaver et al 2000 wan et al 2005 previous studies have argued that warming has increased grassland primary production in cold regions but has decreased it in hot regions ciais et al 2014 gang et al 2015 gao et al 2016 xu et al 2013 which agrees with our modeling results even though elevated co2 is shown to strongly increase wue at both study sites under the rcp8 5 scenario figure s8e the modeling results suggest that the stress effect of warming on grassland ecosystem productivity is more harmful to grassland npp with a generally warmer climate figure s6 table s5 and text s7 an in situ warming experiment also showed that warming by 3 c could lead to a decreased npp of both above ground plant parts 18 and roots 23 in a grassland ecosystem in belgium coinciding with a large decrease in soil moisture de boeck et al 2007 edwards et al 2004 found that soil warming leads to increased root death and eventually reduces root biomass in a temperate grassland ecosystem physiological stresses induced by warming likely cause a down regulation of plant photosynthesis and wue in grassland ecosystems niu et al 2011 2008 which is demonstrated by our modeling results figure s9 although warming could be beneficial to plant growth via enhanced c assimilation these positive effects were shown to be more prevalent in winter and spring walther 2003 whereas in summer the negative effects of supra optimal temperatures and soil water stress likely suppress plant growth in grasslands at the wlr site where grassland ecosystems adapt to a cooler climate regime warming induced drying effects on npp are less fig 9b and are likely to be alleviated by the fertilization effects of rising atmospheric co2 concentration figure s8 which supports our first hypothesis another recent study shows that a warmer and co2 enriched environment can enhance npp in semi arid grassland ecosystems indicating that rising co2 may offset the stress of warming induced drying on plant growth morgan et al 2011 rising atmospheric co2 induced increases in aboveground npp on grassland ecosystems is strongly dependent on plant available soil moisture fay et al 2012 it has been demonstrated that alterations in water processes likely play an important role in enhancing grassland productivity although the interactions between elevated co2 and warming primarily alter soc because soil drying affects soil and plant processes by changing litter decomposition rates luo et al 2004 norby and luo 2004 our modeling results demonstrate that the controlling effects of soil moisture on npp at the wlr is stronger than at the arc site under the rcp4 5 scenario table 3 also modeled soil moisture at the wlr site is higher than that at the arc site fig 8 and table s5 which could provide higher npp at the wlr site because wetter conditions would maintain and even enhance plant growth under warmer conditions with higher co2 our daily simulation results show that compared to the cooler wlr grassland the npp at the warmer arc site is more sensitive i e more negative npp to soil moisture under climatic warming conditions i e the trends of the fitted correlation curves between npp and soil moisture when soil water is in deficit i e soil moisture less than 80 mm fig 9 these results suggest that decreases in soil moisture induced by warming at the warm grassland are more likely to suppress the increases in npp induced by elevated co2 our modeling results agree with the work of zha et al 2005 who used weather station based climate dataset and remote sensing normalized difference vegetation index data to assess the importance of temperature precipitation and evaporation on the productivity in an alpine grassland ecosystem in china 4 2 grassland ecosystem carbon balance a previous study demonstrated that the enrichment of co2 enhances ecosystem metabolism through increased internal c concentration which stimulates photosynthesis and growth however warming can influence ecosystem metabolism through effects on c uptakes and releases which regulates npp and microbial respiration norby and luo 2004 our modeling results reveal that elevated co2 has marginal fertilization effects on increasing grassland ecosystem nep amplitude due to the c4 pathway and the changes in nep are dominated by climate change fig 5 the direct and indirect effects of warming on plant and microbial respiration have been studied by many empirical experiments de valpine and harte 2001 hovenden et al 2008 sherry et al 2007 however large uncertainties remain in resolving whether grassland ecosystems which comprises approximately 40 of the earth s land area white et al 2000 are a net c source or sink with estimates of annual net ecosystem exchange nee varying from a net source of 400 gc m 2 yr 1 to a net sink of 800 gc m 2 yr 1 novick et al 2004 respiration can dominate ecosystem net c balance valentini et al 2000 many experiments have shown that warming increases soil respiration biasi et al 2008 emmett et al 2004 mertens et al 2001 as a result of enhanced activity by microbes and roots sardans et al 2008 increased c input from plant production welker et al 2004 and reduced soil moisture by less frequency rainfall events knapp et al 2008 our modeling results show that the grassland ecosystem respiration consistently increases from the early 21st century to the 2070s fig 6 which agrees with the findings by these studies on the other hand warming induced long term respiratory co2 losses can decrease due to lower litter quality fierer et al 2005 harte and shaw 1995 soil moisture status liu et al 2009 selsted et al 2012 and climate change liu et al 2009 wan et al 2007 the suppressed autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration since the 2070s in our simulation fig 6 is likely due to the comprehensive effects of less c input resulting from depleted aboveground primary productivity fig 4 and reduced soil moisture as the result of rising soil evaporation induced by warming fig 8 previous studies have shown that experimental warming decreased plant biomass due to warming induced moisture stress de boeck et al 2008 de valpine and harte 2001 which suppresses both ecosystem photosynthesis and soil respiration gang et al 2015 with greater respiratory c losses relative to photosynthetic c gains thus leading to a negative impact on net ecosystem productivity in grasslands liu et al 2009 furthermore novick et al 2004 suggested that the effects of climate change on the variability in the hydrological cycle may play a more important role in determining future c dynamics than the projected future atmospheric co2 enrichment in grassland ecosystems gang et al 2015 pointed out that high et induced by warming can lead to drier soils and subsequently decreases productivity our simulations also reflect that et and surface runoff will likely increase due to climate change figs 6 s13 and extreme rainfall events figure s13 s15 respectively by the end of the 21st century eventually reducing long term water availability and c sequestration at both grassland sites our modeling results showing that the soc decreases under both mild and severe warming at the arc site figure s11 indicate the ecosystem soil c will be more easily lost in grasslands adapted to a warmer climate regime compared to the arc site the relatively wetter soil at the wlr site sustaining npp under mild warming conditions provides sufficient litter into the soil c pool and consequently drives a stable soc however the soil c loss in grassland ecosystems will likely be inevitable and surpass c sequestration if warming is severe in the 21st century which indicates that the grassland ecosystem would likely become a net c source consequently rejecting our second hypothesis therefore the trend of grassland ecosystem respiration exceeding npp due to future warming is the main mechanism driving grasslands to be a net c source in the 21st century although only two grasslands sites were studied our simulation results here reflect the importance of the combined interactions between both elevated atmospheric co2 and warming in controlling grassland c exchange in predicting the responses of grassland ecosystems to future climate change further field experiments and model simulations with combined temperature and precipitation manipulations are needed to conclusively determine the importance of the interactions between climate change and elevated co2 on the c balance of terrestrial ecosystems under future climate conditions 4 3 limitations and recommendations our modeling approach did not account for variation in plant community structure or physiology species composition may change under long term drought which may maintain ecosystem stability owensby et al 1999 species turnover can be expected following an extreme drought and intraspecific variability can be a more important driver of the short term functional response of plant communities to drought jung et al 2014 each additional species lost from grasslands has a progressively greater impact on drought resistance tilman and downing 1996 individual species or community types however were not modeled in the tem hd 2l future model development efforts may focus on adding interactions between plant types by introducing new biomes such as c4 grasses and crassulacean acid metabolism plants and into the tem hd 2l and allowing the different species to interact with each other the interaction mechanism among species will be based on previous studies that have successfully proposed and included plant interactions into ecological models to study competition facilitation and redistribution among different vegetation types pan et al 2002 sitch et al 2003 yu et al 2017 yu and d odorico 2015 yu and foster 2016 interactions between climate and ecosystem functions necessitate adding additional soil hydrological processes to better simulate the hydrologic cycle in terrestrial ecosystem models although modifying the single layer soil model in tem hd 2l to a two layer model improves the estimates of vegetation growth balancing hydrology with vegetation c cycling is still necessary to reduce model uncertainty and to increase model stability for two reasons first interactions between soil hydrology and vegetation growth can be more complex for example a partition between lateral fine roots and deep tap roots may better simulate the water accessing ability and improve the water dynamics quantification pan et al 2002 1998 second the vertical water flow from one layer to another which produces a more realistic soil water profile may influence biogeochemical cycles future studies are needed to disentangle the role of changes in precipitation such as the increasing occurrence of extreme precipitation events figure s13 in determining the dynamics of grassland ecosystem c cycling finally the soil layer and runoff routing structure used in the current version of tem hd 2l might limit the estimated precision in soil moisture as the soil hydrology model is based on the original vic 2l model a possible reason for the discrepancy is that the vic 2l tends to underestimate the evaporation due to the low soil moisture in its upper soil layer and the main cause of this error is the lack of a mechanism for moving moisture from the lower to the upper soil layer liang et al 1996 vic 2l has being modified to allow diffusion of moisture between soil layers and to have an additional thin soil layer on top of the previous upper soil layer forming the three layer vic model vic 3l gao et al 2010 the current soil hydrology simulation in the tem hd 2l can potentially be improved by including an additional top thin soil layer as the vic 3l in the future work it will be necessary to comprehensively include the abovementioned three mechanisms in tem hd for raising the accuracy of c and water flux estimations 5 conclusions in this study the combined effects of warming and rising co2 on grassland c exchange in the central great plains were simulated using a modeling approach to more realistically simulate hydrology and c dynamics in highly productive mesic grasslands we constrained parameters of a hydrological model with empirical data from two mesic grassland sites in the central u s the simulation results suggest that the advantage of the fertilization effects of elevated co2 on c sequestration will likely be limited by climatic warming induced drying effect in the mesic grassland ecosystem in the central u s at the wetter site that is adapted to a cooler climate the positive effect of co2 fertilization on npp offsets the negative effect of climate only in the mild warming scenario while at the drier site that is adapted to a warmer climate the negative effects of climate warming more than offset any benefit from co2 the negative effect of climate which is especially pronounced with more severe warming is a product of both direct atmospheric drying effects on photosynthesis and indirect effects due to reduced soil moisture ecosystem respiration increases at first with warming but eventually decreases due to limitation with soil moisture however ecosystem respiration is still larger than npp by the end of the century in both grassland sites with extreme warming therefore the grassland ecosystems at both sites will likely become a net ecosystem c source under future severe warming our work emphasizes that the climatic response of mesic grasslands adds an additional level of complexity to the estimates of net ecosystem exchange and the responses of grassland to future rising co2 in the context of a warming climate credit author statement jien zhang research design model development model calibration and validation model simulation data analysis

24759,atmospheric co2 increased in the 20th century and is expected to continue to do so in the 21st century with resultant warming even so the effects of these changes on the ecological systems such as carbon sequestration in grassland ecosystems are still poorly understood to improve our understanding of the carbon balance we developed a two layer soil hydrology model for terrestrial ecosystem model hydro daily to simulate the carbon fluxes of moist grasslands more accurately using the outputs of two representative concentration projection scenarios rcp4 5 and 8 5 from five coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 climate models we investigated if projected warming and rising atmospheric co2 could stimulate net primary production npp net ecosystem productivity nep and ecosystem respiration of two highly productive grassland sites in the central great plains usa in the 21st century our study shows that elevated atmospheric co2 has a fertilization effect in boosting npp in grassland ecosystems with a sensitivity of 0 53 gc m 2 yr 1 and 1 06 gc m 2 yr 1 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios respectively warming is more harmful to npp in the grassland adapted to a warmer climate under the rcp4 5 scenario both grassland sites likely experience a variable net ecosystem carbon exchange however the rcp8 5 scenario and accompanying severe warming would turn both grassland sites to net carbon sources by the end of the century decreasing nep by 0 97 gc m 2 yr 1 at the warmer site and by 0 96 gc m 2 yr 1 at the cooler site driven by increased respiration and limited plant growth keywords climate change tall grassland carbon balance ecosystem model the great plains elevated co2 1 introduction grassland ecosystems play a significant role in the global carbon c balance white et al 2000 and are among the most sensitive ecosystems to climate change guo et al 2016 the way in which grassland ecosystems sequester c is largely affected by the patterns of temperature precipitation and atmospheric co2 concentrations anderson 1991 bloor et al 2010 lemmens et al 2008 currently increasing evidence has shown that elevated co2 stimulates c storage leading to the positive feedback of increased vegetation productivity but warming may counteract the beneficial effects of co2 on c sequestration in grassland ecosystems jones and donnelly 2004 despite the importance of c sequestration large uncertainties remain in the projections of future c sequestration and balance by global terrestrial ecosystem models given rising levels of co2 and climate warming cramer et al 2001 hence improved accuracy of ecosystem model predictions is critical to understanding whether the terrestrial biosphere is likely to be a c sink or source thereby determining the nature in which these ecosystems feedback to future climate change ryan et al 2017 growing evidence has shown that both atmospheric warming and co2 levels can simultaneously regulate grassland ecosystem c and water fluxes grünzweig and körner 2001 knapp et al 1993 morgan et al 2004 owensby et al 1997 weng and luo 2008 warming may stimulate enzyme activity and accelerate plant photosynthetic rates saxe et al 2001 however it can exacerbate drought by increasing evapotranspiration et dai 2013 leading to a higher likelihood of drought stress to terrestrial ecosystems ciais et al 2005 on the other hand elevated atmospheric co2 concentrations often increase soil moisture and mitigate plant water stress by reducing leaf stomatal conductance and thereby increasing water use efficiency wue knapp et al 1993 morgan et al 2004 many short term experimental studies have demonstrated that elevated co2 leads to an increase in grassland c sequestration and preferential allocation of the sequestrated c to the roots casella and soussana 1997 cotrufo and gorissen 1997 fitter et al 1999 nitschelm et al 1997 owensby et al 1996 schapendonk et al 1997 a three year experiment in an annual grassland ecosystem in central california showed that doubled atmospheric co2 greatly increased c partitioning to roots but most of the sequestrated c is lost through increased root respiration and exudation hungate et al 1997 niklaus et al 2001 also showed that high rates of long term c sequestration by elevated co2 are not likely because most plants and detritus have a rapid turnover rate therefore it remains uncertain how the interactive effects of future warming and elevated atmospheric co2 influence grassland ecosystem c balance previous studies used the projected 21st century climate from the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 outputs to force vegetation hydrological models and investigated the responses of terrestrial ecosystems to future potential climate changes for example using cmip5 climate outputs to force a coupled soil moisture and vegetation model hufkens et al 2016 concluded that the vegetation coverage of grassland ecosystems in north america will likely increase despite the projected increase in aridity as grassland ecosystems likely experience a future shift of vegetation growth towards both earlier spring emergence and delayed autumn senescence however the model used in hufkens et al 2016 s study does not include the effects of rising atmospheric co2 on photosynthesis which may underestimate the climate change impacts on grassland productivity in water limited environments hence a better understanding of the combined effects of warming and elevated co2 on grassland ecosystem c sequestration will help predict the capability of grassland ecosystems in determining the global c balance under future climate conditions in this study we hypothesized that the projected climate warming and elevated co2 would increase mesic grassland net primary production npp furthermore we hypothesized that mesic grassland ecosystems would maintain a c sink under projected climate warming and elevated co2 conditions to test these hypotheses we incorporated a two layer soil column hydrologic model into a process based terrestrial ecosystem model to simulate the soil hydrological processes more accurately the soil hydrology model was calibrated and validated against in situ soil moisture measurements the biogeochemistry of the model was calibrated using c and nitrogen n fluxes and stocks that are from published literature then the biogeochemistry was validated against measured data from two eddy covariance ec sites in the central great plains usa after that the ecosystem model was driven by climate outputs from five cmip5 climate models to evaluate how projected warming and elevated atmospheric co2 regulate grassland ecosystem c exchanges at these two sites in the 21st century 2 methods 2 1 study sites our study includes two highly productive mesic grassland sites the arm southern great plains control site hereafter referred to arc 35 32 47 4 n 98 2 24 w in oklahoma and the walnut river site

ecosystem model hydro daily 2 layer tem hd 2l the terrestrial ecosystem model tem has been widely used to study ecosystem c cycling under various environmental changes including climate change ozone damage and natural and human induced disturbances in many ecosystems including temperate forest and grassland boreal forest tundra and croplands felzer et al 2011 2009 2007 pan et al 2002 1998 zhuang et al 2003 2002 an updated version tem hydro was developed specifically to simulate carbon nitrogen water interactions by improving the representation of the role of stomatal conductance on transpiration and uptake of co2 and o3 felzer et al 2011 a daily version of tem hydro was further developed for this study to capture the effects of hydroclimatic extremes on ecosystem processes text s1 to better model c4 grasses the values of model parameters half saturation constant were adjusted to account for lower co2 fertilization levels in c4 plants which is based on previous experimental studies felzer et al 2011 kimball 1983 sokolov et al 2008 to better partition the precipitation in mesic grasslands we updated the daily version of tem hydro with a two layer soil hydrology model referred to as tem hd 2l hereafter fig 2 and figure s1 by incorporating aspects of the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1996 1994 which has been widely used in hydrological studies gao et al 2010 troy et al 2008 wang et al 2012 to replace the one layer bucket soil hydrological model in the original tem hydro vörösmarty et al 1989 specifically the vertical water drainage between the two layers and arno baseflow curves todini 1996 are incorporated into tem hd 2l an s curve method approach was designed to allow for dynamic water accessing for photosynthesis and transpiration figure s2 more details of tem hd 2l and the development of the two layer soil hydrology model can be found in the supplementary information text s2 s3 2 3 model calibration and validation 2 3 1 calibration and validation of soil hydrology the two layer soil hydrology model was calibrated by using the depth average in situ volumetric soil moisture vsm measured at 5 cm and 60 cm depths from 2001 to 2010 at the arc site for the calibration mean daily temperature diurnal temperature range precipitation and wind speed were from maurer et al 2002 and the reanalysis solar radiation and specific humidity are from compo et al 2011 table 1 first we chose ranges for the five hydrologic parameters infiltration shape parameter bi pore size distribution index bp maximum subsurface flow dm fraction of maximum subsurface flow ds and fraction of maximum soil moisture ws table s1 text s4 based on the values recommended by liang et al 1994 the tem hd 2l model was then run at the arc site using the 1875 combinations of these five parameters from 2001 to 2010 the combination of parameters with the least rmse between modeled and measured monthly vsm was chosen as the calibrated hydrological parameters the modeled vsm with these calibrated parameters was then validated against the measured vsm from 2001 to 2010 at three other soil moisture monitoring sites in oklahoma fig 1 to ensure the calibration was representative of the study region figure s3 and s4 the rmse between the monthly observed and modeled vsm from 2001 to 2010 was calculated for each site results show that the rmse on monthly vsm for the calibration site is 4 and the average rmse across validation sites is 3 6 0 8 figure s3 the improvement of the simulated primary productivity by the updated two layer soil hydrology model can be found in figure s5 and text s5 the sensitivity of the modeled ecosystem fluxes and stocks can be found in table s2 and text s6 2 3 2 calibration and validation of biogeochemistry the biogeochemistry of tem hd 2l was calibrated based on values of c and n fluxes and stocks from well studied sites calibration of biogeochemistry determines parameter values for the primary c and n fluxes including gpp plant nitrogen uptake net nitrogen mineralization autotrophic respiration and heterotrophic respiration table s3 we used the c flux estimations from xu et al 2013 who studied the production in a grassland site in central oklahoma as the calibration values for the arc site we set the average annual npp at the arc site to 740 gc m 2 by taking the average npp in 2010 and 2011 from xu et al 2013 the gpp was assumed to be twice the npp based on existing measurements in tall grassland ecosystems johnson and matchett 2001 owensby et al 1999 williams et al 2004 the npp and gpp for the wlr site were calibrated against 570 and 1140 gc m 2 respectively based on the c flux estimates from yang et al 2007 we also required c and n stocks for the biogeochemistry calibration because there are no other data sources known to us we used the values of c and n stocks from a well studied tall grassland site in kansas johnson and matchett 2001 daily climate data used for the biogeochemistry calibration at the arc and wlr sites are from 2001 to 2005 and 1995 to 1999 respectively solar radiation and specific humidity used to calculate vapor pressure are from noaa cires 20th century reanalysis database compo et al 2011 temperature precipitation and wind speed are from the maurer et al 2002 climate dataset table 1 land use and land cover were set as tall grassland plant functional type and plant community structure remained constant throughout the calibration time period the final values of the biogeochemistry parameters are also listed in table s3 along with the sensitivity of target c and n variables to these calibrated parameters we tested the ability of tem hd 2l to simulate gpp and et at the two study sites by comparing modeled results with observations from the arc and the wlr ec sites we used monthly level 4 ec data of gpp and latent heat from 2005 to 2006 at the arc site and 2002 2004 at the wlr site respectively according to the data availability eddy covariance level 4 data were already gap filled and aggregated from daily to monthly due to missing monthly data at the arc and wlr site for the non growing months we only used the growing season april to october for model validation 2 4 model inputs and climate scenarios for transient simulations the daily climate projections used to drive tem hd 2l including solar radiation temperature precipitation vapor pressure and wind speed were from five different earth system models esms table 2 in this study they were used to explore the effects of warming and rising atmospheric co2 concentration on tall grassland ecosystem c fluxes among the five esms the hadgem2 es and the gfdl esm2g respectively represent the high and low values of the projected climate in the 21st century and the other three esms are representative of the mid range values of equilibrium climate sensitivity in the cmip5 suite the cmip5 climate data from 2006 to 2099 were downloaded from the maca database http www climatologylab org maca html which was already downscaled and bias corrected livneh et al 2013 the maximum and minimum temperatures were used to generate daily temperature range and specific humidity was used to generate vapor pressure the future period of the maca database was defined as from 2006 to 2099 which we used as our future period daily historical temperature diurnal temperature range precipitation and wind speed were from maurer et al 2002 and the daily reanalysis solar radiation and specific humidity were from compo et al 2011 the historical period was defined from 1961 to 2005 the climate data were uniformly resampled to 0 125 resolution to be consistent with the maurer historical climate data two representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 spanning moderate and extreme projections of climate change were used as a climate forcing for the 21st century the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios result in 521 and 936 ppm atmospheric co2 concentration by 2099 respectively riahi et al 2011 atmospheric co2 concentration data for the two rcp scenarios were downloaded from van vuuren et al 2011 http www iiasa ac at web apps tnt rcpdb land use and land cover were set as tall grassland functional type and plant community structure remained constant through the future period in the tem hd 2l model 2 5 attribution analysis we used a partial correlation analysis to assess the influence of individual environmental variables on the inter annual variations of modeled npp partial correlation has been used by other studies in analyzing the effects of climate variables on modeled ecosystem dynamics motew and kucharik 2013 the environmental variables include annual average vapor pressure deficit vpd mean annual temperature mat annual total precipitation atp and annual average soil moisture sm that were generated by the tem hd 2l based on the daily input climate we first detrended the time series of these variables using the detrend function provided by the pracma package in rstudio 1 2 5033 rstudio team 2019 then a z score was calculated for the modeled npp and for the environmental drivers for standardization purposes which were used in the partial correlation analysis for the period of 2006 2099 we employed the pcor test approach from the r package ppcor partial correlation coefficients rpartial were then calculated between modeled npp and its corresponding set of four driver variables a value of r p a r t i a l 2 was used to determine the most influential climate driver s for each modeled npp to further differentiate the effects of warming and elevated atmospheric co2 on ecosystem productivity we conducted four more simulations in the first of these simulations we allowed all the climate variables temperature precipitation radiation vapor pressure and wind speed to vary but held the co2 concentration constant at 2006 levels for the period 2006 to 2099 referred to as climate only this constant co2 concentration simulation highlights the effect of climate on ecosystem responses in the second simulation we allowed co2 to vary according to the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios and used constant values for the other climate variables referred to as co2 only the constant climate is the detrended daily climate including daily temperature precipitation wind speed radiation and vapor pressure from 1976 to 2005 and was repeated three times as input climate for the period 2006 2099 for this simulation experiment in the third and fourth simulations we allowed other climate variables to vary according to the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios and used 1976 2005 temperature and precipitation repeatedly for the period 2006 2099 referred to as constant temperature and constant precipitation the differences between the transient climate co2 simulation and the climate only co2 only constant temperature and constant precipitation simulations respectively quantify the individual feedback effects of elevated co2 all climate variables temperature and precipitation on ecosystem dynamics 3 results 3 1 model validations strong correlations of r2 0 74 and r2 0 85 exist at the arc site between the monthly observed and simulated gpp and et respectively fig 3 a b the correlations between monthly ec based and modeled gpp and et are r2 0 82 and r2 0 83 respectively at the wlr site fig 3c d the average simulated growing season gpp at the arc site in 2005 and 2006 is 1209 gc m 2yr 1 which is slightly higher than the average ec growing season gpp of 1072 5 gc m 2 yr 1 the average simulated growing season et in 2005 and 2006 is 637 mm yr 1 which is consistent with average eddy covariance growing season et of 622 mm yr 1 at the wlr site the average simulated growing season gpp from 2002 to 2004 was 833 gc m 2 yr 1 which is slightly lower than the average ec modeled growing season gpp of 976 gc m 2 yr 1 compared to the ec based et 545 mm yr 1 the simulated growing season et from 2002 to 2004 is slightly lower at 487 mm yr 1 in general these results show that tem hd 2l reasonably simulates c and water exchanges at the two study sites 3 2 changes in ecosystem npp the cmip5 model averaged npp at the arc site fig 4 shows a consistently decreasing trend from 2006 to 2099 under both rcp scenarios with npp decreased by 60 and 240 gc m 2 yr 1 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively fig 4a c table s4 the decreasing rate under the rcp8 5 scenario slope 2 56 gc m 2 yr 1 is four times of that under the rcp4 5 scenario slope 0 63 gc m 2 yr 1 a large variation exists in the modeled npp among the cmip5 models under both rcp scenarios with the largest variation driven by the miroc esm although the five cmip5 models agree that the modeled npp overall decreases in the 21st century at the arc site at the wlr site cmip5 model averaged npp shows opposite trends between both rcp scenarios npp increases by 62 gc m 2 yr 1 under the rcp4 5 scenario slope 0 66 gc m 2 yr 2 but barely changes under the rcp8 5 scenario slope 0 02 gc m 2 yr 2 by the end of the 21st century fig 4b d table s4 all five cmip5 models show that npp for wlr would increase throughout the 21st century under the rcp4 5 scenario and npp first increases but then decreases during the last two decades in the 21st century under the rcp8 5 scenario 3 3 attribution of npp changes the effects of climate drivers for npp variations are summarized in table 3 at both grassland sites soil moisture shows a dominant effect on grassland productivity under the rcp4 5 scenario while the vpd mainly drives the interannual variations of npp under the rcp8 5 scenario climate only simulations show that warming decreases the long term trend of npp at the two grassland sites without elevated co2 figure s6 text s7 except for wlr under rcp4 5 where it does not change rising atmospheric co2 alone co2 only has positive effects on npp trends at both grassland sites figure s7 text s7 a positive net fertilization effect including feedbacks between elevated co2 and climate on the long term trends of npp is observed at both grassland sites figure s8a table s4 text s8 climatic warming with the feedback of elevated co2 decreases the long term npp trends at both sites in both scenarios figure s9a table s4 text s8 while the changes in precipitation would increase npp trend at the arc site and has a neutral effect on the npp trend at the wlr site figure s10 table s4 text s8 3 4 changes in net ecosystem production net ecosystem production nep is the difference between gpp and total ecosystem respiration which reflects whether an ecosystem stores c nep greater than zero or releases c nep less than zero lovett et al 2006 the modeling results show that grasslands nep in the central great plains would likely vary under future climate conditions fig 5 before 2040 climate variability explained over 95 p 0 05 of the interannual variation in nep amplitude at both grassland sites under both rcp scenarios but the importance of climate on nep amplitude declined over 80 of interannual variation in nep thereafter the increasing difference between model estimates of nep magnitude driven by climate alone and climate plus co2 implies a growing role of elevated co2 in increasing nep amplitude in this region after 2040 especially at the wlr site under the rcp8 5 scenario however due to the co2 saturation effect on c4 pathway photosynthesis the effects of elevated co2 on grassland nep are marginal specifically the model averaged nep at the arc site has an overall larger interannual variation than at the wlr site under both rcp scenarios under the rcp4 5 scenario a variable nep exists at both study sites with a larger amplitude detected at the arc site than at the wlr site fig 5a b the rcp8 5 scenario climate drives a negative nep i e nep less than 100 gc m 2 yr 1 at both grassland sites by the end of the 21st century leading to a generally decreasing trend in nep slope 0 97 gc m 2 yr 1 at the arc and slope 0 96 gc m 2 yr 1 at the wlr p 0 01 fig 5c d this indicates that compared to the rcp4 5 climate the rcp8 5 scenario climate likely drives the grassland ecosystems to become a net c source by the end of the 21st century 3 5 changes in ecosystem respiration the autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration shows different trends at the two study sites under future climate conditions fig 6 the autotrophic respiration at the arc site first increases from 700 gc m 2 yr 1 to 800 gc m 2 yr 1 by 2070 under both rcp scenarios and then decreases to 700 gc m 2 yr 1 and 600 gc m 2 yr 1 under the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively fig 6a at the wlr site autotrophic respiration increases by 100 gc m 2 yr 1 by the 2090s and then slightly decreases by the end of the 21st century under both rcp scenarios fig 6c heterotrophic respiration at the arc site first shows a leveled off trend from 2006 to the 2070s under both rcp scenarios and then decreases by 100 and 200 gc m 2 yr 1 under the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively fig 6b in contrast at the wlr site heterotrophic respiration shows an overall increasing trend under both rcp scenarios fig 6d with a slightly increased rate under the rcp8 5 scenario autotrophic respiration generally demonstrates a larger inter annual variation among the cmip5 models than heterotrophic respiration over time we used a generalized additive model gam model to estimate the non linear relationship of daily respiration to daily temperature in the growing season for each site statistics of the daily respiration show that under both rcp scenarios autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration nonlinearly increases with temperature increases at both study sites fig 7 however when the temperature exceeds 30 c autotrophic respiration respectively decreases and levels off at the arc and the wlr site under the rcp8 5 scenario interestingly the turning point of heterotrophic respiration occurs at different temperatures between the arc 28 c and wlr 30 c sites suggesting that depleted c assimilation rate and soil organic carbon soc figure s11 text s9 can be triggered more easily in a grassland ecosystem adapted to a warmer climate regime figure s12a b text s10 3 6 changes in hydrology the changes in soil hydrology are overall similar at the two study sites under each rcp scenario fig 8 modeled evaporation from the soil at the arc site increases by 20 and 60 mm yr 1 by the end of the 21st century under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively fig 8c it increases by 14 and 59 mm yr 1 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios at the wlr site respectively fig 8d the modeled transpiration also shows an increasing trend at both study sites given the projected climate in the 21st century with around 20 and 90 mm yr 1 increases at the arc and the wlr sites respectively fig 8e f furthermore modeled surface runoff increases by 28 and 20 mm yr 1 at the arc site by the end of the 21st century under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively fig 8g simulated surface runoff respectively increases by 12 and 7 mm yr 1 at the wlr site under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios fig 8h we also found that the frequency of extreme precipitation events 40 mm increases under both rcp scenarios throughout the 21st century figure s13 text s10 which also drives an increasing trend of surface runoff at both grassland sites figure s14 text s10 greater surface runoff driven by extreme rainfall figure s14 and larger et driven by climatic warming figure s9b d together largely reduce soil water availability thereby leading to a declining trend of soil moisture at both grassland sites fig 8 specifically modeled soil moisture in the upper layer decreases by 8 and 11 mm yr 1 at the arc site by the end of the 21st century under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively fig 8i while at the wlr site modeled soil water is a little higher decreasing by 5 and 9 mm yr 1 in 2099 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively fig 8j modeled growing season daily npp under both rcp scenarios nonlinearly increases with increases in soil moisture at both study sites fig 9 however when the soil moisture exceeds 90 mm vsm equivalent to 33 the npp shows a decreasing trend at both sites under both rcp scenarios the npp response to soil moisture at the arc site shows little difference between the two rcp scenarios in addition the responses of npp to soil moisture at the wlr site is generally less sensitive compared to the arc site when soil moisture exceeds 95 mm which indicates that the c sequestration rate at the cooler grassland site is less controlled by soil moisture than at the warmer grassland site given climatic warming conditions 4 discussion this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the responses of npp nep ecosystem respiration and soil hydrological fluxes to projected climate change at two mesic grassland sites in the central u s using a modeling approach we found that modeled future npp at the two grassland sites is regulated by similar environmental factors with dominant controlling effects of soil moisture under the mild warming known as low emission scenario and warming induced atmospheric drying under the severe known as high emission warming scenario we also found that grassland ecosystems likely become a net c source in the 21st century because enhanced ecosystem respiration as a result of the warming would exceed the ecosystem primary productivity affected by both warming and elevated co2 4 1 grassland ecosystem responses to warming and elevated co2 the responses of grassland ecosystems to the interaction between elevated co2 and warming are likely the net result of multiple responses previous studies have demonstrated that grassland ecosystems do not respond to a consistent elevated co2 environment suggesting that the long term effects of co2 on ecosystems are more likely to occur through some indirect effects such as changes in tissue chemistry soil moisture and species composition than through direct changes in production dukes et al 2005 reich et al 2018 in this study we identified that at both grassland sites in the central great plains the net fertilization effect of co2 on npp is largely canceled out by the enhanced vpd induced from warming table 3 indicating warming induced physiological stress severely damage the plant growth fig 4 s6 and s9 the direct physiological stress of warming on vegetation production has been demonstrated by many studies norby and luo 2004 shaver et al 2000 wan et al 2005 previous studies have argued that warming has increased grassland primary production in cold regions but has decreased it in hot regions ciais et al 2014 gang et al 2015 gao et al 2016 xu et al 2013 which agrees with our modeling results even though elevated co2 is shown to strongly increase wue at both study sites under the rcp8 5 scenario figure s8e the modeling results suggest that the stress effect of warming on grassland ecosystem productivity is more harmful to grassland npp with a generally warmer climate figure s6 table s5 and text s7 an in situ warming experiment also showed that warming by 3 c could lead to a decreased npp of both above ground plant parts 18 and roots 23 in a grassland ecosystem in belgium coinciding with a large decrease in soil moisture de boeck et al 2007 edwards et al 2004 found that soil warming leads to increased root death and eventually reduces root biomass in a temperate grassland ecosystem physiological stresses induced by warming likely cause a down regulation of plant photosynthesis and wue in grassland ecosystems niu et al 2011 2008 which is demonstrated by our modeling results figure s9 although warming could be beneficial to plant growth via enhanced c assimilation these positive effects were shown to be more prevalent in winter and spring walther 2003 whereas in summer the negative effects of supra optimal temperatures and soil water stress likely suppress plant growth in grasslands at the wlr site where grassland ecosystems adapt to a cooler climate regime warming induced drying effects on npp are less fig 9b and are likely to be alleviated by the fertilization effects of rising atmospheric co2 concentration figure s8 which supports our first hypothesis another recent study shows that a warmer and co2 enriched environment can enhance npp in semi arid grassland ecosystems indicating that rising co2 may offset the stress of warming induced drying on plant growth morgan et al 2011 rising atmospheric co2 induced increases in aboveground npp on grassland ecosystems is strongly dependent on plant available soil moisture fay et al 2012 it has been demonstrated that alterations in water processes likely play an important role in enhancing grassland productivity although the interactions between elevated co2 and warming primarily alter soc because soil drying affects soil and plant processes by changing litter decomposition rates luo et al 2004 norby and luo 2004 our modeling results demonstrate that the controlling effects of soil moisture on npp at the wlr is stronger than at the arc site under the rcp4 5 scenario table 3 also modeled soil moisture at the wlr site is higher than that at the arc site fig 8 and table s5 which could provide higher npp at the wlr site because wetter conditions would maintain and even enhance plant growth under warmer conditions with higher co2 our daily simulation results show that compared to the cooler wlr grassland the npp at the warmer arc site is more sensitive i e more negative npp to soil moisture under climatic warming conditions i e the trends of the fitted correlation curves between npp and soil moisture when soil water is in deficit i e soil moisture less than 80 mm fig 9 these results suggest that decreases in soil moisture induced by warming at the warm grassland are more likely to suppress the increases in npp induced by elevated co2 our modeling results agree with the work of zha et al 2005 who used weather station based climate dataset and remote sensing normalized difference vegetation index data to assess the importance of temperature precipitation and evaporation on the productivity in an alpine grassland ecosystem in china 4 2 grassland ecosystem carbon balance a previous study demonstrated that the enrichment of co2 enhances ecosystem metabolism through increased internal c concentration which stimulates photosynthesis and growth however warming can influence ecosystem metabolism through effects on c uptakes and releases which regulates npp and microbial respiration norby and luo 2004 our modeling results reveal that elevated co2 has marginal fertilization effects on increasing grassland ecosystem nep amplitude due to the c4 pathway and the changes in nep are dominated by climate change fig 5 the direct and indirect effects of warming on plant and microbial respiration have been studied by many empirical experiments de valpine and harte 2001 hovenden et al 2008 sherry et al 2007 however large uncertainties remain in resolving whether grassland ecosystems which comprises approximately 40 of the earth s land area white et al 2000 are a net c source or sink with estimates of annual net ecosystem exchange nee varying from a net source of 400 gc m 2 yr 1 to a net sink of 800 gc m 2 yr 1 novick et al 2004 respiration can dominate ecosystem net c balance valentini et al 2000 many experiments have shown that warming increases soil respiration biasi et al 2008 emmett et al 2004 mertens et al 2001 as a result of enhanced activity by microbes and roots sardans et al 2008 increased c input from plant production welker et al 2004 and reduced soil moisture by less frequency rainfall events knapp et al 2008 our modeling results show that the grassland ecosystem respiration consistently increases from the early 21st century to the 2070s fig 6 which agrees with the findings by these studies on the other hand warming induced long term respiratory co2 losses can decrease due to lower litter quality fierer et al 2005 harte and shaw 1995 soil moisture status liu et al 2009 selsted et al 2012 and climate change liu et al 2009 wan et al 2007 the suppressed autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration since the 2070s in our simulation fig 6 is likely due to the comprehensive effects of less c input resulting from depleted aboveground primary productivity fig 4 and reduced soil moisture as the result of rising soil evaporation induced by warming fig 8 previous studies have shown that experimental warming decreased plant biomass due to warming induced moisture stress de boeck et al 2008 de valpine and harte 2001 which suppresses both ecosystem photosynthesis and soil respiration gang et al 2015 with greater respiratory c losses relative to photosynthetic c gains thus leading to a negative impact on net ecosystem productivity in grasslands liu et al 2009 furthermore novick et al 2004 suggested that the effects of climate change on the variability in the hydrological cycle may play a more important role in determining future c dynamics than the projected future atmospheric co2 enrichment in grassland ecosystems gang et al 2015 pointed out that high et induced by warming can lead to drier soils and subsequently decreases productivity our simulations also reflect that et and surface runoff will likely increase due to climate change figs 6 s13 and extreme rainfall events figure s13 s15 respectively by the end of the 21st century eventually reducing long term water availability and c sequestration at both grassland sites our modeling results showing that the soc decreases under both mild and severe warming at the arc site figure s11 indicate the ecosystem soil c will be more easily lost in grasslands adapted to a warmer climate regime compared to the arc site the relatively wetter soil at the wlr site sustaining npp under mild warming conditions provides sufficient litter into the soil c pool and consequently drives a stable soc however the soil c loss in grassland ecosystems will likely be inevitable and surpass c sequestration if warming is severe in the 21st century which indicates that the grassland ecosystem would likely become a net c source consequently rejecting our second hypothesis therefore the trend of grassland ecosystem respiration exceeding npp due to future warming is the main mechanism driving grasslands to be a net c source in the 21st century although only two grasslands sites were studied our simulation results here reflect the importance of the combined interactions between both elevated atmospheric co2 and warming in controlling grassland c exchange in predicting the responses of grassland ecosystems to future climate change further field experiments and model simulations with combined temperature and precipitation manipulations are needed to conclusively determine the importance of the interactions between climate change and elevated co2 on the c balance of terrestrial ecosystems under future climate conditions 4 3 limitations and recommendations our modeling approach did not account for variation in plant community structure or physiology species composition may change under long term drought which may maintain ecosystem stability owensby et al 1999 species turnover can be expected following an extreme drought and intraspecific variability can be a more important driver of the short term functional response of plant communities to drought jung et al 2014 each additional species lost from grasslands has a progressively greater impact on drought resistance tilman and downing 1996 individual species or community types however were not modeled in the tem hd 2l future model development efforts may focus on adding interactions between plant types by introducing new biomes such as c4 grasses and crassulacean acid metabolism plants and into the tem hd 2l and allowing the different species to interact with each other the interaction mechanism among species will be based on previous studies that have successfully proposed and included plant interactions into ecological models to study competition facilitation and redistribution among different vegetation types pan et al 2002 sitch et al 2003 yu et al 2017 yu and d odorico 2015 yu and foster 2016 interactions between climate and ecosystem functions necessitate adding additional soil hydrological processes to better simulate the hydrologic cycle in terrestrial ecosystem models although modifying the single layer soil model in tem hd 2l to a two layer model improves the estimates of vegetation growth balancing hydrology with vegetation c cycling is still necessary to reduce model uncertainty and to increase model stability for two reasons first interactions between soil hydrology and vegetation growth can be more complex for example a partition between lateral fine roots and deep tap roots may better simulate the water accessing ability and improve the water dynamics quantification pan et al 2002 1998 second the vertical water flow from one layer to another which produces a more realistic soil water profile may influence biogeochemical cycles future studies are needed to disentangle the role of changes in precipitation such as the increasing occurrence of extreme precipitation events figure s13 in determining the dynamics of grassland ecosystem c cycling finally the soil layer and runoff routing structure used in the current version of tem hd 2l might limit the estimated precision in soil moisture as the soil hydrology model is based on the original vic 2l model a possible reason for the discrepancy is that the vic 2l tends to underestimate the evaporation due to the low soil moisture in its upper soil layer and the main cause of this error is the lack of a mechanism for moving moisture from the lower to the upper soil layer liang et al 1996 vic 2l has being modified to allow diffusion of moisture between soil layers and to have an additional thin soil layer on top of the previous upper soil layer forming the three layer vic model vic 3l gao et al 2010 the current soil hydrology simulation in the tem hd 2l can potentially be improved by including an additional top thin soil layer as the vic 3l in the future work it will be necessary to comprehensively include the abovementioned three mechanisms in tem hd for raising the accuracy of c and water flux estimations 5 conclusions in this study the combined effects of warming and rising co2 on grassland c exchange in the central great plains were simulated using a modeling approach to more realistically simulate hydrology and c dynamics in highly productive mesic grasslands we constrained parameters of a hydrological model with empirical data from two mesic grassland sites in the central u s the simulation results suggest that the advantage of the fertilization effects of elevated co2 on c sequestration will likely be limited by climatic warming induced drying effect in the mesic grassland ecosystem in the central u s at the wetter site that is adapted to a cooler climate the positive effect of co2 fertilization on npp offsets the negative effect of climate only in the mild warming scenario while at the drier site that is adapted to a warmer climate the negative effects of climate warming more than offset any benefit from co2 the negative effect of climate which is especially pronounced with more severe warming is a product of both direct atmospheric drying effects on photosynthesis and indirect effects due to reduced soil moisture ecosystem respiration increases at first with warming but eventually decreases due to limitation with soil moisture however ecosystem respiration is still larger than npp by the end of the century in both grassland sites with extreme warming therefore the grassland ecosystems at both sites will likely become a net ecosystem c source under future severe warming our work emphasizes that the climatic response of mesic grasslands adds an additional level of complexity to the estimates of net ecosystem exchange and the responses of grassland to future rising co2 in the context of a warming climate credit author statement jien zhang research design model development model calibration and validation model simulation data analysis
