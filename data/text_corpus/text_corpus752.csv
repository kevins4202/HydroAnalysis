3760,accurate precipitation retrievals with fine spatio temporal resolutions are critical in global and regional analyses as an important alternative of satellite based precipitation products model based precipitation estimates have undergone rapid development over the past few decades with the recent public release of the fifth generation of atmospheric reanalysis by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts era5 and era5 land it is necessary to verify whether these two latest model based precipitation products outperform satellite based precipitation products this study comprehensively evaluates the performances of state of the art satellite based and model based precipitation products including the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap era5 and era5 land over mainland china from 2016 to 2019 the main findings are as follows 1 satellite based products generally outperform model based products but the latter significantly perform better than the former over high latitude regions and in winter 2 era5 and era5 land share similar spatio temporal patterns and have their own advantages in terms of different types of metrics 3 satellite based products perform best over subregions of subtropical and tropical monsoon climate st whereas model based products show highest performance over subregions of temperate monsoon climate tm and temperate continental climate tc both types of products show the poorest performance over subregions of plateau mountain climate pm 4 imerg final performs best in terms of precipitation events while gsmap gauge tends to overestimate the duration of precipitation events and model based products tend to underestimate the mean precipitation rate of the events these findings provide valuable insights into the error characteristics of state of the art model based and satellite based precipitation products in the recent years and will also serve as useful reference for the potential improvement of precipitation retrieval algorithms in the next generation 1 introduction precipitation is one of the most fundamental components of the global water cycle and plays an important role in matter and energy exchanges roca et al 2010 skofronick jackson et al 2017 arabzadeh et al 2020 xu et al 2021 as precipitation patterns are highly variable in both space and time accurate measurement of precipitation has become a repeated theme among hydrological meteorological and climatological communities over the past few decades kidd et al 2017 networks of conventional ground based instruments designed to estimate precipitation for instance rain gauges disdrometers and weather radars are unevenly distributed especially in oceans and in some meteorologically important land regions e g the tibetan plateau yao et al 2012 ma et al 2017a ma et al 2017b moreover ground based instruments usually have various shortcomings for example rain gauges often have undercatch issues due to deformation of the wind field wetting losses evaporation sublimation splashing etc ehsani and behrangi 2021 song et al 2021 to overcome the sparsity issue of ground based observations satellite based and model based precipitation products which could reveal the continuous spatio temporal variability of precipitation at the global scale are potentially suitable alternatives amjad et al 2020 taking advantages of the algorithmic and technological advances in the past few decades several global institutions and organizations have released satellite based and model based precipitation retrievals with a variety of spatio temporal resolutions and coverages for instance as a milestone of satellite based precipitation measurements the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm was launched in 1997 which integrated the constellation of available satellites and provided precipitation products with high quality for applications for about 20 years kummerow et al 1998 kummerow et al 2000 kidd and huffman 2011 as the natural successor of trmm the global precipitation measurement gpm was launched in 2014 and precipitation measurements from the trmm era were extended to the gpm era providing improved estimates of light and frozen precipitation and finer spatio temporal resolutions hou et al 2014 kirschbaum et al 2017 among the various satellite based precipitation products in the trmm and gpm eras the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg huffman et al 2019 and the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap kubota et al 2007 aonashi et al 2009 ushio et al 2009 mega et al 2019 are considered as two of the most popular precipitation products and have been widely used in various applications sunilkumar et al 2015 sharif et al 2017 ma et al 2019 ma et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 lu et al 2020 ehsani et al 2021b the recent versions of imerg v06b released in 2019 and gsmap v07 released in 2017 were selected in this study to represent satellite based precipitation products in addition to the satellite based method another alternative approach to obtaining global continuous precipitation estimates is using numerical weather models and data assimilation techniques to yield model based reanalysis data with the efforts of several weather centers and assimilation offices such as the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf nasa s global modeling and assimilation office gmao national centers for environment prediction and national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar and japanese meteorological agency jma many reanalysis products were released to the public in the past few decades for example era interim from ecmwf the second version of modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra 2 gelaro et al 2017 produced by gmao the second version of climate forecast system reanalysis cfsv2 from ncep saha et al 2014 ncep ncar global reanalysis products from ncep and ncar kalnay et al 1996 kistler et al 2001 and the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 from jma meanwhile the continuously improving developments of three dimensional variational 3d var and four dimensional variational 4d var techniques have also promoted the upgrading of reanalysis products the latest reanalysis dataset released to the public is the fifth generation of atmospheric reanalysis of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era5 which provides finer spatio temporal resolutions 0 25 1 hourly over global regions which are close to those of satellite based datasets than its predecessors era interim around 80 km 3 hourly and era 40 around 2 5 daily uppala et al 2005 dee et al 2011 hersbach et al 2020 in addition to using the 4d var assimilation method to ensure continuity in space and time era5 adopts the integrated forecasting system ifs cy41r2 so as to benefit the ten year period of ifs improvements in model processes core dynamics and data assimilation since era interim was released therefore the performance of era5 would be theoretically higher than that of era interim which agrees with the conclusions of recent studies beyramzade et al 2019 amjad et al 2020 chen et al 2021 meanwhile through a single simulation driven by near surface atmospheric fields from era5 with thermo dynamical orographic adjustment of temperature a downscaled land dataset named era5 land 0 1 1 hourly has also been produced the first batch of era5 land 1981 present was made available in july 2019 and the entire version of era5 land 1950 present is planned to be available for use in 2021 c3s 2019 mu√±oz sabater 2019 in general the data accuracies of some key variables e g precipitation radiation of model based products are considered to be poorer than that of satellite based retrievals seyyedi et al 2015 li et al 2018 ullah et al 2018 however the developments of era5 and era5 land can introduce uncertainties to the conclusion mentioned above for example tang et al 2021 found that the accuracy of downward longwave radiation dlr of era5 is higher than that of satellite based retrievals over land regions on the global scale thus it is necessary to comprehensively compare the performances of the other key variables obtained from satellite based and model based retrievals such as precipitation however the validation of era5 and era5 land precipitation products has rarely been performed and related studies generally have limitations for example amjad et al 2020 evaluated gpm imergv05 tmpa 3b42v7 era interim and era5 precipitation products at the daily scale against ground based gauge stations between 2014 and 2018 over turkey however the imergv05 and tmpa datasets have already been phased out tang et al 2020 compared gpm imerg with nine satellite based and model based precipitation datasets including era5 over mainland china although the hourly reference in the study was limited to summertime from 2013 to 2015 jiang et al 2020 validated era5 precipitation products at the daily scale over mainland china from 2003 to 2015 chen et al 2021 showed detailed evaluation of era interim era5 era5 land and the high asia refined analysis har precipitation datasets at the daily scale in nepal from 2001 to 2013 however jiang et al 2020 and chen et al 2021 did not perform inter comparisons between the performance of era5 and those of the state of the art satellite based precipitation products furthermore among the studies mentioned above the recently released era5 land precipitation product has rarely been evaluated and the hourly performances of era5 and era5 land in the past few years has not been investigated mainland china is an ideal region for evaluating the accuracy of precipitation products considering its large spatial coverage and diverse hydro geo climatological features accordingly this study aimed to comprehensively understand the error characteristics of the state of the art model based precipitation estimates i e era5 and era5 land as well as satellite based precipitation retrievals i e imerg final and gsmap gauge and determined their strengths and limitations on multiple temporal scales especially at the hourly scale over mainland china in recent years from 2016 to 2019 moreover the similarities and differences between era5 and era5 land were explored 2 study area data and methods 2 1 study area mainland china mc covering more than 9 million square kilometers 73 135 e longitude and 18 53 n latitude was selected as the study area mountains plateaus and hills in mc account for approximately 67 of the land area and basins and plains account for the other 33 the spatial distribution of the elevation of mc is shown in fig 1 a indicating that the altitudes range from close to zero in the southeast to higher than 5 000 m in the northwest combined with the broad span of latitudes and longitudes the highly variable topography of the study area contributes to significant differences in climatic conditions based primarily on the different characteristics of climate patterns mainland china could be divided into four subregions temperate continental climate tc plateau mountain climate pm temperate monsoon climate tm and subtropical and tropical monsoon climate st song et al 2011 depending on the location the annual mean precipitation in mc varies from 5 9 mm to more than 6000 mm most rain gauges are located in tm and st while rain gauges in tc and pm are in the minority 2 2 data 2 2 1 imerg final imerg is one of the representative mapped precipitation products released by nasa the imerg algorithm combines available microwave based and infrared based observations from gpm constellation and geostationary satellites to provide information on the microphysics and spatio temporal variations of precipitation over the entire globe comprehensively hou et al 2014 huffman et al 2019 huffman et al 2020 in this study imerg final run version 06b 0 1 half hourly hereafter imerg final was selected for evaluation being anchored by a global monthly gauge analysis from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc imerg final is a research quality gridded precipitation dataset and is available from https doi org 10 5067 gpm imerg 3b hh 06 in addition the imerg final precipitation dataset at the hourly scale is established by averaging the precipitation intensity from two corresponding datasets at the half hourly scale in a specific hour 2 2 2 gsmap gauge gsmap is developed by the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa which utilizes dual frequency precipitation radar dpr onboard the gpm core observatory passive microwave radiometers on gpm constellation satellites and infrared sensors on geostationary satellites to provide an hourly global precipitation distribution map with a high spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 kubota et al 2007 gsmap products comprise the standard product near real time product real time product and reanalysis product in this study we used the latest version 07 standard product of gauge adjusted gsmap hereafter gsmap gauge mega et al 2019 which has been calibrated by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center cpc unified gauge based analysis of global daily precipitation gsmap gauge can be obtained from the jaxa global watch website https sharaku eorc jaxa jp gsmap 2 2 3 era5 benefiting from improvements in model processes core dynamics and data assimilation era5 has a significantly higher data quality finer spatio temporal resolution 0 25 hourly and wider time coverage 1950 to present compared with its widely used predecessor era interim dee et al 2011 hersbach et al 2020 era5 provides data related to a large number of atmospheric land surface and sea state parameters the successful public release of era5 promotes its further applications in a variety of science communities the parameter of total precipitation in era5 which means the total amount of liquid and frozen water comprising rain and snow was used in this study era5 is now available online at https doi org 10 24381 cds adbb2d47 the era5 data used in this study has been resampled to 0 1 using bilinear interpolation to make it spatially consistent with the other products 2 2 4 era5 land the era5 land dataset 0 1 hourly 1950 to present is a replay of the land component of the era5 climate reanalysis providing a consistent view of the evolution of land parameters over the past few decades at an enhanced resolution compared to era5 c3s 2018 2019 hersbach et al 2020 the fine spatial temporal resolutions of era5 land make it very useful for kinds of applications to some extent the era5 land dataset could be the first hourly dataset for describing the water fluxes and energy balances at a spatial resolution of 0 1 on global land surface for more than 70 years which makes this dataset very useful for kinds of land surface applications the parameter of total precipitation of era5 land was used in this study and can be obtained through the website https doi org 10 24381 cds e2161bac detailed information of the satellite based and model based precipitation products used in this study has been provided in table 1 2 2 5 rain gauge data in this study the hourly rain gauge observations from approximately 2200 chinese national meteorological stations were collected from the national meteorological information center of china meteorological administration and are used for multiscale evaluation the spatial distribution of the rain gauge network over mainland china is shown in fig 1a the rain gauge precipitation datasets were tested with three levels of quality controls the extreme values check internal consistency check and spatial consistency check shen et al 2010 2014 the gauge observations were not directly used in data assimilation and bias correction procedure of the precipitation products assessed in this study rain gauge data at the hourly scale are available from http data cma cn meanwhile ground references at coarser temporal resolutions were calculated by accumulating hourly data in the specific periods 2 3 methods the values of gridded data were extracted for the corresponding rain gauges using a bilinear interpolation method to create pairs between rain gauge data and gridded data and perform grid to point evaluations the missing data in rain gauge observations and their corresponding values in gridded data were excluded from the evaluations additionally the inverse distance weighted idw method was used for interpolating gauge based annual mean precipitation to generate a spatial continuous map which facilitated clear comparison with other products era5 era5 land imerg final and gsmap gauge products were evaluated on multiple scales using various validation metrics including correlation coefficient cc relative bias bias root mean square error rmse modified kling gupta efficiency kge probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far critical success index csi heidke skill score hss multi source fusion index mfi precipitation event duration ed and mean event precipitation rate mepr the correlation coefficient is a statistical measure of the strength of the relationship between the relative movements of two variables cc generally reflects the strength of the relationship between estimated and observed datasets bias and rmse are common scores used to describe the deviation degree between estimated and observed datasets kge is a summary metric which is proposed by gupta et al 2009 and slightly modified by kling et al 2012 kge fully considers the indices of coefficient of correlation bias and variability term categorical metrics such as pod far csi and hss reflect the capability of precipitation products in capturing the occurrence of precipitation events ebert et al 2007 mfi is a summary metric which integrates the statistical metrics and categorical metrics ed and mepr present the duration and average precipitation rate of a specific precipitation event at the hourly scale respectively additionally rain no rain thresholds were set to 0 1 mm for hourly scale evaluation and 1 mm for daily scale evaluation tian et al 2009 tan et al 2016 tang et al 2016 zhu et al 2018 the equations value ranges and perfect values of the verification metrics mentioned above are listed in table 2 the spatial and numerical distributions of metrics were calculated at different temporal scales for example pairs of a specific rain gauge at the hourly scale during the entire study period are used to calculate the hourly metric values of the rain gauge and the temporal patterns of metrics were obtained using pairs from all rain gauges in the study area on different temporal scales 3 results 3 1 annual assessment the mean annual precipitation from 2016 to 2019 for rain gauge data spatial continuous rain gauge data based on the idw interpolation method and era5 era5 land imerg final and gsmap gauge data over mainland china are respectively presented in fig 2 a f the spatial patterns of precipitation amount over mainland china present a distinct decreasing variation from the southeast to the northwest and regions with large precipitation amounts greater than2000 mm year were mainly distributed in the southern parts fig 2b in general era5 and era5 land fig 2c and 2d share similar spatial patterns of precipitation amounts and their spatial coverage over the southern tibetan plateau where the mean annual precipitation amount is larger than 2000 mm accounting for 4 5 and 3 8 of the tibetan plateau respectively is larger than that of imerg final and gsmap gauge accounting for 1 1 and 1 0 of the tibetan plateau respectively additionally era5 and era5 land overestimate precipitation in the north of guangxi province greater than2000 mm year and the southeast of sichuan province greater than1500 mm year while they underestimate precipitation in hainan province 2000 mm year in contrast imerg final and gsmap gauge accurately capture the precipitation amount in hainan province model based precipitation datasets tend to overestimate precipitation at higher elevations against ground observations which is consistent with the conclusion of hu et al 2016 compared with rain gauge data imerg final fig 2e and gsmap gauge fig 2f overestimate precipitation in the junction area of jiangxi fujian anhui and zhejiang province unlike ground observations and the other three precipitation products gsmap gauge significantly overestimate precipitation over the south of xinjiang province greater than800 mm year a statistical summary of monthly metrics over mainland china and four subregions is shown in table 3 the values of the metrics were rounded to the nearest 3 decimal digits in general imerg final exhibited the highest performance which may be attributed to the combination of high quality gpcc monthly gauge analysis huffman et al 2020 it is worth noting that the gaps between satellite based products and model based products in tc and tm regions are significantly narrowed compared with those in pm and st regions indicating that model based precipitation products have potential use as alternative datasets over tc and tm regions at the monthly scale fig 3 shows the spatial patterns of cc rmse kge pod far and hss for different products at the daily scale from 2016 to 2019 over mainland china in terms of cc and rmse satellite based products generally outperform model based products and gsmap gauge show the highest performance among the four datasets which is probably attributable to the daily calibration process imerg final shows the finest patterns of kge although the number of high kge values greater than0 85 of imerg final is relatively lower than that of gsmap gauge in terms of pod imerg final shows the poorest performance with approximately 80 of rain gauges exhibiting pod lower than 0 8 indicating limited capability for capturing precipitation events in contrast gsmap gauge exhibited the highest performance among the four products except for southwestern regions where model based products perform the best however the high pod values of model based products are accompanied by high values of far resulting in an overall poor performance in terms of hss over southwestern regions mostly 0 5 overall and regional metric summaries at the daily scale are also displayed in table 4 the performance of imerg final suffers significant degradation at the daily resolution in contrast gsmap gauge generally shows the best performance in terms of all metrics the high kge values of imerg final might be related to the similarity of mean precipitation and the variation coefficient between imerg final and ground observations model based products generally show the highest pod and far values especially in pm and st this is anticipated because era5 and era5 land precipitation datasets tend to represent non zero due to the model characteristics hersbach et al 2020 3 2 hourly scale assessment 3 2 1 general performance the spatial patterns of the metrics performances for era5 era5 land imerg final and gsmap gauge at the hourly scale from 2016 to 2019 over mainland china are presented in fig 4 as expected the statistical metrics at hourly resolution are poorer than those at the daily resolution and the characteristics of spatial patterns in terms of most metrics are similar to those at the daily scale compared with other products in terms of the advantages of imerg final are more significant at the hourly scale than that at the daily scale with more than 50 of stations showing kge values larger than 0 3 in contrast the proportions of gsmap gauge era5 and era5 land with kge greater than 0 3 are 25 1 and 1 respectively as for pod the hourly differences between era5 and era5 land are especially prominent in eastern and coastal areas of mainland china this implies that the downscaling process during the production of era5 land weakened its capability in detecting precipitation events to a certain extent in terms of hss model based precipitation products show the best performance in the northeastern part of china compared with the patterns at daily resolution the improvement is significant indicating that model based products have more robust occurrence detection mechanisms than satellite based products at the hourly scale over high latitude regions overall values of statistical and categorical metrics for the four products over five regions at the hourly scale are presented in table 5 generally speaking model based products show poorer performance than satellite based products in terms of cc and rmse gsmap gauge still performs the best except for tc region imerg final shows the highest values of kge over mainland china 0 306 and four subregions 0 163 0 321 0 271 0 266 for pm st tc and tm respectively which is consistent with the results presented in fig 4 as for categorical metrics model based products show poorer performance than satellite based products in pm and st regions but the former significantly outperform the latter in tc and tm regions for example the hss value of era5 in tc is 0 477 showing 21 and 17 gains compared with values of imerg final and gsmap gauge respectively the advantages of model based products in detecting precipitation occurrence over these regions might present end users an alternative approach of the practical application of precipitation products the temporal patterns of era5 era5 land imerg final and gsmap gauge for specific months are demonstrated in fig 5 concerning cc the performance of era5 and era5 land degrades in wet seasons e g summer and improves in dry seasons e g winter on the contrary imerg final and gsmap gauge share a similar trend of poorer performance in dry seasons and higher performance in wet seasons and gsmap gauge generally outperform imerg final in terms of bias the four precipitation products show the highest and lowest performance in the wet seasons and dry seasons respectively additionally the bias values of gsmap gauge are lower than those of the other products as for rmse the four products show similar trends with lower performance in dry seasons and higher performance in wet seasons the temporal variations of pod and mfi values show that precipitation products have higher performance in wet seasons for instance the pod values of model based products are approximately 0 7 in summer and the mfi values of satellite based estimates are approximately 0 in summer regarding far imerg final generally shows the lowest performance in dry seasons and the highest performance in wet seasons with a trend opposite to that of other products the temporal variations of the performances of era5 era5 land imerg final and gsmap gauge at specific hours are shown in fig 6 according to the cc values the four precipitation products show higher performance during the period from 0 00 means 0 00 1 00 utc and similarly hereinafter to 3 00 and from 19 00 to 23 00 and gsmap gauge significantly outperforms the others regarding bias the performance of model based products was the poorest during the period from 3 00 to 10 00 with the maximum values reaching 93 and 98 at 6 00 respectively in addition the bias values of imerg final are significantly higher during the period from 5 00 to 17 00 than from 20 00 to 3 00 similar to the result presented in fig 6a gsmap gauge shows the highest performance in terms of bias and the performance is more stable than those of the others the rmse values of the four products are obviously higher during the period from 6 00 to 12 00 than during other periods of the day and the rmse of era5 and imerg final peaked at approximately 0 90 mm hour and 0 86 mm hour at 9 00 respectively regarding the variations of pod the performances of all the four precipitation products are relatively stable specifically as shown in fig 6e far of era5 and era5 land reaches the peak during the period from 3 00 to 8 00 and developed a valley from 18 00 to 0 00 regarding the variations of mfi the performance of era5 and era5 land declined during the period from 20 00 to 0 00 and improved from 3 00 to 10 00 imerg final also exhibits the similar temporal patterns 3 2 2 seasonal differences fig 7 shows the performance diagrams and taylor diagrams of era5 era5 land imerg final and gsmap gauge at the hourly scale from 2016 to 2019 for different seasons and subregions in the performance diagrams points closer to the top right represent stronger occurrence detectability we can conclude from the performance diagram the first row that imerg final exhibits notably poor performance in capturing precipitation events in winter over all regions similarly gsmap gauge also shows poorer performance than model based products in winter especially over tc tm and pm regions this may be attributed to the poor accuracy of satellite based products in estimating snowfall and light precipitation tang et al 2020 in winter the performances of era5 and era5 land are higher than those of the satellite based products while in summer the patterns are exactly the opposite in spring and autumn the performance ranking depends on the subregions for instance in st gsmap gauge shows the best performance followed by era5 era5 land and imerg final whereas in tc and tm era5 and era5 land show the best performances followed by gsmap gauge and imerg final in addition it is notable that all the products show the poorest performance over pm compared with the other regions in the taylor diagrams the points closer to the gauge data point reflect higher accuracy according to the taylor diagrams points of era5 and era5 land consistently overlapped indicating their similar performance in terms of inter class standard deviation root mean square difference rmsd and cc note that the inter class standard deviations of era5 and era5 land are smaller than those of satellite based products in all cases indicating that the model based products generally have relatively lower variability in spring and autumn era5 and era5 land outperform gsmap gauge and imerg final over tc tm and pm and gsmap gauge and imerg final outperform era5 and era5 land over mc and st in summer satellite based products outperform model based products except over tc in winter era5 and era5 land significantly outperform imerg final and gsmap gauge over mc and the four subregions in terms of cc and rmsd 3 2 3 performance regarding precipitation events fig 8 presents the spatial patterns of metrics of precipitation events for rain gauges era5 era5 land imerg final and gsmap gauge in mainland china at the hourly scale from 2016 to 2019 compared with the number of precipitation events measured by the rain gauges imerg final overestimates the number in northeast mainland china and underestimates it in southwest mainland china whereas gsmap gauge shows the opposite tendency era5 and era5 land exhibit similar tendencies with both significantly overestimating the number of events in southwest mainland china regarding ed imerg final agrees well with rain gauge data in contrast gsmap gauge and model based products generally overestimate the ed with gsmap gauge showing significant overestimation which should be further investigated to determine the underlying reasons in terms of mepr all the four precipitation products generally tend to overestimate among them imreg final shows the highest performance followed by gsmap gauge and model based products notably some anomalies in gsmap gauge data are observed over the west of mainland china which confirms with the result presented in fig 2f three subregions over st subregion a subregion b and subregion c which frequently experience extreme precipitation events were selected to evaluate the performances of the four precipitation products in different types of precipitation events the locations of the three subregions and the monthly regional average precipitation amount of rain gauges as well as the differences between the estimates from products and observations from rain gauges in the three subregions are presented in fig 9 in general the temporal variations of all the four precipitation products share a similar trend compared with satellite based precipitation products model based products generally show more dramatic deviations against rain gauge observations such as that in may 2019 over subregion a and january 2017 over subregion c additionally the overall precipitation amount in subregion a is larger than that in other regions during the period from may to november and relatively smaller than that of other regions from december to february three types of precipitation events namely typhoon i e tropical cyclone plum rains and cloudburst from 2016 to 2019 over subregion a subregion b and subregion c respectively are selected kge and hss are selected as the summary metrics to assess the performance of different precipitation products for each specific event table 6 the product corresponding to the best kge value varies for each typhoon event nevertheless satellite based products generally outperform model based products regarding plum rains and cloudburst events imerg final shows the highest performance among the four products except for plum rains from june 4 2016 to july 11 2016 during which a performance degradation of approximately 7 5 was observed compared with gsmap gauge as for the categorical metric apart from typhoon khanun from october 12 2017 to october 16 2017 and a cloudburst event around june 13 2017 imerg final still exhibits satisfactory and stable performance overall imerg final is the first choice for applications relevant to extreme precipitation events followed by gsmap gauge the performance of model based products remains unsatisfactory for extreme precipitation events over st 4 discussions 4 1 strengths and weaknesses of the precipitation products each of the model based and satellite based precipitation products has its own strengths and weaknesses across the study area in terms of data release latency spatio temporal resolutions spatio temporal coverage and data quality among the four datasets analyzed in this study imerg final exhibits the finest temporal resolution of 0 5 h and the other three datasets share the same temporal resolution of 1 h compared with the 0 25 spatial resolution of era5 imerg final gsmap gauge and era5 land have finer spatial resolutions of 0 1 in terms of spatial coverage imerg final and era5 precipitation products fully cover global regions 180 w 180 e 90 s 90 n note that imerg final has gaps over snow and ice surfaces gsmap gauge has a quasi global spatial coverage 180 w 180 e 60 s 60 n whereas the spatial coverage of era5 land is limited to the land regions with a considerable number of no data grids in coastal regions concerning the release latency of data era5 and gsmap gauge significantly outperform era5 land and imerg final the update frequency of era5 and gsmap gauge products is approximately 1 day and 3 days respectively in contrast era5 land and imerg final are released with latencies of approximately 3 months and 3 5 months respectively with relatively high update frequency era5 has the potential advantages for near real time hydro geo climatological applications adams iii and dymond 2019 xu et al 2019 shen et al 2021 additionally according to ecmwf the facility to deliver timely updates of era5 land is being implemented and it will be made available to the public shortly see the era5 land data document on the website https confluence ecmwf int display ckb era5 land 3a data documentation regarding temporal coverage the model based precipitation products exhibit significant superiority the time span of imerg final and gsmap gauge has been retrospected to 2000 is relatively short compared with that of model based products 1950 to present c3s 2018 2019 mu√±oz sabater 2019 hersbach et al 2020 the strengths and weaknesses apart from data quality which needs detailed explanation of the model based and satellite based precipitation products analyzed in this study are summarized in table 7 in addition to the strengths and weaknesses mentioned above according to the evaluation results of this study we summarized the applicability of satellite based and model based precipitation products in different scenarios in general satellite based precipitation products are currently more suitable for hydrological meteorological and climatological applications than model based products over mainland china especially over st and pm regions and for research on extreme precipitation events nevertheless model based products have significant advantages under some circumstances such as in winter or in research focusing on occurrence detectability at the sub daily resolution over high latitude areas e g tc and tm regions as for the specific recommendations of products if end users require precipitation datasets at the monthly and coarser temporal resolutions or intend to investigate extreme precipitation events imerg final may be the most suitable candidate for cases where precipitation datasets at the daily and sub daily scales are desired and requirements for data deviation are specified e g bias rmse gsmap gauge is recommended ear5 and era5 land have similar performance and end users can thus select an appropriate dataset depending on the strengths and weaknesses summarized in table 7 4 2 error characteristics and error source analysis of precipitation products according to the results demonstrated above we found that except for pod the performances of satellite based precipitation products are generally higher than those of model based precipitation datasets against rain gauge observations over mainland china however the performances of both types of precipitation products are not highly satisfactory at the hourly scale therefore further efforts are required to improve the accuracy of the precipitation products in practical applications nevertheless the gaps between the state of the art model based precipitation products and satellite based precipitation retrievals are relatively small at meteorological scales e g hourly scale and daily scale in some cases era5 and era5 land could be considered as alternatives for hydro meteorological applications in this study the precipitation products were evaluated against rain gauge observations the distribution of the considered gauge stations is denser in the eastern and southern parts of mainland china and sparser across the northern and western parts especially over the tibetan plateau therefore the spatial distribution of the rain gauges will affect the validation results to a certain extent shen et al 2014 maggioni et al 2017 the differences of spatial representativeness between rain gauge data and satellite based and model based precipitation products may also affect the error characteristics presented in the evaluation results tang et al 2018a for example the locations of grid center of imerg final and gsmap gauge differ from those of era5 and era5 land with a deviation of approximately 0 05 this difference may lead to deviations in the error characteristics furthermore rain gauges collect precipitation information at the point scale or for small regions whereas the grids of precipitation datasets generally cover an area of 0 1 0 1 0 25 0 25 such differences in spatial scales may introduce errors in the evaluation results one of the common sources of errors and uncertainties in imerg final and gsmap gauge precipitation products over mainland china is the a priori databases kubota et al 2007 huffman et al 2020 massari and maggioni 2020 lacking ground based radar observations over mainland china the a priori databases of cloud and precipitation profiles for retrieving passive microwave based satellite precipitation estimates are not sufficiently robust moreover as precipitation retrievals based on passive microwave pmw the main input of imerg final and gsmap gauge products the poor performance of satellite based products in winter and high latitude regions may be attributable to issues associated with pmw remote sensing adhikari et al 2020 ehsani et al 2021b for example challenges posed by cold surfaces e g snow ice surfaces can lead to false positives in the identification of precipitation events massari and maggioni 2020 additionally it should be noted that hourly imerg dataset is produced by averaging the precipitation intensity from two corresponding datasets at the half hourly scale in a specific hour which will also introduce error and uncertainty for model based products era5 and era5 land precipitation datasets generally exhibit non zero hersbach et al 2020 which may explain the significantly higher pod and far values of era5 and era5 land compared with imerg final and gsmap gauge era5 land shows similar error characteristics as era5 and the evaluation results show that era5 land slightly outperforms era5 in terms of the categorical metrics whereas era5 has better performance considering the statistical metrics this phenomenon may be attributable to the fact that era5 land is a downscaled dataset produced through a single simulation driven by near surface atmospheric fields from era5 with thermo dynamical orographic adjustment of temperature consequently with significant similarities between era5 and era5 land the downscaling processing may reduce the overestimates of era5 leading to higher performance in terms of statistical metrics and poorer performance in terms of categorical metrics a possible reason for imerg final and gsmap gauge outperforming era5 and era5 land is that these satellite based precipitation products have undergone a global land ground based calibration using global precipitation climatology centre gpcc precipitation products 1 0 monthly huffman et al 2020 and climate prediction center cpc unified gauge based analysis of global daily precipitation data 0 5 daily mega et al 2019 respectively whereas era5 and era5 land precipitation datasets only assimilate the ncep stage iv quantitative precipitation estimates in usa hersbach et al 2020 and have not been calibrated against gridded ground truth over mainland china additionally the different sources of ground based calibration datasets of imerg final and gsmap gauge may be the critical reason for the difference in accuracy between the two precipitation products 4 3 future improvements despite these comprehensive results presented in this study there is abundant room for further progress in introducing more precipitation estimates with various development and calibration methods for determining and comparing their characteristics and differences for example the different products of imerg and gsmap could be taken into account including imerg early latency of 4 h imerg late latency of 14 h gsmap now latency of 0 h and gsmap mvk latency of 3 days apart from era5 and era5 land other model based precipitation datasets could also be considered in future studies such as jra 55 and merra 2 in this study era5 hourly data on single levels from 2016 to 2019 was used era5 also provides hourly data on pressure levels available online https doi org 10 24381 cds bd0915c6 to draw a complete picture of the performances of era5 additional studies are needed to explore the performance of the variables on pressure levels against the vertical profile observations from weather balloons or radars the spatial coverage of this study is confined to mainland china in further studies global ground based observations such as the integrated surface database isd could be used for long term nearly 120 years global coverage evaluations at the sub daily temporal scale furthermore the performances of satellite based and model based precipitation products could also be evaluated through indirect hydrological modeling based inferencing with the focus on hydrological implications as well as operational flood modeling li et al 2015 belabid et al 2019 although this study reveals that imerg final and gsmap gauge outperform era5 and era5 land the unsatisfactory performances of imerg final and gsmap gauge at the hourly scale still deserve wide attention several studies have already developed several algorithms and methods for instance downscaling error correction and retrospective analyses and applied them to produce precipitation products with finer spatio temporal resolutions higher accuracy and wider time coverage ma et al 2017a b 2018 xie and xiong 2011 tang et al 2018b however the quality improvement studies for the state of the art reanalysis precipitation datasets e g era5 and era5 land have rarely been considered therefore reanalysis precipitation datasets have high potential for further improvement 5 conclusions model based and satellite based precipitation products with high quality and fine spatio temporal resolutions have become two primary underpinnings for large scale applications in hydro geo climatological studies against the backdrop of the growth of model based precipitation products over the past few decades the significance of evaluating the substitutability between model based and satellite based precipitation products is continuously increasing this study evaluated four model based era5 and era5 land and satellite based imerg final and gsmap gauge precipitation products which are recently released to the public against rain gauge data over mainland china at multiple time scales from 2016 to 2019 the main conclusions include but are not limited to the following 1 model based and satellite based precipitation products show similar spatial distributions of annual mean precipitation with a general increasing trend from the northwest to the southeast over mainland china 2 on the whole satellite based precipitation products outperform model based products nevertheless under some circumstances for example in high latitude regions e g subregions of tc and tm as well as during the winter period model based precipitation products outperform satellite based products 3 among all products imerg final shows the highest performance at the monthly resolution but its performance declined at the daily resolution for which gsmap gauge shows the highest performance 4 era5 and era5 land exhibit similar spatial temporal and numerical patterns era5 slightly outperforms era5 land in terms of the statistical metrics whereas era5 shows higher performance considering the categorical metrics the performance differences may be attributable by the downscaling process of era5 land 5 satellite based products show the highest performance over st whereas model based products show highest performance over tm and tc however all the products lead to large uncertainties over pm 6 in terms of event duration and mean event precipitation rate imerg final shows the highest performance in contrast gsmap gauge significantly overestimates the duration of precipitation events and era5 and era5 land significantly underestimate the mean rate of the precipitation events these findings may facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the error characteristics of the newly released era5 era5 land imerg final and gsmap gauge precipitation products as well as the similarities and differences between them over mainland china moreover we hope that the comprehensive analysis of the state of the art model based and satellite based precipitation products could be useful to guide practical application and

3760,accurate precipitation retrievals with fine spatio temporal resolutions are critical in global and regional analyses as an important alternative of satellite based precipitation products model based precipitation estimates have undergone rapid development over the past few decades with the recent public release of the fifth generation of atmospheric reanalysis by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts era5 and era5 land it is necessary to verify whether these two latest model based precipitation products outperform satellite based precipitation products this study comprehensively evaluates the performances of state of the art satellite based and model based precipitation products including the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap era5 and era5 land over mainland china from 2016 to 2019 the main findings are as follows 1 satellite based products generally outperform model based products but the latter significantly perform better than the former over high latitude regions and in winter 2 era5 and era5 land share similar spatio temporal patterns and have their own advantages in terms of different types of metrics 3 satellite based products perform best over subregions of subtropical and tropical monsoon climate st whereas model based products show highest performance over subregions of temperate monsoon climate tm and temperate continental climate tc both types of products show the poorest performance over subregions of plateau mountain climate pm 4 imerg final performs best in terms of precipitation events while gsmap gauge tends to overestimate the duration of precipitation events and model based products tend to underestimate the mean precipitation rate of the events these findings provide valuable insights into the error characteristics of state of the art model based and satellite based precipitation products in the recent years and will also serve as useful reference for the potential improvement of precipitation retrieval algorithms in the next generation 1 introduction precipitation is one of the most fundamental components of the global water cycle and plays an important role in matter and energy exchanges roca et al 2010 skofronick jackson et al 2017 arabzadeh et al 2020 xu et al 2021 as precipitation patterns are highly variable in both space and time accurate measurement of precipitation has become a repeated theme among hydrological meteorological and climatological communities over the past few decades kidd et al 2017 networks of conventional ground based instruments designed to estimate precipitation for instance rain gauges disdrometers and weather radars are unevenly distributed especially in oceans and in some meteorologically important land regions e g the tibetan plateau yao et al 2012 ma et al 2017a ma et al 2017b moreover ground based instruments usually have various shortcomings for example rain gauges often have undercatch issues due to deformation of the wind field wetting losses evaporation sublimation splashing etc ehsani and behrangi 2021 song et al 2021 to overcome the sparsity issue of ground based observations satellite based and model based precipitation products which could reveal the continuous spatio temporal variability of precipitation at the global scale are potentially suitable alternatives amjad et al 2020 taking advantages of the algorithmic and technological advances in the past few decades several global institutions and organizations have released satellite based and model based precipitation retrievals with a variety of spatio temporal resolutions and coverages for instance as a milestone of satellite based precipitation measurements the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm was launched in 1997 which integrated the constellation of available satellites and provided precipitation products with high quality for applications for about 20 years kummerow et al 1998 kummerow et al 2000 kidd and huffman 2011 as the natural successor of trmm the global precipitation measurement gpm was launched in 2014 and precipitation measurements from the trmm era were extended to the gpm era providing improved estimates of light and frozen precipitation and finer spatio temporal resolutions hou et al 2014 kirschbaum et al 2017 among the various satellite based precipitation products in the trmm and gpm eras the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg huffman et al 2019 and the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap kubota et al 2007 aonashi et al 2009 ushio et al 2009 mega et al 2019 are considered as two of the most popular precipitation products and have been widely used in various applications sunilkumar et al 2015 sharif et al 2017 ma et al 2019 ma et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 lu et al 2020 ehsani et al 2021b the recent versions of imerg v06b released in 2019 and gsmap v07 released in 2017 were selected in this study to represent satellite based precipitation products in addition to the satellite based method another alternative approach to obtaining global continuous precipitation estimates is using numerical weather models and data assimilation techniques to yield model based reanalysis data with the efforts of several weather centers and assimilation offices such as the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf nasa s global modeling and assimilation office gmao national centers for environment prediction and national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar and japanese meteorological agency jma many reanalysis products were released to the public in the past few decades for example era interim from ecmwf the second version of modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra 2 gelaro et al 2017 produced by gmao the second version of climate forecast system reanalysis cfsv2 from ncep saha et al 2014 ncep ncar global reanalysis products from ncep and ncar kalnay et al 1996 kistler et al 2001 and the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 from jma meanwhile the continuously improving developments of three dimensional variational 3d var and four dimensional variational 4d var techniques have also promoted the upgrading of reanalysis products the latest reanalysis dataset released to the public is the fifth generation of atmospheric reanalysis of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era5 which provides finer spatio temporal resolutions 0 25 1 hourly over global regions which are close to those of satellite based datasets than its predecessors era interim around 80 km 3 hourly and era 40 around 2 5 daily uppala et al 2005 dee et al 2011 hersbach et al 2020 in addition to using the 4d var assimilation method to ensure continuity in space and time era5 adopts the integrated forecasting system ifs cy41r2 so as to benefit the ten year period of ifs improvements in model processes core dynamics and data assimilation since era interim was released therefore the performance of era5 would be theoretically higher than that of era interim which agrees with the conclusions of recent studies beyramzade et al 2019 amjad et al 2020 chen et al 2021 meanwhile through a single simulation driven by near surface atmospheric fields from era5 with thermo dynamical orographic adjustment of temperature a downscaled land dataset named era5 land 0 1 1 hourly has also been produced the first batch of era5 land 1981 present was made available in july 2019 and the entire version of era5 land 1950 present is planned to be available for use in 2021 c3s 2019 mu√±oz sabater 2019 in general the data accuracies of some key variables e g precipitation radiation of model based products are considered to be poorer than that of satellite based retrievals seyyedi et al 2015 li et al 2018 ullah et al 2018 however the developments of era5 and era5 land can introduce uncertainties to the conclusion mentioned above for example tang et al 2021 found that the accuracy of downward longwave radiation dlr of era5 is higher than that of satellite based retrievals over land regions on the global scale thus it is necessary to comprehensively compare the performances of the other key variables obtained from satellite based and model based retrievals such as precipitation however the validation of era5 and era5 land precipitation products has rarely been performed and related studies generally have limitations for example amjad et al 2020 evaluated gpm imergv05 tmpa 3b42v7 era interim and era5 precipitation products at the daily scale against ground based gauge stations between 2014 and 2018 over turkey however the imergv05 and tmpa datasets have already been phased out tang et al 2020 compared gpm imerg with nine satellite based and model based precipitation datasets including era5 over mainland china although the hourly reference in the study was limited to summertime from 2013 to 2015 jiang et al 2020 validated era5 precipitation products at the daily scale over mainland china from 2003 to 2015 chen et al 2021 showed detailed evaluation of era interim era5 era5 land and the high asia refined analysis har precipitation datasets at the daily scale in nepal from 2001 to 2013 however jiang et al 2020 and chen et al 2021 did not perform inter comparisons between the performance of era5 and those of the state of the art satellite based precipitation products furthermore among the studies mentioned above the recently released era5 land precipitation product has rarely been evaluated and the hourly performances of era5 and era5 land in the past few years has not been investigated mainland china is an ideal region for evaluating the accuracy of precipitation products considering its large spatial coverage and diverse hydro geo climatological features accordingly this study aimed to comprehensively understand the error characteristics of the state of the art model based precipitation estimates i e era5 and era5 land as well as satellite based precipitation retrievals i e imerg final and gsmap gauge and determined their strengths and limitations on multiple temporal scales especially at the hourly scale over mainland china in recent years from 2016 to 2019 moreover the similarities and differences between era5 and era5 land were explored 2 study area data and methods 2 1 study area mainland china mc covering more than 9 million square kilometers 73 135 e longitude and 18 53 n latitude was selected as the study area mountains plateaus and hills in mc account for approximately 67 of the land area and basins and plains account for the other 33 the spatial distribution of the elevation of mc is shown in fig 1 a indicating that the altitudes range from close to zero in the southeast to higher than 5 000 m in the northwest combined with the broad span of latitudes and longitudes the highly variable topography of the study area contributes to significant differences in climatic conditions based primarily on the different characteristics of climate patterns mainland china could be divided into four subregions temperate continental climate tc plateau mountain climate pm temperate monsoon climate tm and subtropical and tropical monsoon climate st song et al 2011 depending on the location the annual mean precipitation in mc varies from 5 9 mm to more than 6000 mm most rain gauges are located in tm and st while rain gauges in tc and pm are in the minority 2 2 data 2 2 1 imerg final imerg is one of the representative mapped precipitation products released by nasa the imerg algorithm combines available microwave based and infrared based observations from gpm constellation and geostationary satellites to provide information on the microphysics and spatio temporal variations of precipitation over the entire globe comprehensively hou et al 2014 huffman et al 2019 huffman et al 2020 in this study imerg final run version 06b 0 1 half hourly hereafter imerg final was selected for evaluation being anchored by a global monthly gauge analysis from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc imerg final is a research quality gridded precipitation dataset and is available from https doi org 10 5067 gpm imerg 3b hh 06 in addition the imerg final precipitation dataset at the hourly scale is established by averaging the precipitation intensity from two corresponding datasets at the half hourly scale in a specific hour 2 2 2 gsmap gauge gsmap is developed by the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa which utilizes dual frequency precipitation radar dpr onboard the gpm core observatory passive microwave radiometers on gpm constellation satellites and infrared sensors on geostationary satellites to provide an hourly global precipitation distribution map with a high spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 kubota et al 2007 gsmap products comprise the standard product near real time product real time product and reanalysis product in this study we used the latest version 07 standard product of gauge adjusted gsmap hereafter gsmap gauge mega et al 2019 which has been calibrated by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center cpc unified gauge based analysis of global daily precipitation gsmap gauge can be obtained from the jaxa global watch website https sharaku eorc jaxa jp gsmap 2 2 3 era5 benefiting from improvements in model processes core dynamics and data assimilation era5 has a significantly higher data quality finer spatio temporal resolution 0 25 hourly and wider time coverage 1950 to present compared with its widely used predecessor era interim dee et al 2011 hersbach et al 2020 era5 provides data related to a large number of atmospheric land surface and sea state parameters the successful public release of era5 promotes its further applications in a variety of science communities the parameter of total precipitation in era5 which means the total amount of liquid and frozen water comprising rain and snow was used in this study era5 is now available online at https doi org 10 24381 cds adbb2d47 the era5 data used in this study has been resampled to 0 1 using bilinear interpolation to make it spatially consistent with the other products 2 2 4 era5 land the era5 land dataset 0 1 hourly 1950 to present is a replay of the land component of the era5 climate reanalysis providing a consistent view of the evolution of land parameters over the past few decades at an enhanced resolution compared to era5 c3s 2018 2019 hersbach et al 2020 the fine spatial temporal resolutions of era5 land make it very useful for kinds of applications to some extent the era5 land dataset could be the first hourly dataset for describing the water fluxes and energy balances at a spatial resolution of 0 1 on global land surface for more than 70 years which makes this dataset very useful for kinds of land surface applications the parameter of total precipitation of era5 land was used in this study and can be obtained through the website https doi org 10 24381 cds e2161bac detailed information of the satellite based and model based precipitation products used in this study has been provided in table 1 2 2 5 rain gauge data in this study the hourly rain gauge observations from approximately 2200 chinese national meteorological stations were collected from the national meteorological information center of china meteorological administration and are used for multiscale evaluation the spatial distribution of the rain gauge network over mainland china is shown in fig 1a the rain gauge precipitation datasets were tested with three levels of quality controls the extreme values check internal consistency check and spatial consistency check shen et al 2010 2014 the gauge observations were not directly used in data assimilation and bias correction procedure of the precipitation products assessed in this study rain gauge data at the hourly scale are available from http data cma cn meanwhile ground references at coarser temporal resolutions were calculated by accumulating hourly data in the specific periods 2 3 methods the values of gridded data were extracted for the corresponding rain gauges using a bilinear interpolation method to create pairs between rain gauge data and gridded data and perform grid to point evaluations the missing data in rain gauge observations and their corresponding values in gridded data were excluded from the evaluations additionally the inverse distance weighted idw method was used for interpolating gauge based annual mean precipitation to generate a spatial continuous map which facilitated clear comparison with other products era5 era5 land imerg final and gsmap gauge products were evaluated on multiple scales using various validation metrics including correlation coefficient cc relative bias bias root mean square error rmse modified kling gupta efficiency kge probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far critical success index csi heidke skill score hss multi source fusion index mfi precipitation event duration ed and mean event precipitation rate mepr the correlation coefficient is a statistical measure of the strength of the relationship between the relative movements of two variables cc generally reflects the strength of the relationship between estimated and observed datasets bias and rmse are common scores used to describe the deviation degree between estimated and observed datasets kge is a summary metric which is proposed by gupta et al 2009 and slightly modified by kling et al 2012 kge fully considers the indices of coefficient of correlation bias and variability term categorical metrics such as pod far csi and hss reflect the capability of precipitation products in capturing the occurrence of precipitation events ebert et al 2007 mfi is a summary metric which integrates the statistical metrics and categorical metrics ed and mepr present the duration and average precipitation rate of a specific precipitation event at the hourly scale respectively additionally rain no rain thresholds were set to 0 1 mm for hourly scale evaluation and 1 mm for daily scale evaluation tian et al 2009 tan et al 2016 tang et al 2016 zhu et al 2018 the equations value ranges and perfect values of the verification metrics mentioned above are listed in table 2 the spatial and numerical distributions of metrics were calculated at different temporal scales for example pairs of a specific rain gauge at the hourly scale during the entire study period are used to calculate the hourly metric values of the rain gauge and the temporal patterns of metrics were obtained using pairs from all rain gauges in the study area on different temporal scales 3 results 3 1 annual assessment the mean annual precipitation from 2016 to 2019 for rain gauge data spatial continuous rain gauge data based on the idw interpolation method and era5 era5 land imerg final and gsmap gauge data over mainland china are respectively presented in fig 2 a f the spatial patterns of precipitation amount over mainland china present a distinct decreasing variation from the southeast to the northwest and regions with large precipitation amounts greater than2000 mm year were mainly distributed in the southern parts fig 2b in general era5 and era5 land fig 2c and 2d share similar spatial patterns of precipitation amounts and their spatial coverage over the southern tibetan plateau where the mean annual precipitation amount is larger than 2000 mm accounting for 4 5 and 3 8 of the tibetan plateau respectively is larger than that of imerg final and gsmap gauge accounting for 1 1 and 1 0 of the tibetan plateau respectively additionally era5 and era5 land overestimate precipitation in the north of guangxi province greater than2000 mm year and the southeast of sichuan province greater than1500 mm year while they underestimate precipitation in hainan province 2000 mm year in contrast imerg final and gsmap gauge accurately capture the precipitation amount in hainan province model based precipitation datasets tend to overestimate precipitation at higher elevations against ground observations which is consistent with the conclusion of hu et al 2016 compared with rain gauge data imerg final fig 2e and gsmap gauge fig 2f overestimate precipitation in the junction area of jiangxi fujian anhui and zhejiang province unlike ground observations and the other three precipitation products gsmap gauge significantly overestimate precipitation over the south of xinjiang province greater than800 mm year a statistical summary of monthly metrics over mainland china and four subregions is shown in table 3 the values of the metrics were rounded to the nearest 3 decimal digits in general imerg final exhibited the highest performance which may be attributed to the combination of high quality gpcc monthly gauge analysis huffman et al 2020 it is worth noting that the gaps between satellite based products and model based products in tc and tm regions are significantly narrowed compared with those in pm and st regions indicating that model based precipitation products have potential use as alternative datasets over tc and tm regions at the monthly scale fig 3 shows the spatial patterns of cc rmse kge pod far and hss for different products at the daily scale from 2016 to 2019 over mainland china in terms of cc and rmse satellite based products generally outperform model based products and gsmap gauge show the highest performance among the four datasets which is probably attributable to the daily calibration process imerg final shows the finest patterns of kge although the number of high kge values greater than0 85 of imerg final is relatively lower than that of gsmap gauge in terms of pod imerg final shows the poorest performance with approximately 80 of rain gauges exhibiting pod lower than 0 8 indicating limited capability for capturing precipitation events in contrast gsmap gauge exhibited the highest performance among the four products except for southwestern regions where model based products perform the best however the high pod values of model based products are accompanied by high values of far resulting in an overall poor performance in terms of hss over southwestern regions mostly 0 5 overall and regional metric summaries at the daily scale are also displayed in table 4 the performance of imerg final suffers significant degradation at the daily resolution in contrast gsmap gauge generally shows the best performance in terms of all metrics the high kge values of imerg final might be related to the similarity of mean precipitation and the variation coefficient between imerg final and ground observations model based products generally show the highest pod and far values especially in pm and st this is anticipated because era5 and era5 land precipitation datasets tend to represent non zero due to the model characteristics hersbach et al 2020 3 2 hourly scale assessment 3 2 1 general performance the spatial patterns of the metrics performances for era5 era5 land imerg final and gsmap gauge at the hourly scale from 2016 to 2019 over mainland china are presented in fig 4 as expected the statistical metrics at hourly resolution are poorer than those at the daily resolution and the characteristics of spatial patterns in terms of most metrics are similar to those at the daily scale compared with other products in terms of the advantages of imerg final are more significant at the hourly scale than that at the daily scale with more than 50 of stations showing kge values larger than 0 3 in contrast the proportions of gsmap gauge era5 and era5 land with kge greater than 0 3 are 25 1 and 1 respectively as for pod the hourly differences between era5 and era5 land are especially prominent in eastern and coastal areas of mainland china this implies that the downscaling process during the production of era5 land weakened its capability in detecting precipitation events to a certain extent in terms of hss model based precipitation products show the best performance in the northeastern part of china compared with the patterns at daily resolution the improvement is significant indicating that model based products have more robust occurrence detection mechanisms than satellite based products at the hourly scale over high latitude regions overall values of statistical and categorical metrics for the four products over five regions at the hourly scale are presented in table 5 generally speaking model based products show poorer performance than satellite based products in terms of cc and rmse gsmap gauge still performs the best except for tc region imerg final shows the highest values of kge over mainland china 0 306 and four subregions 0 163 0 321 0 271 0 266 for pm st tc and tm respectively which is consistent with the results presented in fig 4 as for categorical metrics model based products show poorer performance than satellite based products in pm and st regions but the former significantly outperform the latter in tc and tm regions for example the hss value of era5 in tc is 0 477 showing 21 and 17 gains compared with values of imerg final and gsmap gauge respectively the advantages of model based products in detecting precipitation occurrence over these regions might present end users an alternative approach of the practical application of precipitation products the temporal patterns of era5 era5 land imerg final and gsmap gauge for specific months are demonstrated in fig 5 concerning cc the performance of era5 and era5 land degrades in wet seasons e g summer and improves in dry seasons e g winter on the contrary imerg final and gsmap gauge share a similar trend of poorer performance in dry seasons and higher performance in wet seasons and gsmap gauge generally outperform imerg final in terms of bias the four precipitation products show the highest and lowest performance in the wet seasons and dry seasons respectively additionally the bias values of gsmap gauge are lower than those of the other products as for rmse the four products show similar trends with lower performance in dry seasons and higher performance in wet seasons the temporal variations of pod and mfi values show that precipitation products have higher performance in wet seasons for instance the pod values of model based products are approximately 0 7 in summer and the mfi values of satellite based estimates are approximately 0 in summer regarding far imerg final generally shows the lowest performance in dry seasons and the highest performance in wet seasons with a trend opposite to that of other products the temporal variations of the performances of era5 era5 land imerg final and gsmap gauge at specific hours are shown in fig 6 according to the cc values the four precipitation products show higher performance during the period from 0 00 means 0 00 1 00 utc and similarly hereinafter to 3 00 and from 19 00 to 23 00 and gsmap gauge significantly outperforms the others regarding bias the performance of model based products was the poorest during the period from 3 00 to 10 00 with the maximum values reaching 93 and 98 at 6 00 respectively in addition the bias values of imerg final are significantly higher during the period from 5 00 to 17 00 than from 20 00 to 3 00 similar to the result presented in fig 6a gsmap gauge shows the highest performance in terms of bias and the performance is more stable than those of the others the rmse values of the four products are obviously higher during the period from 6 00 to 12 00 than during other periods of the day and the rmse of era5 and imerg final peaked at approximately 0 90 mm hour and 0 86 mm hour at 9 00 respectively regarding the variations of pod the performances of all the four precipitation products are relatively stable specifically as shown in fig 6e far of era5 and era5 land reaches the peak during the period from 3 00 to 8 00 and developed a valley from 18 00 to 0 00 regarding the variations of mfi the performance of era5 and era5 land declined during the period from 20 00 to 0 00 and improved from 3 00 to 10 00 imerg final also exhibits the similar temporal patterns 3 2 2 seasonal differences fig 7 shows the performance diagrams and taylor diagrams of era5 era5 land imerg final and gsmap gauge at the hourly scale from 2016 to 2019 for different seasons and subregions in the performance diagrams points closer to the top right represent stronger occurrence detectability we can conclude from the performance diagram the first row that imerg final exhibits notably poor performance in capturing precipitation events in winter over all regions similarly gsmap gauge also shows poorer performance than model based products in winter especially over tc tm and pm regions this may be attributed to the poor accuracy of satellite based products in estimating snowfall and light precipitation tang et al 2020 in winter the performances of era5 and era5 land are higher than those of the satellite based products while in summer the patterns are exactly the opposite in spring and autumn the performance ranking depends on the subregions for instance in st gsmap gauge shows the best performance followed by era5 era5 land and imerg final whereas in tc and tm era5 and era5 land show the best performances followed by gsmap gauge and imerg final in addition it is notable that all the products show the poorest performance over pm compared with the other regions in the taylor diagrams the points closer to the gauge data point reflect higher accuracy according to the taylor diagrams points of era5 and era5 land consistently overlapped indicating their similar performance in terms of inter class standard deviation root mean square difference rmsd and cc note that the inter class standard deviations of era5 and era5 land are smaller than those of satellite based products in all cases indicating that the model based products generally have relatively lower variability in spring and autumn era5 and era5 land outperform gsmap gauge and imerg final over tc tm and pm and gsmap gauge and imerg final outperform era5 and era5 land over mc and st in summer satellite based products outperform model based products except over tc in winter era5 and era5 land significantly outperform imerg final and gsmap gauge over mc and the four subregions in terms of cc and rmsd 3 2 3 performance regarding precipitation events fig 8 presents the spatial patterns of metrics of precipitation events for rain gauges era5 era5 land imerg final and gsmap gauge in mainland china at the hourly scale from 2016 to 2019 compared with the number of precipitation events measured by the rain gauges imerg final overestimates the number in northeast mainland china and underestimates it in southwest mainland china whereas gsmap gauge shows the opposite tendency era5 and era5 land exhibit similar tendencies with both significantly overestimating the number of events in southwest mainland china regarding ed imerg final agrees well with rain gauge data in contrast gsmap gauge and model based products generally overestimate the ed with gsmap gauge showing significant overestimation which should be further investigated to determine the underlying reasons in terms of mepr all the four precipitation products generally tend to overestimate among them imreg final shows the highest performance followed by gsmap gauge and model based products notably some anomalies in gsmap gauge data are observed over the west of mainland china which confirms with the result presented in fig 2f three subregions over st subregion a subregion b and subregion c which frequently experience extreme precipitation events were selected to evaluate the performances of the four precipitation products in different types of precipitation events the locations of the three subregions and the monthly regional average precipitation amount of rain gauges as well as the differences between the estimates from products and observations from rain gauges in the three subregions are presented in fig 9 in general the temporal variations of all the four precipitation products share a similar trend compared with satellite based precipitation products model based products generally show more dramatic deviations against rain gauge observations such as that in may 2019 over subregion a and january 2017 over subregion c additionally the overall precipitation amount in subregion a is larger than that in other regions during the period from may to november and relatively smaller than that of other regions from december to february three types of precipitation events namely typhoon i e tropical cyclone plum rains and cloudburst from 2016 to 2019 over subregion a subregion b and subregion c respectively are selected kge and hss are selected as the summary metrics to assess the performance of different precipitation products for each specific event table 6 the product corresponding to the best kge value varies for each typhoon event nevertheless satellite based products generally outperform model based products regarding plum rains and cloudburst events imerg final shows the highest performance among the four products except for plum rains from june 4 2016 to july 11 2016 during which a performance degradation of approximately 7 5 was observed compared with gsmap gauge as for the categorical metric apart from typhoon khanun from october 12 2017 to october 16 2017 and a cloudburst event around june 13 2017 imerg final still exhibits satisfactory and stable performance overall imerg final is the first choice for applications relevant to extreme precipitation events followed by gsmap gauge the performance of model based products remains unsatisfactory for extreme precipitation events over st 4 discussions 4 1 strengths and weaknesses of the precipitation products each of the model based and satellite based precipitation products has its own strengths and weaknesses across the study area in terms of data release latency spatio temporal resolutions spatio temporal coverage and data quality among the four datasets analyzed in this study imerg final exhibits the finest temporal resolution of 0 5 h and the other three datasets share the same temporal resolution of 1 h compared with the 0 25 spatial resolution of era5 imerg final gsmap gauge and era5 land have finer spatial resolutions of 0 1 in terms of spatial coverage imerg final and era5 precipitation products fully cover global regions 180 w 180 e 90 s 90 n note that imerg final has gaps over snow and ice surfaces gsmap gauge has a quasi global spatial coverage 180 w 180 e 60 s 60 n whereas the spatial coverage of era5 land is limited to the land regions with a considerable number of no data grids in coastal regions concerning the release latency of data era5 and gsmap gauge significantly outperform era5 land and imerg final the update frequency of era5 and gsmap gauge products is approximately 1 day and 3 days respectively in contrast era5 land and imerg final are released with latencies of approximately 3 months and 3 5 months respectively with relatively high update frequency era5 has the potential advantages for near real time hydro geo climatological applications adams iii and dymond 2019 xu et al 2019 shen et al 2021 additionally according to ecmwf the facility to deliver timely updates of era5 land is being implemented and it will be made available to the public shortly see the era5 land data document on the website https confluence ecmwf int display ckb era5 land 3a data documentation regarding temporal coverage the model based precipitation products exhibit significant superiority the time span of imerg final and gsmap gauge has been retrospected to 2000 is relatively short compared with that of model based products 1950 to present c3s 2018 2019 mu√±oz sabater 2019 hersbach et al 2020 the strengths and weaknesses apart from data quality which needs detailed explanation of the model based and satellite based precipitation products analyzed in this study are summarized in table 7 in addition to the strengths and weaknesses mentioned above according to the evaluation results of this study we summarized the applicability of satellite based and model based precipitation products in different scenarios in general satellite based precipitation products are currently more suitable for hydrological meteorological and climatological applications than model based products over mainland china especially over st and pm regions and for research on extreme precipitation events nevertheless model based products have significant advantages under some circumstances such as in winter or in research focusing on occurrence detectability at the sub daily resolution over high latitude areas e g tc and tm regions as for the specific recommendations of products if end users require precipitation datasets at the monthly and coarser temporal resolutions or intend to investigate extreme precipitation events imerg final may be the most suitable candidate for cases where precipitation datasets at the daily and sub daily scales are desired and requirements for data deviation are specified e g bias rmse gsmap gauge is recommended ear5 and era5 land have similar performance and end users can thus select an appropriate dataset depending on the strengths and weaknesses summarized in table 7 4 2 error characteristics and error source analysis of precipitation products according to the results demonstrated above we found that except for pod the performances of satellite based precipitation products are generally higher than those of model based precipitation datasets against rain gauge observations over mainland china however the performances of both types of precipitation products are not highly satisfactory at the hourly scale therefore further efforts are required to improve the accuracy of the precipitation products in practical applications nevertheless the gaps between the state of the art model based precipitation products and satellite based precipitation retrievals are relatively small at meteorological scales e g hourly scale and daily scale in some cases era5 and era5 land could be considered as alternatives for hydro meteorological applications in this study the precipitation products were evaluated against rain gauge observations the distribution of the considered gauge stations is denser in the eastern and southern parts of mainland china and sparser across the northern and western parts especially over the tibetan plateau therefore the spatial distribution of the rain gauges will affect the validation results to a certain extent shen et al 2014 maggioni et al 2017 the differences of spatial representativeness between rain gauge data and satellite based and model based precipitation products may also affect the error characteristics presented in the evaluation results tang et al 2018a for example the locations of grid center of imerg final and gsmap gauge differ from those of era5 and era5 land with a deviation of approximately 0 05 this difference may lead to deviations in the error characteristics furthermore rain gauges collect precipitation information at the point scale or for small regions whereas the grids of precipitation datasets generally cover an area of 0 1 0 1 0 25 0 25 such differences in spatial scales may introduce errors in the evaluation results one of the common sources of errors and uncertainties in imerg final and gsmap gauge precipitation products over mainland china is the a priori databases kubota et al 2007 huffman et al 2020 massari and maggioni 2020 lacking ground based radar observations over mainland china the a priori databases of cloud and precipitation profiles for retrieving passive microwave based satellite precipitation estimates are not sufficiently robust moreover as precipitation retrievals based on passive microwave pmw the main input of imerg final and gsmap gauge products the poor performance of satellite based products in winter and high latitude regions may be attributable to issues associated with pmw remote sensing adhikari et al 2020 ehsani et al 2021b for example challenges posed by cold surfaces e g snow ice surfaces can lead to false positives in the identification of precipitation events massari and maggioni 2020 additionally it should be noted that hourly imerg dataset is produced by averaging the precipitation intensity from two corresponding datasets at the half hourly scale in a specific hour which will also introduce error and uncertainty for model based products era5 and era5 land precipitation datasets generally exhibit non zero hersbach et al 2020 which may explain the significantly higher pod and far values of era5 and era5 land compared with imerg final and gsmap gauge era5 land shows similar error characteristics as era5 and the evaluation results show that era5 land slightly outperforms era5 in terms of the categorical metrics whereas era5 has better performance considering the statistical metrics this phenomenon may be attributable to the fact that era5 land is a downscaled dataset produced through a single simulation driven by near surface atmospheric fields from era5 with thermo dynamical orographic adjustment of temperature consequently with significant similarities between era5 and era5 land the downscaling processing may reduce the overestimates of era5 leading to higher performance in terms of statistical metrics and poorer performance in terms of categorical metrics a possible reason for imerg final and gsmap gauge outperforming era5 and era5 land is that these satellite based precipitation products have undergone a global land ground based calibration using global precipitation climatology centre gpcc precipitation products 1 0 monthly huffman et al 2020 and climate prediction center cpc unified gauge based analysis of global daily precipitation data 0 5 daily mega et al 2019 respectively whereas era5 and era5 land precipitation datasets only assimilate the ncep stage iv quantitative precipitation estimates in usa hersbach et al 2020 and have not been calibrated against gridded ground truth over mainland china additionally the different sources of ground based calibration datasets of imerg final and gsmap gauge may be the critical reason for the difference in accuracy between the two precipitation products 4 3 future improvements despite these comprehensive results presented in this study there is abundant room for further progress in introducing more precipitation estimates with various development and calibration methods for determining and comparing their characteristics and differences for example the different products of imerg and gsmap could be taken into account including imerg early latency of 4 h imerg late latency of 14 h gsmap now latency of 0 h and gsmap mvk latency of 3 days apart from era5 and era5 land other model based precipitation datasets could also be considered in future studies such as jra 55 and merra 2 in this study era5 hourly data on single levels from 2016 to 2019 was used era5 also provides hourly data on pressure levels available online https doi org 10 24381 cds bd0915c6 to draw a complete picture of the performances of era5 additional studies are needed to explore the performance of the variables on pressure levels against the vertical profile observations from weather balloons or radars the spatial coverage of this study is confined to mainland china in further studies global ground based observations such as the integrated surface database isd could be used for long term nearly 120 years global coverage evaluations at the sub daily temporal scale furthermore the performances of satellite based and model based precipitation products could also be evaluated through indirect hydrological modeling based inferencing with the focus on hydrological implications as well as operational flood modeling li et al 2015 belabid et al 2019 although this study reveals that imerg final and gsmap gauge outperform era5 and era5 land the unsatisfactory performances of imerg final and gsmap gauge at the hourly scale still deserve wide attention several studies have already developed several algorithms and methods for instance downscaling error correction and retrospective analyses and applied them to produce precipitation products with finer spatio temporal resolutions higher accuracy and wider time coverage ma et al 2017a b 2018 xie and xiong 2011 tang et al 2018b however the quality improvement studies for the state of the art reanalysis precipitation datasets e g era5 and era5 land have rarely been considered therefore reanalysis precipitation datasets have high potential for further improvement 5 conclusions model based and satellite based precipitation products with high quality and fine spatio temporal resolutions have become two primary underpinnings for large scale applications in hydro geo climatological studies against the backdrop of the growth of model based precipitation products over the past few decades the significance of evaluating the substitutability between model based and satellite based precipitation products is continuously increasing this study evaluated four model based era5 and era5 land and satellite based imerg final and gsmap gauge precipitation products which are recently released to the public against rain gauge data over mainland china at multiple time scales from 2016 to 2019 the main conclusions include but are not limited to the following 1 model based and satellite based precipitation products show similar spatial distributions of annual mean precipitation with a general increasing trend from the northwest to the southeast over mainland china 2 on the whole satellite based precipitation products outperform model based products nevertheless under some circumstances for example in high latitude regions e g subregions of tc and tm as well as during the winter period model based precipitation products outperform satellite based products 3 among all products imerg final shows the highest performance at the monthly resolution but its performance declined at the daily resolution for which gsmap gauge shows the highest performance 4 era5 and era5 land exhibit similar spatial temporal and numerical patterns era5 slightly outperforms era5 land in terms of the statistical metrics whereas era5 shows higher performance considering the categorical metrics the performance differences may be attributable by the downscaling process of era5 land 5 satellite based products show the highest performance over st whereas model based products show highest performance over tm and tc however all the products lead to large uncertainties over pm 6 in terms of event duration and mean event precipitation rate imerg final shows the highest performance in contrast gsmap gauge significantly overestimates the duration of precipitation events and era5 and era5 land significantly underestimate the mean rate of the precipitation events these findings may facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the error characteristics of the newly released era5 era5 land imerg final and gsmap gauge precipitation products as well as the similarities and differences between them over mainland china moreover we hope that the comprehensive analysis of the state of the art model based and satellite based precipitation products could be useful to guide practical application and

3761,in the context of global warming permafrost degrades gradually to cope with the instability of the cryosphere it is very important to strengthen the monitoring of the seasonal freeze thaw cycle at present active and passive microwave remote sensing data are widely used in freeze thaw f t onset detection there is some potential to improve accuracy through the combination of active and passive microwave data compared with the traditional method for combination the machine learning algorithm has a stronger nonlinear expression ability therefore it is advisable to use machine learning to combine multi source data for freeze thaw onset detection in this study the temporal change detection method is applied to smap data and ascat data respectively for preliminary detection then the random forest algorithm rf is used to combine the preliminary results of active and passive microwave data with site observation to estimate the freeze thaw onsets more accurately the method is validated with data obtained in alaska from 2015 to 2019 the accuracy evaluation shows that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of freeze thaw onset detection the predicted distribution of the freeze thaw cycle indicates that the variation of the freeze thaw cycle is closely related to latitude in general the proposed method based on machine learning is promising in the research of freeze thaw state monitoring keywords machine learning multi source data freeze thaw onset smap ascat alaska 1 introduction the freeze thaw cycle has a great impact on the ecosystem energy balance and hydrological cycle langer et al 2011 frozen soil regions are considered to be the largest soil carbon pool in terrestrial ecosystems the variation of temperature and humidity during freeze thaw state transitions greatly affects the carbon cycle between the surface and atmosphere du et al 2019 turetsky et al 2020 besides freeze thaw cycles are closely related to soil physical properties lehrsch et al 1991 lehrsch et al 1998 edwards et al 2010 and plant growth kimball et al 2004 bartsch et al 2007 liu et al 2018 change of freeze thaw cycle will also influence the survival of insects mammals and soil microorganisms zhu et al 2019 however the cryosphere ecosystem is very fragile against rising temperatures and increasing co2 the northern region is warming at about twice the global rate stuecker et al 2018 glacier became to recede and permafrost showed a broad trend of degradation teufel and sushama 2019 the accelerated release of carbon in the process of permafrost melting also produced positive feedback on global warming menzel et al 2006 currently permafrost is experiencing widespread sudden collapse land subsidence can cause the expansion of lakes and wetlands and destabilize nearby houses and roads turetsky et al 2019 in order to respond to the unstable changes of the cryosphere rapidly it is of great significance to strengthen the monitoring of the cryosphere the observation station in cold regions is sparse due to the extreme climate and complex terrain therefore remote sensing shows advantages in detecting f t onset of the surface soil with wider coverage and higher efficiency both active and passive microwave data can be used to detect near surface f t state active microwave sensors including scatterometer and synthetic aperture radar sar have a strong ability in f t onset detection for instance some commonly used scatter meters such as nasa scatterometer nscat ku band frolking et al 1999 quick scatterometer quikscat ku band bartsch et al 2010 advanced scatterometer ascat c band naeimi et al 2012 can provide high temporal resolution monitoring meanwhile several space borne sar sensors such as advanced sar asar l band park et al 2011 phrase array l band synthetic aperture radar palsar l band du et al 2014 sentinel 1c band zhang et al 2019 have been used to provide near surface f t state detection with high spatial resolution however the revisit interval of sar data is too long which cannot meet the requirement of rapid response in near surface f t retrieval in terms of passive microwave sensors the radiometer usually has multi frequency channels and high temporal resolution the soil f t state can be retrieved by radiometers such as scanning multi channel microwave radiometer smmr special sensor microwave imager ssm i and advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e zuerndorfer et al 1990 jin et al 2009 zhao et al 2011 different remote sensing products show different error characteristics according to sensor specifications retrieval algorithms and environmental conditions chai et al 2014 therefore the combination of these different datasets is considered a promising way to achieve better performance than using a single product kraatz et al 2020 used effective soil temperature from geos 5 to improve smap freeze thaw retrievals muzalevskiy and ruzicka 2020 constructed a new indicator to detect the soil freeze thaw state in the arctic region based on combining the smap and amsr 2 brightness temperature observations compared with passive microwave data active microwave data are more sensitive to vegetation changes while passive microwave data are more susceptible to surface temperature fluctuations in addition the disturbance brought by snowmelt to the active and passive microwave sensors is also different chen et al 2019 therefore improving the f t onset detection algorithm by combining active and passive microwave remote sensing is a new direction in the current research bateni et al 2013 in terms of the soil moisture kim et al 2018 combined smap with ascat and amsr 2 for soil moisture monitoring using weight distribution as for the f t state retrieval chen et al 2019 detected the soil freeze thaw onsets based on smap and ascat data respectively but they did not realize the combination up to now there are few algorithms combining active and passive microwave measurements to detect f t onset han et al 2012 used active microwave data of quikscat and passive microwave data of ssm i to identify near surface thaw events considering that the change direction of active and passive microwave indicators is opposite during the freeze thaw state transition period a linear combination was used to construct a new monitoring index however such a linear method has limited ability to describe the relationship between f t state transitions and the active passive microwave indicators nowadays due to the strong capability in simulating or simplifying complex nonlinear models machine learning has been widely used in remote sensing retrieval of environmental parameters yuan et al 2020 it has been applied in the retrieval of many aspects including soil moisture rodriguez fernandez et al 2014 xu et al 2018a precipitation bellerby et al 2000 snow cover tedesco et al 2004 evapotranspiration lu and zhuang 2010 particulate matter li et al 2017 wang et al 2020a vegetation parameter li et al 2007 and ocean color parameter musavi et al 2002 shen et al 2018 proposed that machine learning will probably become an indispensable tool for hydrology just like bayesian statistics in recent studies of the cryosphere wang et al 2020b used the deep belief network to fuse gnss r estimates with satellite and meteorological observations for snow depth estimation ni et al 2020 and wang et al 2020c used the random forest to simulate the active layer thickness of permafrost however machine learning has rarely been used to monitor near surface f t onset detection so far therefore this study aims to establish a machine learning based retrieval model so as to improve the retrieval accuracy of f t onset detection on the basis of the combination of active and passive microwave data the main objectives of this study are as follows firstly our purpose is to use the random forest to combine smap and ascat for freeze thaw monitoring and evaluate its accuracy using the in situ measurement in alaska from 2015 to 2020 the proposed method is compared with traditional methods and other machine learning methods to assess the effectiveness then we aim to apply this approach to investigate the temporal and spatial variation of freeze thaw cycle in alaska from 2015 to 2020 in our study we propose a f t retrieval approach combining smap and ascat for the first time the use of machine learning will provide new insights for the practical application of recent f t onset detection 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area 60 n 70 n 140 w 170 e covers most areas of alaska fig 1 alaska is located in the northwest of north america surrounded by the arctic ocean the bering sea and the north pacific ocean western and southwestern alaska is cold and windy due to the influence of the north pacific ocean current the climate of central alaska is continental affected by basin topography it often appears extremely low temperature in winter northern alaska has a polar climate so it is cold all year round where temperatures are mostly below zero alaska has a vast territory and large undulating terrain most of which are in the dynamic change of freeze thaw cycle considerations mentioned above indicate that alaska is an ideal location for the research on near surface freeze thaw onset detection 2 2 microwave remote sensing data 2 2 1 smap brightness temperature the smap satellite launched in 2015 was intended to monitor surface freeze thaw state by combining active and passive microwave measurements however the radar stopped working after only three months here we only use the radiometer data it has an incident angle of 40 and operates at a frequency of 1 5 ghz smap l1c radiometer brightness temperature data chan et al 2018 have been available at the national snow and ice data center https nsidc org since march 2015 the data which is gridded to ease grid 2 0 brodzik et al 2014 includes both vertical and horizontal polarization mode and it is geographically registered and arranged in chronological order the l1c product has a spatial resolution of 36 km and a revisit interval of about one day in the study area in this study brightness temperature data from 2015 to 2019 is downloaded from the national snow and ice data center in addition the smap l3 radiometer freeze thaw state data xu et al 2018b is also used in this paper to compare with the temporal change detection algorithm this product is a daily freeze thaw state product produced by the l1c product based on the seasonal threshold algorithm the l3 product has been available since march 2015 with a spatial resolution of 36 km and a temporal resolution of 1 day 2 2 2 ascat backscatter coefficient ascat is an airborne c band vertical polarization scatterometer on eumetsat s satellites with an incident angle range of 34 to 64 operating at a frequency of 5 3 ghz ascat level 1 backscatter coefficient data resampled at 25 km has been available at http archive eumetsat int since 2007 revisit interval is about one day in the study area here the ascat product is gridded to ease grid 2 0 and resampled to 36 km using the nearest neighbor method to keep the geographic reference consistent with the smap product 2 2 3 amsr 2 brightness temperature brightness temperature data of the amsr 2 satellite at 6 9 ghz under vertical polarization are also used here in order to compare with the modified polarization ratio algorithm muzalevskiy and ruzicka 2020 combining smap and amsr 2 for f t onset detection the data resampled at 25 km could be downloaded from https nsidc org data 2 3 in situ measurements 2 3 1 snotel scan the snow telemetry snotel is a snow and water resources monitoring program of the natural resources conservation service nrcs and the soil climate analysis network scan is a soil moisture temperature monitoring project of nrcs schaefer et al 2007 soil temperature and moisture data provided by these sites are observed at depths of 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm 50 cm and 100 cm considering the penetration ability of microwave observation of soil temperature and moisture at 5 cm are mainly used in this study chen et al 2019 while near surface air temperature data are used at sites without soil temperature and moisture hu et al 2019 2 3 2 uscrn the u s climate reference network uscrn is a climate monitoring network with sites across every u s state including alaska and hawaii bell et al 2013 the observation data of surface temperature are used in this study 2 3 3 rwis road weather information system rwis is a part of the meteorological assimilation data ingest system madis which provides road data of more than 33 states at https madis ncep noaa gov since 2004 we use road temperature data from the asphalt layer provided by rwis sensor 1 which has the most complete data record since permittivity of the road surface is different from that of natural soil in response to changes in humidity and salinity it is of great significance to consider a small number of road observations for f t state monitoring of artificial surface kraatz et al 2020 2 3 4 site distribution and data processing we use in situ data measured at 70 observation sites including 41 snotel sites 7 scan sites 10 uscrn sites and 12 rwis sites observations almost cover the whole study area fig 1 the in situ data from 2015 to 2019 is used for the construction and performance evaluation of the f t onset detection model for in situ measurement of near surface air temperature and road surface temperature the state above 0 is determined as a thawed state and the state below 0 is determined as a frozen state so that we can obtain the f t onset han et al 2012 kraatz et al 2020 for soil temperature and humidity data we assume that when the soil temperature is between 1 and 1 sudden increases or decreases of volumetric water content are caused by soil thawing or freezing in situ freezing onset is defined as the earliest date when the 5 day average volumetric water content is below 10 and the soil temperature is below 1 c similarly the earliest date when a 5 day net increase of volumetric water content is more than 10 and the soil temperature rises to more than 1 is defined as the in situ thawing onset chen et al 2019 2 4 auxiliary data 2 4 1 elevation data considering the topographic influence on the retrieval accuracy of surface freeze thaw state elevation is used as an auxiliary parameter etopo1 global relief model is utilized as elevation data fig 2 with a spatial resolution of 1 arc minute amante and eakins 2009 the high altitudes are the alaska range and brooks range here all the auxiliary data is resampled to match the microwave remote sensing data 2 4 2 land cover data to analyze the influence of land cover on the accuracy of f t onset detection we use the land cover map of alaska in 2016 provided by the national land cover database nlcd with a spatial resolution of 30 m homer et al 2020 the classification system is modified from the anderson land cover classification system it divides alaska into eight major categories including water developed area barren forest shrubland grass cultivated land and wetland the grids with open water as the main land cover type are excluded in the f t onset detection to reduce the influence of open water on microwave emission hu et al 2019 as can be seen from fig 3 the study area is mainly covered with forests and shrubs 2 4 3 land surface temperature data we use the mod11c3 product wan et al 2015 from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa to analyze the relationship between the monthly land surface temperature lst and the freeze thaw process the resolution of the mod11c3 product is 0 05 and its lst values are obtained by synthesis and averaging from the mod11c1 daily product 3 freeze thaw onset detection algorithm the general idea of the proposed method is as follows fig 4 firstly smap and ascat data are preprocessed to construct monitoring indicators and the temporal change detection method is used to obtain the preliminary estimation results then the random forest modeling is used to obtain more accurate f t onsets finally the frozen period is calculated this section will introduce the above ideas in detail 3 1 data preprocessing 3 1 1 passive microwave remote sensing data for passive microwave remote sensing freeze thaw state detection is mainly based on the change of microwave properties caused by the change of soil permittivity for brightness temperature data since vertical polarization mode is more sensitive to the change of soil permittivity than horizontal polarization mode the polarization difference of thawed soil is greater than that of frozen soil rautiainen et al 2014 therefore the freeze thaw state transition can be detected through the mutation of the polarization difference the normalized polarization ratio npr is constructed as the monitoring indicator using brightness temperature data of both vertical and horizontal polarization mode of smap l1c products rautiainen et al 2014 1 npr t bv t bh t bv t bh where tb v and tb h represent brightness temperature of vertical polarization and horizontal polarization respectively 3 1 2 active microwave remote sensing data in the process of soil thawing the increase of the soil dielectric constant will lead to the enhancement of the reflectivity which will increase the backscatter coefficient therefore the freeze thaw state transition can be monitored by the mutation of the backscatter coefficient since the incident angle range of ascat is not fixed the backscatter coefficient will vary with the incident angle so it is necessary to eliminate the influence of the incident angle the relationship between the backscatter coefficient œÉ 0 db and the incident angle Œ∏ i kennett and li 1989 can be described as 2 œÉ 0 Œ∏ i a Œ∏ i b where a is the slope and b is the intercept as changes in biomass and soil moisture during the day of year doy 1 60 are small the backscatter coefficient is relatively stable therefore the slope a obtained from the data regression during the frozen period can be used to correct œÉ 0 of a whole year to the standard incident angle of 45 as chen et al 2019 3 œÉ 45 0 œÉ 0 a Œ∏ i 45 where œÉ 45 0 and œÉ 0 are the backscatter coefficients after and before correction respectively Œ∏ i is the incident angle corresponding to the backscatter coefficient and a is the slope obtained by linear regression 3 2 edge detection the f t retrieval method based on edge detection determines f t onset by identifying significant changes in the time series in this study the edge detection algorithm is applied to the two indicators npr and œÉ 45 0 obtained by preprocessing the active and passive microwave remote sensing data to obtain the preliminary result of f t onsets the canny detector canny 1987 used in edge detection can be described as the first derivative of the normal distribution density function 4 f t t 2 œÄ s 3 e t 2 2 s 2 where t is the time variable and s is the standard deviation of the normal distribution then we convolve the time series of the indicator with the canny detector to obtain the response 5 e t x w w f œÑ g t œÑ d œÑ where w is the half window width g is a microwave remote sensing indicator npr or œÉ 45 0 and œÑ is a dummy time variable smaller s is more sensitive to subtle changes while larger s is more sensitive to significant changes both npr and œÉ 45 0 will increase during the soil thawing process and decrease significantly during the soil freezing process assuming that the soil freeze thaw state transition occurs in the thawing window doy 60 150 and the freezing window doy 250 340 the thawing onset is defined as the date when e n p r e œÉ 45 0 reaches the maximum in the thawing window similarly the freezing onset is defined as the date when e n p r e œÉ 45 0 reaches the minimum in the freezing window chen et al 2019 both the ascending and descending orbit data are used for the study and we use the mean value to avoid the influence of the diurnal freeze thaw cycle thus we can get the preliminary results of the active and passive microwave data respectively 3 3 rf algorithm for freeze thaw onset detection 3 3 1 rf model structure random forest is an ensemble learning model constructed by multiple decision trees which is widely used in data classification and regression breiman and cutler 2001 the basic classifier of the rf model is the decision tree the decision tree uses a heuristic algorithm to select the segmentation variable and value to evaluate the selection of segmentation we calculate the impurity of the nodes after segmentation 6 g x i v ij n l n h x l n r n h x r where x i is the segmentation variable v ij is the value of the segmentation variable n l n r are the number of training samples of the left and right child nodes after segmentation and n is the number of all training samples of the current node x l x r are the training sample sets of the left and right child nodes respectively h x is a function used for evaluation of the impurity and here we choose mse as h x smaller impurity indicates the target variable of samples in a child node is closer so the segmentation variable and value that make the impurity reach the minimum can be used as the optimal segmentation 7 x v argmin x v g x i v ij where x and v represent the optimal segmentation variable and value respectively the rf model fig 5 uses multiple decision trees for ensemble learning to avoid over fitting the bootstrap idea is used to ensure the difference between the basic classifiers finally the average value of the prediction results output by multiple decision trees is taken as the final prediction result 3 3 2 freeze thaw onset detection model based on rf in this study the rf regression model is established for the freezing and thawing onset detection respectively since the influences of vegetation on microwave sensors are different in spring and autumn f t onset detected by npr and œÉ 45 0 are both considered due to the different responses of the active and passive microwave sensor to the snowmelt in addition latitude longitude and elevation are added into the model considering the correlation between f t onset and the geographical location therefore the relationship between f t onset and various variables is established as follows 8 d f f f d f a d f s l a t l o n e l e d t f t d t a d t s l a t l o n e l e where f f and f t are the freezing and thawing onset detection models d f a and d t a are the freezing thawing onset obtained by ascat data and d f s and d t s are those obtained by smap data lat lon and ele are latitude longitude and elevation the grid search method was used to fine tune the model parameters gradually and select the parameters with the best performance for model fitting the adjustable parameters of the rf model include the number of decision trees the maximum depth of each decision tree the minimum sample size in node division the minimum sample size of leaf nodes and the maximum number of features the grid search method adjusts the parameters according to the set step size within the specified parameter range and uses cross validation to select the optimal parameters for the training of the rf model we compared the result with traditional methods including the edge detection algorithm ed chen et al 2019 which uses active and passive microwave data separately smap l3 product xu et al 2018b based on the seasonal threshold algorithm st the modified polarization ratio algorithm mpr muzalevskiy and ruzicka 2020 combining smap and amsr 2 and the daily signal difference algorithm dsd han et al 2012 combining smap and ascat besides we use the same sample as the rf model to build other models for comparison included multiple linear regression mlr support vector machine svm saunders et al 2002 and general regression neural network grnn specht 1991 the performance of the model is evaluated using 10 fold cross validation rodriguez et al 2010 we choose the root mean square error rmse absolute mean error mae correlation coefficient r and bias as the statistics for accuracy evaluation the model with smaller rmse smaller mae larger r is considered to be performing better overall accuracy a can also be used to evaluate the accuracy of f t onset detection hu et al 2019 9 a ff t t ff t t t f f t 100 where f represents the frozen state t represents the thawed state ff or tt represents the number of days in which both in situ measurement and remote sensing monitoring results are in the frozen state or thawed state tf represents the number of days in which in situ measurement is in the thawed state while remote sensing monitoring is in the frozen state and ft represents the opposite condition 4 results and analysis 4 1 evaluation of model performance the rf based f t retrieval algorithm and other methods for comparison are applied to the active and passive microwave data from august 2015 to august 2019 as shown in table 1 the accuracy of each method in thawing onset detection is lower than that of freezing onset detection this could be due to the vulnerability of monitoring indicators to the disturbance caused by snowmelt events also the thawing refreezing thawing process is prone to occur during spring which poses a challenge to accurate detection for the methods which use active and passive microwave data respectively the accuracy of the smap l3 product obtained by the seasonal threshold algorithm is not as good as that obtained by the edge detection method using the smap l1c product this is because the accuracy of the seasonal threshold algorithm is highly dependent on the selection of f t state reference values and the threshold thus short term changes of external factors such as vegetation may easily lead to misjudgment of onsets moreover the accuracy of smap is higher than that of ascat when they both use the edge detection method this is possibly due to the strong penetration caused by the low frequency which makes the smap more sensitive to the change of the soil water phase for the methods which combine multi source data because the mpr algorithm combines smap and amsr 2 based on the threshold the performance is better than that of the seasonal threshold algorithm but the results are still inferior to those of the dsd algorithm which detects f t onsets based on temporal changes the different selection of remote sensors for merging will also affect the retrieval accuracy both smap and amsr 2 used in the mpr algorithm are passive microwave remote sensing data which can provide limited complementary information the dsd algorithm combining smap and ascat has more effect on improving the accuracy of freezing onset detection but still not as good as mlr this may be caused by the use of more parameters corresponding to the f t state transition in mlr in thawing onset detection it is more difficult for the dsd algorithm to take advantage one of the reasons may be that this method is designed for quikscat and ssm i which is not fully applicable to ascat and smap on the other hand the accuracy of the nonlinear methods such as svm grnn and rf is higher than that of mlr which indicates that the nonlinear method can better express the relationship between the freeze thaw cycle and the active passive microwave indicators among the nonlinear methods rf has the best performance r mae and rmse in freezing onset detection are 0 77 7 21 days and 8 78 days respectively for thawing onset detection r mae and rmse are 0 81 8 73 days and 10 84 days respectively the overall accuracy is 95 31 fig 6 and fig 7 respectively show the scatter plots of the observed f t onsets and the predicted values detected by the six algorithms which combine the multi source data it can be seen that the dispersion of the plots in freezing onset detection fig 6 is generally smaller than that of thawing onset detection fig 7 rf model has minimal dispersion in both freezing and thawing onset detection grnn model comes next but it is more prone to underestimate and overestimate than the rf model in conclusion the rf based f t retrieval model proposed in this paper has the best performance among all the comparison models so the predicted result obtained by this model is reliable in addition we analyze the spatial variability of the overall accuracy of the f t onset detection models fig 8 the traditional dsd method was compared with the rf model which has the best performance in comparison to the other machine learning models it can be seen that the results of the rf model have a generally higher consistency with the sites this indicates that the overall accuracy of f t onset detection is effectively improved we can also find that the overall accuracy is generally high in the southeast region with dense sites furthermore we do statistical analysis to understand the influence of land cover on the accuracy of f t onset detection here we use the traditional dsd method to compare with our method as shown in fig 9 the dsd method tends to overestimate which means the f t onset get by this method is often later than the ground truth the bias in the developed area and barren is large indicating that the applicability of the dsd method may be reduced in areas with less vegetation coverage however the rf method proposed in this paper can effectively reduce the bias the accuracy of freezing and thawing onset detection in shrubland is the highest with the bias of 0 07 days and 0 22 days the accuracy in the forest comes next with the bias of 0 09 days and 1 13 days the bias in the developed area and barren is relatively large and both tend to overestimate on the one hand forests and shrubs are the main types of coverage in the study area and these two types account for a large proportion of the sites used in the model construction on the other hand because vegetation has a thermal insulation effect on the underlying soil the temperature fluctuation of barren and the developed area is relatively greater the diurnal freeze thaw cycles will probably cause multiple edges in edge detection which leads to more misjudgment in freeze thaw monitoring in future model construction different land covers can be built with different models to further improve the accuracy 4 2 analysis of variation in freeze thaw cycle taking august 2018 to august 2019 as an example the freezing process in the study area retrieved by the random forest model is shown in fig 10 as can be seen from the figure the northeast of alaska began to freeze at the beginning of october and then the freezing range gradually extended to the southwest finally southwest alaska began to freeze and the freezing of the whole of alaska happened in the middle of november the thawing process is shown in fig 11 it can be seen from the figure that in early april 2019 the thaw event began in the southeast then the southwest and finally the north the whole alaska thawed by the middle of may because the northeast froze first and thawed last it had the longest frozen period to analyze the seasonal variation of the freeze thaw transition process from august 2015 to august 2019 we counted the percentage of the frozen area in the study area at the beginning of each month the average land surface temperature data is used for auxiliary analysis as shown in fig 12 the annual trend is approximately the same from 2015 to 2019 the thawed period is relatively stable from early june to early september and the frozen period is stable from early december to early march as can be seen this trend is similar to seasonal variation in temperature the average temperature from june to september generally stays above 5 while the temperature from december to march of the following year generally stays around 20 to 10 the freezing process usually occurs from october to november while the thawing process mostly occurs from april to may accordingly october is the month in which the average temperature begins to turn negative while the average temperature in april is near zero during the study period the thawing process started at a faster rate in 2019 this is because the average temperature in march 2019 was above 10 which was significantly higher than before then the spatial variation of the freeze thaw cycle during 2015 2019 is further analyzed the freezing onsets all occurred in doy 255 315 and their spatial distribution is shown in fig 13 the freezing onsets in the northeast have remained in the early range probably due to the polar climate and the adjacence of the arctic ocean which makes there wet and cold conversely the freezing onsets in the southwest are the latest which may be related to the low latitude and low altitude in 2015 the freezing onsets of the southwest are generally late the thawing onsets all occurred in doy 70 145 and their spatial distribution is shown in fig 14 the thawing onsets are generally late and stable in the north on the contrary the thawing onsets is early in the mid south probably due to the high population density which makes it vulnerable to human activities in 2019 the thawing onsets of the mid south are extremely early in a wide range the lengths of the frozen period were 135 245 days and their spatial distribution is shown in fig 15 the northeast always had a long frozen period while the southwest and mid south had a relatively shorter frozen period during 2018 2019 the south was prone to see a short frozen period on a large scale in summary the freeze thaw cycle has a strong correlation with latitude the frozen period is generally longer in higher latitudes and the freeze thaw cycle in the northeast is relatively stable 4 3 discussion this study proves that the combination of smap and ascat can effectively improve the accuracy of f t onset detection because active and passive microwave remote sensing data can provide complementary information under different vegetation cover and snow cover conditions the combination of the two remote sensing data can achieve higher accuracy of f t onset detection than using a single product for monitoring the application of machine learning is helpful for combining multi source data compared with traditional methods machine learning can better model the complex freeze thaw cycle however the accuracy of this method also depends on the spatial distribution of samples the method can also be extended to a larger area of the tundra through a wider distribution of site specific calibration which will contribute to a better understanding of the freeze thaw cycle in addition the method could be enhanced by using more data to support more robust modeling considering the influence of land cover types on accuracy machine learning modeling for each land cover type may be a more beneficial way the ability to determine the seasonal f t onset is important to improve the understanding of the climate pattern and the associated climate feedback in this paper the temporal and spatial variation of the freeze thaw cycle in alaska in recent years are analyzed which helps us to have a more accurate grasp of the phenological information of the cryosphere but the time series used here is too short to make a robust analysis of the overall trend longer time series can support deeper correlation analysis and predict future changes of the freeze thaw cycle from a long term trend thus we could make an early response to environmental changes in cold regions consider that late freezing and early melting events of the soil are always caused by extreme weather events such as el nino the temporal and spatial distribution of the f t onset obtained in this study may provide a relevant measurement for the prediction of extreme weather with a more accurate record we could improve the ability to monitor ongoing changes in vulnerable areas 5 conclusions in this study the machine learning algorithm is applied to the near surface f t onset detection giving full play to the complementary advantages of multi source remote sensing data we use passive microwave data from smap and active microwave data from ascat as remote sensing data sources and improve accuracy through the rf based combination which provides a new scheme for near surface f t retrieval compared with the traditional method combining active and passive microwave data the rf based method can effectively improve the retrieval accuracy specially in freezing onset detection r increases from 0 58 to 0 77 mae decreases from 9 52 days to 7 21 days and rmse decreases from 12 17 days to 8 78 days for thawing onset detection r increases from 0 60 to 0 81 mae decreases from 13 09 days to 8 73 days and rmse decreases from 16 78 days to 10 84 days as a result the overall accuracy increases from 93 74 to 95 31 finally the proposed rf based f t onset detection model is used to forecast the freeze thaw cycle of the whole study area the distribution shows that the freeze thaw cycle is closely related to latitude there is still room for further study on the one hand with the deepening of research on frozen soil it can be considered to add more model parameters related to frozen soil so as to improve the accuracy of the model prediction on the other hand we can also combine the radiometer data with radar data to further improve spatial resolution although the temporal resolution of the radar is far inferior to that of the scatterometer spatiotemporal fusion with radiometer data can achieve finer mapping with high temporal resolution the seasonal f t transition is spatially heterogeneous so high spatial resolution and high revisiting rate are necessary to capture the characteristics of the f t state more accurately the introduction of high resolution remote sensing data is helpful to obtain finer landscape scale surface states later the idea proposed can be applied to remote sensing data with longer time series so as to reveal the long term change of the freeze thaw cycle and better understand the impact of el nino on the freeze thaw cycle this will help to continuously quantify the interaction between the climate and the freeze thaw cycle we hope that the proposed f t onset detection approach combining the multi source satellite data based on machine learning can provide more accurate data

3761,in the context of global warming permafrost degrades gradually to cope with the instability of the cryosphere it is very important to strengthen the monitoring of the seasonal freeze thaw cycle at present active and passive microwave remote sensing data are widely used in freeze thaw f t onset detection there is some potential to improve accuracy through the combination of active and passive microwave data compared with the traditional method for combination the machine learning algorithm has a stronger nonlinear expression ability therefore it is advisable to use machine learning to combine multi source data for freeze thaw onset detection in this study the temporal change detection method is applied to smap data and ascat data respectively for preliminary detection then the random forest algorithm rf is used to combine the preliminary results of active and passive microwave data with site observation to estimate the freeze thaw onsets more accurately the method is validated with data obtained in alaska from 2015 to 2019 the accuracy evaluation shows that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of freeze thaw onset detection the predicted distribution of the freeze thaw cycle indicates that the variation of the freeze thaw cycle is closely related to latitude in general the proposed method based on machine learning is promising in the research of freeze thaw state monitoring keywords machine learning multi source data freeze thaw onset smap ascat alaska 1 introduction the freeze thaw cycle has a great impact on the ecosystem energy balance and hydrological cycle langer et al 2011 frozen soil regions are considered to be the largest soil carbon pool in terrestrial ecosystems the variation of temperature and humidity during freeze thaw state transitions greatly affects the carbon cycle between the surface and atmosphere du et al 2019 turetsky et al 2020 besides freeze thaw cycles are closely related to soil physical properties lehrsch et al 1991 lehrsch et al 1998 edwards et al 2010 and plant growth kimball et al 2004 bartsch et al 2007 liu et al 2018 change of freeze thaw cycle will also influence the survival of insects mammals and soil microorganisms zhu et al 2019 however the cryosphere ecosystem is very fragile against rising temperatures and increasing co2 the northern region is warming at about twice the global rate stuecker et al 2018 glacier became to recede and permafrost showed a broad trend of degradation teufel and sushama 2019 the accelerated release of carbon in the process of permafrost melting also produced positive feedback on global warming menzel et al 2006 currently permafrost is experiencing widespread sudden collapse land subsidence can cause the expansion of lakes and wetlands and destabilize nearby houses and roads turetsky et al 2019 in order to respond to the unstable changes of the cryosphere rapidly it is of great significance to strengthen the monitoring of the cryosphere the observation station in cold regions is sparse due to the extreme climate and complex terrain therefore remote sensing shows advantages in detecting f t onset of the surface soil with wider coverage and higher efficiency both active and passive microwave data can be used to detect near surface f t state active microwave sensors including scatterometer and synthetic aperture radar sar have a strong ability in f t onset detection for instance some commonly used scatter meters such as nasa scatterometer nscat ku band frolking et al 1999 quick scatterometer quikscat ku band bartsch et al 2010 advanced scatterometer ascat c band naeimi et al 2012 can provide high temporal resolution monitoring meanwhile several space borne sar sensors such as advanced sar asar l band park et al 2011 phrase array l band synthetic aperture radar palsar l band du et al 2014 sentinel 1c band zhang et al 2019 have been used to provide near surface f t state detection with high spatial resolution however the revisit interval of sar data is too long which cannot meet the requirement of rapid response in near surface f t retrieval in terms of passive microwave sensors the radiometer usually has multi frequency channels and high temporal resolution the soil f t state can be retrieved by radiometers such as scanning multi channel microwave radiometer smmr special sensor microwave imager ssm i and advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e zuerndorfer et al 1990 jin et al 2009 zhao et al 2011 different remote sensing products show different error characteristics according to sensor specifications retrieval algorithms and environmental conditions chai et al 2014 therefore the combination of these different datasets is considered a promising way to achieve better performance than using a single product kraatz et al 2020 used effective soil temperature from geos 5 to improve smap freeze thaw retrievals muzalevskiy and ruzicka 2020 constructed a new indicator to detect the soil freeze thaw state in the arctic region based on combining the smap and amsr 2 brightness temperature observations compared with passive microwave data active microwave data are more sensitive to vegetation changes while passive microwave data are more susceptible to surface temperature fluctuations in addition the disturbance brought by snowmelt to the active and passive microwave sensors is also different chen et al 2019 therefore improving the f t onset detection algorithm by combining active and passive microwave remote sensing is a new direction in the current research bateni et al 2013 in terms of the soil moisture kim et al 2018 combined smap with ascat and amsr 2 for soil moisture monitoring using weight distribution as for the f t state retrieval chen et al 2019 detected the soil freeze thaw onsets based on smap and ascat data respectively but they did not realize the combination up to now there are few algorithms combining active and passive microwave measurements to detect f t onset han et al 2012 used active microwave data of quikscat and passive microwave data of ssm i to identify near surface thaw events considering that the change direction of active and passive microwave indicators is opposite during the freeze thaw state transition period a linear combination was used to construct a new monitoring index however such a linear method has limited ability to describe the relationship between f t state transitions and the active passive microwave indicators nowadays due to the strong capability in simulating or simplifying complex nonlinear models machine learning has been widely used in remote sensing retrieval of environmental parameters yuan et al 2020 it has been applied in the retrieval of many aspects including soil moisture rodriguez fernandez et al 2014 xu et al 2018a precipitation bellerby et al 2000 snow cover tedesco et al 2004 evapotranspiration lu and zhuang 2010 particulate matter li et al 2017 wang et al 2020a vegetation parameter li et al 2007 and ocean color parameter musavi et al 2002 shen et al 2018 proposed that machine learning will probably become an indispensable tool for hydrology just like bayesian statistics in recent studies of the cryosphere wang et al 2020b used the deep belief network to fuse gnss r estimates with satellite and meteorological observations for snow depth estimation ni et al 2020 and wang et al 2020c used the random forest to simulate the active layer thickness of permafrost however machine learning has rarely been used to monitor near surface f t onset detection so far therefore this study aims to establish a machine learning based retrieval model so as to improve the retrieval accuracy of f t onset detection on the basis of the combination of active and passive microwave data the main objectives of this study are as follows firstly our purpose is to use the random forest to combine smap and ascat for freeze thaw monitoring and evaluate its accuracy using the in situ measurement in alaska from 2015 to 2020 the proposed method is compared with traditional methods and other machine learning methods to assess the effectiveness then we aim to apply this approach to investigate the temporal and spatial variation of freeze thaw cycle in alaska from 2015 to 2020 in our study we propose a f t retrieval approach combining smap and ascat for the first time the use of machine learning will provide new insights for the practical application of recent f t onset detection 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area 60 n 70 n 140 w 170 e covers most areas of alaska fig 1 alaska is located in the northwest of north america surrounded by the arctic ocean the bering sea and the north pacific ocean western and southwestern alaska is cold and windy due to the influence of the north pacific ocean current the climate of central alaska is continental affected by basin topography it often appears extremely low temperature in winter northern alaska has a polar climate so it is cold all year round where temperatures are mostly below zero alaska has a vast territory and large undulating terrain most of which are in the dynamic change of freeze thaw cycle considerations mentioned above indicate that alaska is an ideal location for the research on near surface freeze thaw onset detection 2 2 microwave remote sensing data 2 2 1 smap brightness temperature the smap satellite launched in 2015 was intended to monitor surface freeze thaw state by combining active and passive microwave measurements however the radar stopped working after only three months here we only use the radiometer data it has an incident angle of 40 and operates at a frequency of 1 5 ghz smap l1c radiometer brightness temperature data chan et al 2018 have been available at the national snow and ice data center https nsidc org since march 2015 the data which is gridded to ease grid 2 0 brodzik et al 2014 includes both vertical and horizontal polarization mode and it is geographically registered and arranged in chronological order the l1c product has a spatial resolution of 36 km and a revisit interval of about one day in the study area in this study brightness temperature data from 2015 to 2019 is downloaded from the national snow and ice data center in addition the smap l3 radiometer freeze thaw state data xu et al 2018b is also used in this paper to compare with the temporal change detection algorithm this product is a daily freeze thaw state product produced by the l1c product based on the seasonal threshold algorithm the l3 product has been available since march 2015 with a spatial resolution of 36 km and a temporal resolution of 1 day 2 2 2 ascat backscatter coefficient ascat is an airborne c band vertical polarization scatterometer on eumetsat s satellites with an incident angle range of 34 to 64 operating at a frequency of 5 3 ghz ascat level 1 backscatter coefficient data resampled at 25 km has been available at http archive eumetsat int since 2007 revisit interval is about one day in the study area here the ascat product is gridded to ease grid 2 0 and resampled to 36 km using the nearest neighbor method to keep the geographic reference consistent with the smap product 2 2 3 amsr 2 brightness temperature brightness temperature data of the amsr 2 satellite at 6 9 ghz under vertical polarization are also used here in order to compare with the modified polarization ratio algorithm muzalevskiy and ruzicka 2020 combining smap and amsr 2 for f t onset detection the data resampled at 25 km could be downloaded from https nsidc org data 2 3 in situ measurements 2 3 1 snotel scan the snow telemetry snotel is a snow and water resources monitoring program of the natural resources conservation service nrcs and the soil climate analysis network scan is a soil moisture temperature monitoring project of nrcs schaefer et al 2007 soil temperature and moisture data provided by these sites are observed at depths of 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm 50 cm and 100 cm considering the penetration ability of microwave observation of soil temperature and moisture at 5 cm are mainly used in this study chen et al 2019 while near surface air temperature data are used at sites without soil temperature and moisture hu et al 2019 2 3 2 uscrn the u s climate reference network uscrn is a climate monitoring network with sites across every u s state including alaska and hawaii bell et al 2013 the observation data of surface temperature are used in this study 2 3 3 rwis road weather information system rwis is a part of the meteorological assimilation data ingest system madis which provides road data of more than 33 states at https madis ncep noaa gov since 2004 we use road temperature data from the asphalt layer provided by rwis sensor 1 which has the most complete data record since permittivity of the road surface is different from that of natural soil in response to changes in humidity and salinity it is of great significance to consider a small number of road observations for f t state monitoring of artificial surface kraatz et al 2020 2 3 4 site distribution and data processing we use in situ data measured at 70 observation sites including 41 snotel sites 7 scan sites 10 uscrn sites and 12 rwis sites observations almost cover the whole study area fig 1 the in situ data from 2015 to 2019 is used for the construction and performance evaluation of the f t onset detection model for in situ measurement of near surface air temperature and road surface temperature the state above 0 is determined as a thawed state and the state below 0 is determined as a frozen state so that we can obtain the f t onset han et al 2012 kraatz et al 2020 for soil temperature and humidity data we assume that when the soil temperature is between 1 and 1 sudden increases or decreases of volumetric water content are caused by soil thawing or freezing in situ freezing onset is defined as the earliest date when the 5 day average volumetric water content is below 10 and the soil temperature is below 1 c similarly the earliest date when a 5 day net increase of volumetric water content is more than 10 and the soil temperature rises to more than 1 is defined as the in situ thawing onset chen et al 2019 2 4 auxiliary data 2 4 1 elevation data considering the topographic influence on the retrieval accuracy of surface freeze thaw state elevation is used as an auxiliary parameter etopo1 global relief model is utilized as elevation data fig 2 with a spatial resolution of 1 arc minute amante and eakins 2009 the high altitudes are the alaska range and brooks range here all the auxiliary data is resampled to match the microwave remote sensing data 2 4 2 land cover data to analyze the influence of land cover on the accuracy of f t onset detection we use the land cover map of alaska in 2016 provided by the national land cover database nlcd with a spatial resolution of 30 m homer et al 2020 the classification system is modified from the anderson land cover classification system it divides alaska into eight major categories including water developed area barren forest shrubland grass cultivated land and wetland the grids with open water as the main land cover type are excluded in the f t onset detection to reduce the influence of open water on microwave emission hu et al 2019 as can be seen from fig 3 the study area is mainly covered with forests and shrubs 2 4 3 land surface temperature data we use the mod11c3 product wan et al 2015 from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa to analyze the relationship between the monthly land surface temperature lst and the freeze thaw process the resolution of the mod11c3 product is 0 05 and its lst values are obtained by synthesis and averaging from the mod11c1 daily product 3 freeze thaw onset detection algorithm the general idea of the proposed method is as follows fig 4 firstly smap and ascat data are preprocessed to construct monitoring indicators and the temporal change detection method is used to obtain the preliminary estimation results then the random forest modeling is used to obtain more accurate f t onsets finally the frozen period is calculated this section will introduce the above ideas in detail 3 1 data preprocessing 3 1 1 passive microwave remote sensing data for passive microwave remote sensing freeze thaw state detection is mainly based on the change of microwave properties caused by the change of soil permittivity for brightness temperature data since vertical polarization mode is more sensitive to the change of soil permittivity than horizontal polarization mode the polarization difference of thawed soil is greater than that of frozen soil rautiainen et al 2014 therefore the freeze thaw state transition can be detected through the mutation of the polarization difference the normalized polarization ratio npr is constructed as the monitoring indicator using brightness temperature data of both vertical and horizontal polarization mode of smap l1c products rautiainen et al 2014 1 npr t bv t bh t bv t bh where tb v and tb h represent brightness temperature of vertical polarization and horizontal polarization respectively 3 1 2 active microwave remote sensing data in the process of soil thawing the increase of the soil dielectric constant will lead to the enhancement of the reflectivity which will increase the backscatter coefficient therefore the freeze thaw state transition can be monitored by the mutation of the backscatter coefficient since the incident angle range of ascat is not fixed the backscatter coefficient will vary with the incident angle so it is necessary to eliminate the influence of the incident angle the relationship between the backscatter coefficient œÉ 0 db and the incident angle Œ∏ i kennett and li 1989 can be described as 2 œÉ 0 Œ∏ i a Œ∏ i b where a is the slope and b is the intercept as changes in biomass and soil moisture during the day of year doy 1 60 are small the backscatter coefficient is relatively stable therefore the slope a obtained from the data regression during the frozen period can be used to correct œÉ 0 of a whole year to the standard incident angle of 45 as chen et al 2019 3 œÉ 45 0 œÉ 0 a Œ∏ i 45 where œÉ 45 0 and œÉ 0 are the backscatter coefficients after and before correction respectively Œ∏ i is the incident angle corresponding to the backscatter coefficient and a is the slope obtained by linear regression 3 2 edge detection the f t retrieval method based on edge detection determines f t onset by identifying significant changes in the time series in this study the edge detection algorithm is applied to the two indicators npr and œÉ 45 0 obtained by preprocessing the active and passive microwave remote sensing data to obtain the preliminary result of f t onsets the canny detector canny 1987 used in edge detection can be described as the first derivative of the normal distribution density function 4 f t t 2 œÄ s 3 e t 2 2 s 2 where t is the time variable and s is the standard deviation of the normal distribution then we convolve the time series of the indicator with the canny detector to obtain the response 5 e t x w w f œÑ g t œÑ d œÑ where w is the half window width g is a microwave remote sensing indicator npr or œÉ 45 0 and œÑ is a dummy time variable smaller s is more sensitive to subtle changes while larger s is more sensitive to significant changes both npr and œÉ 45 0 will increase during the soil thawing process and decrease significantly during the soil freezing process assuming that the soil freeze thaw state transition occurs in the thawing window doy 60 150 and the freezing window doy 250 340 the thawing onset is defined as the date when e n p r e œÉ 45 0 reaches the maximum in the thawing window similarly the freezing onset is defined as the date when e n p r e œÉ 45 0 reaches the minimum in the freezing window chen et al 2019 both the ascending and descending orbit data are used for the study and we use the mean value to avoid the influence of the diurnal freeze thaw cycle thus we can get the preliminary results of the active and passive microwave data respectively 3 3 rf algorithm for freeze thaw onset detection 3 3 1 rf model structure random forest is an ensemble learning model constructed by multiple decision trees which is widely used in data classification and regression breiman and cutler 2001 the basic classifier of the rf model is the decision tree the decision tree uses a heuristic algorithm to select the segmentation variable and value to evaluate the selection of segmentation we calculate the impurity of the nodes after segmentation 6 g x i v ij n l n h x l n r n h x r where x i is the segmentation variable v ij is the value of the segmentation variable n l n r are the number of training samples of the left and right child nodes after segmentation and n is the number of all training samples of the current node x l x r are the training sample sets of the left and right child nodes respectively h x is a function used for evaluation of the impurity and here we choose mse as h x smaller impurity indicates the target variable of samples in a child node is closer so the segmentation variable and value that make the impurity reach the minimum can be used as the optimal segmentation 7 x v argmin x v g x i v ij where x and v represent the optimal segmentation variable and value respectively the rf model fig 5 uses multiple decision trees for ensemble learning to avoid over fitting the bootstrap idea is used to ensure the difference between the basic classifiers finally the average value of the prediction results output by multiple decision trees is taken as the final prediction result 3 3 2 freeze thaw onset detection model based on rf in this study the rf regression model is established for the freezing and thawing onset detection respectively since the influences of vegetation on microwave sensors are different in spring and autumn f t onset detected by npr and œÉ 45 0 are both considered due to the different responses of the active and passive microwave sensor to the snowmelt in addition latitude longitude and elevation are added into the model considering the correlation between f t onset and the geographical location therefore the relationship between f t onset and various variables is established as follows 8 d f f f d f a d f s l a t l o n e l e d t f t d t a d t s l a t l o n e l e where f f and f t are the freezing and thawing onset detection models d f a and d t a are the freezing thawing onset obtained by ascat data and d f s and d t s are those obtained by smap data lat lon and ele are latitude longitude and elevation the grid search method was used to fine tune the model parameters gradually and select the parameters with the best performance for model fitting the adjustable parameters of the rf model include the number of decision trees the maximum depth of each decision tree the minimum sample size in node division the minimum sample size of leaf nodes and the maximum number of features the grid search method adjusts the parameters according to the set step size within the specified parameter range and uses cross validation to select the optimal parameters for the training of the rf model we compared the result with traditional methods including the edge detection algorithm ed chen et al 2019 which uses active and passive microwave data separately smap l3 product xu et al 2018b based on the seasonal threshold algorithm st the modified polarization ratio algorithm mpr muzalevskiy and ruzicka 2020 combining smap and amsr 2 and the daily signal difference algorithm dsd han et al 2012 combining smap and ascat besides we use the same sample as the rf model to build other models for comparison included multiple linear regression mlr support vector machine svm saunders et al 2002 and general regression neural network grnn specht 1991 the performance of the model is evaluated using 10 fold cross validation rodriguez et al 2010 we choose the root mean square error rmse absolute mean error mae correlation coefficient r and bias as the statistics for accuracy evaluation the model with smaller rmse smaller mae larger r is considered to be performing better overall accuracy a can also be used to evaluate the accuracy of f t onset detection hu et al 2019 9 a ff t t ff t t t f f t 100 where f represents the frozen state t represents the thawed state ff or tt represents the number of days in which both in situ measurement and remote sensing monitoring results are in the frozen state or thawed state tf represents the number of days in which in situ measurement is in the thawed state while remote sensing monitoring is in the frozen state and ft represents the opposite condition 4 results and analysis 4 1 evaluation of model performance the rf based f t retrieval algorithm and other methods for comparison are applied to the active and passive microwave data from august 2015 to august 2019 as shown in table 1 the accuracy of each method in thawing onset detection is lower than that of freezing onset detection this could be due to the vulnerability of monitoring indicators to the disturbance caused by snowmelt events also the thawing refreezing thawing process is prone to occur during spring which poses a challenge to accurate detection for the methods which use active and passive microwave data respectively the accuracy of the smap l3 product obtained by the seasonal threshold algorithm is not as good as that obtained by the edge detection method using the smap l1c product this is because the accuracy of the seasonal threshold algorithm is highly dependent on the selection of f t state reference values and the threshold thus short term changes of external factors such as vegetation may easily lead to misjudgment of onsets moreover the accuracy of smap is higher than that of ascat when they both use the edge detection method this is possibly due to the strong penetration caused by the low frequency which makes the smap more sensitive to the change of the soil water phase for the methods which combine multi source data because the mpr algorithm combines smap and amsr 2 based on the threshold the performance is better than that of the seasonal threshold algorithm but the results are still inferior to those of the dsd algorithm which detects f t onsets based on temporal changes the different selection of remote sensors for merging will also affect the retrieval accuracy both smap and amsr 2 used in the mpr algorithm are passive microwave remote sensing data which can provide limited complementary information the dsd algorithm combining smap and ascat has more effect on improving the accuracy of freezing onset detection but still not as good as mlr this may be caused by the use of more parameters corresponding to the f t state transition in mlr in thawing onset detection it is more difficult for the dsd algorithm to take advantage one of the reasons may be that this method is designed for quikscat and ssm i which is not fully applicable to ascat and smap on the other hand the accuracy of the nonlinear methods such as svm grnn and rf is higher than that of mlr which indicates that the nonlinear method can better express the relationship between the freeze thaw cycle and the active passive microwave indicators among the nonlinear methods rf has the best performance r mae and rmse in freezing onset detection are 0 77 7 21 days and 8 78 days respectively for thawing onset detection r mae and rmse are 0 81 8 73 days and 10 84 days respectively the overall accuracy is 95 31 fig 6 and fig 7 respectively show the scatter plots of the observed f t onsets and the predicted values detected by the six algorithms which combine the multi source data it can be seen that the dispersion of the plots in freezing onset detection fig 6 is generally smaller than that of thawing onset detection fig 7 rf model has minimal dispersion in both freezing and thawing onset detection grnn model comes next but it is more prone to underestimate and overestimate than the rf model in conclusion the rf based f t retrieval model proposed in this paper has the best performance among all the comparison models so the predicted result obtained by this model is reliable in addition we analyze the spatial variability of the overall accuracy of the f t onset detection models fig 8 the traditional dsd method was compared with the rf model which has the best performance in comparison to the other machine learning models it can be seen that the results of the rf model have a generally higher consistency with the sites this indicates that the overall accuracy of f t onset detection is effectively improved we can also find that the overall accuracy is generally high in the southeast region with dense sites furthermore we do statistical analysis to understand the influence of land cover on the accuracy of f t onset detection here we use the traditional dsd method to compare with our method as shown in fig 9 the dsd method tends to overestimate which means the f t onset get by this method is often later than the ground truth the bias in the developed area and barren is large indicating that the applicability of the dsd method may be reduced in areas with less vegetation coverage however the rf method proposed in this paper can effectively reduce the bias the accuracy of freezing and thawing onset detection in shrubland is the highest with the bias of 0 07 days and 0 22 days the accuracy in the forest comes next with the bias of 0 09 days and 1 13 days the bias in the developed area and barren is relatively large and both tend to overestimate on the one hand forests and shrubs are the main types of coverage in the study area and these two types account for a large proportion of the sites used in the model construction on the other hand because vegetation has a thermal insulation effect on the underlying soil the temperature fluctuation of barren and the developed area is relatively greater the diurnal freeze thaw cycles will probably cause multiple edges in edge detection which leads to more misjudgment in freeze thaw monitoring in future model construction different land covers can be built with different models to further improve the accuracy 4 2 analysis of variation in freeze thaw cycle taking august 2018 to august 2019 as an example the freezing process in the study area retrieved by the random forest model is shown in fig 10 as can be seen from the figure the northeast of alaska began to freeze at the beginning of october and then the freezing range gradually extended to the southwest finally southwest alaska began to freeze and the freezing of the whole of alaska happened in the middle of november the thawing process is shown in fig 11 it can be seen from the figure that in early april 2019 the thaw event began in the southeast then the southwest and finally the north the whole alaska thawed by the middle of may because the northeast froze first and thawed last it had the longest frozen period to analyze the seasonal variation of the freeze thaw transition process from august 2015 to august 2019 we counted the percentage of the frozen area in the study area at the beginning of each month the average land surface temperature data is used for auxiliary analysis as shown in fig 12 the annual trend is approximately the same from 2015 to 2019 the thawed period is relatively stable from early june to early september and the frozen period is stable from early december to early march as can be seen this trend is similar to seasonal variation in temperature the average temperature from june to september generally stays above 5 while the temperature from december to march of the following year generally stays around 20 to 10 the freezing process usually occurs from october to november while the thawing process mostly occurs from april to may accordingly october is the month in which the average temperature begins to turn negative while the average temperature in april is near zero during the study period the thawing process started at a faster rate in 2019 this is because the average temperature in march 2019 was above 10 which was significantly higher than before then the spatial variation of the freeze thaw cycle during 2015 2019 is further analyzed the freezing onsets all occurred in doy 255 315 and their spatial distribution is shown in fig 13 the freezing onsets in the northeast have remained in the early range probably due to the polar climate and the adjacence of the arctic ocean which makes there wet and cold conversely the freezing onsets in the southwest are the latest which may be related to the low latitude and low altitude in 2015 the freezing onsets of the southwest are generally late the thawing onsets all occurred in doy 70 145 and their spatial distribution is shown in fig 14 the thawing onsets are generally late and stable in the north on the contrary the thawing onsets is early in the mid south probably due to the high population density which makes it vulnerable to human activities in 2019 the thawing onsets of the mid south are extremely early in a wide range the lengths of the frozen period were 135 245 days and their spatial distribution is shown in fig 15 the northeast always had a long frozen period while the southwest and mid south had a relatively shorter frozen period during 2018 2019 the south was prone to see a short frozen period on a large scale in summary the freeze thaw cycle has a strong correlation with latitude the frozen period is generally longer in higher latitudes and the freeze thaw cycle in the northeast is relatively stable 4 3 discussion this study proves that the combination of smap and ascat can effectively improve the accuracy of f t onset detection because active and passive microwave remote sensing data can provide complementary information under different vegetation cover and snow cover conditions the combination of the two remote sensing data can achieve higher accuracy of f t onset detection than using a single product for monitoring the application of machine learning is helpful for combining multi source data compared with traditional methods machine learning can better model the complex freeze thaw cycle however the accuracy of this method also depends on the spatial distribution of samples the method can also be extended to a larger area of the tundra through a wider distribution of site specific calibration which will contribute to a better understanding of the freeze thaw cycle in addition the method could be enhanced by using more data to support more robust modeling considering the influence of land cover types on accuracy machine learning modeling for each land cover type may be a more beneficial way the ability to determine the seasonal f t onset is important to improve the understanding of the climate pattern and the associated climate feedback in this paper the temporal and spatial variation of the freeze thaw cycle in alaska in recent years are analyzed which helps us to have a more accurate grasp of the phenological information of the cryosphere but the time series used here is too short to make a robust analysis of the overall trend longer time series can support deeper correlation analysis and predict future changes of the freeze thaw cycle from a long term trend thus we could make an early response to environmental changes in cold regions consider that late freezing and early melting events of the soil are always caused by extreme weather events such as el nino the temporal and spatial distribution of the f t onset obtained in this study may provide a relevant measurement for the prediction of extreme weather with a more accurate record we could improve the ability to monitor ongoing changes in vulnerable areas 5 conclusions in this study the machine learning algorithm is applied to the near surface f t onset detection giving full play to the complementary advantages of multi source remote sensing data we use passive microwave data from smap and active microwave data from ascat as remote sensing data sources and improve accuracy through the rf based combination which provides a new scheme for near surface f t retrieval compared with the traditional method combining active and passive microwave data the rf based method can effectively improve the retrieval accuracy specially in freezing onset detection r increases from 0 58 to 0 77 mae decreases from 9 52 days to 7 21 days and rmse decreases from 12 17 days to 8 78 days for thawing onset detection r increases from 0 60 to 0 81 mae decreases from 13 09 days to 8 73 days and rmse decreases from 16 78 days to 10 84 days as a result the overall accuracy increases from 93 74 to 95 31 finally the proposed rf based f t onset detection model is used to forecast the freeze thaw cycle of the whole study area the distribution shows that the freeze thaw cycle is closely related to latitude there is still room for further study on the one hand with the deepening of research on frozen soil it can be considered to add more model parameters related to frozen soil so as to improve the accuracy of the model prediction on the other hand we can also combine the radiometer data with radar data to further improve spatial resolution although the temporal resolution of the radar is far inferior to that of the scatterometer spatiotemporal fusion with radiometer data can achieve finer mapping with high temporal resolution the seasonal f t transition is spatially heterogeneous so high spatial resolution and high revisiting rate are necessary to capture the characteristics of the f t state more accurately the introduction of high resolution remote sensing data is helpful to obtain finer landscape scale surface states later the idea proposed can be applied to remote sensing data with longer time series so as to reveal the long term change of the freeze thaw cycle and better understand the impact of el nino on the freeze thaw cycle this will help to continuously quantify the interaction between the climate and the freeze thaw cycle we hope that the proposed f t onset detection approach combining the multi source satellite data based on machine learning can provide more accurate data

3762,land subsidence due to groundwater extraction is increasingly becoming a major scientific and societal issue in this study alos 1 2007 10 and sentinel 1 nov 2014 19 datasets are utilized to compute vertical land subsidence in the national capital region ncr of india two major subsidence zones located in dwarka 12 km2 and gurgaon 1 km2 area showing subsidence rate up to 6 0 cm year are observed during 2007 10 between nov 2014 19 while a substantial reduction in the size by 6 km2 and subsidence rate by 3 cm year is observed for the zone in dwarka significant enlargement by 11 km2 and enhanced subsidence rate by 5 cm year are observed for the zone in gurgaon an emerging subsidence zone 4 5 km2 subsiding at 3 6 cm year is also detected in the faridabad area the deceleration of subsidence in the dwarka area is due to stabilization of groundwater level post 2014 residual compaction of the aquifer system in the dwarka area halted after sept 2016 and at present it shows elastic deformation in gurgaon and faridabad dominantly negative linear trends in vertical displacement lack of seasonal signals and ongoing groundwater depletion indicate continuous inelastic deformation of the aquifer system the preferential disposition of subsidence zones on the western part of delhi ridge indicates a dominantly confined aquifer system and aquifer compartmentalization by the delhi ridge results presented here demonstrate that precise subsidence monitoring is vital to identify hotspots of groundwater exploitation analyze aquifer characteristics at higher resolution and prepare

unesco 2017 spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar has emerged as an effective rapid and cost effective technique for measuring land subsidence at spatial resolutions of few meters and temporal resolution of days to months simons and rosen 2007 in recent times insar techniques have been utilized to study land subsidence due to excessive groundwater extraction in some of the major cities in the world miller et al 2017 miller and shirzaei 2015 erban et al 2014 cigna et al 2012 chatterjee et al 2006 amelung et al 1999 apart from monitoring land subsidence associated with aquifer system compaction insar based measurements of subsidence have helped identify groundwater flow barrier aquifer extent and mapping of recharge areas e g hu et al 2018 hoffmann et al 2003 bawden

estimation of aquifer storage parameters and prediction of the hydraulic head chen et al 2016 chaussard et al 2014 reeves et al 2014 however such estimates particularly aquifer storage parameters require concurrent groundwater level and subsidence data which unfortunately is not available in most data scarce parts of the world including the study area recent studies have shown potentials for the integrated use of insar and gravity recovery and climate experiment grace datasets for supporting and assessing groundwater management practices e g castellazzi et al 2017 castellazzi et al 2016 national capital region ncr of india is a very rapidly developing urban conglomerate and has a population of 46 1 million according to the 2011 census estimate the requirement of water for domestic and industrial usage has created enormous pressure on groundwater resources and has already stressed the aquifer system previous studies based on gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites had shown alarming levels of groundwater depletion in north western india and indo gangetic plain including delhi and surroundings areas soni and syed 2015 rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 while these regional studies are very effective for overall resource assessment it lacks the spatial resolve to isolate small scale heterogeneities which are crucial for identifying hot spots and sustainable groundwater development hence insar based monitoring of land subsidence due to groundwater extraction can form the basis for actionable information required to monitor and regulate groundwater resources by water managers and stakeholders although insar has been widely used to characterize surface deformation due to groundwater extraction in several parts of the world such detailed studies are very limited in the indian context those that exists are more primarily focussed on the identification of subsidence zones e g suganthi and elango 2020 chatterjee et al 2006 and do not investigate the temporal evolution and nature of deformation in response to groundwater extraction in the present study we use insar to measure the time series of vertical displacement in ncr over the periods of 2007 10 and nov 2014 19 to identify regions most significantly affected by subsidence these deformation estimates are analyzed in the context of limited observations of groundwater level to ascertain the causes of subsidence and their spatiotemporal variations further we study the temporal behaviour of surface deformation during nov 2014 19 to characterize the nature of aquifer deformation 2 study area the study area is part of the indo gangetic alluvial plain fig 1 and drained by the yamuna river which flows from northwest to southeast following the natural slope of 0 4 m km elevation of the region varies from 205 m in flood plains of yamuna river to 250 m in parts of delhi ridge the area receives a majority of the rainfall 81 during the monsoon period july september while the rest of the rainfall is spread throughout the year physiographically the study area can be divided into four major geomorphic units i delhi ridge ii alluvial plains on the eastern and western side of the ridge iii yamuna floodplains and iv chattarpur alluvial basin kaul and pandit 2004 the delhi ridge a regional coaxially folded anticlinal structure is plunging southeast consists of fractured quartzites of the proterozoic era with interbedded mica schists and acts as a basement cgwb 2006 on the western and eastern side of the ridge older alluviums are present while younger alluvium occupies the flood plains of yamuna river the chattarpur alluvial basin located on the eastern part of the ridge is a closed alluvial basin and consists of alluvium derived from the adjacent ridge the delhi ridge acts as a major watershed divide and runoff generated east of ridge drains to the yamuna river while runoff generated on the western side is directed towards regional depressions the occurrence of groundwater is mainly limited to alluvial aquifers two major water bearing horizons comprising of coarse grained sand and kankar local name for calcareous concretions mixed small gravels occur at 30 35 and 115 120 m below ground level mbgl in older alluviums chatterjee et al 2009 in chattarpur alluvial basin bed rock quartzite is overlain by silt clay and varying proportion of

multi temporal insar analysis insar processing uses coherent radar signals of the same area acquired at different periods to derive high resolution surface deformation estimates along the line of sight los of the satellite simons and rosen 2007 as a part of insar processing a stack of coregistered multi looked interferograms are generated from an ensemble of sar scenes using the isce software rosen et al 2012 topographic phase contributions modeled using shuttle radar topographic mission srtm digital elevation model farr et al 2007 are removed from each interferogram random phase noise of the interferograms is reduced using an adaptive phase filter goldstein and werner 1998 and the resulting interferograms are then phase unwrapped using statistical cost network flow algorithm for phase unwrapping snaphu tool chen and zebker 2000 time series of surface deformation at the pixel level is computed using the miami insar time series software in python mintpy yunjun et al 2019 this software integrates a large number of interferograms using the small baseline subset sbas technique doin et al 2011 berardino et al 2002 the sbas technique enables a detailed analysis of the temporal evolution of deformation in an area the technique integrates a large number of multilooked unwrapped interferograms which are separated by short temporal and spatial baseline to retrieve the time series of surface deformation usai 2003 lundgren et al 2001 the tropospheric contributions in interferograms for both alos 1 and sentinel 1 due to vertical stratification and turbulent mixing are reduced by computing the path delays from era5 european centre for medium range weather forecasts model hersbach et al 2020 the reference pixel is selected within the region which showed high temporal coherence 0 85 located in a stable area and at the same elevation as the area of interest and is not strongly affected by troposphere and ionosphere induced path delays phase ramps caused by topographic residuals orbital error and remaining atmospheric contributions are removed by fitting quadratic and linear ramps for alos 1 and sentinel 1 respectively the phase due to errors in the digital elevation model is directly proportional to the perpendicular baseline history of the sar acquisitions which introduces biases in the time series of deformation this bias is corrected by modelling the phase due to errors in the digital elevation model in temporal domain utilizing phase velocity history fattahi and amelung 2013 alos 1 interferograms exceeding the perpendicular baseline of 2 5 km which is approximately half the critical baseline are not included in the analysis as they may lead to geometrical decorrelation the perpendicular baseline for all the sentinel 1 interferograms 200 m is well under the critical perpendicular baseline requirement for c band finally after discarding the interferograms based on perpendicular baselines we use 106 and 475 interferograms generated from alos 1 and sentinel 1 scenes respectively to generate surface deformation time series at 90 meter spatial resolution the temporal coherence of 0 7 is used to avoid the pixels with unwrapping errors the derived surface displacement is sensitive to line of sight los of the satellite and is referred to as los displacement however polar orbiting satellites are not sensitive to the north south component of surface displacement and there is no evidence of significant east west displacement in the study area hence los displacements obtained earlier are converted to vertical displacement by dividing it by the cosine of incidence angle it is to be noted that alos 1 and sentinel 1 surface displacement time series could not be connected as they do not share any common time period average vertical velocity is computed by dividing the cumulative vertical displacement with the temporal duration of datasets since ground based measurements are not available for our study area we cannot quantify the uncertainty in our deformation estimates instead we compute a pseudo uncertainty estimate by evaluating the standard deviation of vertical displacement observed in pixels located within a radius of 3 km of relatively stable regions located away from known subsidence zones our estimate of pseudo uncertainty in subsidence values obtained from alos 1 is 1 46 cm year and for those derived using sentinel 1 dataset is 1 15 cm year these pseudo uncertainty estimates are also in close agreement with those in previous studies conducted elsewhere e g smith and li 2021 4 results 4 1 vertical displacement of land surface shown in fig 2 are the rates of vertical displacement vertical velocity in cm year derived from alos 1 a and sentinel 1 b datasets for the period 2007 10 and nov 2014 19 respectively by convention negative values of vertical velocity depicts the rate at which subsidence occurs shown in shades of red upliftment zones positive vertical velocity are shown in shades of blue regions outside the sharply defined subsidence zones seen in lighter shades show inconsiderable vertical velocity ranging between 0 78 to 1 2 cm year which are within the pseudo uncertainty estimated for alos 1 1 46 cm year and sentinel 1 1 15 cm year such small vertical velocities are most likely caused by spatiotemporal variations in scattering properties of surfaces and residual atmospheric artifacts introducing errors in the range 0 5 1 0 cm year erban et al 2014 here we assume the regions within our pseudo uncertainty estimate to be nearly stable the areas devoid of any displacement measurements are regions where temporal correlation is lost due to changing land cover vegetation types during the period 2007 10 two prominent subsidence zones located east of dwarka and around gurgaon are seen in fig 2a the subsidence zone near dwarka is approximately 4 km long and 3 km wide with vertical velocities varying between 2 5 and 6 0 cm year the subsidence zone near gurgaon is of a relatively smaller dimension 1 km 1 km but shows an equally high vertical velocity of 1 5 to 6 0 cm year between nov 2014 19 the spatial extent of the subsidence zone near dwarka reduced to 2 5 2 5 km and concomitantly its vertical velocity ranging from 1 5 to 2 0 cm year contrastingly the subsidence zone in gurgaon expanded to 3 km 4 km in dimension and the velocity also increased significantly to about 1 6 to 11 5 cm year the other minor subsidence zones located in the vicinity of gurgaon are relatively smaller 1 0 km 1 0 km in size and show vertical velocity in the range of 2 0 to 5 5 cm year the subsidence zone near faridabad has an expanse of 3 x1 5 km with vertical velocities ranging from 1 6 to 3 6 cm year in the following sections the causative factors spatiotemporal variations and nature of subsidence are discussed for each of these subsidence zones 4 2 analysis of subsidence in dwarka area 4 2 1 vertical displacement versus groundwater level in order to ascertain the causative factors of subsidence we analyze groundwater level datasets shown in fig 3 a and b are the locations of groundwater observation wells in the vicinity of the noted subsidence zones for the period 2007 2019 since no groundwater observation well is located within the zones of maximum subsidence analysis of groundwater level and corresponding vertical displacement is limited to observation wells located in the proximity of subsidence zones fig 3 c f shows the time series of groundwater level measurements for the observation wells at dwarka dw c mayapuri mp d and vikaspuri vp e and janakpuri jp f the vertical displacement from alos 1 and sentinel 1 corresponding to 2007 10 and nov 2014 19 are also shown here vertical displacement around each observation well is calculated as the average displacement value of all the pixels lying within a 500 m radius of the observation well this approach is adopted for all the inter comparisons between groundwater level and vertical displacement discussed in the subsequent sections to quantitatively assess the relationship between groundwater level and vertical displacement we interpolate the groundwater level measurements to time stamps at which vertical displacement estimates are available correlation coefficients computed for temporally collocated groundwater level and vertical displacement show the highest value for mayapuri 0 68 followed by dwarka 0 55 janakpuri 0 53 and vikaspuri 0 32 p value 0 05 for all the wells for the period 2007 10 alos 1 observation period during nov 2014 19 sentinel 1 observation period the highest value of correlation coefficient is noted for mayapuri 0 77 followed by dwarka 0 75 vikaspuri 0 58 and janakpuri 0 24 with a p value of 0 05 for both the observation periods 2007 10 and nov 2014 19 the deeper wells mayapuri and dwarka in which groundwater level varies between 18 and 40 m bgl show a higher correlation compared to the shallower wells the observation well vikaspuri show poor correlation during 2007 10 when groundwater was shallow 10 m bgl however the correlation improved during nov 2014 19 wherein groundwater level dropped up to 18 m bgl hence the average correlation coefficient between groundwater level and vertical displacement is significantly higher 0 72 for relatively deeper wells such as dwarka and mayapuri in comparison to shallower wells 0 28 these observations suggest that the observed subsidence zones may be related to groundwater pumping from relatively deeper levels of the earth s subsurface as noted earlier the spatial extent of subsidence zones near dwarka shows a marked difference between 2007 10 and nov 2014 19 the plausible cause of the reduction in magnitude and extent of subsidence zone during nov 2014 19 is investigated by computing the rates of groundwater level fluctuation in each well for 2007 14 and nov 2014 19 further the same can be used to compare the pre and post nov 2014 changes in groundwater level trend the three observation wells dwarka mayapuri and vikaspuri show a decline in groundwater level at a rate of 1 15 0 66 and 0 78 m year negative sign for declining groundwater level respectively for the period 2007 14 during nov 2014 19 groundwater level declined at a reduced rate in dwarka 0 42 m year and mayapuri 0 33 m year while in vikaspuri the groundwater level shows an increasing trend 1 m year given the limitations mentioned earlier we consider the trend in groundwater levels of nearby monitoring wells to represent the general trend of groundwater level in and around the subsidence zone based on this consideration we can infer that reduction in the rate of groundwater level decline post nov 2014 as the most probable cause for the prominent decrease in the spatial extent as well as in the magnitude of subsidence in the dwarka area 4 2 2 time series vertical displacement dense time series datasets available from sentinel 1 for nov 2014 19 are investigated to understand the temporal behavior of vertical displacement for the subsidence zone near dwarka marked in fig 3b are the locations of the sample points considered for the study of temporal variations in vertical displacement fig 4 a the temporal profiles for all the points d1 d2 and d3 representing the lower and middle and upper parts of the subsidence zone show a rapid declining trend until sept 2016 subsequently a clear upward trend is noted for d2 and d3 while point d1 shows signs of stabilization this complex non linear temporal behavior of vertical displacement is modelled by fitting two linear models the slope of first linear model captures the declining trend of vertical displacement until sept 2016 while the second one models the stabilizing upward trend as observed in the temporal profiles after sept 2016 also evident are significant variations in the spatio temporal pattern of vertical displacement within the subsidence zones fig 4b and c for example the lowermost part of the subsidence zone fig 4b shows a vertical velocity of 6 5 cm year until sept 2016 which stabilized after sept 2016 on the contrary the uppermost region which shows moderate subsidence with velocity reaching up to 3 25 cm year until sept 2016 fig 4b shows feeble upliftment 1 cm year fig 4c after sept 2016 although the groundwater level in nearby observation wells shows stabilizing trend post 2014 the continuation of subsidence until sept 2016 can be attributed to equilibration of hydraulic heads of aquifers with neighboring aquitard units groundwater extraction leads to a differential decline in pore pressure in the underlying aquifer and overlying aquitard units which leads to the development of a hydraulic gradient between the aquitard and aquifer units hence subsidence continues till an equilibrium is attained between the aquifer and aquitard units a process known as residual compaction ojha et al 2020 bell et al 2008 4 3 analysis of subsidence in gurgaon area the subsidence zone near gurgaon which has a relatively smaller spatial extent 1 km x1 km during the 2007 10 time period fig 5 a show a significant enlargement 2 5 km 3 5 km in extent between nov 2014 19 fig 5b this increase in spatial extent is also accompanied by an enhanced subsidence rate which increased by an average of 4 cm year during the entire study period apart from the existing subsidence zones few emerging but prominent subsidence zones located south of the major subsidence zone of relatively smaller 1 0 1 0 km spatial extent and vertical velocity 2 0 to 4 5 cm year are also noted the relationship between vertical displacement and groundwater level variations is studied for the gu well since no observation well is located within the subsidence zone fig 5b groundwater level observations are relatively stable during 2007 10 alos 1 observation period which is also reflected in vertical displacements estimates using alos 1 fig 5c after 2014 a steady decline of 2 m year in groundwater level is noted which is replicated to a certain degree by the vertical displacement measured using sentinel 1 the trend estimate for vertical displacement for nov 2014 19 is 0 2 cm year overall the fluctuations in groundwater level and time series of vertical displacement are in good agreement suggesting groundwater extraction as the primary cause of subsidence the time series of vertical displacement for two representative points located at the center g1 and periphery g2 of the subsidence zone is shown in fig 5d the cumulative magnitude of vertical displacement reaches up to 45 cm and 11 cm for the central and peripheral parts respectively during nov 2014 19 both the temporal profiles show linear variations in vertical displacement to assess the presence of seasonality in the time series we fit two functions one having only linear terms a t c and the other with both linear and seasonal terms a t a s i n 2 œÄ t b c o s 2 œÄ t c here a is the slope of the linear model t represents time a 2 b 2 is the amplitude of the seasonal signal and c accounts for constant shift in model due interferometric noises and artefacts the latter model consisting of both seasonal and linear terms shows a decrease in residuals compared to the linear model but this may be due to more number of free parameters subsequently an f test statistic menke 2018 gonz√°lez and fern√°ndez 2011 is computed to check whether the decrease in residuals is due to fitting of noise in the data or an accurate representation of inherent variability the f test shows that the decrease in residual due to the addition of seasonal term is not statistically significant this result indicates that the seasonal signals cannot be distinguished from noise in the vertical displacement time series further isolating low amplitude order of few mm seasonal signals from residual tropospheric noise is challenging in the study area as the timing of recharge primarily during the monsoon period june september is coincident with high water vapor variability in the troposphere above the study area therefore we assume that there are no significant seasonal signals the dominance of linear variation clearly indicates continuous groundwater extraction and consequent inelastic deformation 4 4 analysis of subsidence in faridabad area during 2007 10 no significant subsidence is observed around faridabad fig 6 a however after nov 2014 a major subsidence zone with a vertical velocity ranging from 1 65 to 3 6 cm year is observed over an extent of 3 km 1 5 km since no observation well exists within the subsidence zone groundwater level measurements and collocated time series of vertical displacement available for a nearby observation well p1 are studied fig 6b and c time series of groundwater levels indicate that the area has witnessed a steady decline of groundwater level till 2014 the time series of vertical displacement is not available for 2007 10 alos time period due to loss of coherence thus hindering its analysis with groundwater level post 2014 groundwater level declined in p1 at a very steep rate 8 m year and is fairly manifested in the collocated time series of vertical displacement obtained from sentinel 1 for nov 2014 19 fig 6c time series of vertical displacement derived from sentinel 1for the regions surrounding the two representative points located at the center f1 and periphery f2 of the subsidence zone is shown in fig 6d the magnitude of cumulative vertical displacement during the five years is 7 cm and 1 5 cm for f1 and f2 respectively here also similar to gurgaon the temporal profiles clearly show a linear progression of deformation and the lack of significant seasonal effect indicating inelastic deformation of the aquifer system 5 discussions 5 1 subsidence caused by groundwater extraction the rapid subsidence observed in this study area cannot be attributed to natural compaction the subsidence rate negative vertical velocity due to natural compaction due to superincumbent pressure is only in the order of a few mm year teatini et al 2011 in addition the rates and spatial distribution of subsidence shown here correlate well with the observed patterns of declining stabilizing groundwater levels therefore we can conclude that groundwater extraction for domestic meet the requirement of urban population and industrial purposes is the primary cause of land subsidence observed here 5 2 mechanism of subsidence there exist strong links between groundwater extraction and surface subsidence both in terms of trend and spatial distributions the vertical displacement due to fluctuations in the hydraulic head is explained by the aquitard drainage model chaussard et al 2014 lowering of hydraulic head in a confined aquifer leads to a decrease in pore pressure in the aquifer system and a proportional increase in effective vertical stress which leads to subsidence the mechanism of land surface subsidence caused by groundwater may vary from place to place owing to variations in groundwater pumping rate natural recharge the thickness of compressible materials and pre consolidation stress during 2007 10 the subsidence zone in the dwarka region was mainly due to excessive groundwater extraction however the subsidence halted during nov 2014 19 time frame in response to the stabilization of groundwater levels similarly the steep decline in groundwater level during nov 2014 19 in the gurgaon region led to increased subsidence rate and enlargement of subsidence zone compared to its magnitude and extent in 2007 10 in the wake of declining groundwater levels after 2014 a new subsidence zone is also detected west of faridabad it is also important to note that the subsidence and decline in groundwater levels do not show any time lag in gurgaon and faridabad in the dwarka region the subsidence continued till sept 2016 even after no appreciable decline in groundwater level is noted in the nearby observation wells fig 3c f in fact during nov 2014 16 these observation wells show signs of stabilization in groundwater levels thus the rapid subsidence in dwarka which continued till sept 2016 maybe due to residual or delayed compaction experienced by the aquifer system even after the groundwater levels have stopped declining shirzaei et al 2019 miller et al 2017 this behavior occurs due to the equilibration of the hydraulic head in the aquifer and neighboring aquitard units smith et al 2017 the time taken for the equilibration and subsequent termination of subsidence depends mainly on the hydraulic conductivity and thickness of aquitard units schmidt and b√ºrgmann 2003 delayed compaction as a major cause of transient non linear behavior of subsidence was also reported earlier by miller et al 2017 shirzaei et al 2017 and gonz√°lez and fern√°ndez 2011 the possibility that groundwater extraction and halting of subsidence are coterminous is improbable since the region is dominated by clay layers cgwb 2016b hence instant equilibration of aquifer hydraulic head with neighbouring aquitard units seems implausible that residual compaction ceased post sept 2016 and vertical displacement estimates are either stabilizing or revealing trends of upliftment suggests that the inelastic deformation phase is over and the underlying aquifer is behaving elastically at present in contrast to the non linear temporal behavior of the subsidence region in dwarka the subsidence zones of the gurgaon and faridabad region show a dominantly linear behavior with a negligible seasonal component long term records of groundwater level from existing monitoring wells show the lowest values of groundwater level since the start of monitoring suggesting inelastic deformation of the aquifer system this type of deformation invariably leads to non reversible rearrangement of grains wilson and gorelick 1996 and permanent loss of aquifer storage smith and knight 2019 chaussard et al 2014 hoffmann et al 2003 poland and ireland 1988 processes like this have serious consequences for freshwater water availability and compel immediate supply or demand side interventions to restrict the aquifer deformation to elastic range only chaussard et al 2017 bell et al 2008 hoffmann et al 2001 5 3 compartmentalisation of aquifer system the major subsidence zones near dwarka gurgaon and several minor and emerging subsidence zones are located on the western side of the delhi ridge fig 2 in contrast no prominent subsidence zone is observed on the eastern side between the ridge and yamuna river suggesting possible compartmentalization of the underlying aquifer system by delhi ridge as the distribution of subsidence zones is a good indicator of the presence of confined aquifers schmidt and b√ºrgmann 2003 and the presence of compressible deposits amelung et al 1999 it can be inferred that confined aquifers are more frequent on the western side of the ridge than the eastern side this inference is also supported by the depth to bedrock estimates which is significantly greater 80 170 m on the western side of the ridge cgwb 2016b than the eastern side 9 2 80 m further the aquifers on the eastern side of the ridge are sand dominated while clay silt and kankar dominate the aquifers on the western side cgwb 2016b thus it is evident that the aquifers located on the eastern and western side of the ridge are different in terms of alluvium thickness the proportion of fine grained material and govern the spatial distribution of subsidence zones the delhi ridge comprised of hard and resistant folded quartzite acts as a groundwater divide rainfall on the eastern side is channelized towards the yamuna river following the regional slope while it enters the natural depressions on the western side since groundwater also follows the regional slope the direction of groundwater flow is opposite on both sides of the ridge kumar et al 2011 thus the delhi ridge effectuates compartmentalization of aquifers on either side 5 4 lack of seasonal effect insar derived time series of vertical displacementhas been successfully utilized to characterize the seasonal deformation of aquifer systems due to annual recharge and pumping smith and li 2021 riel et al 2018 bell et al 2008 lanari et al 2004 hoffmann et al 2001 for the ncr the insar derived subsidence do not show any prominent seasonal signals this indicates that there may be no significant lateral variations in pore pressure of the aquifer system at seasonal time scales similar to central mexico chaussard et al 2021 chaussard et al 2013 osmanoƒülu et al 2011 the most likely reason behind the lack of significant seasonal signal is the relentless non periodic groundwater pumping to meet the urban and industrial needs of the region alternatively no pumping is taking place in the regions where aquifers are expected to behave elastically in the case of non periodic continuous pumping even groundwater inflow from the surrounding aquifer or in situ recharge may not lead to a significant seasonal rebound of the aquifer as extraction exceeds recharge in such scenarios the subsidence zones gurgaon and faridabad area are undergoing inelastic deformation it is more likely that long term linear signals will dominate the seasonal signals smith and knight 2019 sneed 2001 in these regions further low magnitude seasonal signal in the order of a few mm due to in situ recharge or inflow from the surrounding aquifer s cannot be distinguished from residual tropospheric noise fattahi and amelung 2015 since both are temporally collocated the period of recharge monsoon period also happens to be the period with the highest variability in the water vapor content of the troposphere the lack of local seasonal signals however does not preclude the presence of regional seasonal vertical displacementswhich have been recorded in the indo gangetic plain by continuous global positioning system stations cgps saji et al 2020 the seasonal amplitude in the data obtained from the cgps station located in ncr liaa operating from 2019 onwards is 4 to 5 mm http geodesy unr edu nglstationpages stations liaa sta large amounts of rainfall during the monsoon period are a major source of hydrological mass change in the indo gangetic plain and are considered the dominant cause of basin wide seasonal uplift and subsidence chanard et al 2014 bettinelli et al 2008 such regional seasonal displacements are associated with movements of the reference point and can t be detected by insar which is a relative measurement technique 6 conclusions the present study analyses land subsidence measured over the ncr in india using insar time series datasets obtained from alos 1 and sentinel 1 satellites two notable subsidence zones located in the vicinity of dwarka and gurgaon are detected during 2007 10 while an additional subsidence zone located near faridabad is detected during nov 2014 19 the spatiotemporal analysis reveal stabilization of subsidence zone near dwarka post sept 2016 while the subsidence zones near gurgaon increased significantly in spatial extent as well as in the rate of subsidence as compared to 2007 10 results reveal that the stabilization of subsidence near dwarka is attributed to the reduction in groundwater extraction post nov 2014 and changes in the deformation phase of the aquifer from inelastic to elastic on the contrary the subsidence zones near gurgaon and faridabad continue to grow with no signs of stabilization the continuing inelastic deformation noted here is causing permanent loss of storage and is detrimental to the groundwater potential of the area the present study demonstrates the use of insar based time series of vertical displacement to map the subsidence affected regions and understand the aquifer behavior in the densely populated ncr region it is important to note that the high spatial and temporal resolution of the surface displacement measurements helped decipher the contrasting deformation behavior of dwarka and gurgaon regions located nearby the results presented here also highlight the potential of insar to capture the heterogeneity in land subsidence due to varying groundwater extraction rates the degree of details achieved here is almost impossible with other satellite or sparse ground based observational networks monitoring the shallow aquifers therefore the capabilities of insar to monitor storage variations of deeper confined aquifers can complement the existing network of groundwater monitoring wells to provide an integrated assessment of groundwater resources especially in the data scarce regions of the world it is expected that increasing groundwater demand and lack of natural recharge may increase the areal extent and the magnitude of the documented subsidence zones and continuous monitoring of its spatiotemporal evolution is essential hence this study will provide information at space time scales crucial for water managers and urban planners for devising actionable groundwater management plans to minimize the ongoing subsidence and mitigate

3762,land subsidence due to groundwater extraction is increasingly becoming a major scientific and societal issue in this study alos 1 2007 10 and sentinel 1 nov 2014 19 datasets are utilized to compute vertical land subsidence in the national capital region ncr of india two major subsidence zones located in dwarka 12 km2 and gurgaon 1 km2 area showing subsidence rate up to 6 0 cm year are observed during 2007 10 between nov 2014 19 while a substantial reduction in the size by 6 km2 and subsidence rate by 3 cm year is observed for the zone in dwarka significant enlargement by 11 km2 and enhanced subsidence rate by 5 cm year are observed for the zone in gurgaon an emerging subsidence zone 4 5 km2 subsiding at 3 6 cm year is also detected in the faridabad area the deceleration of subsidence in the dwarka area is due to stabilization of groundwater level post 2014 residual compaction of the aquifer system in the dwarka area halted after sept 2016 and at present it shows elastic deformation in gurgaon and faridabad dominantly negative linear trends in vertical displacement lack of seasonal signals and ongoing groundwater depletion indicate continuous inelastic deformation of the aquifer system the preferential disposition of subsidence zones on the western part of delhi ridge indicates a dominantly confined aquifer system and aquifer compartmentalization by the delhi

unesco 2017 spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar has emerged as an effective rapid and cost effective technique for measuring land subsidence at spatial resolutions of few meters

major cities in the world miller et al 2017 miller and shirzaei 2015 erban et al 2014 cigna et al 2012 chatterjee et al 2006 amelung et al 1999 apart from monitoring land subsidence associated with aquifer system compaction insar based measurements of subsidence have helped identify groundwater flow barrier aquifer extent and mapping of recharge areas e g hu et al 2018 hoffmann et al 2003 bawden

estimation of aquifer storage parameters and prediction of the hydraulic head chen et al 2016 chaussard et al 2014 reeves et al 2014 however such estimates particularly aquifer storage parameters require concurrent groundwater level and subsidence data which unfortunately is not available in most data scarce parts of the world including the study area recent studies have shown potentials for the integrated use of insar and gravity recovery and climate experiment grace datasets for supporting and assessing groundwater management practices e g castellazzi et al 2017 castellazzi et al 2016 national capital region ncr of india is a very rapidly developing urban conglomerate and has a population of 46 1 million according to the 2011 census estimate the requirement of water for domestic and industrial usage has created enormous pressure on groundwater resources and has already stressed the aquifer system previous studies based on gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites had shown alarming levels of groundwater depletion in north western india and indo gangetic plain including delhi and surroundings areas soni and syed 2015 rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 while these regional studies are very effective for overall resource assessment it lacks the spatial resolve to isolate small scale heterogeneities which are crucial for identifying hot spots and sustainable groundwater development hence insar based monitoring of land subsidence due to groundwater extraction can form the basis for actionable information required to monitor and regulate groundwater resources by water managers and stakeholders although insar has been widely used to characterize surface deformation due to groundwater extraction in several parts of the world such detailed studies are very limited in the indian context those that exists are more primarily focussed on the identification of subsidence zones e g suganthi and elango 2020 chatterjee et al 2006 and do not investigate the temporal evolution and nature of deformation in response to groundwater extraction in the present study we use insar to measure the time series of vertical displacement in ncr over the periods of 2007 10 and nov 2014 19 to identify regions most significantly affected by subsidence these deformation estimates are analyzed in the context of limited observations of groundwater level to ascertain the causes of subsidence and their spatiotemporal variations further we study the temporal behaviour of surface deformation during nov 2014 19 to characterize the nature of aquifer deformation 2 study area the study area is part of the indo gangetic alluvial plain fig 1 and drained by the yamuna river which flows from northwest to southeast following the natural slope of 0 4 m km elevation of the region varies from 205 m in flood plains of yamuna river to 250 m in parts of delhi ridge the area receives a majority of the rainfall 81 during the monsoon period july september while the rest of the rainfall is spread throughout the year physiographically the study area can be divided into four major geomorphic units i delhi ridge ii alluvial plains on the eastern and western side of the ridge iii yamuna floodplains and iv chattarpur alluvial basin kaul and pandit 2004 the delhi ridge a regional coaxially folded anticlinal structure is plunging southeast consists of fractured quartzites of the proterozoic era with interbedded mica schists and acts as a basement cgwb 2006 on the western and eastern side of the ridge older alluviums are present while younger alluvium occupies the flood plains of yamuna river the chattarpur alluvial basin located on the eastern part of the ridge is a closed alluvial basin and consists of alluvium derived from the adjacent ridge the delhi ridge acts as a major watershed divide and runoff generated east of ridge drains to the yamuna river while runoff generated on the western side is directed towards regional depressions

software integrates a large number of interferograms using the small baseline subset sbas technique doin et al 2011 berardino et al 2002 the sbas technique enables a detailed analysis of the temporal evolution of deformation in an area the technique integrates a large number of multilooked unwrapped interferograms which are separated by short temporal and spatial baseline to retrieve the time series of surface deformation usai 2003 lundgren et al 2001 the tropospheric contributions in interferograms for both alos 1 and sentinel 1 due to vertical stratification and turbulent mixing are reduced by computing the path delays from era5 european centre for medium range weather forecasts model hersbach et al 2020 the reference pixel is selected within the region which showed high temporal coherence 0 85 located in a stable area and at the same elevation as the area of interest and is not strongly affected by troposphere and ionosphere induced path delays phase ramps caused by topographic residuals orbital error and remaining atmospheric contributions are removed by fitting quadratic and linear ramps for alos 1 and sentinel 1 respectively the phase due to errors in the digital elevation model is directly proportional to the perpendicular baseline history of the sar acquisitions which introduces biases in the time series of deformation this bias is corrected by modelling the phase due to errors in the digital elevation model in temporal domain utilizing phase velocity history fattahi and amelung 2013 alos 1 interferograms exceeding the perpendicular baseline of 2 5 km which is approximately half the critical baseline are not included in the analysis as they may lead to geometrical decorrelation the perpendicular baseline for all the sentinel 1 interferograms 200 m is well under the critical perpendicular baseline requirement for c band finally after discarding the interferograms based on perpendicular baselines we use 106 and 475 interferograms generated from alos 1 and sentinel 1 scenes respectively to generate surface deformation time series at 90 meter spatial resolution the temporal coherence of 0 7 is used to avoid the pixels with unwrapping errors the derived surface displacement is sensitive to line of sight los of the satellite and is referred to as los displacement however polar orbiting satellites are not sensitive to the north south component of surface displacement and there is no evidence of significant east west displacement in the study area hence los displacements obtained earlier are converted to vertical displacement by dividing it by the cosine of incidence angle it is to be noted that alos 1 and sentinel 1 surface displacement time series could not be connected as they do not share any common time period average vertical velocity is computed by dividing the cumulative vertical displacement with the temporal duration of datasets since ground based measurements are not available for our study area we cannot quantify the uncertainty in our deformation estimates instead we compute a pseudo uncertainty estimate by evaluating the standard deviation of vertical displacement observed in pixels located within a radius of 3 km of relatively stable regions located away from known subsidence zones our estimate of pseudo uncertainty in subsidence values obtained from alos 1 is 1 46 cm year and for those derived using sentinel 1 dataset is 1 15 cm year these pseudo uncertainty estimates are also in close agreement with those in previous studies conducted elsewhere e g smith and li 2021 4 results 4 1 vertical displacement of land surface shown in fig 2 are the rates of vertical displacement vertical velocity in cm year derived from alos 1 a and sentinel 1 b datasets for the period 2007 10 and nov 2014 19 respectively by convention negative values of vertical velocity depicts the rate at which subsidence occurs shown in shades of red upliftment zones positive vertical velocity are shown in shades of blue regions outside the sharply defined subsidence zones seen in lighter shades show inconsiderable vertical velocity ranging between 0 78 to 1 2 cm year which are within the pseudo uncertainty estimated for alos 1 1 46 cm year and sentinel 1 1 15 cm year such small vertical velocities are most likely caused by spatiotemporal variations in scattering properties of surfaces and residual atmospheric artifacts introducing errors in the range 0 5 1 0 cm year erban et al 2014 here we assume the regions within our pseudo uncertainty estimate to be nearly stable the areas devoid of any displacement measurements are regions where temporal correlation is lost due to changing land cover vegetation types during the period 2007 10 two prominent subsidence zones located east of dwarka and around gurgaon are seen in fig 2a the subsidence zone near dwarka is approximately 4 km long and 3 km wide with vertical velocities varying between 2 5 and 6 0 cm year the subsidence zone near gurgaon is of a relatively smaller dimension 1 km 1 km but shows an equally high vertical velocity of 1 5 to 6 0 cm year between nov 2014 19 the spatial extent of the subsidence zone near dwarka reduced to 2 5 2 5 km and concomitantly its vertical velocity ranging from 1 5 to 2 0 cm year contrastingly the subsidence zone in gurgaon expanded to 3 km 4 km in dimension and the velocity also increased significantly to about 1 6 to 11 5 cm year the other minor subsidence zones located in the vicinity of gurgaon are relatively smaller 1 0 km 1 0 km in size and show vertical velocity in the range of 2 0 to 5 5 cm year the subsidence zone near faridabad has an expanse of 3 x1 5 km with vertical velocities ranging from 1 6 to 3 6 cm year in the following sections the causative factors spatiotemporal variations and nature of subsidence are discussed for each of these subsidence zones 4 2 analysis of subsidence in dwarka area 4 2 1 vertical displacement versus groundwater level in order to ascertain the causative factors of subsidence we analyze groundwater level datasets shown in fig 3 a and b are the locations of groundwater observation wells in the vicinity of the noted subsidence zones for the period 2007 2019 since no groundwater observation well is located within the zones of maximum subsidence analysis of groundwater level and corresponding vertical displacement is limited to observation wells located in the proximity of subsidence zones fig 3 c f shows the time series of groundwater level measurements for the observation wells at dwarka dw c mayapuri mp d and vikaspuri vp e and janakpuri jp f the vertical displacement from alos 1 and sentinel 1 corresponding to 2007 10 and nov 2014 19 are also shown here vertical displacement around each observation well is calculated as the average displacement value of all the pixels lying within a 500 m radius of the observation well this approach is adopted for all the inter comparisons between groundwater level and vertical displacement discussed in the subsequent sections to quantitatively assess the relationship between groundwater level and vertical displacement we interpolate the groundwater level measurements to time stamps at which vertical displacement estimates are available correlation coefficients computed for temporally collocated groundwater level and vertical displacement show the highest value for mayapuri 0 68 followed by dwarka 0 55 janakpuri 0 53 and vikaspuri 0 32 p value 0 05 for all the wells for the period 2007 10 alos 1 observation period during nov 2014 19 sentinel 1 observation period the highest value of correlation coefficient is noted for mayapuri 0 77 followed by dwarka 0 75 vikaspuri 0 58 and janakpuri 0 24 with a p value of 0 05 for both the observation periods 2007 10 and nov 2014 19 the deeper wells mayapuri and dwarka in which groundwater level varies between 18 and 40 m bgl show a higher correlation compared to the shallower wells the observation well vikaspuri show poor correlation during 2007 10 when groundwater was shallow 10 m bgl however the correlation improved during nov 2014 19 wherein groundwater level dropped up to 18 m bgl hence the average correlation coefficient between groundwater level and vertical displacement is significantly higher 0 72 for relatively deeper wells such as dwarka and mayapuri in comparison to shallower wells 0 28 these observations suggest that the observed subsidence zones may be related to groundwater pumping from relatively deeper levels of the earth s subsurface as noted earlier the spatial extent of subsidence zones near dwarka shows a marked difference between 2007 10 and nov 2014 19 the plausible cause of the reduction in magnitude and extent of subsidence zone during nov 2014 19 is investigated by computing the rates of groundwater level fluctuation in each well for 2007 14 and nov 2014 19 further the same can be used to compare the pre and post nov 2014 changes in groundwater level trend the three observation wells dwarka mayapuri and vikaspuri show a decline in groundwater level at a rate of 1 15 0 66 and 0 78 m year negative sign for declining groundwater level respectively for the period 2007 14 during nov 2014 19 groundwater level declined at a reduced rate in dwarka 0 42 m year and mayapuri 0 33 m year while in vikaspuri the groundwater level shows an increasing trend 1 m year given the limitations mentioned earlier we consider the trend in groundwater levels of nearby monitoring wells to represent the general trend of groundwater level in and around the subsidence zone based on this consideration we can infer that reduction in the rate of groundwater level decline post nov 2014 as the most probable cause for the prominent decrease in the spatial extent as well as in the magnitude of subsidence in the dwarka area 4 2 2 time series vertical displacement dense time series datasets available from sentinel 1 for nov 2014 19 are investigated to understand the temporal behavior of vertical displacement for the subsidence zone near dwarka marked in fig 3b are the locations of the sample points considered for the study of temporal variations in vertical displacement fig 4 a the temporal profiles for all the points d1 d2 and d3 representing the lower and middle and upper parts of the subsidence zone show a rapid declining trend until sept 2016 subsequently a clear upward trend is noted for d2 and d3 while point d1 shows signs of stabilization this complex non linear temporal behavior of vertical displacement is modelled by fitting two linear models the slope of first linear model captures the declining trend of vertical displacement until sept 2016 while the second one models the stabilizing upward trend as observed in the temporal profiles after sept 2016 also evident are significant variations in the spatio temporal pattern of vertical displacement within the subsidence zones fig 4b and c for example the lowermost part of the subsidence zone fig 4b shows a vertical velocity of 6 5 cm year until sept 2016 which stabilized after sept 2016 on the contrary the uppermost region which shows moderate subsidence with velocity reaching up to 3 25 cm year until sept 2016 fig 4b shows feeble upliftment 1 cm year fig 4c after sept 2016 although the groundwater level in nearby observation wells shows stabilizing trend post 2014 the continuation of subsidence until sept 2016 can be attributed to equilibration of hydraulic heads of aquifers with neighboring aquitard units groundwater extraction leads to a differential decline in pore pressure in the underlying aquifer and overlying aquitard units which leads to the development of a hydraulic gradient between the aquitard and aquifer units hence subsidence continues till an equilibrium is attained between the aquifer and aquitard units a process known as residual compaction ojha et al 2020 bell et al 2008 4 3 analysis of subsidence in gurgaon area the subsidence zone near gurgaon which has a relatively smaller spatial extent 1 km x1 km during the 2007 10 time period fig 5 a show a significant enlargement 2 5 km 3 5 km in extent between nov 2014 19 fig 5b this increase in spatial extent is also accompanied by an enhanced subsidence rate which increased by an average of 4 cm year during the entire study period apart from the existing subsidence zones few emerging but prominent subsidence zones located south of the major subsidence zone of relatively smaller 1 0 1 0 km spatial extent and vertical velocity 2 0 to 4 5 cm year are also noted the relationship between vertical displacement and groundwater level variations is studied for the gu well since no observation well is located within the subsidence zone fig 5b groundwater level observations are relatively stable during 2007 10 alos 1 observation period which is also reflected in vertical displacements estimates using alos 1 fig 5c after 2014 a steady decline of 2 m year in groundwater level is noted which is replicated to a certain degree by the vertical displacement measured using sentinel 1 the trend estimate for vertical displacement for nov 2014 19 is 0 2 cm year overall the fluctuations in groundwater level and time series of vertical displacement are in good agreement suggesting groundwater extraction as the primary cause of subsidence the time series of vertical displacement for two representative points located at the center g1 and periphery g2 of the subsidence zone is shown in fig 5d the cumulative magnitude of vertical displacement reaches up to 45 cm and 11 cm for the central and peripheral parts respectively during nov 2014 19 both the temporal profiles show linear variations in vertical displacement to assess the presence of seasonality in the time series we fit two functions one having only linear terms a t c and the other with both linear and seasonal terms a t a s i n 2 œÄ t b c o s 2 œÄ t c here a is the slope of the linear model t represents time a 2 b 2 is the amplitude of the seasonal signal and c accounts for constant shift in model due interferometric noises and artefacts the latter model consisting of both seasonal and linear terms shows a decrease in residuals compared to the linear model but this may be due to more number of free parameters subsequently an f test statistic menke 2018 gonz√°lez and fern√°ndez 2011 is computed to check whether the decrease in residuals is due to fitting of noise in the data or an accurate representation of inherent variability the f test shows that the decrease in residual due to the addition of seasonal term is not statistically significant this result indicates that the seasonal signals cannot be distinguished from noise in the vertical displacement time series further isolating low amplitude order of few mm seasonal signals from residual tropospheric noise is challenging in the study area as the timing of recharge primarily during the monsoon period june september is coincident with high water vapor variability in the troposphere above the study area therefore we assume that there are no significant seasonal signals the dominance of linear variation clearly indicates continuous groundwater extraction and consequent inelastic deformation 4 4 analysis of subsidence in faridabad area during 2007 10 no significant subsidence is observed around faridabad fig 6 a however after nov 2014 a major subsidence zone with a vertical velocity ranging from 1 65 to 3 6 cm year is observed over an extent of 3 km 1 5 km since no observation well exists within the subsidence zone groundwater level measurements and collocated time series of vertical displacement available for a nearby observation well p1 are studied fig 6b and c time series of groundwater levels indicate that the area has witnessed a steady decline of groundwater level till 2014 the time series of vertical displacement is not available for 2007 10 alos time period due to loss of coherence thus hindering its analysis with groundwater level post 2014 groundwater level declined in p1 at a very steep rate 8 m year and is fairly manifested in the collocated time series of vertical displacement obtained from sentinel 1 for nov 2014 19 fig 6c time series of vertical displacement derived from sentinel 1for the regions surrounding the two representative points located at the center f1 and periphery f2 of the subsidence zone is shown in fig 6d the magnitude of cumulative vertical displacement during the five years is 7 cm and 1 5 cm for f1 and f2 respectively here also similar to gurgaon the temporal profiles clearly show a linear progression of deformation and the lack of significant seasonal effect indicating inelastic deformation of the aquifer system 5 discussions 5 1 subsidence caused by groundwater extraction the rapid subsidence observed in this study area cannot be attributed to natural compaction the subsidence rate negative vertical velocity due to natural compaction due to superincumbent pressure is only in the order of a few mm year teatini et al 2011 in addition the rates and spatial distribution of subsidence shown here correlate well with the observed patterns of declining stabilizing groundwater levels therefore we can conclude that groundwater extraction for domestic meet the requirement of urban population and industrial purposes is the primary cause of land subsidence observed here 5 2 mechanism of subsidence there exist strong links between groundwater extraction and surface subsidence both in terms of trend and spatial distributions the vertical displacement due to fluctuations in the hydraulic head is explained by the aquitard drainage model chaussard et al 2014 lowering of hydraulic head in a confined aquifer leads to a decrease in pore pressure in the aquifer system and a proportional increase in effective vertical stress which leads to subsidence the mechanism of land surface subsidence caused by groundwater may vary from place to place owing to variations in groundwater pumping rate natural recharge the thickness of compressible materials and pre consolidation stress during 2007 10 the subsidence zone in the dwarka region was mainly due to excessive groundwater extraction however the subsidence halted during nov 2014 19 time frame in response to the stabilization of groundwater levels similarly the steep decline in groundwater level during nov 2014 19 in the gurgaon region led to increased subsidence rate and enlargement of subsidence zone compared to its magnitude and extent in 2007 10 in the wake of declining groundwater levels after 2014 a new subsidence zone is also detected west of faridabad it is also important to note that the subsidence and decline in groundwater levels do not show any time lag in gurgaon and faridabad in the dwarka region the subsidence continued till sept 2016 even after no appreciable decline in groundwater level is noted in the nearby observation wells fig 3c f in fact during nov 2014 16 these observation wells show signs of stabilization in groundwater levels thus the rapid subsidence in dwarka which continued till sept 2016 maybe due to residual or delayed compaction experienced by the aquifer system even after the groundwater levels have stopped declining shirzaei et al 2019 miller et al 2017 this behavior occurs due to the equilibration of the hydraulic head in the aquifer and neighboring aquitard units smith et al 2017 the time taken for the equilibration and subsequent termination of subsidence depends mainly on the hydraulic conductivity and thickness of aquitard units schmidt and b√ºrgmann 2003 delayed compaction as a major cause of transient non linear behavior of subsidence was also reported earlier by miller et al 2017 shirzaei et al 2017 and gonz√°lez and fern√°ndez 2011 the possibility that groundwater extraction and halting of subsidence are coterminous is improbable since the region is dominated by clay layers cgwb 2016b hence instant equilibration of aquifer hydraulic head with neighbouring aquitard units seems implausible that residual compaction ceased post sept 2016 and vertical displacement estimates are either stabilizing or revealing trends of upliftment suggests that the inelastic deformation phase is over and the underlying aquifer is behaving elastically at present in contrast to the non linear temporal behavior of the subsidence region in dwarka the subsidence zones of the gurgaon and faridabad region show a dominantly linear behavior with a negligible seasonal component long term records of groundwater level from existing monitoring wells show the lowest values of groundwater level since the start of monitoring suggesting inelastic deformation of the aquifer system this type of deformation invariably leads to non reversible rearrangement of grains wilson and gorelick 1996 and permanent loss of aquifer storage smith and knight 2019 chaussard et al 2014 hoffmann et al 2003 poland and ireland 1988 processes like this have serious consequences for freshwater water availability and compel immediate supply or demand side interventions to restrict the aquifer deformation to elastic range only chaussard et al 2017 bell et al 2008 hoffmann et al 2001 5 3 compartmentalisation of aquifer system the major subsidence zones near dwarka gurgaon and several minor and emerging subsidence zones are located on the western side of the delhi ridge fig 2 in contrast no prominent subsidence zone is observed on the eastern side between the ridge and yamuna river suggesting possible compartmentalization of the underlying aquifer system by delhi ridge as the distribution of subsidence zones is a good indicator of the presence of confined aquifers schmidt and b√ºrgmann 2003 and the presence of compressible deposits amelung et al 1999 it can be inferred that confined aquifers are more frequent on the western side of the ridge than the eastern side this inference is also supported by the depth to bedrock estimates which is significantly greater 80 170 m on the western side of the ridge cgwb 2016b than the eastern side 9 2 80 m further the aquifers on the eastern side of the ridge are sand dominated while clay silt and kankar dominate the aquifers on the western side cgwb 2016b thus it is evident that the aquifers located on the eastern and western side of the ridge are different in terms of alluvium thickness the proportion of fine grained material and govern the spatial distribution of subsidence zones the delhi ridge comprised of hard and resistant folded quartzite acts as a groundwater divide rainfall on the eastern side is channelized towards the yamuna river following the regional slope while it enters the natural depressions on the western side since groundwater also follows the regional slope the direction of groundwater flow is opposite on both sides of the ridge kumar et al 2011 thus the delhi ridge effectuates compartmentalization of aquifers on either side 5 4 lack of seasonal effect insar derived time series of vertical displacementhas been successfully utilized to characterize the seasonal deformation of aquifer systems due to annual recharge and pumping smith and li 2021 riel et al 2018 bell et al 2008 lanari et al 2004 hoffmann et al 2001 for the ncr the insar derived subsidence do not show any prominent seasonal signals this indicates that there may be no significant lateral variations in pore pressure of the aquifer system at seasonal time scales similar to central mexico chaussard et al 2021 chaussard et al 2013 osmanoƒülu et al 2011 the most likely reason behind the lack of significant seasonal signal is the relentless non periodic groundwater pumping to meet the urban and industrial needs of the region alternatively no pumping is taking place in the regions where aquifers are expected to behave elastically in the case of non periodic continuous pumping even groundwater inflow from the surrounding aquifer or in situ recharge may not lead to a significant seasonal rebound of the aquifer as extraction exceeds recharge in such scenarios the subsidence zones gurgaon and faridabad area are undergoing inelastic deformation it is more likely that long term linear signals will dominate the seasonal signals smith and knight 2019 sneed 2001 in these regions further low magnitude seasonal signal in the order of a few mm due to in situ recharge or inflow from the surrounding aquifer s cannot be distinguished from residual tropospheric noise fattahi and amelung 2015 since both are temporally collocated the period of recharge monsoon period also happens to be the period with the highest variability in the water vapor content of the troposphere the lack of local seasonal signals however does not preclude the presence of regional seasonal vertical displacementswhich have been recorded in the indo gangetic plain by continuous global positioning system stations cgps saji et al 2020 the seasonal amplitude in the data obtained from the cgps station located in ncr liaa operating from 2019 onwards is 4 to 5 mm http geodesy unr edu nglstationpages stations liaa sta large amounts of rainfall during the monsoon period are a major source of hydrological mass change in the indo gangetic plain and are considered the dominant cause of basin wide seasonal uplift and subsidence chanard et al 2014 bettinelli et al 2008 such regional seasonal displacements are associated with movements of the reference point and can t be detected by insar which is a relative measurement technique 6 conclusions the present study analyses land subsidence measured over the ncr in india using insar time series datasets obtained from alos 1 and sentinel 1 satellites two notable subsidence zones located in the vicinity of dwarka and gurgaon are detected during 2007 10 while an additional subsidence zone located near faridabad is detected during nov 2014 19 the spatiotemporal analysis reveal stabilization of subsidence zone near dwarka post sept 2016 while the subsidence zones near gurgaon increased significantly in spatial extent as well as in the rate of subsidence as compared to 2007 10 results reveal that the stabilization of subsidence near dwarka is attributed to the reduction in groundwater extraction post nov 2014 and changes in the deformation phase of the aquifer from inelastic to elastic on the contrary the subsidence zones near gurgaon and faridabad continue to grow with no signs of stabilization the continuing inelastic deformation noted here is causing permanent loss of storage and is detrimental to the groundwater potential of the area the present study demonstrates the use of insar based time series of vertical displacement to map the subsidence affected regions and understand the aquifer behavior in the densely populated ncr region it is important to note that the high spatial and temporal resolution of the surface displacement measurements helped decipher the contrasting deformation behavior of dwarka and gurgaon regions located nearby the results presented here also highlight the potential of insar to capture the heterogeneity in land subsidence due to varying groundwater extraction rates the degree of details achieved here is almost impossible with other satellite or sparse ground based observational networks monitoring the shallow aquifers therefore the capabilities of insar to monitor storage variations of deeper confined aquifers can complement the existing network of groundwater monitoring wells to provide an integrated assessment of groundwater resources especially in the data scarce regions of the world it is expected that increasing groundwater demand and lack of natural recharge may increase the areal extent and the magnitude of the documented subsidence zones and continuous monitoring of its spatiotemporal evolution is essential hence this study will provide information at space time scales crucial for water managers and urban planners for devising actionable groundwater management plans to minimize the ongoing subsidence and mitigate

3763,the poyang lake is the largest freshwater lake in china located at the midstream of the yangtze river and the water level has witnessed a decline both interannually and annually since the operation of the three gorges dam tgd located at the upstream of the yangtze river in 2003 however the impact of tgd on the spatial and temporal variation of water levels in the poyang lake remains to be elucidated in this study the long term observed water levels at different stations in the poyang lake and yangtze river were analyzed by seasonal trend decomposition based on loess to determine the impact of tgd on the spatial and temporal variation of water levels in the poyang lake the results reveal that tgd has no obvious impact on the interannual variation of water levels but accounts for a major part of the annual variation of water levels in the impounding season of tgd autumn the effect of the yangtze river is larger in the northern area that is close to the yangtze river than that in the southern area of the lake but the effect of the poyang lake itself is most obvious in the central area tgd has both positive and negative consequences on the water level of the poyang lake it can result in an obvious decrease in the water level and prolong the duration of drought but it can also reduce the variation amplitude of water levels anywhere in the poyang lake and control the maximum and minimum water levels this study may provide insights into the impact of tgd on the poyang lake and thus contribute to water resources conservation and ecological restoration of the lake in the future keywords poyang lake three gorges dam water level spatial and temporal variations stl decomposition 1 introduction the poyang lake is located at the midstream of the yangtze river and now it is the largest freshwater lake in china and plays a very important role in ecosystem wu et al 2017 it is estimated that approximately 95 of siberian cranes winter in the poyang lake wu et al 2009 and there also live a large number of other migratory species wang et al 2019c the lake receives water from several small rivers to the east west and south of the lake and then flows into the yangtze river from the northernmost part of the lake at hukou under normal circumstances fig 1 however a backflow of water from the yangtze river to the poyang lake is also observed in some extreme cases xu et al 2019 the lake also plays an important role in flood control wetland conservation and habitat provision lai et al 2013 mu et al 2020 wang et al 2013a wang et al 2013b the three gorges dam tgd is located at the upstream of the yangtze river and it is now the largest concrete dam in the world lai et al 2014a with an average annual runoff of 451 billion m3 and a flood control capacity of 22 2

extreme hydrological events sun et al 2012 yu et al 2019 the operation of tgd can alter the relationship between the poyang lake and the yangtze river and result in the recession of water level in the poyang lake dai et al 2013b deng et al 2019 mei et al 2015a especially during the impounding of tgd dai et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 in the dry season the outflow of the lake is increased due to the new river lake relationship gao et al 2014 and thus drought would occur earlier and persist for a longer duration than expected wang et al 2014 ye et al 2014 the recession of water level also causes a decrease in the lake area zhou et al 2019 and the water quantity of the poyang lake liu et al 2020 and more importantly the hydrological changes may have substantial impacts on the wildlife habitat and biodiversity li et al 2008 wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 the lake has been facing eutrophication and water quality deterioration since the first impounding of tgd in 2003 because of the changes in the hydrological regime the impounding of tgd also leads to a decrease in water level in the yangtze river in fall and discharge of a large volume of lake water which can decrease the flow velocity and increase the water exchange duration and consequently change the release pattern of phosphorous from sediment and impair the self purification capability of poyang lake tong et al 2017 wu et al 2011 the vegetation and landscape can also be affected because of the low water level in the poyang lake wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2012a the vegetation community is changing from hydrophilic cover types to those adapted to dryer conditions han et al 2018 the poyang lake basin becomes increasingly drier which thus has an effect on the submerged vegetation productivity cong et al 2011 and habitat for fishes han et al 2020 wang et al 2019c and water birds wang et al 2013a wang et al 2013b wu et al 2009 a better understanding of the hydrological changes related to the operation of tgd is essential to solve environmental and ecological problems of the poyang lake many studies have investigated the hydrological effects of tgd on the poyang lake using remote sensing data cai et al 2015 wang et al 2019b liu et al 2011 feng et al 2012 a significant increase in the runoff from the poyang lake to the yangtze river is found since 2003 along with a significant reduction in the lake area by analyzing the trmm and grace data cai et al 2015 wang et al 2019b however it is also found from the remote sensing data that the drought in the poyang lake could not be attributed solely to tgd operation as hydroclimatic change is also an important contributor to the drought liu et al 2011 feng et al 2012 the statistical models with in site observed data are also used to investigate the effects of tgd on the hydrology of the poyang lake zhang et al 2012b liu et al 2017 yao et al 2016 guo et al 2012 wang et al 2013a wang et al 2013b the operation of tgd can substantially alter the hydrological conditions and increase the probability of wet and dry extremes in the poyang lake zhang et al 2012b yao et al 2016 it is found that the fluctuation of water level in the poyang lake is affected more by tgd than by catchment inflow using a multiple linear regression model with observed data from typical water level monitoring stations in the poyang lake liu et al 2017 the comparison of observed data from some typical years reveals that the operation of tgd leads to a substantial decrease in water level in the poyang lake in autumn guo et al 2012 wang et al 2013a wang et al 2013b many numerical models have been established to study the hydrological variation of the poyang lake lai et al 2014a zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2020 li et al 2016 the hydrodynamics of the river lake system were simulated by the physically based hydrodynamic models and it was concluded that the yangtze river had a more significant effect than climate variability because the impounding of tgd accelerated the drainage of the poyang lake lai et al 2014a zhang et al 2014 it is also found that the operation of tgd increased the drought risk of the poyang lake by using the coupled numerical models and there was a spatio temporal variation of water quantity and quality in poyang lake since 2003 li et al 2016 wang et al 2020 however it is time consuming to process remote sensing data and it is difficult to distinguish the random disturbance of measured data it is important to identify key factors responsible for the decline of the water level of the poyang lake there is some evidence showing the recession of water level in the poyang lake which is mainly attributed to the operation of tgd climate change and sediment bathymetry change liu et al 2011 feng et al 2012 yao et al 2019 the operation of tgd results in a drop of water level in the poyang lake especially in autumn lai et al 2014a yao et al 2016 dai et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 however there are also studies suggesting that the drought frequency in the poyang lake is also affected by hydroclimatic changes such as precipitation and evaporation liu and wu 2016 wang et al 2017 gao et al 2013 the relative contributions of hydroclimatic and anthropogenic factors remain controversial gao et al 2013 liu and wu 2016 in addition changes in the sediment bathymetry of the yangtze river and poyang lake become more pronounced due to erosion and sand mining with the operation of tgd which can also contribute to the lower water level of poyang lake wang et al 2013a wang et al 2013b yao et al 2019 lai et al 2014b although there is growing evidence that tgd has an effect on the water level of the poyang lake its effects from different factors on the annual and interannual variation of the water level in different sections of the poyang lake remain controversial there is a slight increase in runoff from in this study the factors affecting the variation of the water level are divided into two types external factors that include the variation of bathymetry of the yangtze river channel operation of tgd and climate change related to the yangtze river and internal factors that include runoff from poyang lake catchment and the variation of bathymetry of the poyang lake in this study we analyzed the long term 52 years observation data with a seasonal trend decomposition based on loess stl to determine the annual and interannual variation of water level which could efficiently avoid the stochastic disturbance and characterize the spatial and temporal variation of water level in poyang lake overall this study may provide new insights into the causes of water level recession and the variation and distribution of water resources in the poyang lake after the operation of tgd 2 data and methodology 2 1 data the average daily water level data were collected for the period 1964 2015 52 years from 6 water level monitoring stations including jiujiang station jj located in the yangtze river and hukou hk xingzi xz duchang dc tangyin ty and kangshan ks stations located in the poyang lake fig 1 note that hk is located at the intersection of the poyang lake and the yangtze river and thus can be affected by both of them the six stations are linked with 5 lines r0 r1 r2 r3 and r4 from jj to ks forming 3 sections where s0 includes r0 in the yangtze river s1 includes r1 and r2 in the downstream of the poyang lake and s2 includes r3 and r4 in the upstream of the poyang lake fig 2 a the distance from jj to hk is set to be negative while those from other stations in the poyang lake to hk are set to the addition of former polyline e g the distance of ty to hk is r1 r2 r3 fig 2a the impounding of tgd began in 2003 zhang et al 2012b and thus the observation data was divided into period a 1964 2002 39 years and period b 2003 2015 13 year in this study period a was further subdivided into period a1 1964 1976 13 years period a2 1977 1989 13 years and period a3 1990 2002 13 years thus the variation of water level before and after the operation of tgd can be analyzed fig 2b according to the typical operation pattern and water level of tgd dai et al 2015 lai et al 2014a zhang et al 2012b a year was divided into four seasons including the draining season from 14 may to 24 jun during which the water of tgd is discharged rapidly for the coming flood season flood season from 24 jun to 25 sep during which a low water level is maintained for flood control impounding season from 25 sep to 11 nov during which water is impounded for the coming dry season and dry season from 11 nov to 14 may of next year during which a high water level is kept to prevent drought fig 2c 2 2 methodology the seasonal trend decomposition was performed based on loess stl to extract the long term trend and the seasonal trend and residual components of the water levels of the six stations cleveland et al 1990 the loess method used in stl has the advantages of the simplicity of linear least squares regression and the adaptability of nonlinear regression methods thus providing flexible and robust nonparametric decomposition of the signal into its main seasonal trend and residual components the long term observed data can be decomposed as follows using stl 1 x x t x s x r where l m is the observed daily data which can be water level l and discharge q xt m is the trend component xs m is the seasonal component and xr m is the residual component fig 3 a the robust estimates are used in stl and the bias caused by outliers can be avoided in the long term trend and the seasonal component eladawy et al 2017 vieira et al 2019 xu et al 2018 in order to verify the period of long term observed water levels for stl decomposition the fast fourier transform was used for each station fig 3b and the results of maximum amplitude show that a period corresponds approximately to a year thus stl decomposition was performed on a yearly basis the stl decomposition can extract the trend and seasonal components from hydrological data for further analysis and avoid the stochastic disturbance the calculation efficiency is high and there is no need to establish complex and time consuming hydrological models to evaluate the trend component more accurately mann kendall test mk test was performed in this study as it is applicable to assess the significance of monotonic trends in hydro meteorological time series bao et al 2012 lu et al 2018 sagarika et al 2014 unnikrishnan and jothiprakash 2015 zhang et al 2006 for a time series xt with a sample size n the statistic s is given by eq 2 2 s j 1 n 1 i j 1 n sgn x i x j where xi and xj are the sequential values data are assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of Œºx 0 and the mk test statistic z is given by eq 3 3 z s 1 var s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 where var s is the variance of s at a given significance level Œ± the original hypothesis would be rejected if z z 1 Œ± 2 and thus there is a significant upward or downward trend for the sequence xt in this case the magnitude of the change trend is expressed as Œ≤ 4 Œ≤ median x i x j i j j i the mk test was performed to detect the aberrance of the time series a significant upward trend would be identified if Œ≤ 0 while a significant downward trend would be identified if Œ≤ 0 the test statistic is given as follows 5 uf s k e s k var s k k 1 2 n where e sk and var sk are the mean and variance of the cumulative number s respectively ub was calculated for the reverse series as described above where the significance level was set to Œ± 0 05 with a critical value of u 0 05 1 96 there is a upward trend if uf 0 which becomes significant if uf 1 96 while there is a downward trend if uf 0 which becomes significant if uf 1 96 when the uf curve intersects that of ub at a given confidence level Œ± the intersection point corresponds to the beginning of a mutation 3 results 3 1 interannual variation trend component the trend component was extracted from the five stations fig 4 a shows that the mean water levels of period a1 a2 and a3 remain stable with negligible fluctuations throughout the year but the mean values of period b drop abruptly fig 4a which may be related to tgd that began to impound in 2003 the mk test was performed for each subsection to determine whether the decreasing trend is related to tgd or just the result of normal hydrological changes the uf value drops in 2003 and there is an intersection between uf and ub curves after 2003 fig 4b which indicates a decreasing mutation however the mk test shows no significant decreasing trend of water level in the poyang lake for all periods as it is slightly increased before 2003 fig 4b the ufs fluctuate between 1 96 and 1 96 fig 4c d which means no significant change in water level during period a however there is an intersection between uf and ub curves immediately after 2003 and the uf drops after 2003 and the trend becomes significant approximately in 2007 fig 4e indicating that the impounding of tgd in 2003 indeed has an impact on the water level of the poyang lake a comparison between the blue and red lines in fig 5 a shows a decreasing trend for all stations in the poyang lake and yangtze river after 2003 the operation of tgd may account for the decrease of the water level in the midstream and downstream of the yangtze river yu et al 2019 and the poyang lake dai et al 2013b deng et al 2019 mei et al 2015a however the decreasing degrees vary substantially across different stations it can be seen from fig 5a that the black dashed line represents the increment of the water level from period a to b and the water level increment of jj is slightly lower than that of hk and this represents that tgd has a more pronounced effect on jj that receives water only from the yangtze river than on hk that receives water from both the yangtze river and the poyang lake the water level increment first decreases from hk to dc and then increases from dc to ks red dashed circle which may be related to the geography of the poyang lake fig 1 for s1 in the northern area of the poyang lake which is long and narrow shaped the water supply is not sufficient potentially causing a backflow of water to the yangtze river the southern area of poyang lake is wider and also the sand bathymetric change here is the most obviously yao et al 2019 thus resulting in less decrease in water level and consequently the appearance of the turning point at dc the water surface slopes are similar from hk to ks r1 r2 r3 and r4 in period a fig 5a which indicates that the hydraulic structure is relatively uniform before 2003 when the tgd has been in operation during period b the slopes become flatter around the northern area of poyang lake in s1 r1 and r2 but steeper in northern area s2 r3 and r4 with a turning point at dc red dashed circle in fig 5a thus tgd seems to have a more pronounced effect on the northern area than on the southern area this is because the bathymetric change may differ at different stations of the lake and the most serious erosion occurs near the dc station yao et al 2019 fig 5b shows that the slopes are almost the same for s0 from jj to hk in the yangtze river the water level variations in the poyang lake are similar across period a1 a2 and a3 which however differ from that in period b thus the slopes in s1 and s2 change gradually from period a1 to b but more dramatically from period a3 to b fig 6 a shows the water surface slopes of s1 and s2 in period a the slopes of both s1 and s2 fluctuate slightly with no significant trends fig 6b c the mk tests also show the changing processes of the slopes fig 6b c after 2003 the slopes of s1 show a decreasing trend while that of s2 show an increasing trend 3 2 annual variation seasonal component generally the seasonal component of stl decomposition is repeated in each period and thus there would be no difference in the seasonal component between period a and b in this study a year is divided into four seasons according to the operation pattern of tgd to characterize the annual variation of the water level in the poyang lake fig 2c and the observation data of period a and b are decomposed separately and then compared in fig 7 a the blue and red lines represent the seasonal components of period a and b respectively and the black dashed line represents the seasonal component for all periods the water level of the poyang lake increases in the draining season in which tgd drains water for the coming flood season after 2003 but decreases in the impounding season in which tgd impounds water for the coming dry season fig 7a in the flood season the water level varies only slightly after 2003 due to flood control of tgd it can be also seen from fig 7a that the duration with relatively lower water level below zero of poyang lake is prolonged which indicates that the duration of relatively drought is prolonged after the operation of tgd the seasonal components of the poyang lake in the four seasons are shown in fig 7b and c for both period a and b water tends to flow from the poyang lake to the yangtze river in the dry season whereas the opposite is observed in the other three seasons however this does not mean the inflow of water from the yangtze river to the poyang lake as the flow direction is related to seasonal trend and residual components of stl decomposition there is a comparison between period a and b solid and dashed lines in fig 7b c which shows that the effects from tgd are relatively weaken in flood and dry seasons but leads to a decrease in water level deviations in impounding season but an increase in water level deviations in draining season fig 7b c the amplitude of the seasonal component shows a decreasing trend from hk to ks but the amplitude in jj is slightly lower than that of hk in both period a and b fig 8 a this is because the hydrological characteristics of the stations in the northern area of the lake are less affected by inflow from the catchment but more by the yangtze river fig 1 as a result hk is affected by both the lake and river and jj is only affected by the yangtze river thus resulting in a slightly lower amplitude in jj there is a comparison between period a and b blue and red lines in fig 8a which shows that after 2003 the variation of the amplitude decreases significantly for almost all stations and this indicates that tgd contributes to stabilizing the water level and controls the maximum and minimum water levels of the poyang lake in a narrow range the fig 8b clearly shows that tgd plays a role in flood control as the maximum water levels drop for all stations and the water tends to flow from the yangtze river to the poyang lake when the water level reaches the maximum in a year fig 8b however there is no significant variation in the minimum water level fig 8c and it even decreases slightly from dc to ks the water levels of jj hk and xz are higher than the initial but show few differences among them red dashed circle in fig 8c thus the operation of tgd makes the minimum water level to be maintained at a relatively high level for hk and xz 3 3 extreme data analysis residual component generally the residual component reflects the extreme values in the observation data series fig 9 a shows that the standard deviation std of the residual component of jj is slightly lower than that of hk as the former is affected only by the yangtze river and thus it is less likely to have extreme values while the latter is affected by both the yangtze river and the poyang lake and there would be more likely to witness extreme values the std of the poyang lake shows a decreasing trend as it approaches to hk because the hydrological conditions of the stations in the upper region of the lake are less affected by the yangtze river and other small rivers fig 1 a comparison between period a and b blue and red lines in fig 9a shows that the variation of std increases at jj hk xz and dc but decreases at ty and ks after 2003 this indicates that operation of tgd can impose more effects on the northern area of poyang lake than that in southern which results in an increase in extreme values for stations in or near the yangtze river but a decrease in extreme values for stations far away from the yangtze river in terms of the risk of extremely low water levels taking the lowest 5 data as example there appears to be a higher frequency of extremely low water levels after 2003 and the closer it is to hk the higher the frequency would be fig 9b thus it is concluded that operation of tgd can increase the drought frequency in the poyang lake especially the down region the frequency of the highest 5 water levels decreases for all stations except dc fig 9c which implies that tgd plays a critical role in flood control note that an increase in the frequency is observed in dc after 2003 red dashed circle in fig 9c this may be related to the geography characteristics fig 1 and the bathymetric change of the poyang lake the northern area of the poyang lake from hk to dc is long and narrow shaped while the southern area from dc to ks is much wider and the area of dc witness the most obvious bathymetric change yao et al 2019 generally flood flows from the southern area to the northern area water would be retained for a while at around dc during the discharge of flood water and thus the water area varies abruptly from the south to the north this may account for the increase of the frequency of extremely high water levels at dc 4 discussion 4 1 factors affecting the interannual variation of water levels no obvious drop is observed in the interannual variation of water levels after 2003 fig 4a and the average drop from period a to b is 0 8193 m fig 4 fig 5 in this study the factors that affect the variation of water levels of the poyang lake are classified into internal factors related to the lake and catchment and external factors related to the yangtze river table 1 fig 10 the sediment flux in the yangtze river varies substantially and the channel erosion at the middle lower stream become more pronounced due to the construction of tgd chen et al 2014 chen et al 2010 lai et al 2017 xu and milliman 2009 yuan et al 2009 the bathymetric change results in the decline of the water level in the yangtze river and consequently the decline of the water level and area of natural lakes connected to the river wang et al 2013a wang et al 2013b this study also shows that the bathymetric change leads to the decline of the water level at hk and other stations in the poyang lake section s1 fig 10a and as a result the water level of the poyang lake is decreased by about 20 on an interannual scale table 1 however only 2 72 of interannual variation of the water level is attributable to the operation of tgd fig 10a table 1 because tgd can adjust the water resources of the yangtze river on an annual scale the daily discharge and water level of the yangtze river are more likely to be within the normal range since the operation of tgd in 2003 with less extreme events compared with that before 2003 mei et al 2015b the storage capacity of tgd is only 9 of the mean annual flow of the upper basin and 4 of the mean annual flow of the whole basin chen et al 2014 in addition tgd accounts for only 1 8 of the decline of natural lake area wang et al 2016 climate change in the yangtze river basin accounts for 53 22 of the decline of the water level in the poyang lake table 1 the runoff from hankou station which is located at the middle stream between tgd and hk in the yangtze river shows a dramatic drop in 2003 fig 11 a previous studies have also confirmed that climate change is the main contributor to the water level of the middle and lower stream of the yangtze river wang et al 2017 liu et al 2013 overall the external factors related to the yangtze river play a major role in the decline of the water level in the poyang lake lai et al 2014a zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2013a wang et al 2013b especially in the northern area of the poyang lake fig 10a there is a slight increase in runoff from the catchment of the poyang lake fig 11b which can have negative impacts on the decline of the water level 1 41 table 1 sand mining may change the bathymetry of poyang lake and result in the drop of the water level yao et al 2018 liang et al 2019 qi et al 2014 lai et al 2014b bathymetric change is the main internal factor that accounts for 18 of the decline of the water level in the poyang lake table 1 it is seen in fig 12 a that the simulated line without bathymetric change is higher than the observed line with bathymetric change the water level in the poyang lake become less sensitive to that in the yangtze river fig 12b c which implies the change of sediment exchange between the yangtze river and the poyang lake due to river channel erosion and sand mining gao et al 2014 guo et al 2018 in line with previous findings that bathymetric change led to the decline of the water level mainly in the northern area of poyang lake yao et al 2018 yao et al 2019 qi et al 2014 fig 10b shows that the maximum water level drop occurs at dc however it is also noted that the decline of the water level at hk and xz located in the northern area is not as obvious as that at dc as the channel is relatively narrow fig 1 4 2 factors affecting the intraannual variation of water levels the water level of the poyang lake is decreased in all seasons especially in the impounding season fig 13 a except in the draining season in which the water level is increased slightly after 2003 because of the draining of tgd and reservoirs in the catchment of the poyang lake the increment of water level in the northern and southern areas is larger than that in the central area fig 10a in the flood season the water level is high and shows a uniformly decreasing trend fig 10a in the dry season the decrement line in fig 13a is similar to that in fig 10b because of the low water level and the obvious effect of bathymetric change in the impounding season the decrease of water level is more pronounced compared with that in other seasons at all stations fig 10a however the decrease of water level at the three northern stations hk xz and dc close to the yangtze river is more pronounced than that at the two southern stations ty and ks due to the operation of tdg fig 13b shows that tgd can decrease the water level of the poyang lake in the impounding season but may increase the water level in the dry season due to adjustment of water resources many studies have confirmed that tgd is partly responsible for the decrease of the water level in the poyang lake in the impounding season dai et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 tan et al 2019 lai et al 2014a this study reveals that tgd accounts for 44 44 of the decrement of the water level fig 14 a table 2 previous studies have shown that the yangtze river accounts for 95 of water level change of the poyang lake in autumn of 2006 yao et al 2016 and tgd accounts for 55 69 of water level changes of the poyang lake in september and october wang et al 2019a the impact of bathymetric change becomes more pronounced in the impounding season fig 14b table 2 accounting for 26 54 of water level change in the poyang lake however yao et al 2019 found that bathymetric change accounted for 14 of water level change in the poyang lake probably because the combined effect of the yangtze river and the poyang lake was not considered in their study ye et al 2018 also found that changes of lake bottom topography accounted for 28 43 of the total change in the autumn the impacts of each factor on the interannual and annual variation of the water level at xz dc and ty stations located in the northern central and southern areas of the poyang lake respectively are also compared as shown in table 1 and table 2 the decrement of water level in the central area is the largest followed by the northern area and then the southern area table 1 table 2 fig 10 fig 14 the total decrement of water level is about 1 m deeper in impounding season table 1 and table 2 and the impacts of external factors decrease from the north to the south for external factors climate change is the dominant factor affecting the interannual variation of water level wang et al 2017 while the operation of tgd becomes the key factor in autumn yao et al 2016 dai et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 which implies that the operation of tgd can prolong the duration of drought in the poyang lake in autumn lai et al 2014a liu et al 2011 thus the external causes of water level recession in the poyang lake should be determined depending on the circumstance for internal factors the water level in the central area drops most mainly because of bathymetric change yao et al 2019 the runoff from the catchment is slightly increased on the interannual scale but decreased in autumn fig 11b fig s4b due to impounding of reservoirs in the catchment of the poyang lake 5 conclusions in this study the 52 year daily observed data of water level in the poyang lake are decomposed into seasonal trend and residual components by taking advantage of the seasonal trend decomposition based on loess stl both interannual and annual variations of water level are clarified and the impacts of different factors on the water level variation in the poyang lake are discussed the main findings of the study are summarized as follows 1 there is an obvious drop of water level in the poyang lake after the operation of tgd it is found that the average water level in the poyang lake is decreased by about 0 82 m interannually and 1 90 m in the impounding season of tgd after 2003 2 tgd accounts for a major portion of the annual variation of the water level the water level is increased in the draining season and decreased in the impounding season and the operation of tgd accounts for 44 44 of the total drop 3 the water level in the poyang lake varies spatially in recent decades the effect of the yangtze river is stronger in the northern area that is close to the yangtze river than that in the southern area the slopes of the water surfaces in the poyang lake become flatter in the northern area but steeper in the southern area which is mainly due to the bathymetric change of the poyang lake 4 the operation of tgd results in positive hydrological changes in the poyang lake tgd plays a critical role in the flood and drought control and it can reduce the amplitude of water level variation anywhere in the poyang lake and control the maximum and minimum water levels this study provides valuable insights into the hydrological effects of tgd on the poyang lake and improves our understanding of the relationship between the poyang lake and the yangtze river so that better water resource management strategies can be developed for the poyang lake this study also provides important insights into the environmental and ecological responses to hydrological changes uncited references yuan et al 2012 credit

3763,the poyang lake is the largest freshwater lake in china located at the midstream of the yangtze river and the water level has witnessed a decline both interannually and annually since the operation of the three gorges dam tgd located at the upstream of the yangtze river in 2003 however the impact of tgd on the spatial and temporal variation of water levels in the poyang lake remains to be elucidated in this study the long term observed water levels at different stations in the poyang lake and yangtze river were analyzed by seasonal trend decomposition based on loess to determine the impact of tgd on the spatial and temporal variation of water levels in the poyang lake the results reveal that tgd has no obvious impact on the interannual variation of water levels but accounts for a major part of the annual variation of water levels in the impounding season of tgd autumn the effect of the yangtze river is larger in the northern area that is close to the yangtze river than that in the southern area of the lake but the effect of the poyang lake itself is most obvious in the central area tgd has both positive and negative consequences on the water level of the poyang lake it can result in an obvious decrease in the water level and prolong the duration of drought but it can also reduce the variation amplitude of water levels anywhere in the poyang lake and control the maximum and minimum water levels this study may provide insights into the impact of tgd on the poyang lake and thus contribute to water resources conservation and ecological restoration of the lake in the future keywords poyang lake three gorges dam water level spatial and temporal variations stl decomposition 1 introduction the poyang lake is located at the midstream of the yangtze river and now it is the largest freshwater lake in china and plays a very important role in ecosystem wu et al 2017 it is estimated that approximately 95 of siberian cranes winter in the poyang lake wu et al 2009 and there also live a large number of other migratory species wang et al 2019c the lake receives water from several small rivers to the east west and south of the lake and then flows into the yangtze river from the northernmost part of the lake at hukou under normal circumstances fig 1 however a backflow of water from the yangtze river to the poyang lake is also observed in some extreme cases xu et al 2019 the lake also plays an important role in flood control wetland conservation and habitat provision lai et al 2013 mu et al 2020 wang et al 2013a wang et al 2013b the three gorges dam tgd is located at the upstream of the yangtze river and it is now the largest concrete dam in the world lai et al 2014a with an average annual runoff of 451 billion m3 and a flood control capacity of 22 2 billion m3 however some concerns have been raised about the hydrological and environmental impacts of tgd on the midstream and downstream of the yangtze river wang et al 2013a wang et al 2013b wang et al 2017 niu 2016 qin et al 2020 such as changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources dai et al 2013a guo et al 2012 jiang et al 2014 tian et al 2019 and a higher probability of extreme hydrological events sun et al 2012 yu et al 2019 the operation of tgd can alter the relationship between the poyang lake and the yangtze river and result in the recession of water level in the poyang lake dai et al 2013b deng et al 2019 mei et al 2015a especially during the impounding of tgd dai et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 in the dry season the outflow of the lake is increased due to the new river lake relationship gao et al 2014 and thus drought would occur earlier and persist for a longer duration than expected wang et al 2014 ye et al 2014 the recession of water level also causes a decrease in the lake area zhou et al 2019 and the water quantity of the poyang lake liu et al 2020 and more importantly the hydrological changes may have substantial impacts on the wildlife habitat and biodiversity li et al 2008 wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 the lake has been facing eutrophication and water quality deterioration since the first impounding of tgd in 2003 because of the changes in the hydrological regime the impounding of tgd also leads to a decrease in water level in the yangtze river in fall and discharge of a large volume of lake water which can decrease the flow velocity and increase the water exchange duration and consequently change the release pattern of phosphorous from sediment and impair the self purification capability of poyang lake tong et al 2017 wu et al 2011 the vegetation and landscape can also be affected because of the low water level in the poyang lake wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2012a the vegetation community is changing from hydrophilic cover types to those adapted to dryer conditions han et al 2018 the poyang lake basin becomes increasingly drier which thus has an effect on the submerged vegetation productivity cong et al 2011 and habitat for fishes han et al 2020 wang et al 2019c and water birds wang et al 2013a wang et al 2013b wu et al 2009 a better understanding of the hydrological changes related to the operation of tgd is essential to solve environmental and ecological problems of the poyang lake many studies have investigated the hydrological effects of tgd on the poyang lake using remote sensing data cai et al 2015 wang et al 2019b liu et al 2011 feng et al 2012 a significant increase in the runoff from the poyang lake to the yangtze river is found since 2003 along with a significant reduction in the lake area by analyzing the trmm and grace data cai et al 2015 wang et al 2019b however it is also found from the remote sensing data that the drought in the poyang lake could not be attributed solely to tgd operation as hydroclimatic change is also an important contributor to the drought liu et al 2011 feng et al 2012 the statistical models with in site observed data are also used to investigate the effects of tgd on the hydrology of the poyang lake zhang et al 2012b liu et al 2017 yao et al 2016 guo et al 2012 wang et al 2013a wang et al 2013b the operation of tgd can substantially alter the hydrological conditions and increase the probability of wet and dry extremes in the poyang lake zhang et al 2012b yao et al 2016 it is found that the fluctuation of water level in the poyang lake is affected more by tgd than by catchment inflow using a multiple linear regression model with observed data from typical water level monitoring stations in the poyang lake liu et al 2017 the comparison of observed data from some typical years reveals that the operation of tgd leads to a substantial decrease in water level in the poyang lake in autumn guo et al 2012 wang et al 2013a wang et al 2013b many numerical models have been established to study the hydrological variation of the poyang lake lai et al 2014a zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2020 li et al 2016 the hydrodynamics of the river lake system were simulated by the physically based hydrodynamic models and it was concluded that the yangtze river had a more significant effect than climate variability because the impounding of tgd accelerated the drainage of the poyang lake lai et al 2014a zhang et al 2014 it is also found that the operation of tgd increased the drought risk of the poyang lake by using the coupled numerical models and there was a spatio temporal variation of water quantity and quality in poyang lake since 2003 li et al 2016 wang et al 2020 however it is time consuming to process remote sensing data and it is difficult to distinguish the random disturbance of measured data it is important to identify key factors responsible for the decline of the water level of the poyang lake there is some evidence showing the recession of water level in the poyang lake which is mainly attributed to the operation of tgd climate change and sediment bathymetry change liu et al 2011 feng et al 2012 yao et al 2019 the operation of tgd results in a drop of water level in the poyang lake especially in autumn lai et al 2014a yao et al 2016 dai et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 however there are also studies suggesting that the drought frequency in the poyang lake is also affected by hydroclimatic changes such as precipitation and evaporation liu and wu 2016 wang et al 2017 gao et al 2013 the relative contributions of hydroclimatic and anthropogenic factors remain controversial gao et al 2013 liu and wu 2016 in addition changes in the sediment bathymetry of the yangtze river and poyang lake become more pronounced due to erosion and sand mining with the operation of tgd which can also contribute to the lower water level of poyang lake wang et al 2013a wang et al 2013b yao et al 2019 lai et al 2014b although there is growing evidence that tgd has an effect on the water level of the poyang lake its effects from different factors on the annual and interannual variation of the water level in different sections of the poyang lake remain controversial there is a slight increase in runoff from in this study the factors affecting the variation of the water level are divided into two types external factors that include the variation of bathymetry of the yangtze river channel operation of tgd and climate change related to the yangtze river and internal factors that include runoff from poyang lake catchment and the variation of bathymetry of the poyang lake in this study we analyzed the long term 52 years observation data with a seasonal trend decomposition based on loess stl to determine the annual and interannual variation of water level which could efficiently avoid the stochastic disturbance and characterize the spatial and temporal variation of water level in poyang lake overall this study may provide new insights into the causes of water level recession and the variation and distribution of water resources in the poyang lake after the operation of tgd 2 data and methodology 2 1 data the average daily water level data were collected for the period 1964 2015 52 years from 6 water level monitoring stations including jiujiang station jj located in the yangtze river and hukou hk xingzi xz duchang dc tangyin ty and kangshan ks stations located in the poyang lake fig 1 note that hk is located at the intersection of the poyang lake and the yangtze river and thus can be affected by both of them the six stations are linked with 5 lines r0 r1 r2 r3 and r4 from jj to ks forming 3 sections where s0 includes r0 in the yangtze river s1 includes r1 and r2 in the downstream of the poyang lake and s2 includes r3 and r4 in the upstream of the poyang lake fig 2 a the distance from jj to hk is set to be negative while those from other stations in the poyang lake to hk are set to the addition of former polyline e g the distance of ty to hk is r1 r2 r3 fig 2a the impounding of tgd began in 2003 zhang et al 2012b and thus the observation data was divided into period a 1964 2002 39 years and period b 2003 2015 13 year in this study period a was further subdivided into period a1 1964 1976 13 years period a2 1977 1989 13 years and period a3 1990 2002 13 years thus the variation of water level before and after the operation of tgd can be analyzed fig 2b according to the typical operation pattern and water level of tgd dai et al 2015 lai et al 2014a zhang et al 2012b a year was divided into four seasons including the draining season from 14 may to 24 jun during which the water of tgd is discharged rapidly for the coming flood season flood season from 24 jun to 25 sep during which a low water level is maintained for flood control impounding season from 25 sep to 11 nov during which water is impounded for the coming dry season and dry season from 11 nov to 14 may of next year during which a high water level is kept to prevent drought fig 2c 2 2 methodology the seasonal trend decomposition was performed based on loess stl to extract the long term trend and the seasonal trend and residual components of the water levels of the six stations cleveland et al 1990 the loess method used in stl has the advantages of the simplicity of linear least squares regression and the adaptability of nonlinear regression methods thus providing flexible and robust nonparametric decomposition of the signal into its main seasonal trend and residual components the long term observed data can be decomposed as follows using stl 1 x x t x s x r where l m is the observed daily data which can be water level l and discharge q xt m is the trend component xs m is the seasonal component and xr m is the residual component fig 3 a the robust estimates are used in stl and the bias caused by outliers can be avoided in the long term trend and the seasonal component eladawy et al 2017 vieira et al 2019 xu et al 2018 in order to verify the period of long term observed water levels for stl decomposition the fast fourier transform was used for each station fig 3b and the results of maximum amplitude show that a period corresponds approximately to a year thus stl decomposition was performed on a yearly basis the stl decomposition can extract the trend and seasonal components from hydrological data for further analysis and avoid the stochastic disturbance the calculation efficiency is high and there is no need to establish complex and time consuming hydrological models to evaluate the trend component more accurately mann kendall test mk test was performed in this study as it is applicable to assess the significance of monotonic trends in hydro meteorological time series bao et al 2012 lu et al 2018 sagarika et al 2014 unnikrishnan and jothiprakash 2015 zhang et al 2006 for a time series xt with a sample size n the statistic s is given by eq 2 2 s j 1 n 1 i j 1 n sgn x i x j where xi and xj are the sequential values data are assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of Œºx 0 and the mk test statistic z is given by eq 3 3 z s 1 var s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 where var s is the variance of s at a given significance level Œ± the original hypothesis would be rejected if z z 1 Œ± 2 and thus there is a significant upward or downward trend for the sequence xt in this case the magnitude of the change trend is expressed as Œ≤ 4 Œ≤ median x i x j i j j i the mk test was performed to detect the aberrance of the time series a significant upward trend would be identified if Œ≤ 0 while a significant downward trend would be identified if Œ≤ 0 the test statistic is given as follows 5 uf s k e s k var s k k 1 2 n where e sk and var sk are the mean and variance of the cumulative number s respectively ub was calculated for the reverse series as described above where the significance level was set to Œ± 0 05 with a critical value of u 0 05 1 96 there is a upward trend if uf 0 which becomes significant if uf 1 96 while there is a downward trend if uf 0 which becomes significant if uf 1 96 when the uf curve intersects that of ub at a given confidence level Œ± the intersection point corresponds to the beginning of a mutation 3 results 3 1 interannual variation trend component the trend component was extracted from the five stations fig 4 a shows that the mean water levels of period a1 a2 and a3 remain stable with negligible fluctuations throughout the year but the mean values of period b drop abruptly fig 4a which may be related to tgd that began to impound in 2003 the mk test was performed for each subsection to determine whether the decreasing trend is related to tgd or just the result of normal hydrological changes the uf value drops in 2003 and there is an intersection between uf and ub curves after 2003 fig 4b which indicates a decreasing mutation however the mk test shows no significant decreasing trend of water level in the poyang lake for all periods as it is slightly increased before 2003 fig 4b the ufs fluctuate between 1 96 and 1 96 fig 4c d which means no significant change in water level during period a however there is an intersection between uf and ub curves immediately after 2003 and the uf drops after 2003 and the trend becomes significant approximately in 2007 fig 4e indicating that the impounding of tgd in 2003 indeed has an impact on the water level of the poyang lake a comparison between the blue and red lines in fig 5 a shows a decreasing trend for all stations in the poyang lake and yangtze river after 2003 the operation of tgd may account for the decrease of the water level in the midstream and downstream of the yangtze river yu et al 2019 and the poyang lake dai et al 2013b deng et al 2019 mei et al 2015a however the decreasing degrees vary substantially across different stations it can be seen from fig 5a that the black dashed line represents the increment of the water level from period a to b and the water level increment of jj is slightly lower than that of hk and this represents that tgd has a more pronounced effect on jj that receives water only from the yangtze river than on hk that receives water from both the yangtze river and the poyang lake the water level increment first decreases from hk to dc and then increases from dc to ks red dashed circle which may be related to the geography of the poyang lake fig 1 for s1 in the northern area of the poyang lake which is long and narrow shaped the water supply is not sufficient potentially causing a backflow of water to the yangtze river the southern area of poyang lake is wider and also the sand bathymetric change here is the most obviously yao et al 2019 thus resulting in less decrease in water level and consequently the appearance of the turning point at dc the water surface slopes are similar from hk to ks r1 r2 r3 and r4 in period a fig 5a which indicates that the hydraulic structure is relatively uniform before 2003 when the tgd has been in operation during period b the slopes become flatter around the northern area of poyang lake in s1 r1 and r2 but steeper in northern area s2 r3 and r4 with a turning point at dc red dashed circle in fig 5a thus tgd seems to have a more pronounced effect on the northern area than on the southern area this is because the bathymetric change may differ at different stations of the lake and the most serious erosion occurs near the dc station yao et al 2019 fig 5b shows that the slopes are almost the same for s0 from jj to hk in the yangtze river the water level variations in the poyang lake are similar across period a1 a2 and a3 which however differ from that in period b thus the slopes in s1 and s2 change gradually from period a1 to b but more dramatically from period a3 to b fig 6 a shows the water surface slopes of s1 and s2 in period a the slopes of both s1 and s2 fluctuate slightly with no significant trends fig 6b c the mk tests also show the changing processes of the slopes fig 6b c after 2003 the slopes of s1 show a decreasing trend while that of s2 show an increasing trend 3 2 annual variation seasonal component generally the seasonal component of stl decomposition is repeated in each period and thus there would be no difference in the seasonal component between period a and b in this study a year is divided into four seasons according to the operation pattern of tgd to characterize the annual variation of the water level in the poyang lake fig 2c and the observation data of period a and b are decomposed separately and then compared in fig 7 a the blue and red lines represent the seasonal components of period a and b respectively and the black dashed line represents the seasonal component for all periods the water level of the poyang lake increases in the draining season in which tgd drains water for the coming flood season after 2003 but decreases in the impounding season in which tgd impounds water for the coming dry season fig 7a in the flood season the water level varies only slightly after 2003 due to flood control of tgd it can be also seen from fig 7a that the duration with relatively lower water level below zero of poyang lake is prolonged which indicates that the duration of relatively drought is prolonged after the operation of tgd the seasonal components of the poyang lake in the four seasons are shown in fig 7b and c for both period a and b water tends to flow from the poyang lake to the yangtze river in the dry season whereas the opposite is observed in the other three seasons however this does not mean the inflow of water from the yangtze river to the poyang lake as the flow direction is related to seasonal trend and residual components of stl decomposition there is a comparison between period a and b solid and dashed lines in fig 7b c which shows that the effects from tgd are relatively weaken in flood and dry seasons but leads to a decrease in water level deviations in impounding season but an increase in water level deviations in draining season fig 7b c the amplitude of the seasonal component shows a decreasing trend from hk to ks but the amplitude in jj is slightly lower than that of hk in both period a and b fig 8 a this is because the hydrological characteristics of the stations in the northern area of the lake are less affected by inflow from the catchment but more by the yangtze river fig 1 as a result hk is affected by both the lake and river and jj is only affected by the yangtze river thus resulting in a slightly lower amplitude in jj there is a comparison between period a and b blue and red lines in fig 8a which shows that after 2003 the variation of the amplitude decreases significantly for almost all stations and this indicates that tgd contributes to stabilizing the water level and controls the maximum and minimum water levels of the poyang lake in a narrow range the fig 8b clearly shows that tgd plays a role in flood control as the maximum water levels drop for all stations and the water tends to flow from the yangtze river to the poyang lake when the water level reaches the maximum in a year fig 8b however there is no significant variation in the minimum water level fig 8c and it even decreases slightly from dc to ks the water levels of jj hk and xz are higher than the initial but show few differences among them red dashed circle in fig 8c thus the operation of tgd makes the minimum water level to be maintained at a relatively high level for hk and xz 3 3 extreme data analysis residual component generally the residual component reflects the extreme values in the observation data series fig 9 a shows that the standard deviation std of the residual component of jj is slightly lower than that of hk as the former is affected only by the yangtze river and thus it is less likely to have extreme values while the latter is affected by both the yangtze river and the poyang lake and there would be more likely to witness extreme values the std of the poyang lake shows a decreasing trend as it approaches to hk because the hydrological conditions of the stations in the upper region of the lake are less affected by the yangtze river and other small rivers fig 1 a comparison between period a and b blue and red lines in fig 9a shows that the variation of std increases at jj hk xz and dc but decreases at ty and ks after 2003 this indicates that operation of tgd can impose more effects on the northern area of poyang lake than that in southern which results in an increase in extreme values for stations in or near the yangtze river but a decrease in extreme values for stations far away from the yangtze river in terms of the risk of extremely low water levels taking the lowest 5 data as example there appears to be a higher frequency of extremely low water levels after 2003 and the closer it is to hk the higher the frequency would be fig 9b thus it is concluded that operation of tgd can increase the drought frequency in the poyang lake especially the down region the frequency of the highest 5 water levels decreases for all stations except dc fig 9c which implies that tgd plays a critical role in flood control note that an increase in the frequency is observed in dc after 2003 red dashed circle in fig 9c this may be related to the geography characteristics fig 1 and the bathymetric change of the poyang lake the northern area of the poyang lake from hk to dc is long and narrow shaped while the southern area from dc to ks is much wider and the area of dc witness the most obvious bathymetric change yao et al 2019 generally flood flows from the southern area to the northern area water would be retained for a while at around dc during the discharge of flood water and thus the water area varies abruptly from the south to the north this may account for the increase of the frequency of extremely high water levels at dc 4 discussion 4 1 factors affecting the interannual variation of water levels no obvious drop is observed in the interannual variation of water levels after 2003 fig 4a and the average drop from period a to b is 0 8193 m fig 4 fig 5 in this study the factors that affect the variation of water levels of the poyang lake are classified into internal factors related to the lake and catchment and external factors related to the yangtze river table 1 fig 10 the sediment flux in the yangtze river varies substantially and the channel erosion at the middle lower stream become more pronounced due to the construction of tgd chen et al 2014 chen et al 2010 lai et al 2017 xu and milliman 2009 yuan et al 2009 the bathymetric change results in the decline of the water level in the yangtze river and consequently the decline of the water level and area of natural lakes connected to the river wang et al 2013a wang et al 2013b this study also shows that the bathymetric change leads to the decline of the water level at hk and other stations in the poyang lake section s1 fig 10a and as a result the water level of the poyang lake is decreased by about 20 on an interannual scale table 1 however only 2 72 of interannual variation of the water level is attributable to the operation of tgd fig 10a table 1 because tgd can adjust the water resources of the yangtze river on an annual scale the daily discharge and water level of the yangtze river are more likely to be within the normal range since the operation of tgd in 2003 with less extreme events compared with that before 2003 mei et al 2015b the storage capacity of tgd is only 9 of the mean annual flow of the upper basin and 4 of the mean annual flow of the whole basin chen et al 2014 in addition tgd accounts for only 1 8 of the decline of natural lake area wang et al 2016 climate change in the yangtze river basin accounts for 53 22 of the decline of the water level in the poyang lake table 1 the runoff from hankou station which is located at the middle stream between tgd and hk in the yangtze river shows a dramatic drop in 2003 fig 11 a previous studies have also confirmed that climate change is the main contributor to the water level of the middle and lower stream of the yangtze river wang et al 2017 liu et al 2013 overall the external factors related to the yangtze river play a major role in the decline of the water level in the poyang lake lai et al 2014a zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2013a wang et al 2013b especially in the northern area of the poyang lake fig 10a there is a slight increase in runoff from the catchment of the poyang lake fig 11b which can have negative impacts on the decline of the water level 1 41 table 1 sand mining may change the bathymetry of poyang lake and result in the drop of the water level yao et al 2018 liang et al 2019 qi et al 2014 lai et al 2014b bathymetric change is the main internal factor that accounts for 18 of the decline of the water level in the poyang lake table 1 it is seen in fig 12 a that the simulated line without bathymetric change is higher than the observed line with bathymetric change the water level in the poyang lake become less sensitive to that in the yangtze river fig 12b c which implies the change of sediment exchange between the yangtze river and the poyang lake due to river channel erosion and sand mining gao et al 2014 guo et al 2018 in line with previous findings that bathymetric change led to the decline of the water level mainly in the northern area of poyang lake yao et al 2018 yao et al 2019 qi et al 2014 fig 10b shows that the maximum water level drop occurs at dc however it is also noted that the decline of the water level at hk and xz located in the northern area is not as obvious as that at dc as the channel is relatively narrow fig 1 4 2 factors affecting the intraannual variation of water levels the water level of the poyang lake is decreased in all seasons especially in the impounding season fig 13 a except in the draining season in which the water level is increased slightly after 2003 because of the draining of tgd and reservoirs in the catchment of the poyang lake the increment of water level in the northern and southern areas is larger than that in the central area fig 10a in the flood season the water level is high and shows a uniformly decreasing trend fig 10a in the dry season the decrement line in fig 13a is similar to that in fig 10b because of the low water level and the obvious effect of bathymetric change in the impounding season the decrease of water level is more pronounced compared with that in other seasons at all stations fig 10a however the decrease of water level at the three northern stations hk xz and dc close to the yangtze river is more pronounced than that at the two southern stations ty and ks due to the operation of tdg fig 13b shows that tgd can decrease the water level of the poyang lake in the impounding season but may increase the water level in the dry season due to adjustment of water resources many studies have confirmed that tgd is partly responsible for the decrease of the water level in the poyang lake in the impounding season dai et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 tan et al 2019 lai et al 2014a this study reveals that tgd accounts for 44 44 of the decrement of the water level fig 14 a table 2 previous studies have shown that the yangtze river accounts for 95 of water level change of the poyang lake in autumn of 2006 yao et al 2016 and tgd accounts for 55 69 of water level changes of the poyang lake in september and october wang et al 2019a the impact of bathymetric change becomes more pronounced in the impounding season fig 14b table 2 accounting for 26 54 of water level change in the poyang lake however yao et al 2019 found that bathymetric change accounted for 14 of water level change in the poyang lake probably because the combined effect of the yangtze river and the poyang lake was not considered in their study ye et al 2018 also found that changes of lake bottom topography accounted for 28 43 of the total change in the autumn the impacts of each factor on the interannual and annual variation of the water level at xz dc and ty stations located in the northern central and southern areas of the poyang lake respectively are also compared as shown in table 1 and table 2 the decrement of water level in the central area is the largest followed by the northern area and then the southern area table 1 table 2 fig 10 fig 14 the total decrement of water level is about 1 m deeper in impounding season table 1 and table 2 and the impacts of external factors decrease from the north to the south for external factors climate change is the dominant factor affecting the interannual variation of water level wang et al 2017 while the operation of tgd becomes the key factor in autumn yao et al 2016 dai et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 which implies that the operation of tgd can prolong the duration of drought in the poyang lake in autumn lai et al 2014a liu et al 2011 thus the external causes of water level recession in the poyang lake should be determined depending on the circumstance for internal factors the water level in the central area drops most mainly because of bathymetric change yao et al 2019 the runoff from the catchment is slightly increased on the interannual scale but decreased in autumn fig 11b fig s4b due to impounding of reservoirs in the catchment of the poyang lake 5 conclusions in this study the 52 year daily observed data of water level in the poyang lake are decomposed into seasonal trend and residual components by taking advantage of the seasonal trend decomposition based on loess stl both interannual and annual variations of water level are clarified and the impacts of different factors on the water level variation in the poyang lake are discussed the main findings of the study are summarized as follows 1 there is an obvious drop of water level in the poyang lake after the operation of tgd it is found that the average water level in the poyang lake is decreased by about 0 82 m interannually and 1 90 m in the impounding season of tgd after 2003 2 tgd accounts for a major portion of the annual variation of the water level the water level is increased in the draining season and decreased in the impounding season and the operation of tgd accounts for 44 44 of the total drop 3 the water level in the poyang lake varies spatially in recent decades the effect of the yangtze river is stronger in the northern area that is close to the yangtze river than that in the southern area the slopes of the water surfaces in the poyang lake become flatter in the northern area but steeper in the southern area which is mainly due to the bathymetric change of the poyang lake 4 the operation of tgd results in positive hydrological changes in the poyang lake tgd plays a critical role in the flood and drought control and it can reduce the amplitude of water level variation anywhere in the poyang lake and control the maximum and minimum water levels this study provides valuable insights into the hydrological effects of tgd on the poyang lake and improves our understanding of the relationship between the poyang lake and the yangtze river so that better water resource management strategies can be developed for the poyang lake this study also provides important insights into the environmental and ecological responses to hydrological changes uncited references yuan et al 2012 credit

3764,deep rooted forest trees can potentially utilize moisture in deep soil to tolerate periods when growth is water limited black locust r pseudoacacia is a deep rooted forest species but the benefits of deep roots for water uptake under drought conditions are unclear in this study we assessed the effects of drought on water storage and the hydrological properties of soil at different depths we performed a precipitation manipulation experiment continuously from june 2015 to november 2016 using mature r pseudoacacia in the loess plateau region of china the soil volumetric water contents were measured in the 0 4 m soil layer as well as the soil hydrological properties comprising the soil bulk density bd total porosity saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and aggregate associated organic carbon oc concentration in the 0 20 cm soil layer the results showed that soil water storage deficit mainly occurred in the 0 1 m soil layer rather than in the 1 4 m layer after excluding precipitation for two years compared with the control excluding precipitation for two years decreased the soil water storage in the 0 1 m soil layer by 18 precipitation exclusion also significantly decreased the soil ks by 28 and total porosity by 17 but increased bd by 20 in the 0 10 cm soil layer in addition precipitation exclusion significantly decreased the total soil oc concentration and macro and micro associated oc concentrations our results indicate that excluding precipitation for two years could potentially degrade the water conditions in the topsoil layer but not the deeper soil these findings provide insights into water management and sustainability in semi humid afforestation areas of the loess plateau region in china keywords forest loess plateau precipitation exclusion soil hydrological property soil water storage deficit 1 introduction increased water stress in semi humid regions is becoming a major concern as global warming progresses arnell 1999 ostad ali askar et al 2018 this problem is demonstrated by the drying trend in the loess plateau region of china which is facing increasing water shortages deng et al 2016 deng et al 2017 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2011 the soil water content is the key factor that limits ecological restoration in the loess plateau region high water consumption by vegetation aggravates the dryness of the soil and leads to declines in plant productivity brookshire and weaver 2015 the soil water dynamics are vital components of the hydrological cycle and they can be affected by various factors including precipitation seneviratne et al 2010 soil organic carbon oc breuer et al 2006 porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks wang et al 2012 as well as the soil depth wang et al 2012 therefore understanding the hydrological properties and water processes in soil is critical for effectively managing water resources and thus successful revegetation in this semi humid region

water content and soil water storage zhang and shangguan 2016 the soil depth is strongly associated with the physiology and respiration rates of tree roots in general the moisture in soil surface layers is greatly influenced by rainfall infiltration or evapotranspiration and it provides a source of water to support the growth of vegetation xue et al 2017 however the soil moisture in deeper layers remains relatively stable during the growth of vegetation due to the insulating effect of the upper soil rasmussen et al 2020 nakhforoosh et al 2021 yang et al 2017 found that deep soil water may contribute significantly to avoiding the effects of drought over the dry period but the shallow soil water available to the fine roots during the dry season may determine tree growth therefore the relationship between the growth of vegetation and water at different soil depths is fundamental for determining the availability of water and nutrients to plants and it may be important for

of its rapid growth and ability to resist drought and thus it has been planted in the loess plateau region wei et al 2009 qiu et al 2010 mantovani et al 2015 however during the last 30 years dramatic climate change has occurred in the dryland regions that dominate north china where soil moisture is a significant component of the overall terrestrial water resources nemani et al 2003 furthermore plants affect soil water storage by forming a pathway for the transport of soil water to the atmosphere via their root systems wang et al 2010 as a consequence the soil water content has decreased dramatically after the restoration of vegetation in this region jia et al 2017 thus it is necessary to understand the changes in the soil water storage under drought conditions and the most important associated factors in soil layers at different depths in the present study we performed a continuous precipitation manipulation experiment from june 2015 to november 2016 using mature r pseudoacacia in the loess plateau region of china we measured the soil volumetric water content in the 0 400 cm soil layer and the soil hydrological properties in the 0 20 cm soil layer including the soil bd total

the deeper layer due to the root distribution and ii precipitation exclusion would have negative effects on the hydrological properties of the topsoil layer our main objectives were to assess the effects of drought on the soil water storage and soil hydrological properties at different soil depths the results obtained in this study provide new insights that may facilitate land water management

volumetric water content in the 0 1 m soil depth was significantly lower during 2016 due to precipitation exclusion p 0 05 furthermore the distributions of the soil volumetric water contents in the 0 4 m soil layer under the two treatments during 2015 and 2016 are shown in fig 2 precipitation exclusion significantly affected the soil volumetric water content and the values were lower than those under the control fig 2 in particular precipitation exclusion had a pronounced effect on the soil volumetric water content in the 0 1 m soil layer during 2016 but not in the soil layer from 1 m to 4 m p 0 05 fig 2 3 2 soil water storage and deficit the changes in soil water storage in each soil layer after excluding precipitation for two years are shown in fig 3 in the 0 4 m soil depth the changes in the soil water storage under precipitation exclusion were more obvious during 2016 than 2015 in addition the soil water storage in the 0 4 m soil depth was lower under precipitation exclusion compared with the control during 2016 especially in the topsoil layer 0 1 m p 0 01 in general precipitation exclusion significantly decreased the soil water storage in the 0 1 m soil layer soil water storage deficit occurred under the control with a range from 27 2 to 32 8 fig 3a after excluding precipitation for two years the soil water storage deficit in the 0 1 m soil depth was significantly higher during 2016 than 2015 p 0 05 fig 3b throughout the soil profile the soil water storage deficit during 2016 was greatest 50 5 in the 0 1 m soil depth and it decreased as the soil depth increased fig 3b below a soil depth of 1 m the soil water storage deficit during 2016 was 40 but it was still higher than that in 2015 3 3 soil hydrological properties in general the soil bd total porosity and ks changed significantly during the precipitation exclusion process fig 4 in the surface soil layer 0 10 cm bd increased significantly p 0 05 from 1 18 g cm 3 to 1 32 g cm 3 after precipitation exclusion fig 4a the total porosity and ks values in the 0 10 cm soil layer were significantly lower under precipitation exclusion compared with the control p 0 05 fig 4b 4c the soil bd total porosity and ks in the 10 20 cm soil layer did not differ significantly between the two treatments the aggregate associated oc concentration was generally higher under the control than precipitation exclusion fig 5 in both the 0 10 and 10 20 cm soil layers the aggregate associated oc concentration decreased as the aggregate size decreased according to the following order macro aggregates micro aggregates silt clay in the 0 10 cm soil layer the oc concentration was significantly lower under precipitation exclusion for the macro and micro aggregate classes i e 25 lower in the macro aggregates and 22 lower in the micro aggregates p 0 05 whereas precipitation exclusion had not significant effect on the oc concentration in the silt clay oc fraction fig 5a the aggregate associated oc concentration in the 10 20 cm soil layer did not differ significantly between the two treatments fig 5b 4 discussion 4 1 effects of precipitation exclusion on soil water storage soil water is replenished by infiltration from rainfall or recharge from groundwater and this water is removed from the soil by evaporation and root uptake for transpiration or it is lost to deeper layers due to drainage and percolation into groundwater arnell 1999 dash et al 2021 these inputs and outputs lead to the variable and continuous redistribution of water within soils shen et al 2014 in our study region with a lack of surface water resources rainfall is considered the sole source of soil water storage zeng et al 2011 thus in the present study in situ soil moisture measurements indicated a significant decline in the moisture content of the topsoil layer after excluding precipitation for two years but not in the deep soil fig 1b 3 4 meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 and seneviratne et al 2010 also found that the soil moisture content of the upper soil layers was influenced greatly by transpiration by plants and soil evaporation in the upper layers the combination of transpiration by vegetation and soil evaporation can consume as much as 60 of the total precipitation input oki and kanae 2006 in an extreme example wang et al 2011 found that transpiration and evaporation consumed 90 of the total precipitation in a study conducted on the loess plateau in the present study the combination of low precipitation and high evapotranspiration mainly explain the decrease in the soil water content of the topsoil layer therefore the different responses of the topsoil and deep soil layer to drought conditions may be explained by i greater evapotranspiration affecting the topsoil layer and ii low infiltration due to the decrease in the capillary force as the soil depth increases nakhforoosh et al 2021 thus r pseudoacacia mainly acquired water from the 0 1 m depth during drought conditions our results highlight the benefit of deep root growth for water uptake in forests but they also suggest that the uptake of water from the deep soil is limited under prolonged drought conditions when little water is available in the topsoil 4 2 changes in soil hydrological properties determining the soil hydrological properties is important for understanding the movement of soil water and predicting parameters that might affect agronomic and environmental projects in the study region zhang et al 2006 our results showed that excluding 40 of the precipitation for two years had negative effects on the soil hydrological properties investigated in this study such as reductions in the total porosity and ks in the 0 10 cm soil layer but an increase in bd fig 4 in particular precipitation exclusion increased the bd in the 0 10 cm soil layer fig 4a possibly due to the lower fine root biomass and porosity of the surface soil layer zhang et al 2019b similarly a previous study showed that drought negatively affected the properties of the surface soil yuksek 2009 in the 10 20 cm soil layer the bd did not differ significantly after excluding 40 of the precipitation for two years thereby suggesting that excluding precipitation for two years had no obvious effects on the bd in the deeper soil layers the total porosity of soil is a highly dynamic property that is affected by numerous natural and human related factors and thus assessing its temporal variability is essential for accurately understanding soil processes during restoration bodner et al 2013 in the present study the total porosity decreased in the 0 10 cm soil layer after excluding 40 of the precipitation for two years fig 4b mainly because the porosity might have been decreased by the lower input of litter from the aboveground biomass and its incorporation into the soil was reduced after precipitation exclusion commenced wu et al 2016 yang et al 2017 rasmussen et al 2020 furthermore these findings indicate that the proportion of macro pore spaces in the drought treated soil decreased as the total porosity decreased wang et al 2012 this decrease in the macro pore volume implies that ks and the water holding capacity also decreased thereby preventing the effective infiltration of precipitation and aeration of the deeper soil layers to hinder plant root growth and vegetation development wang et al 2008 in general ks is a parameter that integrates several physical characteristics such as the bd porosity and mechanical composition wu et al 2016 the mean ks value for all of the soil samples was significantly higher than the values reported previously 0 05 0 58 mm min 1 for soils in the central and southern regions of the loess plateau mainly due to differences in soil parent materials in this region wang et al 2008 the ks values in the 0 10 cm soil layer were significantly higher for the control soil than the soil under precipitation exclusion p 0 05 but the differences were not significant in the 10 20 cm soil layer fig 4c thereby indicating that excluding precipitation for two years reduced the ks value in the surface soil layer under both the control and precipitation exclusion treatments we found that the macro aggregate and micro aggregate associated oc concentrations were higher than the soil oc concentrations and also greater than those in the silt clay fractions in all soil layers fig 5 zhang et al 2019a in general the soil oc concentrations were higher in the macro aggregates than micro aggregates under both treatments these results agree with the aggregate hierarchy concept where micro aggregates are bound together into macro aggregates by transient and temporary binding agents tisdall and oades 1982 this aggregate hierarchy and the important role of organic matter in soil aggregation have been demonstrated in temperate forest land kabiri et al 2015 in agreement with our hypothesis excluding precipitation for two years had significant negative effects on the soil oc concentrations in macro aggregates and micro aggregates fig 5 this negative effect of drought on the aggregate associated oc concentration is similar to the results obtained in temperate forests su et al 2020 these results demonstrate that changes in the oc concentrations in macro aggregates or micro aggregates can be used as sensitive indicators of the effects of management six et al 2002 in the present study we found that excluding precipitation for two years significantly decreased the above and below ground biomass of the understory vegetation zhang et al 2019a in general the transfer of nutrients between soils and plants can lead to the rapid stabilization of c in days to weeks he et al 2006 due to the presence of fresh plant litter on the soil surface as well as the input of residues from understory vegetation into the surface soil layer li et al 2021 consequently excluding precipitation for two years significantly decreased the soil aggregate associated oc concentrations in the 0 10 cm soil layer we also observed that the 10 20 cm soil layer had a lower aggregate associated oc concentration than the 0 10 cm soil layer fig 5 possibly because the fine root biomass was greater in the 0 10 cm soil depth cheng et al 2006 zhang et al 2019b and thus more organic matter was incorporated into the surface soil these results are consistent with those reported by by six and jastrow 2002 and they indicate that the oc concentration was more stable in the 10 20 cm soil layer than the 0 10 cm soil layer despite excluding precipitation for two years 5 conclusions in this study we found that excluding precipitation for two years modified the soil water storage in different soil layers in the 0 400 cm soil depth the soil water storage in the surface layer 0 100 cm decreased after excluding precipitation for two years but this was not the case in the deeper soil 100 400 cm excluding 40 of the precipitation for two years led to significantly lower ks and total porosity values but the bd was higher in the 0 10 cm soil layer precipitation exclusion also significantly decreased the total soil oc concentrations and macro and micro associated oc concentrations in the 0 10 cm soil layer after two years in addition excluding precipitation for two years mainly affected the soil hydrological properties and oc concentrations down to a depth of 10 cm based on these results we conclude that the shallow soil water is probably highly vulnerable to the effects of drought in dry periods our results highlight the importance of considering the differences in the extraction of water from shallow and deep soil layers when trying to explain the variations in evapotranspiration in ecosystems credit authorship

3764,deep rooted forest trees can potentially utilize moisture in deep soil to tolerate periods when growth is water limited black locust r pseudoacacia is a deep rooted forest species but the benefits of deep roots for water uptake under drought conditions are unclear in this study we assessed the effects of drought on water storage and the hydrological properties of soil at different depths we performed a precipitation manipulation experiment continuously from june 2015 to november 2016 using mature r pseudoacacia in the loess plateau region of china the soil volumetric water contents were measured in the 0 4 m soil layer as well as the soil hydrological properties comprising the soil bulk density bd total porosity saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and aggregate associated organic carbon oc concentration in the 0 20 cm soil layer the results showed that soil water storage deficit mainly occurred in the 0 1 m soil layer rather than in the 1 4 m layer after excluding precipitation for two years compared with the control excluding precipitation for two years decreased the soil water storage in the 0 1 m soil layer by 18 precipitation exclusion also significantly decreased the soil ks by 28 and total porosity by 17 but increased bd by 20 in the 0 10 cm soil layer in addition precipitation exclusion significantly decreased the total soil oc concentration and macro and micro associated oc concentrations our results indicate that excluding precipitation for two years could potentially degrade the water conditions in the topsoil layer but not the deeper soil these findings provide insights into water management and sustainability in semi humid afforestation areas of the loess plateau region in china keywords forest loess plateau

volumetric water content in the 0 1 m soil depth was significantly lower during 2016 due to precipitation exclusion p 0 05 furthermore the distributions of the soil volumetric water contents in the 0 4 m soil layer under the two treatments during 2015 and 2016 are shown in fig 2 precipitation exclusion significantly affected the soil volumetric water content and the values were lower than those under the control fig 2 in particular precipitation exclusion had a pronounced effect on the soil volumetric water content in the 0 1 m soil layer during 2016 but not in the soil layer from 1 m to 4 m p 0 05 fig 2 3 2 soil water storage and deficit the changes in soil water storage in each soil layer after excluding precipitation for two years are shown in fig 3 in the 0 4 m soil depth the changes in the soil water storage under precipitation exclusion were more obvious during 2016 than 2015 in addition the soil water storage in the 0 4 m soil depth was lower under precipitation exclusion compared with the control during 2016 especially in the topsoil layer 0 1 m p 0 01 in general precipitation exclusion significantly decreased the soil water storage in the 0 1 m soil layer soil water storage deficit occurred under the control with a range from 27 2 to 32 8 fig 3a after excluding precipitation for two years the soil water storage deficit in the 0 1 m soil depth was significantly higher during 2016 than 2015 p 0 05 fig 3b throughout the soil profile the soil water storage deficit during 2016 was greatest 50 5 in the 0 1 m soil depth and it decreased as the soil depth increased fig 3b below a soil depth of 1 m the soil water storage deficit during 2016 was 40 but it was still higher than that in 2015 3 3 soil hydrological properties in general the soil bd total porosity and ks changed significantly during the precipitation exclusion process fig 4 in the surface soil layer 0 10 cm bd increased significantly p 0 05 from 1 18 g cm 3 to 1 32 g cm 3 after precipitation exclusion fig 4a the total porosity and ks values in the 0 10 cm soil layer were significantly lower under precipitation exclusion compared with the control p 0 05 fig 4b 4c the soil bd total porosity and ks in the 10 20 cm soil layer did not differ significantly between the two treatments the aggregate associated oc concentration was generally higher under the control than precipitation exclusion fig 5 in both the 0 10 and 10 20 cm soil layers the aggregate associated oc concentration decreased as the aggregate size decreased according to the following order macro aggregates micro aggregates silt clay in the 0 10 cm soil layer the oc concentration was significantly lower under precipitation exclusion for the macro and micro aggregate classes i e 25 lower in the macro aggregates and 22 lower in the micro aggregates p 0 05 whereas precipitation exclusion had not significant effect on the oc concentration in the silt clay oc fraction fig 5a the aggregate associated oc concentration in the 10 20 cm soil layer did not differ significantly between the two treatments fig 5b 4 discussion 4 1 effects of precipitation exclusion on soil water storage soil water is replenished by infiltration from rainfall or recharge from groundwater and this water is removed from the soil by evaporation and root uptake for transpiration or it is lost to deeper layers due to drainage and percolation into groundwater arnell 1999 dash et al 2021 these inputs and outputs lead to the variable and continuous redistribution of water within soils shen et al 2014 in our study region with a lack of surface water resources rainfall is considered the sole source of soil water storage zeng et al 2011 thus in the present study in situ soil moisture measurements indicated a significant decline in the moisture content of the topsoil layer after excluding precipitation for two years but not in the deep soil fig 1b 3 4 meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 and seneviratne et al 2010 also found that the soil moisture content of the upper soil layers was influenced greatly by transpiration by plants and soil evaporation in the upper layers the combination of transpiration by vegetation and soil evaporation can consume as much as 60 of the total precipitation input oki and kanae 2006 in an extreme example wang et al 2011 found that transpiration and evaporation consumed 90 of the total precipitation in a study conducted on the loess plateau in the present study the combination of low precipitation and high evapotranspiration mainly explain the decrease in the soil water content of the topsoil layer therefore the different responses of the topsoil and deep soil layer to drought conditions may be explained by i greater evapotranspiration affecting the topsoil layer and ii low infiltration due to the decrease in the capillary force as the soil depth increases nakhforoosh et al 2021 thus r pseudoacacia mainly acquired water from the 0 1 m depth during drought conditions our results highlight the benefit of deep root growth for water uptake in forests but they also suggest that the uptake of water from the deep soil is limited under prolonged drought conditions when little water is available in the topsoil 4 2 changes in soil hydrological properties determining the soil hydrological properties is important for understanding the movement of soil water and predicting parameters that might affect agronomic and environmental projects in the study region zhang et al 2006 our results showed that excluding 40 of the precipitation for two years had negative effects on the soil hydrological properties investigated in this study such as reductions in the total porosity and ks in the 0 10 cm soil layer but an increase in bd fig 4 in particular precipitation exclusion increased the bd in the 0 10 cm soil layer fig 4a possibly due to the lower fine root biomass and porosity of the surface soil layer zhang et al 2019b similarly a previous study showed that drought negatively affected the properties of the surface soil yuksek 2009 in the 10 20 cm soil layer the bd did not differ significantly after excluding 40 of the precipitation for two years thereby suggesting that excluding precipitation for two years had no obvious effects on the bd in the deeper soil layers the total porosity of soil is a highly dynamic property that is affected by numerous natural and human related factors and thus assessing its temporal variability is essential for accurately understanding soil processes during restoration bodner et al 2013 in the present study the total porosity decreased in the 0 10 cm soil layer after excluding 40 of the precipitation for two years fig 4b mainly because the porosity might have been decreased by the lower input of litter from the aboveground biomass and its incorporation into the soil was reduced after precipitation exclusion commenced wu et al 2016 yang et al 2017 rasmussen et al 2020 furthermore these findings indicate that the proportion of macro pore spaces in the drought treated soil decreased as the total porosity decreased wang et al 2012 this decrease in the macro pore volume implies that ks and the water holding capacity also decreased thereby preventing the effective infiltration of precipitation and aeration of the deeper soil layers to hinder plant root growth and vegetation development wang et al 2008 in general ks is a parameter that integrates several physical characteristics such as the bd porosity and mechanical composition wu et al 2016 the mean ks value for all of the soil samples was significantly higher than the values reported previously 0 05 0 58 mm min 1 for soils in the central and southern regions of the loess plateau mainly due to differences in soil parent materials in this region wang et al 2008 the ks values in the 0 10 cm soil layer were significantly higher for the control soil than the soil under precipitation exclusion p 0 05 but the differences were not significant in the 10 20 cm soil layer fig 4c thereby indicating that excluding precipitation for two years reduced the ks value in the surface soil layer under both the control and precipitation exclusion treatments we found that the macro aggregate and micro aggregate associated oc concentrations were higher than the soil oc concentrations and also greater than those in the silt clay fractions in all soil layers fig 5 zhang et al 2019a in general the soil oc concentrations were higher in the macro aggregates than micro aggregates under both treatments these results agree with the aggregate hierarchy concept where micro aggregates are bound together into macro aggregates by transient and temporary binding agents tisdall and oades 1982 this aggregate hierarchy and the important role of organic matter in soil aggregation have been demonstrated in temperate forest land kabiri et al 2015 in agreement with our hypothesis excluding precipitation for two years had significant negative effects on the soil oc concentrations in macro aggregates and micro aggregates fig 5 this negative effect of drought on the aggregate associated oc concentration is similar to the results obtained in temperate forests su et al 2020 these results demonstrate that changes in the oc concentrations in macro aggregates or micro aggregates can be used as sensitive indicators of the effects of management six et al 2002 in the present study we found that excluding precipitation for two years significantly decreased the above and below ground biomass of the understory vegetation zhang et al 2019a in general the transfer of nutrients between soils and plants can lead to the rapid stabilization of c in days to weeks he et al 2006 due to the presence of fresh plant litter on the soil surface as well as the input of residues from understory vegetation into the surface soil layer li et al 2021 consequently excluding precipitation for two years significantly decreased the soil aggregate associated oc concentrations in the 0 10 cm soil layer we also observed that the 10 20 cm soil layer had a lower aggregate associated oc concentration than the 0 10 cm soil layer fig 5 possibly because the fine root biomass was greater in the 0 10 cm soil depth cheng et al 2006 zhang et al 2019b and thus more organic matter was incorporated into the surface soil these results are consistent with those reported by by six and jastrow 2002 and they indicate that the oc concentration was more stable in the 10 20 cm soil layer than the 0 10 cm soil layer despite excluding precipitation for two years 5 conclusions in this study we found that excluding precipitation for two years modified the soil water storage in different soil layers in the 0 400 cm soil depth the soil water storage in the surface layer 0 100 cm decreased after excluding precipitation for two years but this was not the case in the deeper soil 100 400 cm excluding 40 of the precipitation for two years led to significantly lower ks and total porosity values but the bd was higher in the 0 10 cm soil layer precipitation exclusion also significantly decreased the total soil oc concentrations and macro and micro associated oc concentrations in the 0 10 cm soil layer after two years in addition excluding precipitation for two years mainly affected the soil hydrological properties and oc concentrations down to a depth of 10 cm based on these results we conclude that the shallow soil water is probably highly vulnerable to the effects of drought in dry periods our results highlight the importance of considering the differences in the extraction of water from shallow and deep soil layers when trying to explain the variations in evapotranspiration in ecosystems credit authorship
