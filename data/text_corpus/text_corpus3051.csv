15255,antibiotic resistance genes args as emerging environmental contaminants pose severe global risks to public health and ecosystems municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps are crucial transmitters for the dissemination and propagation of args into receiving water bodies via mobile genetic elements mges however the comprehensive and deep deciphering of the diversity abundance and potential hosts of args in two distinct altitudinal wwtps is scarce in this work we revealed the elevational distribution characteristics of the resistance genes and microbial community of six wwtps from two distinct geographical zones a low elevation le region shandong 10 22 m above sea level and a high elevation he region gansu 1 520 1 708 m above sea level significant elevational variations in the diversity and relative abundance of resistance genes were observed wastewater treatment could significantly reduce the concentrations of args and mges by about 1 2 and 2 3 orders of magnitude respectively however above 69 95 of resistance genes were enriched in effluent in particular 24 arg subtype 3 mge subtypes and 59 bacterial genera were persistent in all samples more potential hosts for args in le region and more abundant human gut microbiota in he region were identified this work provides helpful information for controlling the spread of args for their management and assessment thereby mitigating the risks of args in wwtps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistance genes wastewater treatment elevation human gut microbiota co occurrence patterns data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction recently antibiotic resistance genes args originated from the widespread use of large amounts of antibiotics have become a serious threat worldwide due to potential health risks to humans and animals bengtsson palme et al 2019 martinez et al 2015 qin et al 2020 municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps representing a particular human society interactive interface can potentially provide selective pressure for args and are pivotal reservoirs of args spreading into the environment sui et al 2019 wang et al 2020 additionally wwtps are also regarded as transport hotspots for horizontal gene transfer hgt mediated by mobile genetic elements mges enabling a more extensive dissemination of args in the environment rizzo et al 2013 karkman et al 2016 guo et al 2017 the last decades have brought substantial insight into the role of the wwtps in the fate of resistance genes yang et al 2014 ju et al 2016 su et al 2017 ping et al 2022 for example yang et al 2014 investigating the occurrence abundance and removal of args in sewage treatment plants found that the influent had a higher abundance and diversity of total args in comparison with activated sludge and effluent and about 98 8 of total args could be efficiently eliminated from sewage furthermore su et al 2017 investigated the distribution characteristics of resistomes and microbiomes from municipal sewage of 32 wwtps in 17 major chinese cities they detected a total of 381 extensively shared resistance subtypes with significant seasonal variation but no geographical clustering additionally both intracellular and extracellular args in full scale wastewater treatment plant was investigated liu et al 2018 especially proliferation of args and mges among particle associated assemblages free living bacteria and cell free dna in two full scale wwtps was evaluated yu et al 2020a b emphasis has been placed on the spatial ecological effect of args from wwtps effluent into the receiving ecosystems which affected the ecological functions of the aquatic environment czekalski et al 2014 karkman et al 2016 quintela baluja et al 2019 these observations demonstrated that numerous args were significantly enriched in downstream from wwtps typically the investigations were done in freshwater lake sediment czekalski et al 2014 and surface sediment karkman et al 2016 near municipal wwtps effluent discharge pipes the authors found that the discharged effluent increased the abundances of various args in the sediments and the enriched resistance genes might induce the hgt potential in wastewater therefore these works clearly highlight the importance of wwtps effluent sterilization calling for enhanced treatment processes to maximize the effectiveness in the removal of resistance genes from wwtps activated sludge is a complex microbial consortium and the central functional body in biological treatment processes saunders et al 2015 it accelerates the hgt process of resistance genes among microbial communities yang et al 2013 osińska et al 2019 li et al 2020a and numerous microorganisms in the activated sludge are putative hosts of the args identified in wwtps an et al 2018 liu et al 2019 ping et al 2022 hence the application of excess activated sludge used as fertilizer signified can spread antibiotic resistant bacteria arb that carry args causing environmental contamination bouki et al 2013 against this background it is crucial to consider the effects of args released from wwtps on ecological sustainability and human and animal health tang et al 2016 the geographic elevation of wwtps has been recognized as a key factor that affects the microbial community composition in the activated sludge system microbial characteristics mainly depend on some important environmental elements such as temperature dissolved oxygen and ph which are tightly associated with the wwtps location seib et al 2016 niu et al 2016 thus significant geographical discrepancies of microbial community structures in activated sludge have been reported zhang et al 2012 fang et al 2018 in particular fang et al 2018 proved that microbial diversity was negatively correlated with the elevation of wwtps in addition the authors found a unique microbial community structure and a coherence of biomarkers in wwtps located in plateau regions moreover geographic location of wwtps was the largest contributor to explain 23 3 of the microbial community variation in activated sludge sun et al 2022 based on the above mentioned conclusions we predicatively speculate that resistance genes in wwtps are likely to be affected by the latitude of the wwtp location however earlier studies have so far failed to provide a deep insight into the role of the wwtps latitude in affecting the dynamics of args and arb this study represents a first effort to reveal the emergence dissemination and propagation of resistance genes among full scale municipal wwtps in low elevation and high elevation regions furthermore the interactions among resistance genes microbial communities and operational parameters were also comprehensively evaluated our works can provide a more extensive insight into the fate of resistance genes during wastewater treatment processes and are beneficial to the guidance of the operation of wwtps for maximizing the effectiveness in resistance genes removal in this work a total of 54 raw influent activated sludge and effluent samples were collected from six municipal wwtps in china three wwtps were located in a low elevation region le and three in a high elevation region he high throughput quantitative pcr ht qpcr and illumina miseq sequencing technology were implemented to uncover the distribution characteristic of resistance genes and microbial populations between these two regions and to evaluate the elimination of resistance genes through wastewater treatment we also revealed the important potential hosts of args by network analysis we expected to obtain an in depth understanding of the resistance genes and bacterial population in these two regions and to provide useful data for the mitigation of resistance gene spread into the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and microbial dna extraction for this study six municipal wwtps located in two different geographical locations in china shandong province qingdao and yantai 10 22 m above sea level and gansu province lanzhou 1 520 1 708 m were selected

bacterial genera of the human gut microbiota were identified in all samples with 168 genera in le and 192 genera in he supplementary materials ii fig s10a these gut bacteria accounted for an average

proteobacteria bacteriodetes firmicutes acidobacteria epsilonbacteraeota fusobacteria planctomycetes and patescibacteria by comparing the average degree of the network analysis supplementary materials ⅳ table s1 the co occurrence pattern between resistance genes and bacterial genera fig 5a was significantly looser than that among the bacterial genera supplementary materials ii fig s13a and 14a and

observed in influent supplementary materials ii fig s13b s14b s15b except for the resistance genes in he influent supplementary materials ii fig s16b furthermore vpa was conducted to distinguish the contribution of three elements including microbial communities mges and environmental factors to the args profile about 87 3 and 97 8 of the variations in args was depicted by these three elements in le region supplementary materials ii fig s17a and he region supplementary materials ii fig s17b respectively environmental factors in le region and interaction of genera and mges in he region were the most central contributors and accounted for 68 3 and 53 2 of the total args dynamics respectively 4 discussion municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps are important transport hotspots of resistance genes a total of 54 influent activated sludge and effluent samples were taken from six full scale municipal wwtps located at le and he regions to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that comprehensively evaluates the characteristics of antibiotic resistance genes in wwtps at different elevations using the high throughput sequencing technology abundant resistance genes including args and mges were detected in influent samples although most of these could be efficiently removed throughout the treatment process many residual resistance genes were persistent and enriched in activated sludge and effluent samples highlighting that wwtps are potential transmitters for the proliferation spread and dissemination of resistance genes from human society into the natural environments the wwtps influent harbored the most abundant and diverse resistance genes and microbial populations which was in agreement with previous findings yang et al 2014 karkman et al 2016 an et al 2018 generally wwtps received various types of wastewater mainly from households hospitals and the livestock industry containing residual antibiotics li et al 2020a b in china large amounts of antibiotics are applied in hospital settings and as livestock growth promoters zhang et al 2015 approximately 162 000 tons of antibiotics are used yearly of which 46 enter aquatic systems via the effluent of municipal wwtps qiao et al 2018 shen et al 2022 higher abundances of resistance genes and resistant bacterial populations are frequently detected in a variety of water environments such as wastewater surface water groundwater and even drinking water zhang et al 2009 about 34 1 arg subtype and 33 3 mge subtype exhibited significant differences in the relative abundance between le wwtps and he wwtps p 0 05 deterministic processes i e non random might play a crucial role in shaping the bacterial genetic community across a municipal landscape hassell et al 2019 these deterministic ecological processes such as environmental change and microbial interaction could also regulate the assembly of arg communities in coastal sand habitat hu et al 2019 and freshwater bodies corno et al 2019 moreover previous researches reported the microbial community structure in biological process was shaped by geographical distribution treatment processes operational parameters and water qualities seib et al 2016 fang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 various environmental factors might trigger the conformation of unique bacterial community ge et al 2015 kanda et al 2017 significant discrepancies among bacterial communities in activated sludge samples from wwtps in different geographical areas were also observed zhang et al 2019 the microbial communities were the major factors driving the distribution of args because lots of bacterial genera were possible potential bacterial hosts harboring args zhou et al 2017 overall synergistic effect of multiple elements including environmental factors microbial interaction and mges could obviously regulate the spread patterns of args in geographical wwtps thus in he region particular environmental conditions such as low temperature and high do values underlying args community assembly might act as the key driving forces for the fate of resistance genes in wwtps compared with he region le region revealed a significantly higher diversity and abundance of resistance genes p 0 01 this result was in agreement with the findings of su et al 2017 who reported a higher geographical burden of resistance genes in municipal influent in eastern regions of china the geographical distribution of antibiotic consumption in major cities in china possibly provided potential explanation for the elevational variation of resistance genes within the municipal wastewater han et al 2022 the authors clearly showed that the average consumption of eight antibiotics in the eastern region 1 256 2 1 105 1 mg 1 000 inh d was about 1 27 times higher than that in the western region 988 3 474 5 mg 1 000 inh d furthermore the stimulation of antibiotics in activated sludge bioreactors remarkably governs the composition and abundance of microbial community and resistance genes zhao et al 2019 these results indicated that the geographical gradient of antibiotics consumption could actuate the selective pressure of antibiotics release into wwtps and further regulate the microbial community and its antimicrobial resistance it is worth noting that this work involved limitation due to the fact that a limited number of samples were collected from wwtps only in winter thus detailed seasonal variations in resistance genes could not be evaluated although su et al 2017 investigated the seasonal distributions of antibiotic resistance genes from chinese municipal sewage and found that the relative abundance of resistance genes in summer august 2014 was significantly higher than that in winter february 2014 p 0 01 more in depth study on the detailed seasonal variation of resistance genes in wwtps were needed in the future slightly greater absolute concentrations of resistance genes 2 14 times of args and 1 1 times of megs were observed in he wwtps compared to le wwtps p 0 05 in contrast to the relative abundances of resistance genes this might be explained by the lower temperature of winter in he region based on previous findings the absolute concentration of resistances genes in wastewater significantly increased with the transition from a hot summer to a cold winter specifically su et al 2017 investigated the seasonal distributions of bacteria from chinese municipal sewage and found that the bacterial density in winter sewage 1 21 1012 cells l was much greater than that in summer sewage 1 70 1011 cells l furthermore caucci et al 2016 demonstrated that args levels were indeed higher in autumn and winter in comparison with spring and summer this major reason for such seasonal disparity was that higher bacterial population density in winter wastewater moreover there was not only a significant decrease in the absolute abundance approximately two orders of magnitude but also in relative abundances about 94 4 of resistance genes from influent to effluent throughout the treatment process in this work this result was lower than that found in a previous study yang et al 2014 where args were effectively eliminated with a removal efficiency above 99 8 the different removal effectiveness for resistance genes and the microbial population among different wwtps can mainly be explained by the various factors including the purification process wastewater quality microbial population and operating parameters therefore how to enhance the removal of resistance genes in wwtps by optimizing their design and operation is still a great challenge although the wwtps can efficiently and economically eliminate resistance genes from municipal wastewater mcconnell et al 2018 le et al 2018 certain resistance genes are highly enriched with fc values from several to ten thousand folds after the biological treatment processes an et al 2018 in the current study of 27 persistent resistance genes more than 40 were distinctly enriched in sludge and effluent this could be explained by selection pressure which favors the preservation of resistance genes and the microbial bacteria carrying args or hgt within the microbial community karkman et al 2016 sharma et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 when the wwtp effluent is directly discharged into the receiving aquatic environment or excess activated sludge is reused as fertilizer residual resistance genes and resistant bacteria can severely threaten public and environmental health wang and chen 2022 hence nowadays more efficient technologies such as membrane bioreactors coagulation and membrane filtration and advanced oxidation should be adopted for inactivation of persistent antimicrobial resistance genes wang and chen 2022 in this study among the predicted potential hosts the proportion of multidrug resistant bacteria which was associated with at least three or more resistance genes in he 38 2 was 1 33 times higher than that in le 28 8 the proportion was about 20 0 in the core potential hosts thauera and nitrosomonas as the most abundant multidrug resistant bacteria harbored nine and eight resistance genes respectively in le wwtps the top two multidrug resistant bacteria were thermomonas and denitratisoma in he wwtps harboring seven and six resistance genes respectively moreover the resistance genes mlsb lnub vancomycin vanyb and fluoroquinolone qnrd were carried by 10 8 and 8 microbial bacteria respectively therefore these microbial bacteria genera as potential hosts possibly embodied the risks of multi drug resistance development suggesting that especially for he wwtps the more extensive existence of multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria might generate severe potential threats for public health worldwide in human fecal samples numerous stable resistance genes have been detected transmitted from tap water to human by human gut bacteria yu et al 2022 in this work the human gut bacteria harbored 60 of the core antibiotic resistant bacteria indicating that the human gut bacteria play a crucial part in the further transfer of resistance genes from human feces into the environment by wwtps furthermore among these gut bacterial hosts arcobacter and aeromonas in the wwtps influent were the most prevalent common enteric and emerging opportunistic pathogens respectively cai et al 2013 shi et al 2020 these bacterial pathogens are also potential hosts harboring multiple resistance genes among microbial communities of drinking water han et al 2020 tap water yu et al 2022 and freshwater hatha et al 2005 the findings obtained in this work together with the results from previous research clearly highlight the potential risk of antibiotic resistant pathogen transmission by means of wwtps into the downstream environments 5 conclusion this work shows the elevational patterns of the profiles of the antibiotic resistome and potential hosts of args in municipal wwtps of eastern and western china across above 1500 m elevations elevational dynamics in antibiotic resistance and microbial community were observed wastewater treatment could effectively decrease the diversity abundance and concentration of resistances genes with a reduction in diversity by about 83 2 of arg subtype and 91 4 of mge subtype core shared resistance genes such as aminoglycoside gene aac 3 via sulfonamide gene sul1 new mge gene int1 and multidrug gene qach 351 were discharged into the receiving environment moreover among the 23 shared human gut bacteria 9 core gut bacteria accounting for 60 of the potential args hosts identified were identified as possible hosts of resistance genes indicating that human gut bacteria play an important role in the dissemination of resistance genes in wwtps environmental factors 68 3 in le region and the interaction of genera and mges 53 2 in he region determined the arg variations this study provides insights into the dynamics of resistance genes and microbial populations in wastewater especially for wwtps located in he region the results can be used in the design and operation of wwtps to maximize the elimination of

15255,antibiotic resistance genes args as emerging environmental contaminants pose severe global risks to public health and ecosystems municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps are crucial transmitters for the dissemination and propagation of args into receiving water bodies via mobile genetic elements mges however the comprehensive and deep deciphering of the diversity abundance and potential hosts of args in two distinct altitudinal wwtps is scarce in this work we revealed the elevational distribution characteristics of the resistance genes and microbial community of six wwtps from two distinct geographical zones a low elevation le region shandong 10 22 m above sea level and a high elevation he region gansu 1 520 1 708 m above sea level significant elevational variations in the diversity and relative abundance of resistance genes were observed wastewater treatment could significantly reduce the concentrations of args and mges by about 1 2 and 2 3 orders of magnitude respectively however above 69 95 of resistance genes were enriched in effluent in particular 24 arg subtype 3 mge subtypes and 59 bacterial genera were persistent in all samples more potential hosts for args in le region and more abundant human gut microbiota in he region were identified this work provides helpful information for controlling the spread of args for their management and assessment thereby mitigating the risks of args in wwtps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistance genes wastewater treatment elevation human gut microbiota co occurrence patterns data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction recently antibiotic resistance genes args originated from the widespread use of large amounts of antibiotics have become a serious threat worldwide due to potential health risks to humans and animals bengtsson palme et al 2019 martinez et al 2015 qin et al 2020 municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps representing a particular human society interactive interface can potentially provide selective pressure for args and are pivotal reservoirs of args spreading into the environment sui et al 2019 wang et al 2020 additionally wwtps are also regarded as transport hotspots for horizontal gene transfer hgt mediated by mobile genetic elements mges enabling a more extensive dissemination of args in the environment rizzo et al 2013 karkman et al 2016 guo et al 2017 the last decades have brought substantial insight into the role of the wwtps in the fate of resistance genes yang et al 2014 ju et al 2016 su et al 2017 ping et al 2022 for example yang et al 2014 investigating the occurrence abundance and removal of args in sewage treatment plants found that the influent had a higher abundance and diversity of total args in comparison with activated sludge and effluent and about 98 8 of total args could be efficiently eliminated from sewage furthermore su et al 2017 investigated the distribution characteristics of resistomes and microbiomes from municipal sewage of 32 wwtps in 17 major chinese cities they detected a total of 381 extensively shared resistance subtypes with significant seasonal variation but no geographical clustering additionally both intracellular and extracellular args in full scale wastewater treatment plant was investigated liu et al 2018 especially proliferation of args and mges among particle associated assemblages free living bacteria and cell free dna in two full scale wwtps was evaluated yu et al 2020a b emphasis has been placed on the spatial ecological effect of args from wwtps effluent into the receiving ecosystems which affected the ecological functions of the aquatic environment czekalski et al 2014 karkman et al 2016 quintela baluja et al 2019 these observations demonstrated that numerous args were significantly enriched in downstream from wwtps typically the investigations were done in freshwater lake sediment czekalski et al 2014 and surface sediment karkman et al 2016 near municipal wwtps effluent discharge pipes the authors found that the discharged effluent increased the abundances of various args in the sediments and the enriched resistance genes might induce the hgt potential in wastewater therefore these works clearly highlight the importance of wwtps effluent sterilization calling for enhanced treatment processes to maximize the effectiveness in the removal of resistance genes from wwtps activated sludge is a complex microbial consortium and the central functional body in biological treatment processes saunders et al 2015 it accelerates the hgt process of resistance genes among microbial communities yang et al 2013 osińska et al 2019 li et al 2020a and numerous microorganisms in the activated sludge are putative hosts of the args identified in wwtps an et al 2018 liu et al 2019 ping et al 2022 hence the application of excess activated sludge used as fertilizer signified can spread antibiotic resistant bacteria arb that carry args causing environmental contamination bouki et al 2013 against this background it is crucial to consider the effects of args released from wwtps on ecological sustainability and human and animal health tang et al 2016 the geographic elevation of wwtps has been recognized as a key factor that affects the microbial community composition in the activated sludge system microbial characteristics mainly depend on some important environmental elements such as temperature dissolved oxygen and ph which are tightly associated with the wwtps location seib et al 2016 niu et al 2016 thus significant geographical discrepancies of microbial community structures in activated sludge have been reported zhang et al 2012 fang et al 2018 in particular fang et al 2018 proved that microbial diversity was negatively correlated with the elevation of wwtps in addition the authors found a unique microbial community structure and a coherence of biomarkers in wwtps located in plateau regions moreover geographic location of wwtps was the largest contributor to explain 23 3 of the microbial community variation in activated sludge sun et al 2022 based on the above mentioned conclusions we predicatively speculate that resistance genes in wwtps are likely to be affected by the latitude of the wwtp location however earlier studies have so far failed to provide a deep insight into the role of the wwtps latitude in affecting the dynamics of args and arb this study represents a first effort to reveal the emergence dissemination and propagation of resistance genes among full scale municipal wwtps in low elevation and high elevation regions furthermore the interactions among resistance genes microbial communities and operational parameters were also comprehensively evaluated our works can provide a more extensive insight into the fate of resistance genes during wastewater treatment processes and are beneficial to the guidance of the operation of wwtps for maximizing the effectiveness in resistance genes removal in this work a total of 54 raw influent activated sludge and effluent samples were collected from six municipal wwtps in china three wwtps were located in a low elevation region le and three in a high elevation region he high throughput quantitative pcr ht qpcr and illumina miseq sequencing technology were implemented to uncover the distribution characteristic of resistance genes and microbial populations between these two regions and to evaluate the elimination of resistance genes through wastewater treatment we also revealed the important potential hosts of args by network analysis we expected to obtain an in depth understanding of the resistance genes and bacterial population in these two regions and to provide useful data for the mitigation of resistance gene spread into the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and microbial dna extraction for this study six municipal wwtps located in two different geographical locations in china shandong province qingdao and yantai 10 22 m above sea level and gansu province lanzhou 1 520 1 708 m were selected

among resistance genes supplementary materials ii fig s15a and 16a moreover there were looser connections among the bacterial genera in total le samples supplementary materials ii fig s13a than in

observed in influent supplementary materials ii fig s13b s14b s15b except for the resistance genes in he influent supplementary materials ii fig s16b furthermore vpa was conducted to distinguish the contribution of three elements including microbial communities mges and environmental factors to the args profile about 87 3 and 97 8 of the variations in args was depicted by these three elements in le region supplementary materials ii fig s17a and he region supplementary materials ii fig s17b respectively environmental factors in le region and interaction of genera and mges in he region were the most central contributors and accounted for 68 3 and 53 2 of the total args dynamics respectively 4 discussion municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps are important transport hotspots of resistance genes a total of 54 influent activated sludge and effluent samples were taken from six full scale municipal wwtps located at le and he regions to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that comprehensively evaluates the characteristics of antibiotic resistance genes in wwtps at different elevations using the high throughput sequencing technology abundant resistance genes including args and mges were detected in influent samples although most of these could be efficiently removed throughout the treatment process many residual resistance genes were persistent and enriched in activated sludge and effluent samples highlighting that wwtps are potential transmitters for the proliferation spread and dissemination of resistance genes from human society into the natural environments the wwtps influent harbored the most abundant and diverse resistance genes and microbial populations which was in agreement with previous findings yang et al 2014 karkman et al 2016 an et al 2018 generally wwtps received various types of wastewater mainly from households hospitals and the livestock industry containing residual antibiotics li et al 2020a b in china large amounts of antibiotics are applied in hospital settings and as livestock growth promoters zhang et al 2015 approximately 162 000 tons of antibiotics are used yearly of which 46 enter aquatic systems via the effluent of municipal wwtps qiao et al 2018 shen et al 2022 higher abundances of resistance genes and resistant bacterial populations are frequently detected in a variety of water environments such as wastewater surface water groundwater and even drinking water zhang et al 2009 about 34 1 arg subtype and 33 3 mge subtype exhibited significant differences in the relative abundance between le wwtps and he wwtps p 0 05 deterministic processes i e non random might play a crucial role in shaping the bacterial genetic community across a municipal landscape hassell et al 2019 these deterministic ecological processes such as environmental change and microbial interaction could also regulate the assembly of arg communities in coastal sand habitat hu et al 2019 and freshwater bodies corno et al 2019 moreover previous researches reported the microbial community structure in biological process was shaped by geographical distribution treatment processes operational parameters and water qualities seib et al 2016 fang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 various environmental factors might trigger the conformation of unique bacterial community ge et al 2015 kanda et al 2017 significant discrepancies among bacterial communities in activated sludge samples from wwtps in different geographical areas were also observed zhang et al 2019 the microbial communities were the major factors driving the distribution of args because lots of bacterial genera were possible potential bacterial hosts harboring args zhou et al 2017 overall synergistic effect of multiple elements including environmental factors microbial interaction and mges could obviously regulate the spread patterns of args in geographical wwtps thus in he region particular environmental conditions such as low temperature and high do values underlying args community assembly might act as the key driving forces for the fate of resistance genes in wwtps compared with he region le region revealed a significantly higher diversity and abundance of resistance genes p 0 01 this result was in agreement with the findings of su et al 2017 who reported a higher geographical burden of resistance genes in municipal influent in eastern regions of china the geographical distribution of antibiotic consumption in major cities in china possibly provided potential explanation for the elevational variation of resistance genes within the municipal wastewater han et al 2022 the authors clearly showed that the average consumption of eight antibiotics in the eastern region 1 256 2 1 105 1 mg 1 000 inh d was about 1 27 times higher than that in the western region 988 3 474 5 mg 1 000 inh d furthermore the stimulation of antibiotics in activated sludge bioreactors remarkably governs the composition and abundance of microbial community and resistance genes zhao et al 2019 these results indicated that the geographical gradient of antibiotics consumption could actuate the selective pressure of antibiotics release into wwtps and further regulate the microbial community and its antimicrobial resistance it is worth noting that this work involved limitation due to the fact that a limited number of samples were collected from wwtps only in winter thus detailed seasonal variations in resistance genes could not be evaluated although su et al 2017 investigated the seasonal distributions of antibiotic resistance genes from chinese municipal sewage and found that the relative abundance of resistance genes in summer august 2014 was significantly higher than that in winter february 2014 p 0 01 more in depth study on the detailed seasonal variation of resistance genes in wwtps were needed in the future slightly greater absolute concentrations of resistance genes 2 14 times of args and 1 1 times of megs were observed in he wwtps compared to le wwtps p 0 05 in contrast to the relative abundances of resistance genes this might be explained by the lower temperature of winter in he region based on previous findings the absolute concentration of resistances genes in wastewater significantly increased with the transition from a hot summer to a cold winter specifically su et al 2017 investigated the seasonal distributions of bacteria from chinese municipal sewage and found that the bacterial density in winter sewage 1 21 1012 cells l was much greater than that in summer sewage 1 70 1011 cells l furthermore caucci et al 2016 demonstrated that args levels were indeed higher in autumn and winter in comparison with spring and summer this major reason for such seasonal disparity was that higher bacterial population density in winter wastewater moreover there was not only a significant decrease in the absolute abundance approximately two orders of magnitude but also in relative abundances about 94 4 of resistance genes from influent to effluent throughout the treatment process in this work this result was lower than that found in a previous study yang et al 2014 where args were effectively eliminated with a removal efficiency above 99 8 the different removal effectiveness for resistance genes and the microbial population among different wwtps can mainly be explained by the various factors including the purification process wastewater quality microbial population and operating parameters therefore how to enhance the removal of resistance genes in wwtps by optimizing their design and operation is still a great challenge although the wwtps can efficiently and economically eliminate resistance genes from municipal wastewater mcconnell et al 2018 le et al 2018 certain resistance genes are highly enriched with fc values from several to ten thousand folds after the biological treatment processes an et al 2018 in the current study of 27 persistent resistance genes more than 40 were distinctly enriched in sludge and effluent this could be explained by selection pressure which favors the preservation of resistance genes and the microbial bacteria carrying args or hgt within the microbial community karkman et al 2016 sharma et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 when the wwtp effluent is directly discharged into the receiving aquatic environment or excess activated sludge is reused as fertilizer residual resistance genes and resistant bacteria can severely threaten public and environmental health wang and chen 2022 hence nowadays more efficient technologies such as membrane bioreactors coagulation and membrane filtration and advanced oxidation should be adopted for inactivation of persistent antimicrobial resistance genes wang and chen 2022 in this study among the predicted potential hosts the proportion of multidrug resistant bacteria which was associated with at least three or more resistance genes in he 38 2 was 1 33 times higher than that in le 28 8 the proportion was about 20 0 in the core potential hosts thauera and nitrosomonas as the most abundant multidrug resistant bacteria harbored nine and eight resistance genes respectively in le wwtps the top two multidrug resistant bacteria were thermomonas and denitratisoma in he wwtps harboring seven and six resistance genes respectively moreover the resistance genes mlsb lnub vancomycin vanyb and fluoroquinolone qnrd were carried by 10 8 and 8 microbial bacteria respectively therefore these microbial bacteria genera as potential hosts possibly embodied the risks of multi drug resistance development suggesting that especially for he wwtps the more extensive existence of multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria might generate severe potential threats for public health worldwide in human fecal samples numerous stable resistance genes have been detected transmitted from tap water to human by human gut bacteria yu et al 2022 in this work the human gut bacteria harbored 60 of the core antibiotic resistant bacteria indicating that the human gut bacteria play a crucial part in the further transfer of resistance genes from human feces into the environment by wwtps furthermore among these gut bacterial hosts arcobacter and aeromonas in the wwtps influent were the most prevalent common enteric and emerging opportunistic pathogens respectively cai et al 2013 shi et al 2020 these bacterial pathogens are also potential hosts harboring multiple resistance genes among microbial communities of drinking water han et al 2020 tap water yu et al 2022 and freshwater hatha et al 2005 the findings obtained in this work together with the results from previous research clearly highlight the potential risk of antibiotic resistant pathogen transmission by means of wwtps into the downstream environments 5 conclusion this work shows the elevational patterns of the profiles of the antibiotic resistome and potential hosts of args in municipal wwtps of eastern and western china across above 1500 m elevations elevational dynamics in antibiotic resistance and microbial community were observed wastewater treatment could effectively decrease the diversity abundance and concentration of resistances genes with a reduction in diversity by about 83 2 of arg subtype and 91 4 of mge subtype core shared resistance genes such as aminoglycoside gene aac 3 via sulfonamide gene sul1 new mge gene int1 and multidrug gene qach 351 were discharged into the receiving environment moreover among the 23 shared human gut bacteria 9 core gut bacteria accounting for 60 of the potential args hosts identified were identified as possible hosts of resistance genes indicating that human gut bacteria play an important role in the dissemination of resistance genes in wwtps environmental factors 68 3 in le region and the interaction of genera and mges 53 2 in he region determined the arg variations this study provides insights into the dynamics of resistance genes and microbial populations in wastewater especially for wwtps located in he region the results can be used in the design and operation of wwtps to maximize the elimination of

15256,dissolved organic carbon doc in inland waters plays an essential role in the global carbon cycle and has significant public health effects machine learning ml together with remote sensing has emerged as a powerful and promising combination to quantify water quality parameters from space however inland water sample data for doc is limited hence little is known about the potential to quantify doc content in inland waters especially over large scale areas this study presents the first attempt to estimate doc in inland waters over a large scale area using satellite data and ml methods with the newly published open source dataset aquasat four ml approaches namely random forest regression rfr support vector regression svr gaussian process regression gpr and a multilayer backpropagation neural network mbpnn were trained using more than 16 thousand samples across the continental united states matched with satellite data from landsat 5 7 and 8 missions satellite data from the landsat missions were further extended with environmental data from the era5 land product and used as input to train the ml algorithms our results show that including environmental data as inputs considerably improved the prediction of doc for all ml algorithms with gpr showing the most promising performance results with moderate estimation errors rmse 4 08 mg l permutation feature importance analysis showed that the wavelength range in the visible green band from landsat and the monthly average air temperature from era5 land were the most important variables for the ml approaches the results demonstrate the predictive strength of gpr and its useful feature to derive per pixel standard deviations for detailed analysis our results further highlight the important role of considering environmental processes to explain doc variations over large scales the application and performance of the gpr in mapping spatiotemporal variations of doc in an entire water body were discussed by taking lake okeechobee the 8th largest freshwater lake in the u s as an illustrative example while performance evaluation showed that doc concentrations can be retrieved with adequate accuracy algorithm development was challenged by the heterogenous nature of large scale open source in situ data issues related to atmospheric correction and the low spatial and temporal resolution of the environmental predictors this research demonstrates how open source large scale datasets like aquasat in combination with ml and satellite remote sensing can make research toward large scale estimation of inland water doc more realistic while highlighting its remaining limitations and challenges graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic carbon machine learning remote sensing water quality open source data landsat data availability all used data in this study are freely available the aquasat dataset can be downloaded from https github com globalhydrologylab aquasat the era5 land product can be accessed at https www ecmwf int en era5 land 1 introduction inland waters such as lakes reservoirs rivers ponds swamps and wetlands provide essential freshwater resources and a broad range of ecosystem services to humankind millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 inland waters only occupy a small fraction of the surface of the earth 3 but recently it has been recognized that they play an important role in the global carbon cycle lauerwald et al 2015 raymond et al 2013 regnier et al 2013 dissolved organic matter doc has been a largely unaccounted form of carbon kutser et al 2017 although its amount is typically considerable in inland waters wetzel 2001 doc also has effects on public health water rich in doc in connection with chlorination has been shown to have an increased risk of bladder and rectal cancer koivusalo et al 1997 and higher frequencies of birth defects magnus et al 1999 in many boreal regions increased levels of doc have led to the browning of lakes that are important drinking water sources williamson et al 2015 therefore to predict and better understand the dramatically changing climate on earth in which the global carbon cycle is a major component it is highly desirable to estimate and map doc content in inland waters especially at large spatial scales routine monitoring of doc is also needed to ensure safe provide drinking water and to be able to adjust treatment processes when required however in situ measuring and sampling of doc concentrations is time consuming and labor intense doc contains an optically active part known as colored dissolved organic matter cdom which can be detected by remote sensing instruments in recent years satellite based techniques have evolved as an important supplement or alternative to in situ measurements of cdom as they can capture the spatio temporal dynamics of cdom from large scale and historical perspectives brezonik et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 many studies have shown that cdom and doc concentrations correlate significantly indicating that cdom can be a reliable regional proxy for doc e g chen et al 2020 erlandsson et al 2012 kutser et al 2016 however the cdom doc relationship can be weak in some waterbodies or underly seasonal variations brezonik et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 the prediction of doc from cdom levels is therefore associated with considerable uncertainty brezonik et al 2015 and thus modelling the complex relationship of the received remote sensing signal and doc concentration remains a big challenge before reaching the sensor the sun s light passes twice through the earth s atmosphere from the sun to the earth surface and from the surface to the sensor as a result the absorption and scattering by gas molecules and particles in the environment always affect the light received at the sensor moses et al 2017 therefore the development of atmospheric correction algorithms in remote sensing is a research field on its own for open ocean water robust atmospheric correction techniques have been developed but those algorithms cannot simply be applied due to various additional challenges that remote sensing of inland waters faces e g adjacency effects from neighboring land pixels proximity to terrestrial sources of atmospheric pollution moses et al 2017 in the history of water quality remote sensing inland water remote sensing has made slow progress compared to ocean remote sensing that benefits from robust open and large data sets therefore there is still a lack of universal algorithms and unified approaches to quantifying water quality parameters in inland waters palmer et al 2015 hence it is not surprising that machine learning ml has gained considerable attention in the inland water remote sensing community ml together with remote sensing big data technologies and high performance computing has emerged as a powerful and promising combination to quantify water quality parameters from remote sensing data hassan and woo 2021 wagle et al 2020 these methods have the potential to overcome the nonlinear multicollinear and heteroscedastic relationship of the received remote sensing signal and water quality parameters in inland water environments giri 2021 some findings even indicated that ml can achieve better predictions without atmospheric correction as common correction algorithms are not developed for inland waters and can introduce errors medina lopez 2020 toming et al 2016 for an ml approach to successfully learn the hidden and complex patterns between doc concentrations and the remote sensing signal a large number of doc in situ samples are required which are often not available or very costly to get many studies only have access to in situ data from a small number of inland waters thus validation studies are often biased toward certain optical water types palmer et al 2015 therefore to date very little is known about the potential of ml algorithms to predict doc from remote sensing data in larger scale areas that include a diverse collection of complex optical water types fortunately a large data set aquasat consisting of in situ doc measurements coupled with satellite data across the continental united states was recently made available ross et al 2019 which offers us a unique opportunity and motivates us to address the aforementioned research gaps regarding the estimation of doc at larger scales hence we formulated the following three specifical objectives in this study 1 evaluate the performance of four different ml algorithms for predicting the concentration of doc in inland waters from satellite data using a large scale data set of doc samples covering different inland water bodies 2 evaluate the effect of using multiple environmental variables and landsat surface reflectance to predict doc concentration for inland waters this objective is inspired by previous studies that have shown that environmental variables such as air temperature wind speed and precipitation contribute to explaining the variability of in situ doc concentrations in inland waters baines and pace 1991 correll et al 2001 zhou et al 2016 therefore including environmental variables has the potential to considerably improve the doc prediction models for the retrieval of doc concentrations of large areas environmental variables can play a fundamental role toming et al 2020 however only few studies assimilate in situ data within ecological and hydrodynamic models and only little is known about the combinatorial effects of earth observation data with existing monitoring frameworks palmer et al 2015 3 to better understand the characteristics traceability and dynamics of doc it is important to map the spatio temporal variations of doc in the entire water body therefore this study will upscale point based measurements to an entire waterbody using the best performing model outcomes from objective 1 2 and analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of doc content by mapping the doc concentrations of a waterbody for each month of a selected year 2 materials and methods 2 1 aquasat the comprehensive data set aquasat consisting of in situ doc measurements coupled with satellite data ross et al 2019 was used in this study aquasat is a combination of existing public datasets covering the continental united states including the water quality portal wqp read et al 2017 lagos ne soranno et al 2017 and the landsat archive wulder et al 2016 aquasat includes more than 600 000 landsat match ups of water quality parameters matched with atmospherically corrected surface reflectance from the landsat missions covering the years 1984 2019 each water quality sample in the aquasat dataset has matched reflectance values of landsat 5 7 or 8 from the blue green red near infrared nir short wave infrared 1 swir1 and short wave infrared 2 swir2 band as stated by ross et al 2019 aquasat is the largest set of matchup data ever assembled and was developed to specifically meet the lack of a public remote sensing data set paired with in situ measurements of water constituents the data set has already been used in previous studies e g pahlevan et al 2022 topp et al 2021 but to the best of our knowledge it has not yet been used for doc predictions with ml 2 2 era5 land data to combine satellite data with environmental predictors data from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis v5 era5 land product was used muñoz sabater et al 2021 reanalysis data combine observational inputs and models to produce consistent products based on physical principles copernicus climate change service 2020 the era5 land product has been available since mid 2019 and is thus one of the most recent products available era5 land has been shown to outperform gauge or satellite based products in terms of reliability and accuracy zandler et al 2020 for this study the era5 land monthly averaged data product from 1981 to present is used muñoz sabater et al 2021 the seven environmental predictors tested were selected based on a literature review and include the average monthly air temperature wind speed leaf area index lai high vegetation average lai low vegetation evaporation over inland waters surface net solar radiation and the monthly total precipitation the following briefly describes the reasoning behind choosing these variables solar radiation surface net solar radiation has been found an essential variable for global doc estimations toming et al 2020 evaporation over inland waters anderson and stedmon 2007 found evaporative concentration to be the first order control on doc concentration in lakes tested in southwest greenland anderson and stedmon 2007 lai low vegetation high vegetation yang et al 2017 studied riverine systems in the us and found that forests and shrubland are positively correlated with doc concentration yang et al 2017 which can be represented by lai total precipitation although the subsequent effect of rain on doc can vary considerably its relation to doc variation have been shown in many studies jennings et al 2012 reche and pace 2002 zhou et al 2016 wind speed wind speed has been shown to promote sediment doc release and doc redistribution zhou et al 2016 and found to contribute to explaining doc variations in a ml model liu et al 2021 air temperature many studies have shown air temperature to be one of the main drivers of doc variations kellerman et al 2014 liu et al 2021 strock et al 2016 2 3 methods fig 1 shows the schematic workflow of methods used in this study the workflow can be divided into three major parts data preprocessing model development and model evaluation which are described in the following subsections 2 3 1 data preprocessing although aquasat contains an extensive number of samples it is a dataset that is compiled from multiple sources in such secondary use data many issues can arise through different methods used to report the same common metadata elements sprague et al 2017 ross et al 2019 have applied several data quality assurance procedures for data integration section 2 3 1 of ross et al 2019 and joining landsat data to in situ match ups section 2 3 2 of ross et al 2019 ross et al 2019 included as much data as possible to allow future users to set their own criteria resulting in a dataset of purposefully lower quality ross et al 2019 although not all issues can be resolved we intended to set a high quality standard for the samples and thus a considerable reduction in the amount of in situ data was necessary the preprocessing steps undertaken are detailed in the support information after preprocessing the dataset contains 16 029 samples across the continental united states fig 2 previous findings from modelling cdom with ml suggest that ml approaches can generally use information in a wide wavelength range olmanson et al 2016 ruescas et al 2018 hence for model development all six available landsat bands from the aquasat dataset were used together with the seven environmental predictors retrieved from era5 land the samples were randomly divided into training 70 and test datasets 30 all input features were standardized by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance codden et al 2021 the output variable i e doc was logarithmically transformed base 10 to ensure homogeneity of variance figure s1 campbell 1995 transformation to logarithmic space is a common technique for data sets containing multiple inland water bodies and a wide range of water constituent s concentrations brezonik et al 2015 maier et al 2021 pahlevan et al 2022 the test data was then scaled using the same function that was used to standardize the training data resulting in input consistent with the trained algorithm s expectations 2 3 2 model development based on the literature review four popular ml algorithms were selected in addition to their wide applications we aimed to select a representative method from different machine learning families including tree based algorithms kernel methods and neural networks the ml algorithms are random forest regression rfr support vector regression svr gaussian process regression gpr and a multilayer backpropagation neural network mbpnn the mbpnn was implemented in tensorflow abadi et al 2016 and all other ml models were implemented in python package scikit learn pedregosa et al 2011 data processing was done on a workstation with 64gb of ram the 10 fold cross validation was implemented to test if differences in dataset partitioning influence the model performance in this study hyperparameter tuning was done via random search bergstra and bengio 2012 in random search hyperparameter combinations are randomly selected and the best configuration based on k fold cross validation is evaluated in this study 5 fold cross validation was adopted with 60 trials around 60 trials have been shown to find better models than grid search in a larger less promising space bergstra and bengio 2012 5 fold cross validation was used as a compromise between robust estimates and processing time all tuned hyperparameters are presented in table s1 in the support information to check the validity and compare the models four widely used metrics the root mean squared error rmse the mean absolute error mae the bias and coefficient of determination r2 were used for better interpretability predicted and measured values were transformed back from the logarithmic scale before calculating the evaluation metrics rmse mae and bias the unit for these metrics is doc mg l the cross validation score cv score is based on the training set and is compared between the models by the log10 transformed rmse with standard deviation after 10 folds to estimate the importance of variables for the models the inspection technique permutation feature importance was used which is defined by the decrease in a model score when a single feature value is randomly shuffled breiman 2001 the feature importance score was based on the average increase in mean squared error log10 transformed when a single feature has been randomly shuffled 30 times multiple tests in our study and experience from other studies show that more than 30 realizations do not reduce much of the variance of the estimates ruescas et al 2018 2 3 2 1 random forest regression rfr rfr is an ensemble learning method that constructs many independent decision trees decision trees are independent because they work with random subsets of features many of these random trees together form a random forest the average of all outputs of the independent decision trees is then taken as the model prediction result breiman 2001 in this way overfitting is avoided and the output is less sensitive to outliers and noise which increases the generalization ability of random forest when applied to new data compared to other ml methods rfr is easy to understand but still strong in its performance and therefore commonly applied in water quality research e g hafeez et al 2019 ruescas et al 2018 sun et al 2021 2 3 2 2 support vector regression svr in svr a loss only incurs if the difference between the model output f x and the ground truth y exceeds a set error margin this error margin creates a buffer region that surrounds f x and training samples that may fall into this region are considered correctly predicted zhou 2021b these minor inaccuracies are mostly accepted as the main goal is to find a hyperplane in multidimensional feature space that separates the data with a maximum margin which may not always perform best on the training dataset but has the strongest generalization ability when applied to new data zhou 2021b to map samples from the original feature space to a higher dimensional space svr requires a kernel function that allows svr to work in a multidimensional feature space without computing the actual coordinates of the data also known as the kernel trick commonly used kernel methods in svr include polynomial linear and radial basis functions important hyperparameters of svr include the c regularization parameter which controls overfitting the e insensitive zone which sets the error margin where no loss incurs and the kernel which defines the kernel type used in the algorithm compared to other ml algorithms the performance of svr is very dependent on the selection of these parameters mountrakis et al 2011 besides rfr svr can be considered a standard approach in ml algorithms and is often among the best performing algorithms in water quality applications guan et al 2020 kim et al 2014 tenjo et al 2021 2 3 2 3 gaussian process regression gpr the basic idea in gpr is to give a prior probability to all functions that could explain the relationship between the input variables and the target variable where higher probabilities are given to functions that are more likely to explain the relationship of the input variables and the target variable for instance because they are smoother than other functions rasmussen and williams 2006 because it is impossible to compute an infinite set of possible functions for the relationship of x and y a gaussian process is used a gaussian process is a generalization of the gaussian probability distribution and instead of describing the probability distribution for random variables it governs the properties of functions with a stochastic process rasmussen and williams 2006 similarly to svr gpr uses the kernel trick to allow this process to work in a multidimensional space as suggested by findings of zare farjoudi and alizadeh 2021 we used the rational quadratic kernel function for the gpr implementation zare farjoudi and alizadeh 2021 including a white kernel for noise level estimation hyperparameter tuning through random search is not required for gpr as its hyperparameter are optimized by maximizing the log marginal likelihood in the training set see rasmussen and williams 2006 gpr has become a common ml algorithm used in water quality parameter predictions due to its excellent performance blix et al 2018 ruescas et al 2018 sun et al 2021 2 3 2 4 multilayer backpropagation neural network mbpnn the mbpnn is a type of neural network which comprises an input layer multiple hidden layers and an output layer the input layer receives the external input the hidden layers process the signals and the output layer outputs the processed signals zhou 2021a the hidden layers consist of a large number of neurons which were optimized with the adam optimizer kingma and ba 2014 each neuron in each layer is connected to all neurons in the preceding and subsequent layers training a neural network requires selecting a structure number of hidden layers and nodes per layer properly initialization of the weights shape of the nonlinearity learning rate and regularization parameters to prevent overfitting the implementation of the mbpnn in this study mainly follows the example by géron 2019 in chapter 10 géron 2019 to prevent overfitting and reduce the amount of training time early stopping is implemented which interrupt training early when there is no more progress early stopping is defined by the patience argument and set to 10 géron 2019 mpnn have shown promising results in water quality research chen and hu 2017 sun et al 2011 and have recently been applied for the retrieval of doc liu et al 2021 3 results 3 1 performance of ml algorithms overall the ml algorithms predicted doc with moderate to high uncertainties table 1 including the environmental predictors led to substantial performance improvements for all ml algorithms with gpr and mbpnn showing the highest improvements and best overall scores mbpnn has a slightly lower rmse 4 02 mg l and bias 0 45 than gpr rmse 4 08 mg l bias 0 69 but a higher mae mbpnn 2 03 mg l gpr 1 9 mg l and a lower r2 score mbpnn 0 57 gpr 0 61 although the metric scores between both algorithms are without considerable differences the cv score of mbpnn 0 25 0 008 is much higher than that of gpr 0 19 0 008 table 2 the performance of the ml algorithms is further illustrated in fig 3 the reported slopes are generally closer to unity when environmental variables are included although a negative bias in all algorithms indicates an overall underestimation of doc the slopes compared to unity suggest a degraded performance of all ml algorithms at the two tails of data distribution overestimating small doc concentrations and underestimating larger doc concentrations of all ml algorithms the slopes of gpr and mbpnn with included environmental variables are closest to the unity line 3 2 variable importance overall removing the green band and air temperature leads to the highest mse increase on average suggesting that the two variables are most important for the models followed by the red band and lai high vegetation fig 4 mbpnn and svr strongly depend on the green band as large increases in mse are observed when it is removed although gpr has a similar distribution of variable importance compared to svr and mbpnn the average mse increase appears more balanced 3 3 spatiotemporal variations of doc in an entire waterbody based on the model evaluation the gpr approach with environmental predictors included was the most promising model for predicting doc hence the gpr approach was applied to an entire waterbody to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of doc the lake okeechobee in florida us was chosen as an illustrative example fig s2 it is the 8th largest freshwater lake in the us and has been subject to many studies as it plays an important role for the everglades agricultural area and has experienced many cyanobacteria outbreaks in the past metcalf et al 2018 the gpr model was applied to map the doc concentration for lake okeechobee for each month of the year 2019 fig 5 doc concentrations were mapped using landsat 8 or landsat 7 images the images were visually checked for cloud cover and downloaded using the usgs earth explorer landsat 8 images with no or few clouds were generally preferred over landsat 7 images which contain white stripes due to a failure of the scan line corrector after 31 may 2003 as the era 5 land product is provided in a reduced gaussian grid with a quasi uniform spacing over the globe the layers containing the environmental information were resampled to universal transfer mercator utm and spatial resolution 30m of the landsat products using bilinear interpolation the satellite derived monthly doc concentration in lake okeechobee in 2019 reveals distinct spatial and temporal patterns high concentrations of doc appear in the north eastern part of the lake during the month from june to september a high doc concentration event was observed in june lower concentrations of doc are observed from october to march an exception is the month of december where higher concentrations of doc were predicted in the south eastern part of the lake 4 discussion 4 1 performance of ml algorithms the results imply the strongest performance of gpr with satellite data and environmental variables as inputs this result is in line with several water quality studies in which gpr was found to outperform other ml approaches blix et al 2018 ruescas et al 2018 sun et al 2021 however the differences in the performance scores were subtle especially for the developed mbpnn which predicted doc concentration on the test dataset with about the same precision as gpr yet our cross validation analysis showed that mbpnn predictions were more unstable table 2 suggesting that its generalization performance varies more according to the composition of the data it is applied to considering the small differences in the performance metrics among ml algorithms it is difficult to conclude which method is the best performing ml algorithm in this study we chose gpr as the most promising method and worth continued research and development for water quality applications because of its slightly improved performance scores but also because of its unique advantage that associated standard deviations can be derived along with the estimations on a per pixel basis this feature is very useful for further analysis demonstrated in section 4 3 in this study all four ml approaches tested predict very low or very high doc values with larger errors this is a common issue in water quality research as there are usually fewer samples available for more extreme values here further sampling efforts are necessary that focus specifically on waterbodies with very low or very high doc concentrations on the other hand the landsat data and environmental predictors might simply not be sensitive enough to capture the extreme doc values which could be investigated in further studies while cross validation analysis indicates that a robust overall performance of the ml algorithms systematic bias might still exist on a regional level or for sites with specific characteristics because of the uneven feature distribution in the sample dataset fig s5 s6 and s7 the accuracy of doc estimation could have a spatiotemporal dependence inland waters in areas and in a time period that better reflect the spatiotemporal distribution of the sample dataset would tend to have more accurate doc estimations inland waters with spatiotemporal conditions that are not well represented in the dataset e g mountainous regions during in winter would tend to have less accurate doc estimations however when analyzing the prediction errors against spatial and temporal domains we could not find a significant or clear pattern on the one hand the spatially and temporally inconsistent samples in the dataset may hamper finding such anomalies on the other hand it is extremely difficult to disentangle to what extent many drivers of doc influence its variability we stress that further research should be focused on doc estimation at varying spatial and temporal scales once a more temporally and spatially consistent sample dataset can be obtained apart from the spatiotemporal domain other features can influence the accuracy of the trained algorithms this is illustrated in fig 6 which shows the logarithmic error of the gpr estimates compared to the measurements in the held out test dataset based on the three different water types in which samples were taken the plot shows that the interquartile error range of lakes expands further than estuary and streams it suggests that the algorithm estimated doc concentrations with larger errors for lakes than for the other two water types one reason could be the difference in the dynamics between the inland water types while water flows in streams and estuaries are constantly changing water constituents water parameters in lakes have shown to be much more stable which is also why a larger overpass time window was allowed for lakes see the description of preprocessing steps in support information the ml algorithms might not be able to capture these differences in dynamics especially since there is an overrepresentation of samples for streams in the dataset fig s5 after plotting the spatial distribution of errors from the gpr model for the measurements in the held out test dataset no distinct spatial pattern could be observed fig s3 it should however be considered that the range of samples spans over many years it is thus unlikely to find spatial patterns as the conditions might be considerably different even though the location of samples is in close proximity on the other hand if a specific time window e g summer month in one year is considered the number of samples is too low to analyze if spatial patterns exist while we argue that the focus of this study is on large scale estimations of doc the heterogenous nature of the sample dataset limits the possibilities of more in depth analysis and consequently a better picture of how the model performs under specific conditions it is yet another limitation that underlines the need of systematic and standardized sample efforts for inland waters 4 2 variable importance permutation feature importance analysis showed that the green band is the most important predictor of the six landsat bands followed by the red band and the blue band this result is expected to a certain degree as wavelengths in the visible range and especially the green and red bands are commonly used to explain variations in water quality parameters including the doc related cdom brezonik et al 2015 of all environmental predictors the monthly average air temperature was found to be the most important environmental predictor this result is consistent with other studies that identified temperature as one of the main drivers of doc concentrations in inland waters kellerman et al 2014 liu et al 2021 strock et al 2016 surprisingly total precipitation and average wind speed do not have large impacts on the model performance which contradicts with earlier findings jennings et al 2012 reche and pace 2002 zhou et al 2016 one reason might be that the low temporal and spatial resolution of environmental predictors used in this study is not capable of capturing the highly dynamic processes of precipitation and wind speed for example the time periods between a rainfall event and its subsequent effect on doc concentrations in inland waters can vary considerably and depend on many factors such as soil organic carbon of the soil vegetation and hydrological conditions in the basin blaen et al 2017 wang et al 2019 changes in wind speed are also highly dynamic thus making use of information on wind speed and rainfall may require higher resolution monitoring jennings et al 2012 implying that the era5 land product based on daily averages could be more suitable for these variables lai low vegetation surface net solar radiation and evaporation over inland water were not shown to have a large impact on the model s performance however running the models without these three predictors still results in noticeable drops in rmse table s2 despite their seemingly marginal role in predicting doc the ml models still gain knowledge from them doc variations have been related to many environmental drivers that may produce a variety of effects on doc release that can even work in opposition to each other pagano et al 2014 and vary significantly according to geographic region cool et al 2014 for modelling such complex interactions in different environments the ml approaches still seem to require as much information as possible using the enhanced information due to interaction of multiple variables this implies that using more information could still improve the model s performance the era5 land product offers many more environmental variables than those that were selected in this study to reduce the complexity of the models we selected environmental predictors found to be linked to doc variations in previous studies section 2 2 the considerable improvements observed when including environmental predictors in the models underline the important role of environmental processes in modelling doc variations in inland waters over larger scales however other variables from the era5 land product might still have improved the models even though they might not be directly associated to doc variations more studies are needed to explore the relationships between external drivers and doc concentration in inland waters at different spatiotemporal scales 4 3 application in mapping spatiotemporal variations of doc in an entire water body mapping the monthly doc concentrations in lake okeechobee showed some distinct spatial patterns for example the monthly images show higher doc in the north eastern part of the lake from june to september this pattern could potentially be linked to the increased cyanobacteria blooms that lake okeechobee has experienced lately from early may to september metcalf et al 2018 as the findings of earlier studies suggest that increased doc concentrations are linked to and partially explained by chlorophyll a concentration liu et al 2021 ye et al 2011 furthermore the high concentrations of doc observed in june was in agreement with pahlevan et al 2020 who captured cyanobacteria blooms in lake okeechobee on the 5th of june 2019 using a mixture density model pahlevan et al 2020 fig 8 the spatial pattern of doc concentrations from june and august also suggests large input of doc from the kissime river where water with high levels of doc enter the lake from a south east direction figure s2 which then distributes in the north and east part of the lake these observations indicate that spatial patterns of doc concentration mapped by the gpr model in lake okeechobee are reasonable however since there are only very few studies that have mapped doc concentrations for inland waters a direct comparison of doc estimates or measured doc samples was not possible and thus considerable uncertainties regarding the accuracy of mapped doc remain in addition only a few images per month were available as landsat sensors only have a revisit time of 16 days the more recently launched sentinel 2 satellites offer great potential for inland water remote sensing due to the higher spatial temporal and spectral resolution toming et al 2016 however images are only available from 2017 which would make the vast majority of the aquasat dataset unusable aquasat covers the period 1985 to 2019 if regular updates for the aquasat dataset are foreseen in the future the combination of sentinel 2 and landsat 8 will allow water quality mapping in a much finer spatio temporal scale and give more robust monthly estimates e g chen et al 2020 a unique feature of gpr is that standard deviations can be derived along with the mean estimations which can be interpreted as reliability estimates and mapped for all mean predictions of the model as shown in fig 7 the standard deviations for each pixel of lake okeechobee on june 25th 2019 clearly increase towards the shoreline of the lake the increased uncertainties are most likely due to land adjacency effects where scattering in the atmosphere contaminates water pixels close to the shoreline with radiation from the surrounding land since lake okeechobee is a large lake with a large area of pure open water the reduced reliability of doc estimates is limited to the shoreline area the proportion of uncertainties would however increase when inland waters are narrowly confined within land boundaries more inland water bodies with varying morphometric characteristics could be tested in a future study to gain more insight into how land adjacency effects influence the uncertainty in doc predictions in the central part of the lake a random pattern can be observed most visible as white patches in the gpr standard deviation image fig 7 which is likely an effect of atmospheric interference this problem is further illustrated in figure s4 which shows estimated standard deviations from the gpr model in an area with cloud interference from the image taken on september 29th 2019 uncertainties related to atmospheric correction are one of the key challenges of water quality mapping although recent work found that the lasrc model used for atmospheric correction for landsat 8 products performs well over the amazon river kuhn et al 2019 the correction algorithms are still developed for terrestrial remote sensing there is still big potential in optimizing atmospheric correction for inland waters it was recently shown that different atmospheric processors can have considerable influence on the prediction outcome of water quality mapping pahlevan et al 2021 or even that ml approaches can achieve better predictions without atmospheric correction as information may be lost during the atmospheric correction progress medina lopez 2020 evaluating further possibilities and estimating uncertainties in atmospheric correction processes could give important insights into how they affect satellite derived doc estimates 4 4 limitations of this study an important limitation in this study comes from the in situ data as described in section 2 aquasat is a combination of existing public datasets and thus the techniques methods and interpretations of doc measurements may vary considerably despite our efforts to implement additional quality assurance steps inconsistencies in the sampling technique the instrumentation and their corresponding calibration were not preventable the extent to which such differences are reflected in the algorithm development and validation remains unclear we argue that due to the large number of samples used in this research and the additional quality assurance steps deployed minor differences in some of the sampling methods will not have a significant effect on the overall model development and evaluation however the limitation underlines the potential value coordinated and standardized in situ data collection methods could have another problem with heterogeneous datasets is the uneven distribution of features which also exist in this dataset see support information figs s5 s6 and s7 when the dataset is split randomly there is an increased risk of introducing a bias in the training or test dataset we argue that because the 10 fold cross validation score does not differ substantially from the test score in all algorithms except the mbpnn table 2 the data partitioning does not have a significant influence on the models performance and a random split is reasonable another limitation regards the temporal matching of in situ data and satellite imagery the high number of samples allowed us to set conservative temporal match up limits section 2 yet any time that passes between the time of when the sample was taken and the satellite image was captured is a source of uncertainty also here coordination and standardization efforts where samples are for instance taken with consideration of satellite overpass times and clear weather conditions bear great potential towards more robust satellite derived water quality products lastly although the dataset is not limited to a certain type of water body all samples are located in the continental us the models may estimate doc reasonably well for areas in similar settings but may struggle in places that are totally different in terms of their environmental conditions such issues could be addressed with a larger international sample dataset while our study points towards many limiting challenges for estimating doc in inland waters through remote sensing and machine learning the lack of standardized in situ doc observations is one of the most crucial issues first the possibilities of validation were limited by the heterogenous nature of the aquasat dataset while we could validate the overall performances on continental scale using a held out test datatset the case example on lake okeechobee could only be assessed by visual comparisons to other studies in that area due to a lack of other mapped doc products and spatially and temporally consistent sample measurements therefore although the visual comparisons indicate reasonable doc estimates considerable uncertainties for the regional case of lake okeechobee remain second even though gpr had relatively better performance metrics table 2 it did not show considerable differences in the performance compared to the other algorithms tested in other words all tested ml algorithms showed promise for estimating doc we chose gpr as the most promising method worth continued research and development but emphasize that this choice is also motivated by its useful feature to derive standard deviations for each estimate therefore our study suggests that most of the potential to improve doc estimations and their validation lies in wider more standardized and spatially and temporally consistent in situ measurements such measurements are essential for development and validation of methods particularly satellite based and machine learning based for estimating doc at various spatial and temporal scales in this regard the aquasat dataset represents a first promising approach of open source large scale datasets that could be built on in the future 5 conclusions this study presents the first attempt to estimate dissolved organic carbon doc in inland waters in the continental united states using four machine learning methods and the recent comprehensive data set aquast consisting of in situ measurements coupled with satellite data besides satellite data environmental predictors from global era5 land product notably improved the prediction of doc in all algorithms highlighting the critical role of environmental processes when explaining doc variations among the different methods the gaussian process regression gpr was the most promising algorithm because of its slightly improved performance metrics and more importantly its unique feature to derive standard deviations along with its predictions which showed to be very useful in further analysis the gpr was applied to map doc concentration for each month of an illustrative example lake lake okeechobee 8th largest lake in the us in 2019 which showed patterns that could be linked to previous findings and indicate that doc estimates by the gpr model are reasonable however spatiotemporal estimates of doc in lake okeechobee cannot be rigorously evaluated due to a lack of regional validation data our analysis illustrated remaining issues in atmospheric correction for inland waters using the usgs land surface reflectance satellite products algorithm development was further challenged by the heterogenous nature of large scale open source in situ data and the low spatial and temporal resolution of the environmental predictors although locally tuned models are likely to outperform our developed model in terms of accuracy our developed model can address key issues of inland water remote sensing regarding the lack of in situ measurements and has the potential to show large scale trends of inland doc dynamically over long time periods and seasons this study demonstrates how open source large scale datasets like aquasat in combination machine learning and satellite remote sensing can make research toward estimating doc from inland waters at large scales more realistic credit authorship contribution statement lasse harkort conceptualization data curation methodology writing original draft writing review editing zheng duan conceptualization

15256,dissolved organic carbon doc in inland waters plays an essential role in the global carbon cycle and has significant public health effects machine learning ml together with remote sensing has emerged as a powerful and promising combination to quantify water quality parameters from space however inland water sample data for doc is limited hence little is known about the potential to quantify doc content in inland waters especially over large scale areas this study presents the first attempt to estimate doc in inland waters over a large scale area using satellite data and ml methods with the newly published open source dataset aquasat four ml approaches namely random forest regression rfr support vector regression svr gaussian process regression gpr and a multilayer backpropagation neural network mbpnn were trained using more than 16 thousand samples across the continental united states matched with satellite data from landsat 5 7 and 8 missions satellite data from the landsat missions were further extended with environmental data from the era5 land product and used as input to train the ml algorithms our results show that including environmental data as inputs considerably improved the prediction of doc for all ml algorithms with gpr showing the most promising performance results with moderate estimation errors rmse 4 08 mg l permutation feature importance analysis showed that the wavelength range in the visible green band from landsat and the monthly average air temperature from era5 land were the most important variables for the ml approaches the results demonstrate the predictive strength of gpr and its useful feature to derive per pixel standard deviations for detailed analysis our results further highlight the important role of considering environmental processes to explain doc variations over large scales the application and performance of the gpr in mapping spatiotemporal variations of doc in an entire water body were discussed by taking lake okeechobee the 8th largest freshwater lake in the u s as an illustrative example while performance evaluation showed that doc concentrations can be retrieved with adequate accuracy algorithm development was challenged by the heterogenous nature of large scale open source in situ data issues related to atmospheric correction and the low spatial and temporal resolution of the environmental predictors this research demonstrates how open source large scale datasets like aquasat in combination with ml and satellite remote sensing can make research toward large scale estimation of inland water doc more realistic while highlighting its remaining limitations and challenges graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic carbon machine learning remote sensing water quality open source data landsat data availability all used data in this study are freely available the aquasat dataset can be downloaded from https github com globalhydrologylab aquasat the era5 land product can be accessed at https www ecmwf int en era5 land 1 introduction inland waters such as lakes reservoirs rivers ponds swamps and wetlands provide essential freshwater resources and a broad range of ecosystem services to humankind millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 inland waters only occupy a small fraction of the surface of the earth 3 but recently it has been recognized that they play an important role in the global carbon cycle lauerwald et al 2015 raymond et al 2013 regnier et al 2013 dissolved organic matter doc has been a largely unaccounted form of carbon kutser et al 2017 although its amount is typically considerable in inland waters wetzel 2001 doc also has effects on public health water rich in doc in connection with chlorination has been shown to have an increased risk of bladder and rectal cancer koivusalo et al 1997 and higher frequencies of birth defects magnus et al 1999 in many boreal regions increased levels of doc have led to the browning of lakes that are important drinking water sources williamson et al 2015 therefore to predict and better understand the dramatically changing climate on earth in which the global carbon cycle is a major component it is highly desirable to estimate and map doc content in inland waters especially at large spatial scales routine monitoring of doc is also needed to ensure safe provide drinking water and to be able to adjust treatment processes when required however in situ measuring and sampling of doc concentrations is time consuming and labor intense doc contains an optically active part known as colored dissolved organic matter cdom which can be detected by remote sensing instruments in recent years satellite based techniques have evolved as an important supplement or alternative to in situ measurements of cdom as they can capture the spatio temporal dynamics of cdom from large scale and historical perspectives brezonik et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 many studies have shown that cdom and doc concentrations correlate significantly indicating that cdom can be a reliable regional proxy for doc e g chen et al 2020 erlandsson et al 2012 kutser et al 2016 however the cdom doc relationship can be weak in some waterbodies or underly seasonal variations brezonik et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 the prediction of doc from cdom levels is therefore associated with considerable uncertainty brezonik et al 2015 and thus modelling the complex relationship of the received remote sensing signal and doc concentration remains a big challenge before reaching the sensor the sun s light passes twice through the earth s atmosphere from the sun to the earth surface and from the surface to the sensor as a result the absorption and scattering by gas molecules and particles in the environment always affect the light received at the sensor moses et al 2017 therefore the development of atmospheric correction algorithms in remote sensing is a research field on its own for open ocean water robust atmospheric correction techniques have been developed but those algorithms cannot simply be applied due to various additional challenges that remote sensing of inland waters faces e g adjacency effects from neighboring land pixels proximity to terrestrial sources of atmospheric pollution moses et al 2017 in the history of water quality remote sensing inland water remote sensing has made slow progress compared to ocean remote sensing that benefits from robust open and large data sets therefore there is still a lack of universal algorithms and unified approaches to quantifying water quality parameters in inland waters palmer et al 2015 hence it is not surprising that machine learning ml has gained considerable attention in the inland water remote sensing community ml together with remote sensing big data technologies and high performance computing has emerged as a powerful and promising combination to quantify water quality parameters from remote sensing data hassan and woo 2021 wagle et al 2020 these methods have the potential to overcome the nonlinear multicollinear and heteroscedastic relationship of the received remote sensing signal and water quality parameters in inland water environments giri 2021 some findings even indicated that ml can achieve better predictions without atmospheric correction as common correction algorithms are not developed for inland waters and can introduce errors medina lopez 2020 toming et al 2016 for an ml approach to successfully learn the hidden and complex patterns between doc concentrations and the remote sensing signal a large number of doc in situ samples are required which are often not available or very costly to get many studies only have access to in situ data from a small number of inland waters thus validation studies are often biased toward certain optical water types palmer et al 2015 therefore to date very little is known about the potential of ml algorithms to predict doc from remote sensing data in larger scale areas that include a diverse collection of complex optical water types fortunately a large data set aquasat consisting of in situ doc measurements coupled with satellite data across the continental united states was recently made available ross et al 2019 which offers us a unique opportunity and motivates us to address the aforementioned research gaps regarding the estimation of doc at larger scales hence we formulated the following three specifical objectives in this study 1 evaluate the performance of four different ml algorithms for predicting the concentration of doc in inland waters from satellite data using a large scale data set of doc samples covering different inland water bodies 2 evaluate the effect of using multiple environmental variables and landsat surface reflectance to predict doc concentration for inland waters this objective is inspired by previous studies that have shown that environmental variables such as air temperature wind speed and precipitation contribute to explaining the variability of in situ doc concentrations in inland waters baines and pace 1991 correll et al 2001 zhou et al 2016 therefore including environmental variables has the potential to considerably improve the doc prediction models for the retrieval of doc concentrations of large areas environmental variables can play a fundamental role toming et al 2020 however only few studies assimilate in situ data within ecological and hydrodynamic models and only little is known about the combinatorial effects of earth observation data with existing monitoring frameworks palmer et al 2015 3 to better understand the characteristics traceability and dynamics of doc it is important to map the spatio temporal variations of doc in the entire water body therefore this study will upscale point based measurements to an entire waterbody using the best performing model outcomes from objective 1 2 and analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of doc content by mapping the doc concentrations of a waterbody for each month of a selected year 2 materials and methods 2 1 aquasat the comprehensive data set aquasat consisting of in situ doc measurements coupled with satellite data ross et al 2019 was used in this study aquasat is a combination of existing public datasets covering the continental united states including the water quality portal wqp read et al 2017 lagos ne soranno et al 2017 and the landsat archive wulder et al 2016 aquasat includes more than 600 000 landsat match ups of water quality parameters matched with atmospherically corrected surface reflectance from the landsat missions covering the years 1984 2019 each water quality sample in the aquasat dataset has matched reflectance values of landsat 5 7 or 8 from the blue green red near infrared nir short wave infrared 1 swir1 and short wave infrared 2 swir2 band as stated by ross et al 2019 aquasat is the largest set of matchup data ever assembled and was developed to specifically meet the lack of a public remote sensing data set paired with in situ measurements of water constituents the data set has already been used in previous studies e g pahlevan et al 2022 topp et al 2021 but to the best of our knowledge it has not yet been used for doc predictions with ml 2 2 era5 land data to combine satellite data with environmental predictors data from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis v5 era5 land product was used muñoz sabater et al 2021 reanalysis data combine observational inputs and models to produce consistent products based on physical principles copernicus climate change service 2020 the era5 land product has been available since mid 2019 and is thus one of the most recent products available era5 land has been shown to outperform gauge or satellite based products in terms of reliability and accuracy zandler et al 2020 for this study the era5 land monthly averaged data product from 1981 to present is used muñoz sabater et al 2021 the seven environmental predictors tested were selected based on a literature review and include the average monthly air temperature wind speed leaf area index lai high vegetation average lai low vegetation evaporation over inland waters surface net solar radiation and the monthly total precipitation the following briefly describes the reasoning behind choosing these variables solar radiation surface net solar radiation has been found an essential variable for global doc estimations toming et al 2020 evaporation over inland waters anderson and stedmon 2007 found evaporative concentration to be the first order control on doc concentration in lakes tested in southwest greenland anderson and stedmon 2007 lai low vegetation high vegetation yang et al 2017 studied riverine systems in the us and found that forests and shrubland are positively correlated with doc concentration yang et al 2017 which can be represented by lai total precipitation although the subsequent effect of rain on doc can vary considerably its relation to doc variation have been shown in many studies jennings et al 2012 reche and pace 2002 zhou et al 2016 wind speed wind speed has been shown to promote sediment doc release and doc redistribution zhou et al 2016 and found to contribute to explaining doc variations in a ml model liu et al 2021 air temperature many studies have shown air temperature to be one of the main drivers of doc variations kellerman et al 2014 liu et al 2021 strock et al 2016 2 3 methods fig 1 shows the schematic workflow of methods used in this study the workflow can be divided into three major parts data preprocessing model development and model evaluation which are described in the following subsections 2 3 1 data preprocessing although aquasat contains an extensive number of samples it is a dataset that is compiled from multiple sources in such secondary use data many issues can arise through different methods used to report the same common metadata elements sprague et al 2017 ross et al 2019 have applied several data quality assurance procedures for data integration section 2 3 1 of ross et al 2019 and joining landsat data to in situ match ups section 2 3 2 of ross et al 2019 ross et al 2019 included as much data as possible to allow future users to set their own criteria resulting in a dataset of purposefully lower quality ross et al 2019 although not all issues can be resolved we intended to set a high quality standard for the samples and thus a considerable reduction in the amount of in situ data was necessary the preprocessing steps undertaken are detailed in the support information after preprocessing the dataset contains 16 029 samples across the continental united states fig 2 previous findings from modelling cdom with ml suggest that ml approaches can generally use information in a wide wavelength range olmanson et al 2016 ruescas et al 2018 hence for model development all six available landsat bands from the aquasat dataset were used together with the seven environmental predictors retrieved from era5 land the samples were randomly divided into training 70 and test datasets 30 all input features were standardized by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance codden et al 2021 the output variable i e doc was logarithmically transformed base 10 to ensure homogeneity of variance figure s1 campbell 1995 transformation to logarithmic space is a common technique for data sets containing multiple inland water bodies and a wide range of water constituent s concentrations brezonik et al 2015 maier et al 2021 pahlevan et al 2022 the test data was then scaled using the same function that was used to standardize the training data resulting in input consistent with the trained algorithm s expectations 2 3 2 model development based on the literature review four popular ml algorithms were selected in addition to their wide applications we aimed to select a representative method from different machine learning families including tree based algorithms kernel methods and neural networks the ml algorithms are random forest regression rfr support vector regression svr gaussian process regression gpr and a multilayer backpropagation neural network mbpnn the mbpnn was implemented in tensorflow abadi et al 2016 and all other ml models were implemented in python package scikit learn pedregosa et al 2011 data processing was done on a workstation with 64gb of ram the 10 fold cross validation was implemented to test if differences in dataset partitioning influence the model performance in this study hyperparameter tuning was done via random search bergstra and bengio 2012 in random search hyperparameter combinations are randomly selected and the best configuration based on k fold cross validation is evaluated in this study 5 fold cross validation was adopted with 60 trials around 60 trials have been shown to find better models than grid search in a larger less promising space bergstra and bengio 2012 5 fold cross validation was used as a compromise between robust estimates and processing time all tuned hyperparameters are presented in table s1 in the support information to check the validity and compare the models four widely used metrics the root mean squared error rmse the mean absolute error mae the bias and coefficient of determination r2 were used for better interpretability predicted and measured values were transformed back from the logarithmic scale before calculating the evaluation metrics rmse mae and bias the unit for these metrics is doc mg l the cross validation score cv score is based on the training set and is compared between the models by the log10 transformed rmse with standard deviation after 10 folds to estimate the importance of variables for the models the inspection technique permutation feature importance was used which is defined by the decrease in a model score when a single feature value is randomly shuffled breiman 2001 the feature importance score was based on the average increase in mean squared error log10 transformed when a single feature has been randomly shuffled 30 times multiple tests in our study and experience from other studies show that more than 30 realizations do not reduce much of the variance of the estimates ruescas et al 2018 2 3 2 1 random forest regression rfr rfr is an ensemble learning method that constructs many independent decision trees decision trees are independent because they work with random subsets of features many of these random trees together form a random forest the average of all outputs of the independent decision trees is then taken as the model prediction result breiman 2001 in this way overfitting is avoided and the output is less sensitive to outliers and noise which increases the generalization ability of random forest when applied to new data compared to other ml methods rfr is easy to understand but still strong in its performance and therefore commonly applied in water quality research e g hafeez et al 2019 ruescas et al 2018 sun et al 2021 2 3 2 2 support vector regression svr in svr a loss only incurs if the difference between the model output f x and the ground truth y exceeds a set error margin this error margin creates a buffer region that surrounds f x and training samples that may fall into this region are considered correctly predicted zhou 2021b these minor inaccuracies are mostly accepted as the main goal is to find a hyperplane in multidimensional feature space that separates the data with a maximum margin which may not always perform best on the training dataset but has the strongest generalization ability when applied to new data zhou 2021b to map samples from the original feature space to a higher dimensional space svr requires a kernel function that allows svr to work in a multidimensional feature space without computing the actual coordinates of the data also known as the kernel trick commonly used kernel methods in svr include polynomial linear and radial basis functions important hyperparameters of svr include the c regularization parameter which controls overfitting the e insensitive zone which sets the error margin where no loss incurs and the kernel which defines the kernel type used in the algorithm compared to other ml algorithms the performance of svr is very dependent on the selection of these parameters mountrakis et al 2011 besides rfr svr can be considered a standard approach in ml algorithms and is often among the best performing algorithms in water quality applications guan et al 2020 kim et al 2014 tenjo et al 2021 2 3 2 3 gaussian process regression gpr the basic idea in gpr is to give a prior probability to all functions that could explain the relationship between the input variables and the target variable where higher probabilities are given to functions that are more likely to explain the relationship of the input variables and the target variable for instance because they are smoother than other functions rasmussen and williams 2006 because it is impossible to compute an infinite set of possible functions for the relationship of x and y a gaussian process is used a gaussian process is a generalization of the gaussian probability distribution and instead of describing the probability distribution for random variables it governs the properties of functions with a stochastic process rasmussen and williams 2006 similarly to svr gpr uses the kernel trick to allow this process to work in a multidimensional space as suggested by findings of zare farjoudi and alizadeh 2021 we used the rational quadratic kernel function for the gpr implementation zare farjoudi and alizadeh 2021 including a white kernel for noise level estimation hyperparameter tuning through random search is not required for gpr as its hyperparameter are optimized by maximizing the log marginal likelihood in the training set see rasmussen and williams 2006 gpr has become a common ml algorithm used in water quality parameter predictions due to its excellent performance blix et al 2018 ruescas et al 2018 sun et al 2021 2 3 2 4 multilayer backpropagation neural network mbpnn the mbpnn is a type of neural network which comprises an input layer multiple hidden layers and an output layer the input layer receives the external input the hidden layers process the signals and the output layer outputs the processed signals zhou 2021a the hidden layers consist of a large number of neurons which were optimized with the adam optimizer kingma and ba 2014 each neuron in each layer is connected to all neurons in the preceding and subsequent layers training a neural network requires selecting a structure number of hidden layers and nodes per layer properly initialization of the weights shape of the nonlinearity learning rate and regularization parameters to prevent overfitting the implementation of the mbpnn in this study mainly follows the example by géron 2019 in chapter 10 géron 2019 to prevent overfitting and reduce the amount of training time early stopping is implemented which interrupt training early when there is no more progress early stopping is defined by the patience argument and set to 10 géron 2019 mpnn have shown promising results in water quality research chen and hu 2017 sun et al 2011 and have recently been applied for the retrieval of doc liu et al 2021 3 results 3 1 performance of ml algorithms overall the ml algorithms predicted doc with moderate to high uncertainties table 1 including the environmental predictors led to substantial performance improvements for all ml algorithms with gpr and mbpnn showing the highest improvements and best overall scores mbpnn has a slightly lower rmse 4 02 mg l and bias 0 45 than gpr rmse 4 08 mg l bias 0 69 but a higher mae mbpnn 2 03 mg l gpr 1 9 mg l and a lower r2 score mbpnn 0 57 gpr 0 61 although the metric scores between both algorithms are without considerable differences the cv score of mbpnn 0 25 0 008 is much higher than that of gpr 0 19 0 008 table 2 the performance of the ml algorithms is further illustrated in fig 3 the reported slopes are generally closer to unity when environmental variables are included although a negative bias in all algorithms indicates an overall underestimation of doc the slopes compared to unity suggest a degraded performance of all ml algorithms at the two tails of data distribution overestimating small doc concentrations and underestimating larger doc concentrations of all ml algorithms the slopes of gpr and mbpnn with included environmental variables are closest to the unity line 3 2 variable importance overall removing the green band and air temperature leads to the highest mse increase on average suggesting that the two variables are most important for the models followed by the red band and lai high vegetation fig 4 mbpnn and svr strongly depend on the green band as large increases in mse are observed when it is removed although gpr has a similar distribution of variable importance compared to svr and mbpnn the average mse increase appears more balanced 3 3 spatiotemporal variations of doc in an entire waterbody based on the model evaluation the gpr approach with environmental predictors included was the most promising model for predicting doc hence the gpr approach was applied to an entire waterbody to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of doc the lake okeechobee in florida us was chosen as an illustrative example fig s2 it is the 8th largest freshwater lake in the us and has been subject to many studies as it plays an important role for the everglades agricultural area and has experienced many cyanobacteria outbreaks in the past metcalf et al 2018 the gpr model was applied to map the doc concentration for lake okeechobee for each month of the year 2019 fig 5 doc concentrations were mapped using landsat 8 or landsat 7 images the images were visually checked for cloud cover and downloaded using the usgs earth explorer landsat 8 images with no or few clouds were generally preferred over landsat 7 images which contain white stripes due to a failure of the scan line corrector after 31 may 2003 as the era 5 land product is provided in a reduced gaussian grid with a quasi uniform spacing over the globe the layers containing the environmental information were resampled to universal transfer mercator utm and spatial resolution 30m of the landsat products using bilinear interpolation the satellite derived monthly doc concentration in lake okeechobee in 2019 reveals distinct spatial and temporal patterns high concentrations of doc appear in the north eastern part of the lake during the month from june to september a high doc concentration event was observed in june lower concentrations of doc are observed from october to march an exception is the month of december where higher concentrations of doc were predicted in the south eastern part of the lake 4 discussion 4 1 performance of ml algorithms the results imply the strongest performance of gpr with satellite data and environmental variables as inputs this result is in line with several water quality studies in which gpr was found to outperform other ml approaches blix et al 2018 ruescas et al 2018 sun et al 2021 however the differences in the performance scores were subtle especially for the developed mbpnn which predicted doc concentration on the test dataset with about the same precision as gpr yet our cross validation analysis showed that mbpnn predictions were more unstable table 2 suggesting that its generalization performance varies more according to the composition of the data it is applied to considering the small differences in the performance metrics among ml algorithms it is difficult to conclude which method is the best performing ml algorithm in this study we chose gpr as the most promising method and worth continued research and development for water quality applications because of its slightly improved performance scores but also because of its unique advantage that associated standard deviations can be derived along with the estimations on a per pixel basis this feature is very useful for further analysis demonstrated in section 4 3 in this study all four ml approaches tested predict very low or very high doc values with larger errors this is a common issue in water quality research as there are usually fewer samples available for more extreme values here further sampling efforts are necessary that focus specifically on waterbodies with very low or very high doc concentrations on the other hand the landsat data and environmental predictors might simply not be sensitive enough to capture the extreme doc values which could be investigated in further studies while cross validation analysis indicates that a robust overall performance of the ml algorithms systematic bias might still exist on a regional level or for sites with specific characteristics because of the uneven feature distribution in the sample dataset fig s5 s6 and s7 the accuracy of doc estimation could have a spatiotemporal dependence inland waters in areas and in a time period that better reflect the spatiotemporal distribution of the sample dataset would tend to have more accurate doc estimations inland waters with spatiotemporal conditions that are not well represented in the dataset e g mountainous regions during in winter would tend to have less accurate doc estimations however when analyzing the prediction errors against spatial and temporal domains we could not find a significant or clear pattern on the one hand the spatially and temporally inconsistent samples in the dataset may hamper finding such anomalies on the other hand it is extremely difficult to disentangle to what extent many drivers of doc influence its variability we stress that further research should be focused on doc estimation at varying spatial and temporal scales once a more temporally and spatially consistent sample dataset can be obtained apart from the spatiotemporal domain other features can influence the accuracy of the trained algorithms this is illustrated in fig 6 which shows the logarithmic error of the gpr estimates compared to the measurements in the held out test dataset based on the three different water types in which samples were taken the plot shows that the interquartile error range of lakes expands further than estuary and streams it suggests that the algorithm estimated doc concentrations with larger errors for lakes than for the other two water types one reason could be the difference in the dynamics between the inland water types while water flows in streams and estuaries are constantly changing water constituents water parameters in lakes have shown to be much more stable which is also why a larger overpass time window was allowed for lakes see the description of preprocessing steps in support information the ml algorithms might not be able to capture these differences in dynamics especially since there is an overrepresentation of samples for streams in the dataset fig s5 after plotting the spatial distribution of errors from the gpr model for the measurements in the held out test dataset no distinct spatial pattern could be observed fig s3 it should however be considered that the range of samples spans over many years it is thus unlikely to find spatial patterns as the conditions might be considerably different even though the location of samples is in close proximity on the other hand if a specific time window e g summer month in one year is considered the number of samples is too low to analyze if spatial patterns exist while we argue that the focus of this study is on large scale estimations of doc the heterogenous nature of the sample dataset limits the possibilities of more in depth analysis and consequently a better picture of how the model performs under specific conditions it is yet another limitation that underlines the need of systematic and standardized sample efforts for inland waters 4 2 variable importance permutation feature importance analysis showed that the green band is the most important predictor of the six landsat bands followed by the red band and the blue band this result is expected to a certain degree as wavelengths in the visible range and especially the green and red bands are commonly used to explain variations in water quality parameters including the doc related cdom brezonik et al 2015 of all environmental predictors the monthly average air temperature was found to be the most important environmental predictor this result is consistent with other studies that identified temperature as one of the main drivers of doc concentrations in inland waters kellerman et al 2014 liu et al 2021 strock et al 2016 surprisingly total precipitation and average wind speed do not have large impacts on the model performance which contradicts with earlier findings jennings et al 2012 reche and pace 2002 zhou et al 2016 one reason might be that the low temporal and spatial resolution of environmental predictors used in this study is not capable of capturing the highly dynamic processes of precipitation and wind speed for example the time periods between a rainfall event and its subsequent effect on doc concentrations in inland waters can vary considerably and depend on many factors such as soil organic carbon of the soil vegetation and hydrological conditions in the basin blaen et al 2017 wang et al 2019 changes in wind speed are also highly dynamic thus making use of information on wind speed and rainfall may require higher resolution monitoring jennings et al 2012 implying that the era5 land product based on daily averages could be more suitable for these variables lai low vegetation surface net solar radiation and evaporation over inland water were not shown to have a large impact on the model s performance however running the models without these three predictors still results in noticeable drops in rmse table s2 despite their seemingly marginal role in predicting doc the ml models still gain knowledge from them doc variations have been related to many environmental drivers that may produce a variety of effects on doc release that can even work in opposition to each other pagano et al 2014 and vary significantly according to geographic region cool et al 2014 for modelling such complex interactions in different environments the ml approaches still seem to require as much information as possible using the enhanced information due to interaction of multiple variables this implies that using more information could still improve the model s performance the era5 land product offers many more environmental variables than those that were selected in this study to reduce the complexity of the models we selected environmental predictors found to be linked to doc variations in previous studies section 2 2 the considerable improvements observed when including environmental predictors in the models underline the important role of environmental processes in modelling doc variations in inland waters over larger scales however other variables from the era5 land product might still have improved the models even though they might not be directly associated to doc variations more studies are needed to explore the relationships between external drivers and doc concentration in inland waters at different spatiotemporal scales 4 3 application in mapping spatiotemporal variations of doc in an entire water body mapping the monthly doc concentrations in lake okeechobee showed some distinct spatial patterns for example the monthly images show higher doc in the north eastern part of the lake from june to september this pattern could potentially be linked to the increased cyanobacteria blooms that lake okeechobee has experienced lately from early may to september metcalf et al 2018 as the findings of earlier studies suggest that increased doc concentrations are linked to and partially explained by chlorophyll a concentration liu et al 2021 ye et al 2011 furthermore the high concentrations of doc observed in june was in agreement with pahlevan et al 2020 who captured cyanobacteria blooms in lake okeechobee on the 5th of june 2019 using a mixture density model pahlevan et al 2020 fig 8 the spatial pattern of doc concentrations from june and august also suggests large input of doc from the kissime river where water with high levels of doc enter the lake from a south east direction figure s2 which then distributes in the north and east part of the lake these observations indicate that spatial patterns of doc concentration mapped by the gpr model in lake okeechobee are reasonable however since there are only very few studies that have mapped doc concentrations for inland waters a direct comparison of doc estimates or measured doc samples was not possible and thus considerable uncertainties regarding the accuracy of mapped doc remain in addition only a few images per month were available as landsat sensors only have a revisit time of 16 days the more recently launched sentinel 2 satellites offer great potential for inland water remote sensing due to the higher spatial temporal and spectral resolution toming et al 2016 however images are only available from 2017 which would make the vast majority of the aquasat dataset unusable aquasat covers the period 1985 to 2019 if regular updates for the aquasat dataset are foreseen in the future the combination of sentinel 2 and landsat 8 will allow water quality mapping in a much finer spatio temporal scale and give more robust monthly estimates e g chen et al 2020 a unique feature of gpr is that standard deviations can be derived along with the mean estimations which can be interpreted as reliability estimates and mapped for all mean predictions of the model as shown in fig 7 the standard deviations for each pixel of lake okeechobee on june 25th 2019 clearly increase towards the shoreline of the lake the increased uncertainties are most likely due to land adjacency effects where scattering in the atmosphere contaminates water pixels close to the shoreline with radiation from the surrounding land since lake okeechobee is a large lake with a large area of pure open water the reduced reliability of doc estimates is limited to the shoreline area the proportion of uncertainties would however increase when inland waters are narrowly confined within land boundaries more inland water bodies with varying morphometric characteristics could be tested in a future study to gain more insight into how land adjacency effects influence the uncertainty in doc predictions in the central part of the lake a random pattern can be observed most visible as white patches in the gpr standard deviation image fig 7 which is likely an effect of atmospheric interference this problem is further illustrated in figure s4 which shows estimated standard deviations from the gpr model in an area with cloud interference from the image taken on september 29th 2019 uncertainties related to atmospheric correction are one of the key challenges of water quality mapping although recent work found that the lasrc model used for atmospheric correction for landsat 8 products performs well over the amazon river kuhn et al 2019 the correction algorithms are still developed for terrestrial remote sensing there is still big potential in optimizing atmospheric correction for inland waters it was recently shown that different atmospheric processors can have considerable influence on the prediction outcome of water quality mapping pahlevan et al 2021 or even that ml approaches can achieve better predictions without atmospheric correction as information may be lost during the atmospheric correction progress medina lopez 2020 evaluating further possibilities and estimating uncertainties in atmospheric correction processes could give important insights into how they affect satellite derived doc estimates 4 4 limitations of this study an important limitation in this study comes from the in situ data as described in section 2 aquasat is a combination of existing public datasets and thus the techniques methods and interpretations of doc measurements may vary considerably despite our efforts to implement additional quality assurance steps inconsistencies in the sampling technique the instrumentation and their corresponding calibration were not preventable the extent to which such differences are reflected in the algorithm development and validation remains unclear we argue that due to the large number of samples used in this research and the additional quality assurance steps deployed minor differences in some of the sampling methods will not have a significant effect on the overall model development and evaluation however the limitation underlines the potential value coordinated and standardized in situ data collection methods could have another problem with heterogeneous datasets is the uneven distribution of features which also exist in this dataset see support information figs s5 s6 and s7 when the dataset is split randomly there is an increased risk of introducing a bias in the training or test dataset we argue that because the 10 fold cross validation score does not differ substantially from the test score in all algorithms except the mbpnn table 2 the data partitioning does not have a significant influence on the models performance and a random split is reasonable another limitation regards the temporal matching of in situ data and satellite imagery the high number of samples allowed us to set conservative temporal match up limits section 2 yet any time that passes between the time of when the sample was taken and the satellite image was captured is a source of uncertainty also here coordination and standardization efforts where samples are for instance taken with consideration of satellite overpass times and clear weather conditions bear great potential towards more robust satellite derived water quality products lastly although the dataset is not limited to a certain type of water body all samples are located in the continental us the models may estimate doc reasonably well for areas in similar settings but may struggle in places that are totally different in terms of their environmental conditions such issues could be addressed with a larger international sample dataset while our study points towards many limiting challenges for estimating doc in inland waters through remote sensing and machine learning the lack of standardized in situ doc observations is one of the most crucial issues first the possibilities of validation were limited by the heterogenous nature of the aquasat dataset while we could validate the overall performances on continental scale using a held out test datatset the case example on lake okeechobee could only be assessed by visual comparisons to other studies in that area due to a lack of other mapped doc products and spatially and temporally consistent sample measurements therefore although the visual comparisons indicate reasonable doc estimates considerable uncertainties for the regional case of lake okeechobee remain second even though gpr had relatively better performance metrics table 2 it did not show considerable differences in the performance compared to the other algorithms tested in other words all tested ml algorithms showed promise for estimating doc we chose gpr as the most promising method worth continued research and development but emphasize that this choice is also motivated by its useful feature to derive standard deviations for each estimate therefore our study suggests that most of the potential to improve doc estimations and their validation lies in wider more standardized and spatially and temporally consistent in situ measurements such measurements are essential for development and validation of methods particularly satellite based and machine learning based for estimating doc at various spatial and temporal scales in this regard the aquasat dataset represents a first promising approach of open source large scale datasets that could be built on in the future 5 conclusions this study presents the first attempt to estimate dissolved organic carbon doc in inland waters in the continental united states using four machine learning methods and the recent comprehensive data set aquast consisting of in situ measurements coupled with satellite data besides satellite data environmental predictors from global era5 land product notably improved the prediction of doc in all algorithms highlighting the critical role of environmental processes when explaining doc variations among the different methods the gaussian process regression gpr was the most promising algorithm because of its slightly improved performance metrics and more importantly its unique feature to derive standard deviations along with its predictions which showed to be very useful in further analysis the gpr was applied to map doc concentration for each month of an illustrative example lake lake okeechobee 8th largest lake in the us in 2019 which showed patterns that could be linked to previous findings and indicate that doc estimates by the gpr model are reasonable however spatiotemporal estimates of doc in lake okeechobee cannot be rigorously evaluated due to a lack of regional validation data our analysis illustrated remaining issues in atmospheric correction for inland waters using the usgs land surface reflectance satellite products algorithm development was further challenged by the heterogenous nature of large scale open source in situ data and the low spatial and temporal resolution of the environmental predictors although locally tuned models are likely to outperform our developed model in terms of accuracy our developed model can address key issues of inland water remote sensing regarding the lack of in situ measurements and has the potential to show large scale trends of inland doc dynamically over long time periods and seasons this study demonstrates how open source large scale datasets like aquasat in combination machine learning and satellite remote sensing can make research toward estimating doc from inland waters at large scales more realistic credit authorship contribution statement lasse harkort conceptualization data curation methodology writing original draft writing review editing zheng duan conceptualization

water disinfection process sodis is of energy conservation but it is not thorough enough for pathogen inactivation gamage and zhang 2010 as a branch of sodis photocatalysis process with catalyst and oxidant under visible light which is in a wide wavelength range of 43 solar spectrum mohapatra and parida 2017 has been regarded as a promising viable solution to overcome the limitations of traditional disinfection processes liu et al 2016 peroxymonosulfate pms based advanced oxidation processes aops have drawn continued unabated interest from researchers yin et al 2021 especially in photocatalysis processes cao et al 2021 phan et al 2022 pms activation can be efficiently achieved by the energy input in the form of photons with the existence of semiconductor catalysts during photocatalytic activation of pms multifarious reactive oxygen species ros can be generated such as superoxide radical o2 sulfate radical so4 singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radical oh phan et al 2022 tang et al 2022 zhou et al 2021 oh and o2 can be generated during microbial metabolism processes whereupon bacterial cells have produced corresponding anti oxidation enzymes of catalase and superoxide dismutase hence protecting bacterial cells from the damage from low content of oh and o2 in environment beaman et al 1985 among the ros generated by pms 1o2 is more sensitive and selective for bacterial moieties such as lipids proteins and even nucleic acids qiao et al 2012 which results from its long lifespan 3 5 μs and the absence of corresponding anti oxidation enzyme in bacterial cells villén et al 2006 thus application of 1o2 predominant photocatalysis with pms would be promising to gain a high efficient water disinfection most of the pms activation methods generate radicals such as so4 and oh while an increasing number of studies discovered that nonradical dominated pathway with 1o2 also occupied quite a few consequences of pms activations composition and structure of catalyst dramatically influence catalytic performance in heterogeneous catalytic processes carbonaceous materials with porous structures possessing of electron rich functional groups or carbon in the form of π π are favorable to act as electron donors or mediators activate pms fu et al 2022 interestingly 1o2 was found to be main reactive species in most of pms activation with carbon based materials but the mechanism differs from specific materials hou et al 2022 yang et al 2021 moreover metal derived materials such as li al layered double hydroxides li et al 2022 aluminum based layered metal oxides bai et al 2022 cuo mxene nanocomposites yang et al 2022b and bimetallic mofe tio2 nanospheres dong et al 2021 are regarded to be conducive to pms activation to produce 1o2 by accelerating electrons transition hence the mofs jiao et al 2019 which are composed with c o groups transition metals and regular uniform pore structures are considered potential catalysts to promote pms to generate 1o2 mainly through enhanced electron transition bi et al 2022 khojastegi et al 2022 roy et al 2022 among the omnifarious mofs fe based and zn based mofs materials can be considered as candidates since they can response to visible light huo et al 2021 xia et al 2023 however it has been reported that photocorrosion tend to happen with zn based photocatalysts leading to poor stability and secondary pollution abdollahi et al 2021 the fe based mofs exhibiting an extraordinary light absorption and photocatalytic performance due to its internal fe o clusters huo et al 2021 staying good water and light stability during catalytic process yang et al 2022a is a kind of feasible catalyst however narrow utilization range of visible light 400 600 nm and poor photo generated hole electron separation efficiency confine the photocatalytic applications of mil 101 fe xie et al 2022 to improve the situation modifications on mil 101 fe are urgently needed quantum dots qds have drawn increasing attention in the fields of electronic devices solar cell and particularly in catalytic process for the sake of ultra small size qd has special properties such as quantum confinement effect and surface effect energy levels near femi level vary from continuous states to discrete states and its surface atoms are too unstable to combine with other atoms which allows expediting electron migration adjusting band gap and providing highly active sites liu et al 2022a besides compared with bulk materials electron hole pairs separation efficiency in qds can be enhanced on account of the tiny sizes zhong et al 2022 a modified porous polyimide aerogel exhibited an efficient visible light photocatalytic degradation over oxytetracycline with carbon qds and zns qds tailoring its band gap and improving the separation of photoexcited electron and hole liu et al 2022c similarly liu et al employed cuins2 qds to promote charge separation migration of 3d graphene oxide array achieving an efficient photocatalytic synthesis of xylonic acid liu et al 2022a to date most of studies have centered on investigating various carbon quantum dots and several semiconductor qds such as zns qds and cds qds kim et al 2015a sharma et al 2022 cus qds are of good stability little toxicity and low cost they exhibit a remarkable enhanced absorption of visible light when compared with cus nanoparticles li et al 2016 moreover as a result of the strong quantum confinement effect the excitons or spins in qds are likely to be confined which making it possible for qds to function as a photosensitizer yuan et al 2017 it is reported that only a few qds can work as photosensitizers in which energy transfer exist during the photo excitation process benefiting for 1o2 quantum yield ge et al 2014 and the cus qds is one of the few qds vinoth et al 2022 attributed to its high biocompatibility and excellent visible light absorption currently cus qds become increasingly popular in tumor photodynamic therapy procedures where the 1o2 acts as the main ros zhong et al 2016 given that the features of cus qds introducing cus qds in mil 101 fe is an ideal strategy to promote the photocatalytic performance inspired by above discussion zero dimensional cus qds were synthesized a novel photocatalyst mil 101 fe modified by cus qds csqds mf was prepared for the first time a 1o2 predominated vis

vis spectroscopy briefly a mixture with 20 μg ml dpbf and 100 μg ml catalyst was prepared in dark and then irradiated with led lamps for different periods of time then the uv vis spectrophotometer was employed to record absorbance changes of dpbf in addition the generation of 1o2 in reaction aqueous solution was further confirmed by using commercial singlet oxygen sensor green sosg which is highly selective for 1o2 ruiz gonzalez et al 2017 typically a mixture with 100 μg ml catalyst 50 μmol l oxidant and 10 mmol l sosg was prepared in dark and then irradiated with led lamps at certain intervals a microplate reader synergy mx biotek u s a was employed for recording the fluorescence emission of sosg at 525 nm and the excitation wavelength was at 504 nm 2 6 bacterial analysis to look into the mechanism of bacterial inactivation process bacterial membrane integrity intracellular ros and dna analysis were investigated the exhaustive descriptions of analysis methods care listed in text s7 s9 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of primary reactive species the cus qds modified mil 101 fe was successfully prepared which was demonstrated by a variety of characterizations including sem tem eds and xrd as detailed in text s10 and figs s1 s2 previous studies reported that pms activation with catalyst under visible light can generate ros such as oh so4 o2 and 1o2 eqs 1 9 h ming et al 2022 phan et al 2022 tang et al 2022 in this study catalyst was designed for the purpose of 1o2 generation to verify the assumption reactive species existing in the vis pms csqds mf system were identified with epr as demonstrated in figs 1a 1c four kinds of peaks were observed in the vis pms csqds mf system after 2 min reaction the triplet spectrum a n 16 3 g with intensities 1 1 1 indicated temp 1o2 adduct signal hadjur et al 1994 whose intensity significantly enhanced at 10 min reaction implying 1o2 was constantly generated in the system besides dmpoo2h adduct signal with hyperfine coupling constants a n 14 2 g a h β 11 34 g a h γ 1 25 g and a o 17 5 9 g was detected mottley et al 1986 demonstrating the o2 was produced which kept its intensity until reacting for 10 min moreover two kinds of peaks with hyperfine coupling constants of a n a h β 14 9 g for dmpooh adduct dikalov and mason 1999 and a n 13 7 g a h β 10 2 g a h1 γ 1 51 g and a h2 γ 0 8 g for dmpo so4 adduct were probed wei et al 2017 whose peak intensities were weak at two minute reaction interestingly the adduct signals of dmpooh and dmpo so4 disappeared when the reaction lasted for 10 min in our study the oh was inferred to be generated as a result of oh oxidation by so4 eqs 4 and reduction of hso5 eqs 5 previous study reported that dmpooh adduct is instable and its degradation obeys first order kinetics reszka et al 2006 so the extremely low concentrations of oh and so4 existed in vis pms csqds mf system might contribute to the disappeared signals khan et al 2003 from the results of epr the main ros in vis pms csqds mf system were products from oxygen molecular activation 3 3 5 5 tetramethylbenzidine tmb is used as a visualization reagent in detecting activated oxygen molecular including oh o2 h2o2 and 1o2 the colorless tmb will turn into blue when it is oxidized and generates ox tmb zhang et al 2021a to further clarify the contributions of reactive species of the vis pms csqds mf system quenching experiments of tmb oxidation with different scavengers were introduced for semi quantitative analysis diverse trapping agents were applied for ros quenching on account of reaction rate constants for quenching oh tertiary butyl alcohol tba was employed and the k oh tba is 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 ikhlaq et al 2012 methanol was used for oh and so4 quenching k oh methanol 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 k so4 methanol 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 oh et al 2016 wang et al 2018 as for 1o2 quenching l histidine was utilized k 1o2 l histidine 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 wade and tucker 1998 p benzoquinone was employed for o2 quenching k o2 p benzoquinone 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 yao et al 2020 as depicted in fig 1d compared with the experimental group without scavenger tba and methanol barely inhibited the tmb oxidation excluding the role of oh and so4 in tmb oxidation however tmb oxidation obviously decreased when adding p benzoquinone and l histidine the quenching effect of l histidine was more remarkable than p benzoquinone results again suggested that negligible amount of oh and so4 existed in the system while o2 and 1o2 were the main active species according to quenching experiments and the related reactions eqs 2 8 and 9 1o2 played a leading role in the system while o2 was a precursor before being oxidated into 1o2 1 photocatalyst hν h e 2 o2 e o2 3 hso5 e so4 oh 4 so4 oh oh so4 2 5 hso5 e oh so4 2 6 hso5 h so5 h 7 so5 so5 2so4 2 1o2 8 o2 oh oh 1o2 9 o2 h 1o2 3 2 photoelectric properties of catalysts to investigate the photoelectric property variations of mil 101 fe before and after cus qds modification a series of photoelectric analyses were performed first the photocatalytic properties of mil 101 fe and csqds mf were measured by uv vis diffraction as reflected in fig 2a csqds mf owned an enhanced visible light absorption capacity than mil 101 fe accordingly the bandgap energy eg values were further estimated through tauc equation text s11 jubu et al 2020 the energy bandgaps of mil 101 fe and csqds mf were 2 36 ev and 1 64 ev respectively moreover to evaluate the flat band potential position mott schottky measurements were employed for n type semiconductor the conduction band potential and flat band potential values are approximately equal in general li et al 2013 as shown in fig 2b the conduction bands of mil 101 fe and csqds mf were 0 886 ev and 0 591 ev versus normal hydrogen electrode nhe respectively correspondingly the valence bands vs nhe were calculated as 1 47 ev for mil 101 fe and 1 05 ev for csqds mf approximately the conduction band of csqds mf is lower than the potential to generate o2 e0 o2 o2 0 33 ev nosaka and nosaka 2017 and the valence band of csqds mf cannot reach the potential of producing oh e0 oh oh 2 68 ev nosaka and nosaka 2017 namely it could generate o2 rather than oh with csqds mf under visible light irradiation which is also supported by the fee radicals scavenging experiments fig 1d a narrower energy bandgap means a stronger electron transfer capacity in photocatalytic process hao et al 2012 to further assess the electrical conductivity of catalysts electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis analysis was conducted csqds mf showed a smaller semicircular radius than mil 101 fe fig 2c demonstrating a lower resistance in electrons transfer and a better separation efficiency of photogenerated charges bian et al 2021 liu et al 2022b light absorption in photocatalyst generally can lead to the formation of electronically excited states that are delocalized as free charge carrier pairs then giving rise to a photocurrent however alternative processes involving the excited electron hole pair have to compete with efficient recombination thus the quantum yields for photoelectrochemical reactions at illuminated semiconductor photocatalysts are usually very small to evaluate the quantum efficiency photocurrent response spectroscopy was measured with a xenon lamp λ 400 nm as depicted in fig 2d the photocurrent intensity of csqds mf significantly enhanced compared with mil 101 fe revealing a stronger separation of excited electron hole pairs which is beneficial to the redox reaction on the surface of photocatalyst 3 3 insight mechanism of enhanced 1o2 generation it has been confirmed that 1o2 was the predominant activate species in the vis pms csqds mf system by above epr tests and quenching experiments to appraise the 1o2 quantum yields φ of the developed photocatalysts methylene blue mb was employed as the standard φ 0 52 by measuring the change of optical density od of a typical 1o2 indicator dpbf figs 3a and text s12 results demonstrated that φ mil 101 fe 0 35 while φ csqds mf 0 63 namely compared with mil 101 fe the 1o2 quantum yields of csqds mf was significantly enhanced which was 1 8 times more efficient in generating 1o2 than mil 101 fe moreover photoluminescence pl spectroscopy was carried out to further verify electron hole separation efficiency and the possibility of generating 1o2 as shown in fig 3b fluorescence intensity of mil 101 fe was obviously higher than csqds mf indicating that there were more excited electron holes recombination in mil 101 fe interestingly the phosphorescence intensity of mil 101 fe was weaker than csqds mf fig 3c theoretically fluorescence and phosphorescence emissions were direct evidences for the existence of singlet states and triplet states respectively zhang et al 2021b the enhanced phosphorescence intensity of csqds mf demonstrated an increased triplet state population the formation of 1o2 in photocatalysis process generally through two pathways one is the electron transfer or the oxidation of o2 the other is the photocatalyst in excited state can transfer energy to the triplet ground state of o2 huang et al 2020 electron transfer occurs in charge carrier involved photocatalysis while energy transfer happens in exciton involved photocatalysis zhang et al 2021a the remarkable phosphorescence signal of csqds mf inferred that considerable amount of triplet states existed which rest in exciton involved photocatalysis process besides energy transfer from singlet states of sensitizers to the ground state of o2 is spin forbidden the generation of 1o2 mainly relies on the energy transfer from triplet states zhang et al 2021b triplet states are usually produced during the vibrational relaxation of singlet states this process is known as intersystem crossing isc in brief a higher singlet exciton concentration facilitates isc processes resulting in an enhanced formation of triplet states generally binding energies which exhibit prominent dependence on size and thickness have great impact on singlet exciton concentrations in semiconductors in other words smaller size or thinner materials tend to own higher singlet excitation concentration zhang et al 2021a hence the ultrathin csqds is an essential prerequisite for promoting to generate higher singlet exciton concentration and enhanced isc processes resulting in producing more triplet states additionally o2 generation in the vis pms csqds mf system implied the existence of charge carrier involved photocatalysis as supported by above results of eis photocurrent response spectroscopy and pl spectroscopy it was pretty definite that electron transfer was boosted by modifying mil 101 fe with csqds then promoted the 1o2 yield in detail oxygen molecules adsorbed on the surface of photocatalyst trapped electrons from conduction band and generated o2 then it should be oxidized by valence band holes to generate 1o2 eqs 1 2 and 9 significantly the participation of pms eqs 3 8 was also a nonnegligible pathway to generate 1o2 in vis pms csqds mf system pms served as competitors to react with photogenerated electrons and holes so as to enhance the electron hole pairs separation and benefited the charge carrier involved photocatalysis process nevertheless the contribution of electron transfer and energy transfer to generate 1o2 remains unrevealed sorbic acid sa is highly selective for triplet states because it only accepts the energy transferring from the triplet state matters rather than the excited ones grebel et al 2011 therefore quenching experiments with sa for triplet state quenching and p benzoquinone for o2 quenching were carried out as described in fig 3d both of the addition of sa and p benzoquinone could inhibit the oxidation of tmb to a certain degree thereinto p benzoquinone had a slightly stronger inhibitory effect than sa demonstrating the contribution of electron transfer process was higher than energy transfer process on balance compared with mil 101 fe the enhanced 1o2 yields of csqds mf was owing to the stronger electron transfer for o2 oxidation and the higher population of the triplet states 3 4 disinfection performance of vis pms csqds mf system now that 1o2 has been identified to be the predominant active species in vis pms csqds mf system a sequence of bacterial inactivation experiments choosing e coli as model bacteria were further executed to investigate the disinfection performance firstly safety of photocatalysts was confirmed by control test with mixing e coli and csqds mf in the dark fig s3a then the visible light was also verified to be uninjurious as shown in fig 4a compared with vis csqds mf vis pms and csqds mf pms systems the vis pms csqds mf system exhibited the best disinfection performance disinfecting 7 5 log e coli cells in 60 min then followed by csqds mf pms system which can lead to 5 2 log inactivation and vis pms system for 4 1 log vis csqds mf for 1 1 log these consequences emphasized the existence of pms could remarkably improve bacterial inactivation efficiency however the bacterial inactivation performance of vis pms csqds fig s3i was similar to the vis pms indicating that pure csqds cannot make full use of visible light under the given concentration the disinfection effect mainly depended on pms moreover the active species amounts 1o2 output of each group were monitored with tmb measurements fig s5a as demonstrated in figs 4a and s5 the bacterial inactivation efficiency of vis pms csqds mf vis csqds mf and vis pms csqds mf systems were corresponding to the tmb oxidation intensity which demonstrating the differences of activated molecular oxygen not surprisingly the activate species amount of vis pms csqds mf system was the highest as a result of 1o2 yield enhancement in contrast the pms csqds mf group generated less 1o2 emphasizing the indispensable of visible light input in the process of pms activation interestingly the tmb oxidation intensity of vis pms could not support its disinfection efficiency in can be inferred that a very small amount of 1o2 generated in vis pms system according to the result of tmb experiment which might due to the low concentration of pms it can be assumed that the disinfection effect should come from the pms which is of germicidal efficacy lópez vinent et al 2022 to thoroughly figure out the bacterial inactivation process of vis pms csqds mf system disinfection experiments were conducted by varying influence factors including pms concentration fig s3b e coli concentration fig s3c and photocatalyst dosage fig s3d and fitted by chick watson model text s13 it can be summed from the results that both of increasing the pms concentration and photocatalyst dosage could enhance the disinfection efficiency which can be ascribed more activate species production besides the lower bacterial initial concentrations led to higher inactivation efficiencies because less e coli cells could take more chances to contact with active species to discern the influence capacity of each factor inactivation fitting parameters were calculated with chick watson model and detail values were listed in table s1 as shown in fig 4b the change rule of k values was consistent with disinfection efficiency among these factors the initial e coli concentration impacted the rate constant most significantly to explore the application potential in practice water it is important to understand the law of bactericidal efficiency under different ph values and dissolve oxygen do to rule out the effect of ph and do on bacterial survival control experiments were employed as shown in figs s3e and s3f respectively e coli cells remained a stable activity in a ph range from 3 to 9 and stayed active under anaerobic and oxygen rich condition as illustrated in fig 4c the disinfection efficiency significantly improved under acidic aqueous which might be because the negative charged cell wall surface consists of various proteins qiao et al 2012 protons in acidic solution could neutralize negative charges on bacterial surface then reducing electrostatic repulsion between the bacteria cell membrane and hso5 hence accelerating disinfection efficiency jiang et al 2022 besides the alkaline condition promoted the efficiency as well alkaline conditions induce nucleophilic attack of so5 2 to the peroxide oxygen of hso5 leading to the pms self decay and 1o2 formation lee et al 2020 do is of vital importance in this disinfection process because o2 is fundamental for 1o2 generation as depicted in fig 4d higher do concentration fig s3h led to better disinfection performance of the system implying more 1o2 was generated in o2 saturated solution which also was supported by the sosg results fig s3g in all the developed vis pms csqds mf system is of good ph and do adaptability 3 5 stability and reusability of the vis pms csqds mf system from a practical point of view the stability and reusability arouse wide attention in terms of cost effectiveness and environmental concern of photocatalyst to further estimate the practicability of vis pms csqds mf system five repeated regenerations of csqds mf was conducted via simple water washing and oven drying as shown in fig 4e even the photocatalyst has been used for five cylces the disinfection efficiency maintains the same as the first use confirming that csqds mf exhibited excellent reusability to gain an insight into the stability of csqds mf the chemical compositions of csqds mf and bonding states of the elements were investigated by xps characterization as displayed in xps survey spectra fig 4f the presence of c o and fe elements in csqds mf was revealed the super weak peak of s element and the missing spectrum of cu should be due to the extreme low content of cus qds the variations of elements chemical states were also analyzed figs s4 and text s14 generally the xps spectrum of cycle used csqds mf was well matched with the fresh one confirming an excellent photocatalytic stability furthermore metal ions leaching and bacterial survivals in metal ions solutions were evaluated fig s6a depicts that after sixty minute reaction only 33 8 μg l fe3 and 3 4 μg l cu2 leached in the aqueous which also supports the stability of photocatalyst bacterial activities were investigated at different fe3 and cu2 concentrations figs s6b s6d reveal that fe3 and cu2 leached in the vis pms csqds mf system were harmless to e coli cells reactive species were the main cause of bacterial inactivation 3 6 bacterial inactivation mechanisms membrane integrity is fundamental to bacterial activity and metabolism ros in aqueous solution usually attack the cell membranes first to induce a series of cell stress reaction and finally result in bacterial inactivation he et al 2021 the membrane integrity variations of e coli during the photocatalysis process were explored by using laser confocal scanning microscopy lcsm flow cytometry fcm for and sem for qualitative and quantitative analysis lcsm results fig 5b illustrated that the proportion of intact membrane green fluorescence emission was gradually decreased with photocatalysis progress establishing that 1o2 acted on the cell membranes and caused membrane damages as expected the results of fcm analysis fig 5a were in accordance with lcsm results it is worth noting that compared with the above results of plate count the proportion of damaged membrane was slightly lower than the one of inactivated bacteria it can be explained that a small number of bacterial cells were under a viable but nonculturable vbnc state during the treatment process fida et al 2017 which might be potential microbial hazards in water however with the passage of reaction ros produced in the system increased fig s7 and finally eliminated vbnc cells results of fcm and plate count were consistent at the end of treatment moreover morphology changes of e coli cells were recorded by sem analysis fig 5c which graphically portrayed the membrane tattering and distorting process the untreated cell possessed intact plump and smooth membrane at the beginning whereas during the inactivation big holes pits and wrinkles on membrane came into being the formation of membrane defects and holes could facilitate 1o2 entrance into cytoplasm and boost bactericidal progress after 60 min treatment bacterial membranes were fully out of shape indicating an irreversible cell death to better understand the inactivation process bacterial responses against oxidative stress posed by the vis pms csqds mf system were investigated by intracellular ros analysis generally the stable level of intracellular ros reflects a good activity of bacterial cell as shown in fig 5d the rank order of intercellular ros levels was in keeping with the disinfection performance followed as vis pms csqds mf pms csqds mf vis pms vis csqds mf and vis environmental 1o2 concentrations in different systems were monitored by sosg probe as well fig s8 except the vis pms system the rank orders of intracellular ros levels and 1o2 concentrations were consistent the high intracellular ros levels in vis pms system might be attributed to strong oxidative and bactericidal properties of pms as discussed above for bacterial cells intracellular ros such as h2o2 oh and o2 were inevitable by products during aerobic metabolism park et al 2011 accordingly catalase and superoxide dismutase are available in bacteria to keep redox balance in vivo beaman et al 1985 but corresponding enzyme for resisting oxidative stress from 1o2 is of absence in vis pms csqds mf system it can be concluded that a mass of 1o2 generated in the aqueous and attacked the bacterial cells the accumulation of intracellular ros gradually exceeded the threshold of bacterial cells to self regulate eventually triggering oxidative stress which can damage cellular sites such as protein cysteine iron sulfur clusters cell membrane and even dna jiang et al 2022 furthermore dna gel electrophoresis was employed to investigate changes of dna integrity as depicted in fig 5e two distinct dna bands of untreated e coli cells were observed at about 3000 bp and greater than 5000 bp with the progress of treatment dna strand broke into small pieces and the band at 1500 bp arose ultimately the two initial bands vanished and a shallow band around 1500 bp left manifesting a thorough dna cleavages resulting in irreversible bacterial death on account of above consequences a hypothetic disinfection mechanism in vis pms csqds mf system was proposed promoted electron transfer enhanced energy transfer and the existence of pms for stronger charge carrier pairs separation facilitated the 1o2 generation the 1o2 formed in the aqueous solution attacked the cell membranes first made the bacterial cell out of shape caused abundant membrane damages such as holes and pits to enable 1o2 get into the cytoplasm environmental ever rising 1o2 concentration initiated oxidative stress then bacterial intracellular ros level up regulated at the end the dna strand broke into pieces under the destroy from self intracellular ros and extraneous 1o2 3 7 disinfection applicability in practical wastewater the disinfection performance to gram positive bacterium remains unknown since e coli is a typical gram negative bacterium b subtilis a representative of gram positive bacteria was chosen as a target pathogen the results fig 6a showed more time was needed for vis pms csqds mf system to inactivate b subtilis than e coli only 5 2 log b subtilis cells were inactivated within 120 min the reason might lie in the different thickness of cell walls a thicker peptidoglycan layer 20 40 nm of gram positive bacterium consumes more ros than that of gram negative bacterium 10 nm kim et al 2015b even so the consequences still supported that the developed vis pms csqds mf system can disinfect both of gram negative and gram positive bacteria furthermore to evaluate the disinfection efficiency of vis pms csqds mf for actual wastewater inactivation performance of fecal coliforms in secondary effluent from a hospital wastewater was studied as illustrated in fig 6b it took 120 min to reach 4 8 log cfu l fecal coliforms when pms concentration was 50 μm practical wastewater contains a lot of inorganic ions and dissolve organic matters which consume oxidant and compete with pathogens for 1o2 weakening the bactericidal efficiency subsequently with the increase of pms concentration disinfection time became shorter it required 60 min for thorough disinfection of 4 8 log cfu l fecal coliforms by adding 150 μm pms overall the developed vis pms csqds mf system is applicable for practical wastewater disinfection 4 conclusion in this work a 1o2 predominated vis pms csqds mf water disinfection system was developed cus qds modified mil 101 fe exhibited a better photocatalytic efficiency by promoting the visible light absorption accelerating electron transfer ability and enhancing charge carrier separation efficiency a great part of 1o2 in the system was produced from the enhanced electron transfer process and the rest was generated by energy transfer process with reinforced intersystem crossing it took 60 min to inactivate 7 5 log e coli by the vis pms csqds mf system besides the system kept good bactericidal performance in the condition of ph ranging from 3 to 9 and different do concentrations what s more the csqds mf could maintain good performance and stable structure after five cycles 1o2 attacked the bacterial cell membranes first led to abundant membrane damages to enable 1o2 get into the cytoplasm up regulated intracellular ros level and broke dna strand at the end the developed system showed good disinfection effect on both gram positive b subtilis and fecal coliforms in practical wastewater indicating the vis pms csqds mf system is a

water disinfection process sodis is of energy conservation but it is not thorough enough for pathogen inactivation gamage and zhang 2010 as a branch of sodis photocatalysis process with catalyst and oxidant under visible light which is in a wide wavelength range of 43 solar spectrum mohapatra and parida 2017 has been regarded as a promising viable solution to overcome the limitations of traditional disinfection processes liu et al 2016 peroxymonosulfate pms based advanced oxidation processes aops have drawn continued unabated interest from researchers yin et al 2021 especially in photocatalysis processes cao et al 2021 phan et al 2022 pms activation can be efficiently achieved by the energy input in the form of photons with the existence of semiconductor catalysts during photocatalytic activation of pms multifarious reactive oxygen species ros can be generated such as superoxide radical o2 sulfate radical so4 singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radical oh phan et al 2022 tang et al 2022 zhou et al 2021 oh and o2 can be generated during microbial metabolism processes whereupon bacterial cells have produced corresponding anti oxidation enzymes of catalase and superoxide dismutase hence protecting bacterial cells from the damage from low content of oh and o2 in environment beaman et al 1985 among the ros generated by pms 1o2 is more sensitive and selective for bacterial moieties such as lipids proteins and even nucleic acids qiao et al 2012 which results from its long lifespan 3 5 μs and the absence of corresponding anti oxidation enzyme in bacterial cells villén et al 2006 thus application of 1o2 predominant photocatalysis with pms would be promising to gain a high efficient water disinfection most of the pms activation methods generate radicals such as so4 and oh while an increasing number of studies discovered that nonradical dominated pathway with 1o2 also occupied quite a few consequences of pms activations composition and structure of catalyst dramatically influence catalytic performance in heterogeneous catalytic processes carbonaceous materials with porous structures possessing of electron rich functional groups or carbon in the form of π π are favorable to act as electron donors or mediators activate pms fu et al 2022 interestingly 1o2 was found to be main reactive species in most of pms activation with carbon based materials but the mechanism differs from specific materials hou et al 2022 yang et al 2021 moreover metal derived materials such as li al layered double hydroxides li et al 2022 aluminum based layered metal oxides bai et al 2022 cuo mxene nanocomposites yang et al 2022b and bimetallic mofe tio2 nanospheres dong et al 2021 are regarded to be conducive to pms activation to produce 1o2 by accelerating electrons transition hence the mofs jiao et al 2019 which are composed with c o groups transition metals and regular uniform pore structures are considered potential catalysts to promote pms to generate 1o2 mainly through enhanced electron transition bi et al 2022 khojastegi et al 2022 roy et al 2022 among the omnifarious mofs fe based and zn based mofs materials can be considered as candidates since they can response to visible light huo et al 2021 xia et al 2023 however it has been reported that photocorrosion tend to happen with zn based photocatalysts leading to poor stability and secondary pollution abdollahi et al 2021 the fe based mofs exhibiting an extraordinary light absorption and photocatalytic performance due to its internal fe o clusters huo et al 2021 staying good water and light stability during catalytic process yang et al 2022a is a kind of feasible catalyst however narrow utilization range of visible light 400 600 nm and poor photo generated hole electron separation efficiency confine the photocatalytic applications of mil 101 fe xie et al 2022 to improve the situation modifications on mil 101 fe are urgently needed quantum dots qds have drawn increasing attention in the fields of electronic devices solar cell and particularly in catalytic process for the sake of ultra small size qd has special properties such as quantum confinement effect and surface effect energy levels near femi level vary from continuous states to discrete states and its surface atoms are too unstable to combine with other atoms which allows expediting electron migration adjusting band gap and providing highly active sites liu et al 2022a besides compared with bulk materials electron hole pairs separation efficiency in qds can be enhanced on account of the tiny sizes zhong et al 2022 a modified porous polyimide aerogel exhibited an efficient visible light photocatalytic degradation over oxytetracycline with carbon qds and zns qds tailoring its band gap and improving the separation of photoexcited electron and hole liu et al 2022c similarly liu et al employed cuins2 qds to promote charge separation migration of 3d graphene oxide array achieving an efficient photocatalytic synthesis of xylonic acid liu et al 2022a to date most of studies have centered on investigating various carbon quantum dots and several semiconductor qds such as zns qds and cds qds kim et al 2015a sharma et al 2022 cus qds are of good stability little toxicity and low cost they exhibit a remarkable enhanced absorption of visible light when compared with cus nanoparticles li et al 2016 moreover as a result of the strong quantum confinement effect the excitons or spins in qds are likely to be confined which making it possible for qds to function as a photosensitizer yuan et al 2017 it is reported that only a few qds can work as photosensitizers in which energy transfer exist during the photo excitation process benefiting for 1o2 quantum yield ge et al 2014 and the cus qds is one of the few qds vinoth et al 2022 attributed to its high biocompatibility and excellent visible light absorption currently cus qds become increasingly popular in tumor photodynamic therapy procedures where the 1o2 acts as the main ros zhong et al 2016 given that the features of cus qds introducing cus qds in mil 101 fe is an ideal strategy to promote the photocatalytic performance inspired by above discussion zero dimensional cus qds were synthesized a novel photocatalyst mil 101 fe modified by cus qds csqds mf was prepared for the first time a 1o2 predominated vis pms csqds mf water disinfection system was developed in this study the mechanism of enhanced 1o2 generation was studied by a series of photoelectric analyses besides disinfection performance of vis pms csqds mf system service life of catalyst and mechanisms of bacterial inactivation were discussed moreover to evaluate the universality of the vis pms csqds mf system disinfection performance on gram positive bacteria and fecal coliform in actual sewage was investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals microbials and wastewater sampling the detail information of chemical reagents microbials wastewater sampling and water quality analysis is shown in text s1 s3 2 2 preparation of cus qds mil 101 fe and csqds mf cus qds were prepared with cupric chloride and polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp as starting materials typically a mixture of 100 μl 300 mmol l copper ii chloride dihydrate and 10 ml 100 mg ml pvp solution was magnetically kept stirring for 5 min followed with 30 μl 1 mol l sodium sulfide solution added the pvp can cap to the precursors to control the growing sizes of cus qds sharma et al 2021 then an oil bath at 90 c was applied to heat the mixture with 15 min stir to get a uniform solution finally the obtained brown solution was transferred to ice water to cool down and stored in a 4 c refrigerator the csqds mf was produced by in situ growth with a mild solvothermal process by modifying a reported synthesis method of mil 101 fe li et al 2019 briefly 2 5 mm terephthalic acid bdc 5 mm fecl3 6h2o and 30 ml n n dimethylformamide dmf were mixed and put in a teflon container then the mixture was treated by ultrasound to disperse the powder after that 3 ml prepared cus quantum dots solution was add into the mixture then heated in an autoclave at 110 c for 15 h the produced powder was washed with dmf and hot ethanol for three times finally the csqds mf powder was dried at 60 c for 24 h to wipe off moisture mil 101 fe was prepared in the same procedures without adding cus quantum dots the prepared samples were stored in the dark 2 3 characterization of materials the characterization details of materials are provided in supplementary information text s4 s6 2 4 photocatalysis disinfection e coli was chosen to evaluate disinfection performance e coli cells cultured to late logarithmic stage were harvested and then suspended in sterile saline at od600 0 1 for later use photocatalysis disinfection experiments were carried under light emitting diode led irradiation the photo intensity was about 11 000 lux 400 nm cel lab200e7 china education au light china the prepared e coli solution was treated with a certain amount of catalyst and pms under the irradiation and magnetic stir samples were taken from the reaction mixture and diluted to a suitable concentration after a certain time interval then viable bacterial number was investigated with traditional spread plate count to study the disinfection performance on gram positive bacteria inactivation tests of b subtilis were conducted in the same procedures as e coli culture conditions of b subtilis was the same as e coli all the disinfection tests were conducted for three times besides photocatalytic disinfection experiments on bacteria in practical wastewater were carried out wastewater sample was filtered through sterile acetate fiber filter membrane 0 45 μm 50 mm then the filter membrane was affixed to mfc culture medium and the blue colonies were counted after 24 h culture at 44 5 c sterile water shall be used as blank control plate for each culture test 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 detection of reactive species to verify the reactive species generation in reaction process 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was applied as the spin trapping reagent for oh and so4 in aqueous solution wei et al 2017 and for o2 in methanol mottley et al 1986 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp was used as the spin trapping for 1o2 bai et al 2022 typically an aqueous mixture was irradiated under light λ 400 nm which contains 100 μg ml catalyst 50 μmol l oxidant and 10 mmol l spin trapping agent aliquots were collected after certain time intervals for further electron paramagnetic resonance technology epr emxplus bruker germany analysis 2 5 2 detection of molecular oxygen activation acetic acid sodium acetate hac naac buffer solution containing 100 μg ml catalyst 50 μmol l oxidant and 50 μmol l 3 3 5 5 tetramethylbenzidine tmb was irradiated by a led lamp λ 400 nm tmb oxidation was assessed by uv vis spectrophotometer at the absorbance of 370 nm and 660 nm after a certain interval zhang et al 2021a 2 5 3 chemical detection of singlet oxygen 1 3 diphenylisobenzofuran dpbf was used as a typical trap to detect and evaluate 1o2 quantum yield via uv vis spectroscopy briefly a mixture with 20 μg ml dpbf and 100 μg ml catalyst was prepared in dark and then irradiated with led lamps for different periods of time then the uv vis spectrophotometer was employed to record absorbance changes of dpbf in addition the generation of 1o2 in reaction aqueous solution was further confirmed by using commercial singlet oxygen sensor green sosg which is highly selective for 1o2 ruiz gonzalez et al 2017 typically a mixture with 100 μg ml catalyst 50 μmol l oxidant and 10 mmol l sosg was prepared in dark and then irradiated with led lamps at certain intervals a microplate reader synergy mx biotek u s a was employed for recording the fluorescence emission of sosg at 525 nm and the excitation wavelength was at 504 nm 2 6 bacterial analysis to look into the mechanism of bacterial inactivation process bacterial membrane integrity intracellular ros and dna analysis were investigated the exhaustive descriptions of analysis methods care listed in text s7 s9 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of primary reactive species the cus qds modified mil 101 fe was successfully prepared which was demonstrated by a variety of characterizations including sem tem eds and xrd as detailed in text s10 and figs s1 s2 previous studies reported that pms activation with catalyst under visible light can generate ros such as oh so4 o2 and 1o2 eqs 1 9 h ming et al 2022 phan et al 2022 tang et al 2022 in this study catalyst was designed for the purpose of 1o2 generation to verify the assumption reactive species existing in the vis pms csqds mf system were identified with epr as demonstrated in figs 1a 1c four kinds of peaks were observed in the vis pms csqds mf system after 2 min reaction the triplet spectrum a n 16 3 g with intensities 1 1 1 indicated temp 1o2 adduct signal hadjur et al 1994 whose intensity significantly enhanced at 10 min reaction implying 1o2 was constantly generated in the system besides dmpoo2h adduct signal with hyperfine coupling constants a n 14 2 g a h β 11 34 g a h γ 1 25 g and a o 17 5 9 g was detected mottley et al 1986 demonstrating the o2 was produced which kept its intensity until reacting for 10 min moreover two kinds of peaks with hyperfine coupling constants of a n a h β 14 9 g for dmpooh adduct dikalov and mason 1999 and a n 13 7 g a h β 10 2 g a h1 γ 1 51 g and a h2 γ 0 8 g for dmpo so4 adduct were probed wei et al 2017 whose peak intensities were weak at two minute reaction interestingly the adduct signals of dmpooh and dmpo so4 disappeared when the reaction lasted for 10 min in our study the oh was inferred to be generated as a result of oh oxidation by so4 eqs 4 and reduction of hso5 eqs 5 previous study reported that dmpooh adduct is instable and its degradation obeys first order kinetics reszka et al 2006 so the extremely low concentrations of oh and so4 existed in vis pms csqds mf system might contribute to the disappeared signals khan et al 2003 from the results of epr the main ros in vis pms csqds mf system were products from oxygen molecular activation 3 3 5 5 tetramethylbenzidine tmb is used as a visualization reagent in detecting activated oxygen molecular including oh o2 h2o2 and 1o2 the colorless tmb will turn into blue when it is oxidized and generates ox tmb zhang et al 2021a to further clarify the contributions of reactive species of the vis pms csqds mf system quenching experiments of tmb oxidation with different scavengers were introduced for semi quantitative analysis diverse trapping agents were applied for ros quenching on account of reaction rate constants for quenching oh tertiary butyl alcohol tba was employed and the k oh tba is 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 ikhlaq et al 2012 methanol was used for oh and so4 quenching k oh methanol 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 k so4 methanol 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 oh et al 2016 wang et al 2018 as for 1o2 quenching l histidine was utilized k 1o2 l histidine 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 wade and tucker 1998 p benzoquinone was employed for o2 quenching k o2 p benzoquinone 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 yao et al 2020 as depicted in fig 1d compared with the experimental group without scavenger tba and methanol barely inhibited the tmb oxidation excluding the role of oh and so4 in tmb oxidation however tmb oxidation obviously decreased when adding p benzoquinone and l histidine the quenching effect of l histidine was more remarkable than p benzoquinone results again suggested that negligible amount of oh and so4 existed in the system while o2 and 1o2 were the main active species according to quenching experiments and the related reactions eqs 2 8 and 9 1o2 played a leading role in the system while o2 was a precursor before being oxidated into 1o2 1 photocatalyst hν h e 2 o2 e o2 3 hso5 e so4 oh 4 so4 oh oh so4 2 5 hso5 e oh so4 2 6 hso5 h so5 h 7 so5 so5 2so4 2 1o2 8 o2 oh oh 1o2 9 o2 h 1o2 3 2 photoelectric properties of catalysts to investigate the photoelectric property variations of mil 101 fe before and after cus qds modification a series of photoelectric analyses were performed first the photocatalytic properties of mil 101 fe and csqds mf were measured by uv vis diffraction as reflected in fig 2a csqds mf owned an enhanced visible light absorption capacity than mil 101 fe accordingly the bandgap energy eg values were further estimated through tauc equation text s11 jubu et al 2020 the energy bandgaps of mil 101 fe and csqds mf were 2 36 ev and 1 64 ev respectively moreover to evaluate the flat band potential position mott schottky measurements were employed for n type semiconductor the conduction band potential and flat band potential values are approximately equal in general li et al 2013 as shown in fig 2b the conduction bands of mil 101 fe and csqds mf were 0 886 ev and 0 591 ev versus normal hydrogen electrode nhe respectively correspondingly the valence bands vs nhe were calculated as 1 47 ev for mil 101 fe and 1 05 ev for csqds mf approximately the conduction band of csqds mf is lower than the potential to generate o2 e0 o2 o2 0 33 ev nosaka and nosaka 2017 and the valence band of csqds mf cannot reach the potential of producing oh e0 oh oh 2 68 ev nosaka and nosaka 2017 namely it could generate o2 rather than oh with csqds mf under visible light irradiation which is also supported by the fee radicals scavenging experiments fig 1d a narrower energy bandgap means a stronger electron transfer capacity in photocatalytic process hao et al 2012 to further assess the electrical conductivity of catalysts electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis analysis was conducted csqds mf showed a smaller semicircular radius than mil 101 fe fig 2c demonstrating a lower resistance in electrons transfer and a better separation efficiency of photogenerated charges bian et al 2021 liu et al 2022b light absorption in photocatalyst generally can lead to the formation of electronically excited states that are delocalized as free charge carrier pairs then giving rise to a photocurrent however alternative processes involving the excited electron hole pair have to compete with efficient recombination thus the quantum yields for photoelectrochemical reactions at illuminated semiconductor photocatalysts are usually very small to evaluate the quantum efficiency photocurrent response spectroscopy was measured with a xenon lamp λ 400 nm as depicted in fig 2d the photocurrent intensity of csqds mf significantly enhanced compared with mil 101 fe revealing a stronger separation of excited electron hole pairs which is beneficial to the redox reaction on the surface of photocatalyst 3 3 insight mechanism of enhanced 1o2 generation it has been confirmed that 1o2 was the predominant activate species in the vis pms csqds mf system by above epr tests and quenching experiments to appraise the 1o2 quantum yields φ of the developed photocatalysts methylene blue mb was employed as the standard φ 0 52 by measuring the change of optical density od of a typical 1o2 indicator dpbf figs 3a and text s12 results demonstrated that φ mil 101 fe 0 35 while φ csqds mf 0 63 namely compared with mil 101 fe the 1o2 quantum yields of csqds mf was significantly enhanced which was 1 8 times more efficient in generating 1o2 than mil 101 fe moreover photoluminescence pl spectroscopy was carried out to further verify electron hole separation efficiency and the possibility of generating 1o2 as shown in fig 3b fluorescence intensity of mil 101 fe was obviously higher than csqds mf indicating that there were more excited electron holes recombination in mil 101 fe interestingly the phosphorescence intensity of mil 101 fe was weaker than csqds mf fig 3c theoretically fluorescence and phosphorescence emissions were direct evidences for the existence of singlet states and triplet states respectively zhang et al 2021b the enhanced phosphorescence intensity of csqds mf demonstrated an increased triplet state population the formation of 1o2 in photocatalysis process generally through two pathways one is the electron transfer or the oxidation of o2 the other is the photocatalyst in excited state can transfer energy to the triplet ground state of o2 huang et al 2020 electron transfer occurs in charge carrier involved photocatalysis while energy transfer happens in exciton involved photocatalysis zhang et al 2021a the remarkable phosphorescence signal of csqds mf inferred that considerable amount of triplet states existed which rest in exciton involved photocatalysis process besides energy transfer from singlet states of sensitizers to the ground state of o2 is spin forbidden the generation of 1o2 mainly relies on the energy transfer from triplet states zhang et al 2021b triplet states are usually produced during the vibrational relaxation of singlet states this process is known as intersystem crossing isc in brief a higher singlet exciton concentration facilitates isc processes resulting in an enhanced formation of triplet states generally binding energies which exhibit prominent dependence on size and thickness have great impact on singlet exciton concentrations in semiconductors in other words smaller size or thinner materials tend to own higher singlet excitation concentration zhang et al 2021a hence the ultrathin csqds is an essential prerequisite for promoting to generate higher singlet exciton concentration and enhanced isc processes resulting in producing more triplet states additionally o2 generation in the vis pms csqds mf system implied the existence of charge carrier involved photocatalysis as supported by above results of eis photocurrent response spectroscopy and pl spectroscopy it was pretty definite that electron transfer was boosted by modifying mil 101 fe with csqds then promoted the 1o2 yield in detail oxygen molecules adsorbed on the surface of photocatalyst trapped electrons from conduction band and generated o2 then it should be oxidized by valence band holes to generate 1o2 eqs 1 2 and 9 significantly the participation of pms eqs 3 8 was also a nonnegligible pathway to generate 1o2 in vis pms csqds mf system pms served as competitors to react with photogenerated electrons and holes so as to enhance the electron hole pairs separation and benefited the charge carrier involved photocatalysis process nevertheless the contribution of electron transfer and energy transfer to generate 1o2 remains unrevealed sorbic acid sa is highly selective for triplet states because it only accepts the energy transferring from the triplet state matters rather than the excited ones grebel et al 2011 therefore quenching experiments with sa for triplet state quenching and p benzoquinone for o2 quenching were carried out as described in fig 3d both of the addition of sa and p benzoquinone could inhibit the oxidation of tmb to a certain degree thereinto p benzoquinone had a slightly stronger inhibitory effect than sa demonstrating the contribution of electron transfer process was higher than energy transfer process on balance compared with mil 101 fe the enhanced 1o2 yields of csqds mf was owing to the stronger electron transfer for o2 oxidation and the higher population of the triplet states 3 4 disinfection performance of vis pms csqds mf system now that 1o2 has been identified to be the predominant active species in vis pms csqds mf system a sequence of bacterial inactivation experiments choosing e coli as model bacteria were further executed to investigate the disinfection performance firstly safety of photocatalysts was confirmed by control test with mixing e coli and csqds mf in the dark fig s3a then the visible light was also verified to be uninjurious as shown in fig 4a compared with vis csqds mf vis pms and csqds mf pms systems the vis pms csqds mf system exhibited the best disinfection performance disinfecting 7 5 log e coli cells in 60 min then followed by csqds mf pms system which can lead to 5 2 log inactivation and vis pms system for 4 1 log vis csqds mf for 1 1 log these consequences emphasized the existence of pms could remarkably improve bacterial inactivation efficiency however the bacterial inactivation performance of vis pms csqds fig s3i was similar to the vis pms indicating that pure csqds cannot make full use of visible light under the given concentration the disinfection effect mainly depended on pms moreover the active species amounts 1o2 output of each group were monitored with tmb measurements fig s5a as demonstrated in figs 4a and s5 the bacterial inactivation efficiency of vis pms csqds mf vis csqds mf and vis pms csqds mf systems were corresponding to the tmb oxidation intensity which demonstrating the differences of activated molecular oxygen not surprisingly the activate species amount of vis pms csqds mf system was the highest as a result of 1o2 yield enhancement in contrast the pms csqds mf group generated less 1o2 emphasizing the indispensable of visible light input in the process of pms activation interestingly the tmb oxidation intensity of vis pms could not support its disinfection efficiency in can be inferred that a very small amount of 1o2 generated in vis pms system according to the result of tmb experiment which might due to the low concentration of pms it can be assumed that the disinfection effect should come from the pms which is of germicidal efficacy lópez vinent et al 2022 to thoroughly figure out the bacterial inactivation process of vis pms csqds mf system disinfection experiments were conducted by varying influence factors including pms concentration fig s3b e coli concentration fig s3c and photocatalyst dosage fig s3d and fitted by chick watson model text s13 it can be summed from the results that both of increasing the pms concentration and photocatalyst dosage could enhance the disinfection efficiency which can be ascribed more activate species production besides the lower bacterial initial concentrations led to higher inactivation efficiencies because less e coli cells could take more chances to contact with active species to discern the influence capacity of each factor inactivation fitting parameters were calculated with chick watson model and detail values were listed in table s1 as shown in fig 4b the change rule of k values was consistent with disinfection efficiency among these factors the initial e coli concentration impacted the rate constant most significantly to explore the application potential in practice water it is important to understand the law of bactericidal efficiency under different ph values and dissolve oxygen do to rule out the effect of ph and do on bacterial survival control experiments were employed as shown in figs s3e and s3f respectively e coli cells remained a stable activity in a ph range from 3 to 9 and stayed active under anaerobic and oxygen rich condition as illustrated in fig 4c the disinfection efficiency significantly improved under acidic aqueous which might be because the negative charged cell wall surface consists of various proteins qiao et al 2012 protons in acidic solution could neutralize negative charges on bacterial surface then reducing electrostatic repulsion between the bacteria cell membrane and hso5 hence accelerating disinfection efficiency jiang et al 2022 besides the alkaline condition promoted the efficiency as well alkaline conditions induce nucleophilic attack of so5 2 to the peroxide oxygen of hso5 leading to the pms self decay and 1o2 formation lee et al 2020 do is of vital importance in this disinfection process because o2 is fundamental for 1o2 generation as depicted in fig 4d higher do concentration fig s3h led to better disinfection performance of the system implying more 1o2 was generated in o2 saturated solution which also was supported by the sosg results fig s3g in all the developed vis pms csqds mf system is of good ph and do adaptability 3 5 stability and reusability of the vis pms csqds mf system from a practical point of view the stability and reusability arouse wide attention in terms of cost effectiveness and environmental concern of photocatalyst to further estimate the practicability of vis pms csqds mf system five repeated regenerations of csqds mf was conducted via simple water washing and oven drying as shown in fig 4e even the photocatalyst has been used for five cylces the disinfection efficiency maintains the same as the first use confirming that csqds mf exhibited excellent reusability to gain an insight into the stability of csqds mf the chemical compositions of csqds mf and bonding states of the elements were investigated by xps characterization as displayed in xps survey spectra fig 4f the presence of c o and fe elements in csqds mf was revealed the super weak peak of s element and the missing spectrum of cu should be due to the extreme low content of cus qds the variations of elements chemical states were also analyzed figs s4 and text s14 generally the xps spectrum of cycle used csqds mf was well matched with the fresh one confirming an excellent photocatalytic stability furthermore metal ions leaching and bacterial survivals in metal ions solutions were evaluated fig s6a depicts that after sixty minute reaction only 33 8 μg l fe3 and 3 4 μg l cu2 leached in the aqueous which also supports the stability of photocatalyst bacterial activities were investigated at different fe3 and cu2 concentrations figs s6b s6d reveal that fe3 and cu2 leached in the vis pms csqds mf system were harmless to e coli cells reactive species were the main cause of bacterial inactivation 3 6 bacterial inactivation mechanisms membrane integrity is fundamental to bacterial activity and metabolism ros in aqueous solution usually attack the cell membranes first to induce a series of cell stress reaction and finally result in bacterial inactivation he et al 2021 the membrane integrity variations of e coli during the photocatalysis process were explored by using laser confocal scanning microscopy lcsm flow cytometry fcm for and sem for qualitative and quantitative analysis lcsm results fig 5b illustrated that the proportion of intact membrane green fluorescence emission was gradually decreased with photocatalysis progress establishing that 1o2 acted on the cell membranes and caused membrane damages as expected the results of fcm analysis fig 5a were in accordance with lcsm results it is worth noting that compared with the above results of plate count the proportion of damaged membrane was slightly lower than the one of inactivated bacteria it can be explained that a small number of bacterial cells were under a viable but nonculturable vbnc state during the treatment process fida et al 2017 which might be potential microbial hazards in water however with the passage of reaction ros produced in the system increased fig s7 and finally eliminated vbnc cells results of fcm and plate count were consistent at the end of treatment moreover morphology changes of e coli cells were recorded by sem analysis fig 5c which graphically portrayed the membrane tattering and distorting process the untreated cell possessed intact plump and smooth membrane at the beginning whereas during the inactivation big holes pits and wrinkles on membrane came into being the formation of membrane defects and holes could facilitate 1o2 entrance into cytoplasm and boost bactericidal progress after 60 min treatment bacterial membranes were fully out of shape indicating an irreversible cell death to better understand the inactivation process bacterial responses against oxidative stress posed by the vis pms csqds mf system were investigated by intracellular ros analysis generally the stable level of intracellular ros reflects a good activity of bacterial cell as shown in fig 5d the rank order of intercellular ros levels was in keeping with the disinfection performance followed as vis pms csqds mf pms csqds mf vis pms vis csqds mf and vis environmental 1o2 concentrations in different systems were monitored by sosg probe as well fig s8 except the vis pms system the rank orders of intracellular ros levels and 1o2 concentrations were consistent the high intracellular ros levels in vis pms system might be attributed to strong oxidative and bactericidal properties of pms as discussed above for bacterial cells intracellular ros such as h2o2 oh and o2 were inevitable by products during aerobic metabolism park et al 2011 accordingly catalase and superoxide dismutase are available in bacteria to keep redox balance in vivo beaman et al 1985 but corresponding enzyme for resisting oxidative stress from 1o2 is of absence in vis pms csqds mf system it can be concluded that a mass of 1o2 generated in the aqueous and attacked the bacterial cells the accumulation of intracellular ros gradually exceeded the threshold of bacterial cells to self regulate eventually triggering oxidative stress which can damage cellular sites such as protein cysteine iron sulfur clusters cell membrane and even dna jiang et al 2022 furthermore dna gel electrophoresis was employed to investigate changes of dna integrity as depicted in fig 5e two distinct dna bands of untreated e coli cells were observed at about 3000 bp and greater than 5000 bp with the progress of treatment dna strand broke into small pieces and the band at 1500 bp arose ultimately the two initial bands vanished and a shallow band around 1500 bp left manifesting a thorough dna cleavages resulting in irreversible bacterial death on account of above consequences a hypothetic disinfection mechanism in vis pms csqds mf system was proposed promoted electron transfer enhanced energy transfer and the existence of pms for stronger charge carrier pairs separation facilitated the 1o2 generation the 1o2 formed in the aqueous solution attacked the cell membranes first made the bacterial cell out of shape caused abundant membrane damages such as holes and pits to enable 1o2 get into the cytoplasm environmental ever rising 1o2 concentration initiated oxidative stress then bacterial intracellular ros level up regulated at the end the dna strand broke into pieces under the destroy from self intracellular ros and extraneous 1o2 3 7 disinfection applicability in practical wastewater the disinfection performance to gram positive bacterium remains unknown since e coli is a typical gram negative bacterium b subtilis a representative of gram positive bacteria was chosen as a target pathogen the results fig 6a showed more time was needed for vis pms csqds mf system to inactivate b subtilis than e coli only 5 2 log b subtilis cells were inactivated within 120 min the reason might lie in the different thickness of cell walls a thicker peptidoglycan layer 20 40 nm of gram positive bacterium consumes more ros than that of gram negative bacterium 10 nm kim et al 2015b even so the consequences still supported that the developed vis pms csqds mf system can disinfect both of gram negative and gram positive bacteria furthermore to evaluate the disinfection efficiency of vis pms csqds mf for actual wastewater inactivation performance of fecal coliforms in secondary effluent from a hospital wastewater was studied as illustrated in fig 6b it took 120 min to reach 4 8 log cfu l fecal coliforms when pms concentration was 50 μm practical wastewater contains a lot of inorganic ions and dissolve organic matters which consume oxidant and compete with pathogens for 1o2 weakening the bactericidal efficiency subsequently with the increase of pms concentration disinfection time became shorter it required 60 min for thorough disinfection of 4 8 log cfu l fecal coliforms by adding 150 μm pms overall the developed vis pms csqds mf system is applicable for practical wastewater disinfection 4 conclusion in this work a 1o2 predominated vis pms csqds mf water disinfection system was developed cus qds modified mil 101 fe exhibited a better photocatalytic efficiency by promoting the visible light absorption accelerating electron transfer ability and enhancing charge carrier separation efficiency a great part of 1o2 in the system was produced from the enhanced electron transfer process and the rest was generated by energy transfer process with reinforced intersystem crossing it took 60 min to inactivate 7 5 log e coli by the vis pms csqds mf system besides the system kept good bactericidal performance in the condition of ph ranging from 3 to 9 and different do concentrations what s more the csqds mf could maintain good performance and stable structure after five cycles 1o2 attacked the bacterial cell membranes first led to abundant membrane damages to enable 1o2 get into the cytoplasm up regulated intracellular ros level and broke dna strand at the end the developed system showed good disinfection effect on both gram positive b subtilis and fecal coliforms in practical wastewater indicating the vis pms csqds mf system is a promising alternative disinfection technology for actual wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may

15258,polyethylene pe pipes are often the material of choice for water supply systems thanks to their favorable properties such as high strength density ratio and corrosion resistance however previous studies have shown that organic compounds can migrate from pe pipes to the water this study aimed to identify potential organic compounds migrating from high density pe hdpe pipes used to distribute drinking water in denmark based on laboratory experiments and sampling in the distribution system using a two tiered study design in the first tier migration of volatile and semi volatile organic compounds vocs and semi vocs from hdpe pipes were investigated over one three and nine days in laboratory experiments performed according to modified standards for migration testing en 12 873 1 the analytical workflow consisted of solid phase extraction spe for 10 000 times enrichment and gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analysis from the water phase after migration a total of 133 compounds originating from the pe pipes were detected thirty one compounds were detected by suspect screening ss while the remaining 102 compounds were detected by non target screening nts analysis among the detected compounds were also hindered amine stabilizers hals flame retardant and plasticizer tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate in the second tier drinking water from a water distribution system in copenhagen denmark with a newly installed hdpe pipe was sampled and analyzed with gc ms and liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lchrms a total of 51 compounds were detected in the water 12 of which were assigned to migration from hdpe surprisingly hdpe antioxidants and their degradation products contributed only a relatively small percentage of the total measured compound intensities in the drinking water distribution system instead a larger proportion of the compounds detected were assigned to rubber seals used upstream in the water system from the abstraction site to delivery at the consumer tap seals are considered trifle in the larger picture of materials in contact with drinking water however these results may cause a reconsideration of this position graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hdpe pipes migration gc ms water contaminants non targeted analysis freshwater analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction traditional drinking water treatment in denmark consists of groundwater abstraction into the waterworks where the water is aerated and filtrated before it is stored in water tanks winther et al 2010 further treatment with disinfection e g by chlorination or uv is not commonly used in denmark a large part of the utility system consists of a piping network currently most newly laid and replaced pipes are made of polyethylene pe which offers many advantageous chemical and mechanical properties facilitating their widespread application as a cost effective solution for private and industrial water supply systems pe pipes are made from pe resin generally with added colorants antioxidants stabilizers fillers and other ingredients essential to achieve the desired properties that strengthen and protect the pipes during fabrication and service whelton and nguyen 2013 previous analysis of water distributed through pe pipes revealed migration of phenolic additives and antioxidant degradation products from the material anselme et al 1985 subsequently phenol ketone and quinone compounds resulting from antioxidant additive degradation became subjects of monitoring organic contaminants leaching from pe piping material into drinking water in the distribution system danish environmental protection agency 2012 these sterically hindered phenolic and phosphite antioxidants are large molecules with high hydrophobicity and low water miscibility limiting their migration into water dopico garcı a et al 2003 however degradation products of the antioxidants are found to leach from the piping material brocca et al 2002 skjevrak et al 2003 the release of unwanted organic compounds from materials in contact with drinking water can affect the quality of the water impact odor and taste cause microbial growth or worst case be toxic stern and lagos 2008 therefore the european commission has adopted a regulation on the hygienic requirements for materials in contact with drinking water in the new drinking water directive council directive 2020 2184 however the composition and manufacturing process of plastic pipes used for drinking water remains a trade secret thus only targeted analysis on a subset of compounds provided by the manufacturer is disclosed to the utilities evaluating the possible impact on water quality most pe pipes used by european drinking water utilities are certified according to different certification schemes e g kiwa kq 561 dwgv and dk vand the certification schemes evaluate the pipes according to manufacture formulation and quantify a list of known compounds associated with plastics however studies have shown that these targeted compounds only comprise 2 of the total organic migration from pe pipes denberg 2009 regarding the entire water distribution system from source to the tap also other parts than pe pipes could contribute to migration such as the used rubber seals european commissionpean 2017 a way to increase our knowledge of compound migration from pe and the entire distribution system is to perform a suspect screening analysis task et al 2013 this approach explores data from samples measured by mass spectrometry ms for specific fragmentation patterns of compounds contained in a suspect screening library hollender et al 2017 further analysis of the same data can be in the form of non target screening nts analysis aiming to detect and identify compounds in measured samples unlike suspect screening nts uses no constrained suspect list thus providing a broader screening approach gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms is a well established technique used for the analysis of volatile semi volatile and thermostable compounds migrating from plastic pipes brocca et al 2002 including antioxidant degradation products lützhøft et al 2013 while liquid chromatography high resolution ms lchrms can support the analysis by gaining additional information on non volatile water soluble compounds hollender et al 2017 this study was set up as a two tiered study design the aim of the first tier was to build a suspect screening list containing previously reported compounds migrating from pe pipes and additional compounds tentatively identified in an accelerated migration study of high density pe hdpe pipes the aim of the second tier was to screen for known hdpe migrating compounds in a danish drinking water distribution system as well as other unknowns by gc ms and lchrms by that a conclusion about source related contaminants in the water distribution system could be reached 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards and reagents water was prepared using a millipore milliq plus system hellerup denmark methanol lc ms grade was obtained from sigma aldrich broendby denmark twelve analytical standards of antioxidants and antioxidant degradation products were obtained from sigma aldrich broendby denmark namely 4 tert butylphenol 99 2 6 di tert butyl p benzoquinone 98 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl alcohol 97 5 methyl 2 hexanone 99 2 4 tert butylphenol 99 3 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl methylpropanoate 99 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxyacetophenone 97 3 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propioic acid 99 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 97 4 ethylphenol 99 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxystyrene 95 4 methyl 2 6 di tert butyl phenol 99 2 2 tier 1 laboratory migration study 2 2 1 samples hdpe pipes six hdpe pipes commonly used in danish water distribution systems were investigated the pipes were retrieved as new from the stock of a danish utility thus representing pipes that have already been installed in the distribution system all the tested pipes originated from the same manufacturer but had varying dimensions and strengths see figure s1 for details all the pipes investigated obtained european certification for contact with drinking water i e the kiwa watermark and dk vand approval 2 2 2 samples rubber seals five rubber seals from different valves commonly used in the water distribution system consisting of epdm and nbr rubber were investigated see figure s5 for details 2 2 3 migration study the laboratory migration study was designed based on the european method standard for testing the influence of materials on water intended for human consumption en 12873 1 2014 the pretreatment steps of flushing stagnation flushing and rinsing were followed according to the method standard for both hdpe pipes and the rubber seals water from the 24 hour stagnation in the pretreatment step was sampled for analysis 1 day sample hereafter the method was modified to accelerate compound migration from both the hdpe pipes and rubber seals hdpe pipes no 2 3 5 and 6 were de coated and shredded into threads using a jigsaw to accelerate migration by increasing the surface area to volume ratio similarly all the rubber seals were shredded the shredded hdpe and rubber seals were placed in 1 l glass bottles and filled with fresh milli q water the glass bottles used for the experiments were acid washed 1 hno₃ and burned 550 c for 4 h pipe no 1 and 4 were kept whole and plug sealed using burned 550 c for 4 h solid brass rod stoppers two migration periods were conducted after the pretreatment period 1 for 72 1 hours 3 days followed by period 2 for 216 1 hours 9 days period 2 for rubber seals lasted 168 1 hours 7 days milli q water 18 2 mω 5 ppm toc was used during pretreatment stagnation and migration periods with experimental temperatures of 23 c and 37 c respectively the higher migration temperature was used to accelerate the migration at the end of the contact time water was transferred to acid washed and burned 1 l blue cap bottles sealed with teflon coated plastic screw caps water was fully replaced between stagnation and migration periods the water samples 1 day 24 h 3 7 9 days from the migration experiments were stored at 5 c in the 1 l bottles and subjected to spe within 2 days after the migration experiments extracts were then stored at 20 c until gc ms analysis method blank samples were prepared using empty acid washed and burned glass bottles and the same milli q water as used in the migration experiments going through all the same processes without contact with the two sampled materials 2 3 tier 2 field study analysis of drinking water from distributional network to investigate migration from in use distribution systems drinking water from a site with newly renovated pipes was analyzed replacement of the pipes was carried out by a water utility company using certified pipes the site was renovated with a 90 mm pipe with a wall thickness of 16 4 mm giving an internal diameter of 73 6 mm the total length of the pipe installed was 320 m the inlet water originates from two different waterworks water coming from waterwork 1 would have been in contact with 6 028 m of pe pipes while water arriving from waterwork 2 would have been in contact with 26 296 m of pe pipes before reaching the sampling point in this study it was impossible to distinguish the amount of water originating from each waterwork detailed information can be found in supplementary information 1 2 4 solid phase extraction spe waters oasis hlb cartridges 6 cm3 500 mg 60 μm were conditioned using 10 ml methanol and equilibrated with 10 ml milli q water one liter of the water sample was loaded to the cartridge at a rate of 20 ml min 1 after loading the cartridge was washed with 10 ml milli q water the cartridge was then dried by sucking through air for 1 min before blowing with nitrogen to remove any water droplets the glass bottles that had been used for storing the water samples were rinsed with 10 ml methanol to extract any analytes that had adhered to the glass and the methanol was then used to elute the trapped analytes from the spe cartridge at 2 ml min 1 a further 10 ml methanol was used to ensure full elution of the analytes from the cartridge the volume of the combined methanolic extract was then up concentrated by decreasing the volume of methanol to 100 µl with a nitrogen flow the overall enrichment factor was 10 000 very polar acidic or basic compounds might have low recovery on the used hlb method alternatively multi layer spe has been used in literature tisler et al 2021 to increase the recovery of these polar compounds 2 5 gc ms analysis an agilent 7890a gc coupled to agilent 5973c ms using electron ionization at 70 ev was used to analyze all the sample extracts injection of 1 µl extract was made into the inlet in splitless mode at 300 c the gc was equipped with a zebron zb 5 capillary column 60 m 0 25 mm i d 0 25 μm film thickness initially the oven temperature was 45 c for 1 min then increased at 10 c min 1 to 330 c which was then held for 15 min giving a total run time of 45 min per sample helium was used as carrier gas with a flow rate of 2 ml min 1 the ms was operated in scan mode 10 600 m z the transfer line ion source and quadrupole temperatures were 330 230 and 150 c respectively to ensure the detection of lower levels and higher confidence in identification level 1 12 compounds were analyzed using gc ms with selected ion monitoring sim each compound was monitored using three sim ions and retention time the sim method contained five retention time groups with 9 ions each table 2s the dwell time for each ion was 25 ms with 3 96 scans s 1 2 6 lchrms analysis lchrms analysis was performed on an acquity uplc interfaced to a g2 si synapt quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer qtofms with electrospray ionization esi waters milford ma in the m z range 50 to 1000 m z an acquity beh c18 column 2 1 100 mm 1 7 µm pore size waters taastrup denmark was used with a flow rate of 0 3 ml min 1 the gradient program was increasing from initial conditions of 90 eluent a milliq h2o 0 1 fa to 99 b acetonitrile 0 1 fa over 16 min these conditions were kept for 5 min before switching back to the starting conditions 3 min equilibration time which corresponds to 11 column volumes to give a total run time of 24 min per sample the autosampler was kept at 15 c and the injection volume was 2 µl for all samples the ms was set up as follows 3000 v capillary voltage 120 c source temperature 500 c desolvation temperature cone gas flow l hr 100 desolvation gas flow l hr 1000 nebulizer gas 6 5 bar the samples were run in mse continuum mode scan time 0 35 s ramp trap collision 10 to 40 v 2 7 data analysis workflow for suspect screening and nts 2 7 1 tier 1 suspect screening for migration study with gc ms in tier 1 a suspect screening list was created based on a collection of previously reported compounds migrating from pe pipes materials with all pe densities were considered including the ones found in cross bonded polyethylene pex the literature search revealed 172 compounds reported for pe material mass spectral data was available for 154 of these compounds which were included in the suspect screening list table s1 suspect library pe together with retention index ri information if available the actual suspect screening was done using automated mass spectral deconvolution identification system amdis 2 73 nist ei mass spectra and median of reported ri if available were used in the amdis target list mallard 2014 deconvolution settings were optimized according to mastrangelo et al 2015 the search was done by matching amdis deconvoluted mass spectra to the spectra and ri of suspect compounds in the amdis target list stein 1999 mallard 2014 a full list of settings used for the amdis analysis can be found in figure s2 2 7 2 tier 1 nts of migration study with gc ms the software paradise version 3 9 www models life ku dk gcparadise for resolving nts gc ms data was used for nts data analysis johnsen et al 2017 the software settings for building the parafac2 model were non negativity constraints 2000 iterations for manually set intervals targeting individual eluting peaks with 1 to 9 components for an interval the models and the optimal number of components were evaluated based on individual elution profiles amdis was also used for nts analysis by means of exhaustive manual peak picking performed after deconvolution in all samples the deconvoluted spectra of components representing compounds were saved in a project specific ms library and afterward used for amdis searching deconvolution settings for nts analysis were match factor mf 80 and 7 ri unit window amdis results from suspect screening and nts analysis were exported to matlab 9 3 0 r2017b mathwork inc usa gui gavin3 0 96 behrends et al 2011 to visualize amdis results and integrate areas under the single ion peaks the aim of using parafac2 and amdis for gc ms nts was to obtain more pure mass spectra for identification leading to a less biased nist search compound identification was performed by matching deconvoluted mass spectra to nist epa nih mass spectral library 2017 and the corresponding ri data linear retention indexes ri were calculated from n alkanes c8 to c37 by liquid injection of 1 μl of an in house reference mineral oil sample dissolved in hplc grade dichloromethane with a total concentration of 2 5 g l calculation of ri was performed in amdis the reported identification levels id were inspired by guidelines in the metabolomics standards initiative sumner et al 2007 and are given according to the following scheme level 1 id indicates the compound has been confirmed using a commercial standard level 2 id corresponds to putatively annotated compounds resulting from a library match with 2 ri and 800 nist mf level 3 id corresponds to a putatively annotated library match with 2 ri or 800 nist mf compounds assigned to level 4 have 5 ri deviation or 700 mf and are considered unknowns the flow diagram for the combined suspect screening and nts in the migration study is shown in fig 1 the new compounds detected by nts were combined with the original literature based suspect screening list the extended suspect screening list consisted of 274 pe relevant compounds 172 suspects from the literature based suspect screening list table s1 and 102 additional nts compounds table s2 detected in the migration study 2 7 3 tier 2 suspect screening and nts for field study with gc ms and lc hrms the extended suspect screening list of 274 pe relevant compounds was applied to the samples analyzed with gc ms from the field study in addition nts was also applied for the field study with the same parameters described above to further elucidate on compounds present in the drinking water and to help with the source assignment lchrms suspect screening was conducted the suspect compounds were based on the norman suspect lists echaplastic 241 compounds and kwr drinking water suspect list 158 compounds the unifi software waters corporation was used for the suspect screening with lchrms conducted with the same workflow as tisler and christensen 2022 confidence level 1 was assigned for compounds confirmed with analytical standard and confidence level 2 for matching fragments with reference spectra and retention time prediction within a 2 min range confidence level 3 was assigned for matching the compound s retention time prediction and plausibility but missing fragment spectra for comparison identification levels followed the scheme proposed by schymanski et al 2014 the workflow for suspect screening and nts of samples from the field study is shown in figure s3 it consists of gc ms suspect screening of pe related compounds and nts as well as lchrms suspect screening of pe and rubber compounds 2 7 4 statistical analysis principal component analysis pca was used to explore the relationship between the samples and detected compounds it was performed on the log transformed and pareto scaled intensity peak table van den berg et al 2006 for combined datasets from suspect screening and nts interpretation of scores and loadings was aided by jackknife confidence intervals obtained by seven fold cross validation the venn diagram and box plot were created in r rstudio team 2019 using the package venndiagram chen and boutros 2011 2 7 5 quality assurance each sample of tier 1 and 2 was enriched by spe in triplicates a compound was only considered if it was detected in all triplicates for removal of laboratory contaminants originating from the sample preparation and the analytical system peak intensities of all detected compounds in the migration and field study were compared individually at each time point from method blank samples peaks of interest were those with a 10 times larger area in the samples than the blanks as assessed by a t test p 0 05 in the in use renovated pipe analysis the cutoff values used to select peaks of interest were set to p 0 1 and greater than 2x larger average peak areas in samples compared to the corresponding method blanks this was done for each replicate of the enriched triplicates individually 3 results and discussion 3 1 tier 1 suspect screening and nts of the migration study 3 1 1 visual inspection of gc ms data the gc ms total ion chromatograms tic of the analyzed water samples are shown in fig 2 a c for the three migration periods of 1 3 and 9 days the largest peaks are annotated in the caption below the figure inserts in the chromatograms represent zoom in on tic areas illustrating the presence of low intensity compounds in the tic fig 2d shows a method blank sample containing compounds originating from sample processing the time series showed a visible increase in the intensity of 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dione peak 5 an antioxidant degradation product of irganox 1076 fischer et al 1999 and 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxycinnamic acid peak 18 an antioxidant as well as several unknown compounds peaks 13 15 17 these compounds result from primary and secondary antioxidant additives like irganox 1010 1076 1330 and irgafos 168 protecting the pe against uv light and thermo oxidative degradation tolinski 2015 the parent molecules are sterically hindered phenolic and phosphite antioxidants which are large molecules with high hydrophobicity and low water miscibility limiting their migration into water dopico garcı a et al 2003 however degradation products of the antioxidants are commonly found to leach from the piping material skjevrak et al 2003 3 1 2 tier 1 nts analysis of gc ms data the nts analysis using amdis and parafac2 for peak detection and peak deconvolution resulted in the detection of 102 compounds including the 22 compounds detected by visual inspection of the gc ms tic in fig 2 of the detected compounds 40 were assigned id level 2 and 17 compounds id level 3 table s2 based on previous studies carrero carralero et al 2019 we assume that the relatively large number of compounds detected explicitly in hdpe was related to the high sample enrichment factor and employment of peak detection and deconvolution methods previous degradation studies have demonstrated the presence of more than 200 compounds during thermal and photo oxidized degradation of pe hakkarainen and albertsson 2004 the compounds reported in that study were mainly alkanes aldehydes ketones alcohols furans carboxylic and dicarboxylic acids with different chain lengths and only 16 of the reported compounds corresponded to those detected by nts in the current migration study apart from the different sample treatments this can also indicate the possible presence of different additives resulting in the district compounds observed in this study approximately 25 of the detected compounds are oxygenated phenolic species likely related to commonly used phenolic antioxidants it has been previously demonstrated that the added antioxidants can decompose into many products löschner et al 2011 beißmann et al 2013 which can further degrade ryssel et al 2015 however distinct groups of compounds in the migration study contained heteroatoms these have not previously been reported in pe pipes tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcpe is an organophosphate used as a plasticizer viscosity regulator and flame retardant in many types of polymers regnery and püttmann 2010 an additional detected compound was 1 dodecanethiol which has industrial usage related to pe production as a plasticizer and lubricant dionisio et al 2018 n n dibutylformamide detected is used as a lubrication oil and an additive for increasing thermal stability during manufacture and overall plastic lifespan the n n dibutylformamide and dodecanamide may be related to the use of n n bis 2 hydroxyethyl dodecanamide as antistatic agent which is permitted with a composition of up to 1 w w in hdpe efsa 2010 the compound 4 methyl 1h benzotriazole was observed in trace amounts it is widely used as a corrosion inhibitor while 2 2 4 trimethyl 1 3 pentanediol diisobutyrate txib was also detected and has application as a viscosity regulator and plasticizer furthermore a study of migration trends employing principal component analysis pca on the detected signal intensities was performed see supplementary information 2 and figure s4 3 1 3 suspect screening of gc ms data the samples from the migration study were screened for 154 compounds previously detected in pe materials resulting in the detection and identification of 31 substances based on the proposed id scheme see table s2 among the detected compounds 9 were from the list of 12 relevant target compounds included in routine analysis of danish drinking water danish environmental protection agency 2012 on average hdpe samples from the second migration period 3 days at 37 c had the largest number of detected suspects see table s2 for occurrence in the respective pipes and days as shown in fig 3 suspects detected in the third migration period 9 days at 37 c had the highest median peak intensities for compounds of the four classes aldehyde ketone carboxylic acid ester and phenol alcohol figure s4 the ester group is dominated by 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dione the most abundant compound detected the antioxidant derivative 2 6 di tert butylbenzoquinone bht q was detected for all migration periods see table s2 additional compounds found only in the first two migration periods were pent 3 en 2 one acetophenone used as a solvent for pe resin and decanal nonanal and cyclopentanone byproducts of pe manufacture skjevrak et al 2005 auto oxidation of the polymeric chain can occur during the manufacture and usage of pe pipes leading to the production of low mw ketones aldehydes alcohols and carboxylic acids andersson and wesslén 2005 carboxylic acids are the most stable oxygenated pe degradation products and accumulate during prolonged degradation hakkarainen and albertsson 2004 in general the suspects could explain 69 of the nts compound intensities after 1 day migration but only 42 after 3 and 9 days migration 3 2 tier 2 field study analysis of drinking water from distributional network table 1 shows field study results of combined gc ms and lchrms suspect screening and gc ms nts of water samples from the drinking water distribution network of copenhagen denmark detection and identification of 12 compounds that originates from pe and rubber included in the routine analysis of danish drinking water were ensured by using gc ms with selected ion monitoring fifty one compounds were detected at the two locations in triplicates before and after the newly renovated 320 m pipe section of these compounds 17 were identified at level 1 13 at level 2 19 at level 3 and 2 at level 4 in nts the only antioxidant degradation product detected was 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dione with gc ms sim the targeted antioxidants 2 4 di tert butylphenol and 2 6 di tert butyl p benzoquinone 2 6 di tert butyl 4 vinylphenol 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxyphenylpropionic acid together with 4 tert butylphenol and 5 methyl 2 hexanone were found in the majority of the samples but only two times higher than the method blanks compounds may be introduced during sample preparation and work up in contrast with the measurements from the migration study where the antioxidants and their degradation products were observed with the highest chromatographic peak intensities a total of nine out of the 42 compounds detected in at least one field sample were from the extended gc ms suspect list of compounds migrating from pe pipes thus a large proportion of the compounds detected by gc ms could not be assigned to pe pipes most of the remaining compounds could be related to rubber origin forrest 2006 five rubber seals used in danish water utilities were investigated by gc ms nts analysis figure s5 the nts compounds detected in the migration study of these five rubber seals were searched for in the gc ms data from the field study surprisingly out of 42 compounds detected in the field study 22 could also be found migrating from the rubber seals table 1 this finding is contrary to expectations that the most intense contaminants would leach from the pe piping material due to the higher surface area in contact with the water thus the source of migrating compounds was proposed based on their presence in the migration studies of pe and the rubber seal shown in table 1 the signal intensities of the detected compounds in the field study are in fig 4 and are shown as fold changes compared to the method blank the highest values that is the highest differences between samples and method blanks were found for compounds with proposed rubber origin in addition as indicated by color coding fig 4 shows that a large part of the compounds detected in the field study is assigned to have rubber origin the largest fold change values were observed for cyanoethyl ether and cyclohexyl isocyanate out of the five tested rubber seals the highest intensities of the two compounds were observed in the two pipe repair couplings figure s5 previous research focusing on nts analysis of micropollutants in urban freshwater sediments in danish water channels also detected the presence of cyclohexyl isocyanate lübeck et al 2020 in addition the compound was found to migrate from recycled rubber like rubber carpet padding phillips et al 2018 and together with cyanoethyl ether in recycled car rubber material benson et al 2019 the majority of rubber seals and membranes in waterworks and water distribution systems are made from ethylene propylene rubber epdm with minor use of nitrile rubber compound nbr danish environmental protection agency 2012 n cyclohexyl 2 benzothiazole sulphenamide cbs accelerator in epdm manufacturing allahbakhsh and mazinani 2015 could be assigned to sulfur based vulcanization of epdm rubber it has previously been shown that cbs accelerators leach benzothiazole cyclohexyl isocyanate and benzothiazolone forrest 2006 which were also detected in our field study these findings increase the plausibility of our observations that many of the detected compounds in the drinking water originate from rubber containing products used during abstraction in waterworks and or distribution systems similar results were observed for the compounds detected by lchrms eight of the twelve compounds were benzothiazoles and amines assigned to rubber related compounds previous studies have detected these compounds in car tire related samples seiwert et al 2020 benzothiazoles are commonly used as vulcanization accelerators in rubber production and 1 3 diphenylguanidine is used in rubber as a secondary vulcanization accelerator dicyclohexylurea is known as a byproduct of surface grating of polymers national toxicology program 2019 even caprolactam a monomer for synthetic fiber was detected in rubber tire products before seiwert et al 2020 benzotriazole detected with gc and lc is widely used as an anticorrosive stabilizing agent and lubricant and could also originate from the ultraviolet stabilizer additive degradation uv 328 or tinuvin p bartsch et al 2019 the methylated analog was observed at trace levels in the migration study comparing samples before and after the new stretch of piping the samples were flowing through more than 6 km of piping material and sampled before and after the newly renovated 320 m pipe section with comparable residence time in both sections see supplementary information 1 it can be concluded from the target ss and nts results that the 320 m stretch of new pipe was not significantly increasing the peak intensity of the detected compounds chemical and bio transformation processes and not capturing the same water package before and after the pipe stretch could account for the intensity fluctuation however it could also show that the contamination in the distribution system is influenced by more dominant materials than the stretch of the new pe pipe 4 conclusion a migration study was performed for six hdpe pipes used to distribute drinking water water samples from the hdpe pipe migration study were subjected to spe gc ms analysis results from the analysis were evaluated in suspect screening and nts approach a suspect screening library was built by compiling 157 previously reported compounds utilizing deconvolution and identification software amdis led to the detection of 31 suspected compounds the suspect screening method facilitated relatively fast detection of compounds reported to migrate from pe pipes nts employing deconvolution by paradise and amdis led to the detection of 102 compounds with 57 compounds detected previously not reported migrating from hdpe pipes an analysis of water from a drinking water distribution system was performed which led to the detection of 51 migrating compounds based on the migration study 11 compounds were assigned to originate from pe piping materials 16 were assigned to exclusive rubber origin and 11 were found to migrate from both investigated materials the rest of the compounds remained unassigned compared to other detected compounds in the drinking water additives antioxidants and other pe born vocs and semi vocs were found to be only minor contributors to drinking water contamination similarly investigation of compound migration into the drinking water at the inlet and outlet of the 320 meter hdpe pipe could not be assigned to migrate from the new hdpe piping stretch additional compounds found in the drinking water with higher intensities contained nitrogen and sulfur including cyanoethyl ether cyclohexyl isocyanate and several benzothiazole class compounds the detected compounds were also found in rubber seals used in the water distribution system rubber seals are considered trifle in the larger picture of materials used in contact with drinking water and these results may cause a reconsideration of this position

15258,polyethylene pe pipes are often the material of choice for water supply systems thanks to their favorable properties such as high strength density ratio and corrosion resistance however previous studies have shown that organic compounds can migrate from pe pipes to the water this study aimed to identify potential organic compounds migrating from high density pe hdpe pipes used to distribute drinking water in denmark based on laboratory experiments and sampling in the distribution system using a two tiered study design in the first tier migration of volatile and semi volatile organic compounds vocs and semi vocs from hdpe pipes were investigated over one three and nine days in laboratory experiments performed according to modified standards for migration testing en 12 873 1 the analytical workflow consisted of solid phase extraction spe for 10 000 times enrichment and gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analysis from the water phase after migration a total of 133 compounds originating from the pe pipes were detected thirty one compounds were detected by suspect screening ss while the remaining 102 compounds were detected by non target screening nts analysis among the detected compounds were also hindered amine stabilizers hals flame retardant and plasticizer tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate in the second tier drinking water from a water distribution system in copenhagen denmark with a newly installed hdpe pipe was sampled and analyzed with gc ms and liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lchrms a total of 51 compounds were detected in the water 12 of which were assigned to migration from hdpe surprisingly hdpe antioxidants and their degradation products contributed only a relatively small percentage of the total measured compound intensities in the drinking water distribution system instead a larger proportion of the compounds detected were assigned to rubber seals used upstream in the water system from the abstraction site to delivery at the consumer tap seals are considered trifle in the larger picture of materials in contact with drinking water however these results may cause a reconsideration of this position graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hdpe pipes migration gc ms water contaminants non targeted analysis freshwater analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction traditional drinking water treatment in denmark consists of groundwater abstraction into the waterworks where the water is aerated and filtrated before it is stored in water tanks winther et al 2010 further treatment with disinfection e g by chlorination or uv is not commonly used in denmark a large part of the utility system consists of a piping network currently most newly laid and replaced pipes are made of polyethylene pe which offers many advantageous chemical and mechanical properties facilitating their widespread application as a cost effective solution for private and industrial water supply systems pe pipes are made from pe resin generally with added colorants antioxidants stabilizers fillers and other ingredients essential to achieve the desired properties that strengthen and protect the pipes during fabrication and service whelton and nguyen 2013 previous analysis of water distributed through pe pipes revealed migration of phenolic additives and antioxidant degradation products from the material anselme et al 1985 subsequently phenol ketone and quinone compounds resulting from antioxidant additive degradation became subjects of monitoring organic contaminants leaching from pe piping material into drinking water in the distribution system danish environmental protection agency 2012 these sterically hindered phenolic and phosphite antioxidants are large molecules with high hydrophobicity and low water miscibility limiting their migration into water dopico garcı a et al 2003 however degradation products of the antioxidants are found to leach from the piping material brocca et al 2002 skjevrak et al 2003 the release of unwanted organic compounds from materials in contact with drinking water can affect the quality of the water impact odor and taste cause microbial growth or worst case be toxic stern and lagos 2008 therefore the european commission has adopted a regulation on the hygienic requirements for materials in contact with drinking water in the new drinking water directive council directive 2020 2184 however the composition and manufacturing process of plastic pipes used for drinking water remains a trade secret thus only targeted analysis on a subset of compounds provided by the manufacturer is disclosed to the utilities evaluating the possible impact on water quality most pe pipes used by european drinking water utilities are certified according to different certification schemes e g kiwa kq 561 dwgv and dk vand the certification schemes evaluate the pipes according to manufacture formulation and quantify a list of known compounds associated with plastics however studies have shown that these targeted compounds only comprise 2 of the total organic migration from pe pipes denberg 2009 regarding the entire water distribution system from source to the tap also other parts than pe pipes could contribute to migration such as the used rubber seals european commissionpean 2017 a way to increase our knowledge of compound migration from pe and the entire distribution system is to perform a suspect screening analysis task et al 2013 this approach explores data from samples measured by mass spectrometry ms for specific fragmentation patterns of compounds contained in a suspect screening library hollender et al 2017 further analysis of the same data can be in the form of non target screening nts analysis aiming to detect and identify compounds in measured samples unlike suspect screening nts uses no constrained suspect list thus providing a broader screening approach gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms is a well established technique used for the analysis of volatile semi volatile and thermostable compounds migrating from plastic pipes brocca et al 2002 including antioxidant degradation products lützhøft et al 2013 while liquid chromatography high resolution ms lchrms can support the analysis by gaining additional information on non volatile water soluble compounds hollender et al 2017 this study was set up as a two tiered study design the aim of the first tier was to build a suspect screening list containing previously reported compounds migrating from pe pipes and additional compounds tentatively identified in an accelerated migration study of high density pe hdpe pipes the aim of the second tier was to screen for known hdpe migrating compounds in a danish drinking water distribution system as well as other unknowns by gc ms and lchrms by that a conclusion about source related contaminants in the water distribution system could be reached 2 materials

study 2 2 1 samples hdpe pipes six hdpe pipes commonly used in danish water distribution systems were investigated the pipes were retrieved as new from the stock of a danish utility thus representing pipes that have already been installed in the distribution system all the tested pipes originated from the same manufacturer but had varying dimensions and strengths see figure s1 for details all the pipes investigated obtained european certification for contact with drinking water i e the kiwa watermark and dk vand approval 2 2 2 samples rubber seals five rubber seals from different valves commonly used in the water distribution system consisting of epdm and nbr rubber were investigated see figure s5 for details 2 2 3 migration study the laboratory migration study was designed based on the european method standard for testing the influence of materials on water intended for human consumption en 12873 1 2014 the pretreatment steps of flushing stagnation flushing and rinsing were followed according to the method standard for both hdpe pipes and the rubber seals water from the 24 hour stagnation in the pretreatment step was sampled for analysis 1 day sample hereafter the method was modified to accelerate compound migration from both the hdpe pipes and rubber seals hdpe pipes no 2 3 5 and 6 were de coated and shredded into threads using a jigsaw to accelerate migration by increasing the surface area to volume ratio similarly all the rubber seals were shredded the shredded hdpe and rubber seals were placed in 1 l glass bottles and filled with fresh milli q water the glass bottles used for the experiments were acid washed 1 hno₃ and burned 550 c for 4 h pipe no 1 and 4 were kept whole and plug sealed using burned 550 c for 4 h solid brass rod stoppers two migration periods were conducted after the pretreatment period 1 for 72 1 hours 3 days followed by period 2 for 216 1 hours 9 days period 2 for rubber seals lasted 168 1 hours 7 days milli q water 18 2 mω 5 ppm toc was used during pretreatment stagnation and migration periods with experimental temperatures of 23 c and 37 c respectively the higher migration temperature was used to accelerate the migration at the end of the contact time water was transferred to acid washed and burned 1 l blue cap bottles sealed with teflon coated plastic screw caps water was fully replaced between stagnation and migration periods the water samples 1 day 24 h 3 7 9 days from the migration experiments were stored at 5 c in the 1 l bottles and subjected to spe within 2 days after the migration experiments extracts were then stored at 20 c until gc ms analysis method blank samples were prepared using empty acid washed and burned glass bottles and the same milli q water as used in the migration experiments going through all the same processes without contact with the two sampled materials 2 3 tier 2 field study analysis of drinking water from distributional network to investigate migration from in use distribution systems drinking water from a site with newly renovated pipes was analyzed replacement of the pipes was carried out by a water utility company using certified pipes the site was renovated with a 90 mm pipe with a wall thickness of 16 4 mm giving an internal diameter of 73 6 mm the total length of the pipe installed was 320 m the inlet water originates from two different waterworks water coming from waterwork 1 would have been in contact with 6 028 m of pe pipes while water arriving from waterwork 2 would have been in contact with 26 296 m of pe pipes before reaching the sampling point in this study it was impossible to distinguish the amount of water originating from each waterwork detailed information can be found in supplementary information 1 2 4 solid phase extraction spe waters oasis hlb cartridges 6 cm3 500 mg 60 μm were conditioned using 10 ml methanol and equilibrated with 10 ml milli q water one liter of the water sample was loaded to the cartridge at a rate of 20 ml min 1 after loading the cartridge was washed with 10 ml milli q water the cartridge was then dried by sucking through air for 1 min before blowing with nitrogen to remove any water droplets the glass bottles that had been used for storing the water samples were rinsed with 10 ml methanol to extract any analytes that had adhered to the glass and the methanol was then used to elute the trapped analytes from the spe cartridge at 2 ml min 1 a further 10 ml methanol was used to ensure full elution of the analytes from the cartridge the volume of the combined methanolic extract was then up concentrated by decreasing the volume of methanol to 100 µl with a nitrogen flow the overall enrichment factor was 10 000 very polar acidic or basic compounds might have low recovery on the used hlb method alternatively multi layer spe has been used in literature tisler et al 2021 to increase the recovery of these polar compounds 2 5 gc ms analysis an agilent 7890a gc coupled to agilent 5973c ms using electron ionization at 70 ev was used to analyze all the sample extracts injection of 1 µl extract was made into the inlet in splitless mode at 300 c the gc was equipped with a zebron zb 5 capillary column 60 m 0 25 mm i d 0 25 μm film thickness initially the oven temperature was 45 c for 1 min then increased at 10 c min 1 to 330 c which was then held for 15 min giving a total run time of 45 min per sample helium was used as carrier gas with a flow rate of 2 ml min 1 the ms was operated in scan mode 10 600 m z the transfer line ion source and quadrupole temperatures were 330 230 and 150 c respectively to ensure the detection of lower levels and higher confidence in identification level 1 12 compounds were analyzed using gc ms with selected ion monitoring sim each compound was monitored using three sim ions and retention time the sim method contained five retention time groups with 9 ions each table 2s the dwell time for each ion was 25 ms

esi waters milford ma in the m z range 50 to 1000 m z an acquity beh c18 column 2 1 100 mm 1 7 µm pore size waters taastrup denmark was used with a flow rate of 0 3 ml min 1 the gradient program was increasing from initial conditions of 90 eluent a milliq h2o 0 1 fa to 99 b acetonitrile 0 1 fa over 16 min these conditions were kept for 5 min before switching back to the starting conditions 3 min equilibration time which corresponds to 11 column volumes to give a total run time of 24 min per sample the autosampler was kept at 15 c and the injection volume was 2 µl for all samples the ms was set up as follows 3000 v capillary voltage 120 c source temperature 500 c desolvation temperature cone gas flow l hr 100 desolvation gas flow l hr 1000 nebulizer gas 6 5 bar the samples were run in mse continuum mode scan time 0 35 s ramp trap collision 10 to 40 v 2 7 data analysis workflow for suspect screening and nts 2 7 1 tier 1 suspect screening for migration study with gc ms in tier 1 a suspect screening list was created based on a collection of previously reported compounds migrating from pe pipes materials with all pe densities were considered including the ones found in cross bonded polyethylene pex the literature search revealed 172 compounds reported for pe material mass spectral data was available for 154 of these compounds which were included in the suspect screening list table s1 suspect library pe together with retention index ri information if available the actual suspect screening was done using automated mass spectral deconvolution identification system amdis 2 73 nist ei mass spectra and median of reported ri if available were used in the amdis target list mallard 2014 deconvolution settings were optimized according to mastrangelo et al 2015 the search was done by matching amdis deconvoluted mass spectra to the spectra and ri of suspect compounds in the amdis target list stein 1999 mallard 2014 a full list of settings used for the amdis analysis can be found in figure s2 2 7 2 tier 1 nts of migration study with gc ms the software paradise version 3 9 www models life ku dk gcparadise for resolving nts gc ms data was used for nts data analysis johnsen et al 2017 the software settings for building the parafac2 model were non negativity constraints 2000 iterations for manually set intervals targeting individual eluting peaks with 1 to 9 components for an interval the models and the optimal number of components were evaluated based on individual elution profiles amdis was also used for nts analysis by means of exhaustive manual peak picking performed after deconvolution in all samples the deconvoluted spectra of components representing compounds were saved in a project specific ms library and afterward used for amdis searching deconvolution settings for nts analysis were match factor mf 80 and 7 ri unit window amdis results from suspect screening and nts analysis were exported to matlab 9 3 0 r2017b mathwork inc usa gui gavin3 0 96 behrends et al 2011 to visualize amdis results and integrate areas under the single ion peaks the aim of using parafac2 and amdis for gc ms nts was to obtain more pure mass spectra for identification leading to a less biased nist search compound identification was performed by matching deconvoluted mass spectra to nist epa nih mass spectral library 2017 and the corresponding ri data linear retention indexes ri were calculated from n alkanes c8 to c37 by liquid injection of 1 μl of an in house reference mineral oil sample dissolved in hplc grade dichloromethane with a total concentration of 2 5 g l calculation of ri was performed in amdis the reported identification levels id were inspired by guidelines in the metabolomics standards initiative sumner et al 2007 and are given according to the following scheme level 1 id indicates the compound has been confirmed using a commercial standard level 2 id corresponds to putatively annotated compounds resulting from a library match with 2 ri and 800 nist mf level 3 id corresponds to a putatively annotated library match with 2 ri or 800 nist mf compounds assigned to level 4 have 5 ri deviation or 700 mf and are considered unknowns the flow diagram for the combined suspect screening and nts in the migration study is shown in fig 1 the new compounds detected by nts were combined with the original literature based suspect screening list the extended suspect screening list consisted of 274 pe relevant compounds 172 suspects from the literature based suspect screening list table s1 and 102 additional nts compounds table s2 detected in the migration study 2 7 3 tier 2 suspect screening and nts for field study with gc ms and lc hrms the extended suspect screening list of 274 pe relevant compounds was applied to the samples analyzed with gc ms from the field study in addition nts was also applied for the field study with the same parameters described above to further elucidate on compounds present in the drinking water and to help with the source assignment lchrms suspect screening was conducted the suspect compounds were based on the norman suspect lists echaplastic 241 compounds and kwr drinking water suspect list 158 compounds the unifi software waters corporation was used for the suspect screening with lchrms conducted with the same workflow as tisler and christensen 2022 confidence level 1 was assigned for compounds confirmed with analytical standard and confidence level 2 for matching fragments with reference spectra and retention time prediction within a 2 min range confidence level 3 was assigned for matching the compound s retention time prediction and plausibility but missing fragment spectra for comparison identification levels followed the scheme proposed by schymanski et al 2014 the workflow for suspect screening and nts of samples from the field study is shown in figure s3 it consists of gc ms suspect screening of pe related compounds and nts as well as lchrms suspect screening of pe and rubber compounds 2 7 4 statistical analysis principal component analysis pca was used to explore the relationship between the samples and detected compounds it was performed on the log transformed and pareto scaled intensity peak table van den berg et al 2006 for combined datasets from suspect screening and nts interpretation of scores and loadings was aided by jackknife confidence intervals obtained by seven fold cross validation the venn diagram and box plot were created in r rstudio team 2019 using the package venndiagram chen and boutros 2011 2 7 5 quality assurance each sample of tier 1 and 2 was enriched by spe in triplicates a compound was only considered if it was detected in all triplicates for removal of laboratory contaminants originating from the sample preparation and the analytical system peak intensities of all detected compounds in the migration and field study were compared individually at each time point from method blank samples peaks of interest were those with a 10 times larger area in the samples than the blanks as assessed by a t test p 0 05 in the in use renovated pipe analysis the cutoff values used to select peaks of interest were set to p 0 1 and greater than 2x larger average peak areas in samples compared to the corresponding method blanks this was done for each replicate of the enriched triplicates individually 3 results and discussion 3 1 tier 1 suspect screening and nts of the migration study 3 1 1 visual inspection of gc ms data the gc ms total ion chromatograms tic of the analyzed water samples are shown in fig 2 a c for the three migration periods of 1 3 and 9 days the largest peaks are annotated in the caption below the figure inserts in the chromatograms represent zoom in on tic areas illustrating the presence of low intensity compounds in the tic fig 2d shows a method blank sample containing compounds originating from sample processing the time series showed a visible increase in the intensity of 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dione peak 5 an antioxidant degradation product of irganox 1076 fischer et al 1999 and 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxycinnamic acid peak 18 an antioxidant as well as several unknown compounds peaks 13 15 17 these compounds result from primary and secondary antioxidant additives like irganox 1010 1076 1330 and irgafos 168 protecting the pe against uv light and thermo oxidative degradation tolinski 2015 the parent molecules are sterically hindered phenolic and phosphite antioxidants which are large molecules with high hydrophobicity and low water miscibility limiting their migration into water dopico garcı a et al 2003 however degradation products of the antioxidants are commonly found to leach from the piping material skjevrak et al 2003 3 1 2 tier 1 nts analysis of gc ms data the nts analysis using amdis and parafac2 for peak detection and peak deconvolution resulted in the detection of 102 compounds including the 22 compounds detected by visual inspection of the gc ms tic in fig 2 of the detected compounds 40 were assigned id level 2 and 17 compounds id level 3 table s2 based on previous studies carrero carralero et al 2019 we assume that the relatively large number of compounds detected explicitly in hdpe was related to the high sample enrichment factor and employment of peak detection and deconvolution methods previous degradation studies have demonstrated the presence of more than 200 compounds during thermal and photo oxidized degradation of pe hakkarainen and albertsson 2004 the compounds reported in that study were mainly alkanes aldehydes ketones alcohols furans carboxylic and dicarboxylic acids with different chain lengths and only 16 of the reported compounds corresponded to those detected by nts in the current migration study apart from the different sample treatments this can also indicate the possible presence of different additives resulting in the district compounds observed in this study approximately 25 of the detected compounds are oxygenated phenolic species likely related to commonly used phenolic antioxidants it has been previously demonstrated that the added antioxidants can decompose into many products löschner et al 2011 beißmann et al 2013 which can further degrade ryssel et al 2015 however distinct groups of compounds in the migration study contained heteroatoms these have not previously been reported in pe pipes tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcpe is an organophosphate used as a plasticizer viscosity regulator and flame retardant in many types of polymers regnery and püttmann 2010 an additional detected compound was 1 dodecanethiol which has industrial usage related to pe production as a plasticizer and lubricant dionisio et al 2018 n n dibutylformamide detected is used as a lubrication oil and an additive for increasing thermal stability during manufacture and overall plastic lifespan the n n dibutylformamide and dodecanamide may be related to the use of n n bis 2 hydroxyethyl dodecanamide as antistatic agent which is permitted with a composition of up to 1 w w in hdpe efsa 2010 the compound 4 methyl 1h benzotriazole was observed in trace amounts it is widely used as a corrosion inhibitor while 2 2 4 trimethyl 1 3 pentanediol diisobutyrate txib was also detected and has application as a viscosity regulator and plasticizer furthermore a study of migration trends employing principal component analysis pca on the detected signal intensities was performed see supplementary information 2 and figure s4 3 1 3 suspect screening of gc ms data the samples from the migration study were screened for 154 compounds previously detected in pe materials resulting in the detection and identification of 31 substances based on the proposed id scheme see table s2 among the detected compounds 9 were from the list of 12 relevant target compounds included in routine analysis of danish drinking water danish environmental protection agency 2012 on average hdpe samples from the second migration period 3 days at 37 c had the largest number of detected suspects see table s2 for occurrence in the respective pipes and days as shown in fig 3 suspects detected in the third migration period 9 days at 37 c had the highest median peak intensities for compounds of the four classes aldehyde ketone carboxylic acid ester and phenol alcohol figure s4 the ester group is dominated by 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dione the most abundant compound detected the antioxidant derivative 2 6 di tert butylbenzoquinone bht q was detected for all migration periods see table s2 additional compounds found only in the first two migration periods were pent 3 en 2 one acetophenone used as a solvent for pe resin and decanal nonanal and cyclopentanone byproducts of pe manufacture skjevrak et al 2005 auto oxidation of the polymeric chain can occur during the manufacture and usage of pe pipes leading to the production of low mw ketones aldehydes alcohols and carboxylic acids andersson and wesslén 2005 carboxylic acids are the most stable oxygenated pe degradation products and accumulate during prolonged degradation hakkarainen and albertsson 2004 in general the suspects could explain 69 of the nts compound intensities after 1 day migration but only 42 after 3 and 9 days migration 3 2 tier 2 field study analysis of drinking water from distributional network table 1 shows field study results of combined gc ms and lchrms suspect screening and gc ms nts of water samples from the drinking water distribution network of copenhagen denmark detection and identification of 12 compounds that originates from pe and rubber included in the routine analysis of danish drinking water were ensured by using gc ms with selected ion monitoring fifty one compounds were detected at the two locations in triplicates before and after the newly renovated 320 m pipe section of these compounds 17 were identified at level 1 13 at level 2 19 at level 3 and 2 at level 4 in nts the only antioxidant degradation product detected was 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dione with gc ms sim the targeted antioxidants 2 4 di tert butylphenol and 2 6 di tert butyl p benzoquinone 2 6 di tert butyl 4 vinylphenol 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxyphenylpropionic acid together with 4 tert butylphenol and 5 methyl 2 hexanone were found in the majority of the samples but only two times higher than the method blanks compounds may be introduced during sample preparation and work up in contrast with the measurements from the migration study where the antioxidants and their degradation products were observed with the highest chromatographic peak intensities a total of nine out of the 42 compounds detected in at least one field sample were from the extended gc ms suspect list of compounds migrating from pe pipes thus a large proportion of the compounds detected by gc ms could not be assigned to pe pipes most of the remaining compounds could be related to rubber origin forrest 2006 five rubber seals used in danish water utilities were investigated by gc ms nts analysis figure s5 the nts compounds detected in the migration study of these five rubber seals were searched for in the gc ms data from the field study surprisingly out of 42 compounds detected in the field study 22 could also be found migrating from the rubber seals table 1 this finding is contrary to expectations that the most intense contaminants would leach from the pe piping material due to the higher surface area in contact with the water thus the source of migrating compounds was proposed based on their presence in the migration studies of pe and the rubber seal shown in table 1 the signal intensities of the detected compounds in the field study are in fig 4 and are shown as fold changes compared to the method blank the highest values that is the highest differences between samples and method blanks were found for compounds with proposed rubber origin in addition as indicated by color coding fig 4 shows that a large part of the compounds detected in the field study is assigned to have rubber origin the largest fold change values were observed for cyanoethyl ether and cyclohexyl isocyanate out of the five tested rubber seals the highest intensities of the two compounds were observed in the two pipe repair couplings figure s5 previous research focusing on nts analysis of micropollutants in urban freshwater sediments in danish water channels also detected the presence of cyclohexyl isocyanate lübeck et al 2020 in addition the compound was found to migrate from recycled rubber like rubber carpet padding phillips et al 2018 and together with cyanoethyl ether in recycled car rubber material benson et al 2019 the majority of rubber seals and membranes in waterworks and water distribution systems are made from ethylene propylene rubber epdm with minor use of nitrile rubber compound nbr danish environmental protection agency 2012 n cyclohexyl 2 benzothiazole sulphenamide cbs accelerator in epdm manufacturing allahbakhsh and mazinani 2015 could be assigned to sulfur based vulcanization of epdm rubber it has previously been shown that cbs accelerators leach benzothiazole cyclohexyl isocyanate and benzothiazolone forrest 2006 which were also detected in our field study these findings increase the plausibility of our observations that many of the detected compounds in the drinking water originate from rubber containing products used during abstraction in waterworks and or distribution systems similar results were observed for the compounds detected by lchrms eight of the twelve compounds were benzothiazoles and amines assigned to rubber related compounds previous studies have detected these compounds in car tire related samples seiwert et al 2020 benzothiazoles are commonly used as vulcanization accelerators in rubber production and 1 3 diphenylguanidine is used in rubber as a secondary vulcanization accelerator dicyclohexylurea is known as a byproduct of surface grating of polymers national toxicology program 2019 even caprolactam a monomer for synthetic fiber was detected in rubber tire products before seiwert et al 2020 benzotriazole detected with gc and lc is widely used as an anticorrosive stabilizing agent and lubricant and could also originate from the ultraviolet stabilizer additive degradation uv 328 or tinuvin p bartsch et al 2019 the methylated analog was observed at trace levels in the migration study comparing samples before and after the new stretch of piping the samples were flowing through more than 6 km of piping material and sampled before and after the newly renovated 320 m pipe section with comparable residence time in both sections see supplementary information 1 it can be concluded from the target ss and nts results that the 320 m stretch of new pipe was not significantly increasing the peak intensity of the detected compounds chemical and bio transformation processes and not capturing the same water package before and after the pipe stretch could account for the intensity fluctuation however it could also show that the contamination in the distribution system is influenced by more dominant materials than the stretch of the new pe pipe 4 conclusion a migration study was performed for six hdpe pipes used to distribute drinking water water samples from the hdpe pipe migration study were subjected to spe gc ms analysis results from the analysis were evaluated in suspect screening and nts approach a suspect screening library was built by compiling 157 previously reported compounds utilizing deconvolution and identification software amdis led to the detection of 31 suspected compounds the suspect screening method facilitated relatively fast detection of compounds reported to migrate from pe pipes nts employing deconvolution by paradise and amdis led to the detection of 102 compounds with 57 compounds detected previously not reported migrating from hdpe pipes an analysis of water from a drinking water distribution system was performed which led to the detection of 51 migrating compounds based on the migration study 11 compounds were assigned to originate from pe piping materials 16 were assigned to exclusive rubber origin and 11 were found to migrate from both investigated materials the rest of the compounds remained unassigned compared to other detected compounds in the drinking water additives antioxidants and other pe born vocs and semi vocs were found to be only minor contributors to drinking water contamination similarly investigation of compound migration into the drinking water at the inlet and outlet of the 320 meter hdpe pipe could not be assigned to migrate from the new hdpe piping stretch additional compounds found in the drinking water with higher intensities contained nitrogen and sulfur including cyanoethyl ether cyclohexyl isocyanate and several benzothiazole class compounds the detected compounds were also found in rubber seals used in the water distribution system rubber seals are considered trifle in the larger picture of materials used in contact with drinking water and these results may cause a reconsideration of this position

moreira and simionato 2019 used a particle tracking simulation that revealed a traverse gradient of suspended clay concentrations attributed to differences in the suspended load between the turbid paraná and clearer uruguay river in spite of the availability of numerical simulations and tracer modelling studies the characterization of the biogeochemical signature of main water corridors with field data is scarce in order to fill this gap we employed a continuous measurement system to monitor standard water quality parameters chlorophyll a and coloured dissolved organic matter combined with discrete water sampling for pigment and suspended particulate matter grain size analysis the resulting high resolution field data along cross sectional and longitudinal transects coupled with multivariate analysis techniques provided a detailed characterization of the water pathways in the upper rlp estuary 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling 2 1 1 main tributaries in order to characterize the hydrochemical signature of rlp freshwater sources at the estuary head the main tributary branches luján river lu paraná de las palmas pp paraná guazú pg and uruguay river ur fig 1 and

close to colonia along three 38 km transects during 2017 2018 i 2017 oct 6 ii 2017 oct 7 iii 2018 feb 17 an additional longitudinal transect was sampled along the south rlp shore in 2018 iv 2018 apr 5 fig 1 field campaigns 4 7 h for each transect were carried out in a fully equipped 41 foot oceanic boat the multiparameter probe ysi 6600v2 and a submersible fluorometer turner c3 turner designs inc san jose usa chlorophyll a chl a and coloured dissolved organic matter cdom were coupled to flow cells supplied with river water from a 0 5 m deep water intake and connected to an external pc for data logging ysi ecowatch lite and turner c soft software the sampling rate was set to every minute to obtain a high resolution 200 m snapshot in each transect n 225 222 222 and 443 readings for transects

procedures due to technical problems during data downloading cdom data for transects i and ii were not retrieved 2 1 3 discrete sampling during transect iii three discrete water samples were collected for laboratory determination of spm concentration spm grain size distribution and analysis of chlorophyll a and phaeopigments these three sampling locations were selected to be representative of the southern central and northern rlp sectors at km 9 km 20 and km 30 from the south shore respectively fig 1 and table 1 2 2 climate and river conditions tributaries were sampled under average flow

completed under similar tidal conditions ebb tide and 0 8 0 1 m tidal range mhsa 2019 but with contrasting wind directions and tributaries discharges transects i and ii were characterized by weak s ssw winds 15 20 km h 1 and a low paraná river discharge 11 103 m3 s 1 resulting in a reduced total rlp flow 17 103 m3 s 1 during transect iii weak ne winds prevailed 15 km h 1 nmsa 2022 and total rlp discharge was higher mainly driven by the paraná river while uruguay river was markedly below average 18 0 1 103 and 2 2 0 3 103 m3 s 1 for the paraná and uruguay respectively finally during transect iv weak ne winds also prevailed and the rlp total discharge was at its maximum 23 0 9 103 m3 s 1 due to the recovery of ur discharge flow 2 3 calibration procedures detailed calibration of the

ggplot2 packages r core team 2019 in rstudio development environment data are reported as ranges and or mean sd for multivariate analysis data were standardized x x y where x mean and y sd in order to classify the data into groups based on variable similarity an unsupervised clustering method k means was performed followed by a principal component analysis pca to evaluate the distribution of the observations along the cross sectional transects the optimal number of clusters for each transect was obtained after bssk 1 tssk 1 100 bssk tssk 100 5 where bss and tss denote the between and total sum of squares for a given number of clusters k and the following k 1 respectively which explained 82 88 of the total variability the initial random centers to partition the readings was set to 25 both multivariate techniques were performed using r base functions kmeans and prcomp the relationship between variables was evaluated through linear regression models and the level of significance was

ranges and spm grain size composition of main tributaries discrete stations and continuous measurements are detailed in table 1 and fig 3 water corridor characterization resulting from multivariate analysis is shown in figs 4 5 and table 2 and further detailed in the supplementary material 3 1 main tributaries in general water temperatures were relatively uniform in all tributaries 27 0 3 c

ph in the paraná 7 6 0 3 vs 8 1 in the ur among the paraná branches lu was characterized by the highest conductivity 201 µs cm 1 and lowest ph values 7 2 and higher chl a concentration 3 1 µg l 1 whereas the other branches pp and pg showed intermediate conductivities 140 155 µs cm 1 higher ph 7 7 and lower chl a concentrations 1 5 1 8 µg l 1 table 1 the highest ph values in ur are related to enhanced eutrophication as denoted the higher chl a values 6 1 µg l 1 and fresher pigment signature effectively the phaeo ratio applied to evaluate the degradation of the pigment signal phaeo phaeopigment phaeopigment chlorophyll a lemaire et al 2002 was 2 3 5 times lower in the ur relative to the paraná phaeo 16 vs 34 59 respectively table 1 the analysis of spm also revealed significant differences between both rivers paraná river spm was dominated by silt fractions clay 41 7 silt 59 7 median 4 4 6 5 µm whereas uruguay river spm showed a finer distribution clay 52 silt 48 median 3 7

fig 3 insert and table 1 clay appeared to be inversely correlated with turbidity whereas silt insinuated a reciprocal direct although non significant relationship r2 0 76 p 0 127 the highest turbidity associated to a clear silt predominance 67 including coarser medium silts 15 6 31 µm was registered in the paraná guazú 145 ntu and 16 medium silts with lower values in the other paraná branches 107

offshore along the cross sectional transects in a s n direction there was a general decreasing pattern of conductivity 541 275 to 186 115 µs cm 1 turbidity 59 82 to 48 66 ntu and cdom 1 3 0 6 mg c l 1 while temperature ph and chl a showed higher variability the southern end of the transects located 7 10 km away from la plata inner harbour presented higher conductivity cdom and chl a 160 541 µs cm 1

the transects 18 25 km away from la plata conductivity turbidity and ph showed intermediate records 131 287 µs cm 1 55 70 ntu 7 9 8 0 respectively whereas 35 km away from the argentine shore rlp waters were characterized by lower conductivity and turbidity and more basic records of ph 112 201 µs cm 1 49 70 ntu and 7 9 8 1 respectively the spatial trends were further explored by correlation analysis of water quality parameters with distance from the south coast along each transect conductivity was negatively correlated to distance along the three transects r 0 99 p 0 001 while turbidity showed no significant trend along transect i but it was negatively correlated with distance in transects ii and iii r 0 77 to 0 87 p 0 05 fig s1 this s n shift was also reflected by decreasing cdom concentrations with distance from the south coast 1 2 to 0 6 mg c l 1 r2 0 95 p 0 001 transect iii which were also significantly p 0 001 correlated with conductivity 285 to 109 µs cm 1 r2 0 77 and turbidity 76 to 48 ntu r2 0 74 temperature readings reflected seasonality but showed no significant relationship with other parameters chlorophyll a distribution was highly variable with opposing trends in transects ii and iii fig 3 during 2017 transect ii chl a was slightly lower and less variable general mean 3 0 0 4 µg l 1 and increased northward 2 3 to 4 3 µg l 1 r 0 92 p 0 01 in contrast during 2018 transect iii chl a was more variable 3 3 0 8 µg l 1 and decreased northward 5 9 to 1 3 µg l 1 r 0 86 p 0 01 fig 3 with a consistent decreasing trend of the phaeo ratios 20 in station km 20 and 5 in station km 30 the s n shift was also observed in the grain size composition of spm which showed a progressive relative enrichment in finer materials to the north silt 64 52 and 38 clay 36 48 and 62 grain size median 5 7 4 2 and 3 0 µm for stations km 9 km 20 and km 30 respectively fig 3 insert and table 1 this pattern was emphasized for the finest 0 98 µm fraction which showed a five times increase to the north 4 16 and 20 respectively with a concomitant decrease of medium silts 7 8 15 6 µm 35 27 and 8 3 3 multivariate analysis of high resolution data given the large number of data obtained in each cross sectional transect a clustering method k means was used to sort data into groups which represent the different sectors after the cluster analysis readings were classified into four groups for transect i and iii and five groups in transect ii ensuring that the global variability was captured see 2 methods section to identify the main variables that control this unsupervised grouping principal component analysis pca was employed the first two principal components explained 85 91 of the total variability in the three transects i 91 ii 87 iii 85 in transects i and ii pc1 is defined by turbidity and ph pc1 opposed to temperature and conductivity pc1 in transect iii these contributing parameters are reversed and opposed to cdom and chl a pc1 pc2 is driven by temperature pc2 in the case of transect i and by a combined contribution of chlorophyll a pc2 opposed to turbidity and conductivity in transect ii pc2 fig 4 this general pattern is repeated in the transect iii with the addition of cdom to pc1 detailed pca results are reported in the supplementary material tables s2 and s3 along the south north transition different water corridors were identified with an approximate width of 3 6 km 11 19 km and 7 20 km for the south central and north corridors respectively fig 4 table s4 along transect ii an additional intermediate corridor was identified central north corridor identified by blue strip in fig 4 3 4 longitudinal transect the coastal corridor identified previously by k means and pca corresponds to impacted coastal waters extending along the argentinean side red strip in fig 4 this coastal corridor was characterized along the nw se longitudinal transect carried out 6 10 km offshore the south coast transect iv fig 1 the hydrochemical signature of this corridor flowing to the sea from la plata harbour area was characterized by higher records of conductivity chl a and cdom fig 5a and table 2 and was maintained 100 km seaward at the end of the transect the relationship between water quality parameters along the entire transect was evaluated by correlation analysis conductivity and cdom showed a positive relationship r 0 96 p 0 001 and both were negatively associated with turbidity r 0 93 and 0 87 p 0 001 respectively two separated peaks of conductivity and cdom associated to minimums of turbidity were observed in the middle of the transect in the first 30 km south from the beginning of the transect conductivity and cdom peaked 33 36 over the baseline 266 vs 200 µs cm 1 3 2 vs 2 4 mg c l 1 displaying a significant positive correlation r 0 92 p 0 001 with a parallel 43 decrease of turbidity 80 vs 140 ntu baseline which was thus negatively correlated with both conductivity and cdom r 0 90 and 0 91 p 0 001 encircled in fig 5 the second spike observed 60 km seaward from the beginning of the transect showed basically the same pattern positively correlated conductivity and cdom peaks 258 µs cm 1 and 3 2 mg c l 1 r 0 95 p 0 001 with an opposite trend of turbidity 77 ntu r 0 85 and 0 93 p 0 001 encircled in fig 5 4 discussion upper freshwater sources characterized at the estuary head show different hydrochemical signatures the paraná river form a rapidly growing sandy delta at the estuary head 44 m year 1 marcomini et al 2018 with several branches of contrasting water quality characteristics and anthropic impact in a s n direction lu is highly impacted by urban industrial discharges and commercial nautical activities castañé et al 2015 and show higher conductivity and chl a and lower ph while pp and pg fig 1 are both less impacted cataldo et al 2001 on the northside the ur single channel discharges to the rlp with clearly different water quality characteristics with lower conductivity and turbidity higher chl a and ph these hydrochemical signatures reflect the different characteristics of the tributaries sub basins including anthropogenic impact and are maintained along the upper rlp estuary as discrete water corridors the large contrast of turbidity between paraná and uruguay rivers is related to the massive contribution of clays and silts originating from the andean plains carried by the very turbid bermejo river 7 8 g l 1 depetris and pasquini 2007 1000 km north in the paraguay paraná river confluence fig 1 insert in contrast the uruguay river reflect the contribution of eutrophic and basic waters from the salto grande dam fig 1 insert located 300 km north chl a 3 215 µg l 1 ph 7 4 10 aubriot et al 2020 o farrell et al 2012 the different eutrophic status of both tributaries is corroborated by the phaeo ratio that shows a more detrital pigment signature in the paraná river compared with a fresher signal in the ur the grain size composition of spm also reflects contrasting signatures with a coarser composition dominated by silts in the paraná and finer spm specially the 0 98 µm fraction in the uruguay river overall the pigment and spm grain size data indicates a distinct nature of the material transported by both rivers with a detrital more aged pigment signal in the paraná compared to a fresher autochthonous signature in the uruguay river sixty km seaward these hydrochemical signatures are preserved showing also the influence of polluted coastal sources la plata inner harbour waters characterized by highest conductivity and lowest ph reflect local pollution from domestic sources port shipyard and a large petrochemical complex fig 3 colombo et al 1989 the lower turbidity of this low energy inner environment coupled to the discharge of urban effluents promote algae blooms resulting in highest chl a records temperature is also anomalously high in this area reflecting the reduced water movement and the contribution of cooling waters from industrial facilities this impacted lp harbour signature is progressively diluted along the port channel while turbidity increases offshore especially at the channel mouth due to local resuspension these results are consistent with previous reports which highlighted the severe anthropogenic impact produced by the discharge sewage outfalls and polluted streams like the riachuelo river along the argentine coast resulting in exponential offshore decreases of hydrocarbons pcbs and trace metals in bottom sediments colombo et al 2005a 2005b tatone et al 2009 this anthropogenic influence is reflected by higher conductivity records along the south shore and outside the port channel fig 1 in the middle section of the transects more typical conditions of the paraná river are observed with lower conductivity higher turbidity and ph similar to values reported for the delta puig et al 2015 in the northern extreme of the transects the influence of the uruguay river is detected by the decrease of conductivity and turbidity and increase of ph comparable to values measured 400 km upstream the uruguay river colombo et al 2015 these decreasing gradients of conductivity and turbidity coupled to the rapid drop of cdom are good tracers of the reduction of the impact of coastal discharges and the transition between paraná and uruguay river waters another useful tracer of this transition is the grain size composition of spm with coarser material along the south and middle sections of the rlp influenced by the paraná river and a finer distribution to the north specially of the finest 0 98 µm fraction predominant in the uruguay river fig 3 insert due to a higher variability chl a do not display such consistent spatial patterns in transect ii the northward increase of this parameter appear to reflect an increasing influence of the more eutrophic uruguay river however in transect iii the highest chl a records are observed on the south possibly reflecting the detection of discharge pulses from the eutrophic la plata harbour this reversed chl a pattern would be facilitated by the reduced influence of uruguay river which had lower flow rates at that time 2218 254 vs 5000 m3 s 1 average module cammesa 2020 in spite of the contradictory trends of chl a concentrations the transition from the detrital influence of the paraná to the fresher pigment signal of the uruguay river was captured by the phaeo ratios in transect iii effectively the south central sector shows a degraded pigment signal phaeo 17 comparable to values reported for the turbidity maximum zone of different world estuaries e g 15 18 in the ems and scheldt lemaire et al 2002 whereas in the northern sector the phaeo ratios show a 4 times drop multivariate analysis successfully grouped the continuous readings into discrete clusters based on their similarities and identified the parameters driving the south north transition in the principal component analysis ph conductivity and turbidity pc1 explained the transition from la plata inner harbour waters to the open rlp for transects i and ii temperature chl a and turbidity pc2 explained the cross sectional transition of the rlp the contribution of turbidity is particularly relevant since it reflects the higher spm content of paraná de las palmas waters flowing along the south shore relative to the less turbid uruguay river the addition of cdom to the analysis in transect iii supports the characterization of this transition from lp inner harbour waters to the rlp and also contributes to explain the south north transition between paraná uruguay river waters historic measurements of dissolved organic carbon performed by the wet digestion method in both rivers effectively indicated values twice as large for the paraná river 6 8 7 4 vs 3 4 mg l 1 in the ur mañosa and depetris 1993 cataldo et al 2001 the k means analysis allowed to identify different water corridors south central and north fig 4 with variable width according to the influence of tributaries discharge and river conditions i e tides winds in transect iii a transitional corridor having intermediate water characteristics between the central and north corridors is identified an analogous transitional corridor was previously inferred by computational modelling for normal low paraná river discharge and high uruguay river flow simionato et al 2009 overall in situ high resolution multiparameter data identified the corridors of flow in the rlp which are globally consistent with numerical modelling results jaime and menéndez 2002 piedra cueva and fossati 2007 simionato et al 2009 fig 4 and table s5 conductivity cdom turbidity and suspended sediment grain size composition are the best indicators to characterize the cross sectional variability of upper rlp waters an additional contribution of the high resolution multivariate data is the consistent tracing of a previously unidentified coastal corridor integrating the impact of metropolitan buenos aires and la plata city the distinctive cdom conductivity signature of this corridor is traced 100 km downstream with additional point source contributions from la plata magdalena sewage outfalls fig 5 at magdalena the buñirigo stream affected by tanneries and meat processing activities rodrigues capítulo et al 2001 stars in fig 1 also contributes to these point sources the direct covariation of cdom and conductivity with synchronic peaks coinciding with a parallel decrease of turbidity is a clear signature of local polluted discharges as is also observed in la plata inner harbour waters the consistent delimitation of this southern coastal corridor suggests a reduced cross mixing of rlp waters probably reinforced by the strong ebb tide and low ne winds during the cruise future studies are needed to evaluate the transport and eventual mixing of this corridor along the river marine transition until its final discharge to the sea 5 conclusions the combined approach of high resolution water quality monitoring combined with multivariate analysis techniques allowed a detailed characterization of the corridors of flow and the anthropogenic impact in the upper río de la plata estuary marked changes of water characteristics were registered in major tributaries with coarser suspended sediment and a detrital pigment signature in the paraná river compared to a finer and fresher signal in the uruguay river these hydrochemical signatures were tracked 60 km downstream across the river the south north decreasing trends of conductivity turbidity coloured dissolved organic matter suspended particulate matter grain size composition and pigment degradation reflected the transition from paraná to uruguay river waters multivariate techniques also allowed the identification of a polluted coastal corridor along the south shore integrating the urban industrial discharges from buenos aires la plata metropolitan area the signature of this coastal

paraná and clearer uruguay river in spite of the availability of numerical simulations and tracer modelling studies the characterization of the biogeochemical signature of main water corridors with field data is scarce in order to fill this gap we employed a continuous measurement system to monitor standard water quality parameters chlorophyll a and coloured dissolved organic matter combined with discrete water sampling for pigment and suspended particulate matter grain size analysis the resulting high resolution field data along cross sectional and longitudinal transects coupled with multivariate analysis techniques provided a detailed characterization of the water pathways in the upper rlp estuary 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling 2 1 1 main tributaries in order to characterize the hydrochemical signature of rlp freshwater sources at the estuary head the main tributary branches luján river lu paraná de las palmas pp paraná guazú pg and uruguay river ur fig 1 and

close to colonia along three 38 km transects during 2017 2018 i 2017 oct 6 ii 2017 oct 7 iii 2018 feb 17 an additional longitudinal transect was sampled along the south rlp shore in 2018 iv 2018 apr 5

san jose usa chlorophyll a chl a and coloured dissolved organic matter cdom were coupled to flow cells supplied with river water from a 0 5 m deep water intake and connected to an external pc for data logging ysi ecowatch lite and turner c soft software the sampling rate was set to every minute to obtain a high resolution 200 m snapshot in each transect n 225 222 222 and 443 readings for transects

procedures due to technical problems during data downloading cdom data for transects i and ii were not retrieved 2 1 3 discrete sampling during transect iii three discrete water samples were collected for laboratory determination of spm concentration spm grain size distribution and analysis of chlorophyll a and phaeopigments these three sampling locations were selected to be representative of the southern central and northern rlp sectors at km 9 km 20 and km 30 from the south shore respectively fig 1 and table 1 2 2 climate and river conditions tributaries were sampled under average flow

completed under similar tidal conditions ebb tide and 0 8 0 1 m tidal range mhsa 2019 but with contrasting wind directions and tributaries discharges transects i and ii were characterized by weak s ssw winds 15 20 km h 1 and a low paraná river discharge 11 103 m3 s 1 resulting in a reduced total rlp flow 17 103 m3 s 1 during transect iii weak ne winds prevailed 15 km h 1 nmsa 2022 and total rlp discharge was higher mainly driven by the paraná river while uruguay river was markedly below average 18 0 1 103 and 2 2 0 3 103 m3 s 1 for the paraná and uruguay respectively finally during transect iv weak ne winds also prevailed and the rlp total discharge was at its maximum 23 0 9 103 m3 s 1 due to the recovery of ur discharge flow 2 3 calibration procedures detailed calibration of the

ggplot2 packages r core team 2019 in rstudio development environment data are reported as ranges and or mean sd for multivariate analysis data were standardized x x y where x mean and y sd in order to classify the data into groups based on variable similarity an unsupervised clustering method k means was performed followed by a principal component analysis pca to evaluate the distribution of the observations along the cross sectional transects the optimal number of clusters for each transect was obtained after bssk 1 tssk 1 100 bssk tssk 100 5 where bss and tss denote the between and total sum of squares for a given number of clusters k and the following k 1 respectively which explained 82 88 of the total variability the initial random centers to partition the readings was set to 25 both multivariate techniques were performed using r base functions kmeans and prcomp the relationship between variables was evaluated through linear regression models and the level of significance was verified via t test to evaluate the degradation of the pigment signal the percentage of phaeopigments relative to total pigments was calculated phaeo phaeopigment phaeopigment chlorophyll a lemaire et al 2002 turbidity was expressed as nephelometric turbidity units ntu chlorophyll a reports refer to fluorometric records except in the case of discrete sampling 3 results water quality parameter ranges and spm grain size composition of main tributaries discrete stations and continuous measurements are detailed in table 1 and fig 3 water corridor characterization resulting from multivariate analysis is shown in figs 4 5 and table 2 and further detailed in the supplementary material 3 1 main tributaries in general water temperatures were relatively uniform in all tributaries 27 0 3 c whereas the other parameters showed significant differences between paraná river branches and the uruguay river i e higher turbidity 131 21 vs 64 ntu and conductivity 165 32 vs 114 µs cm 1 and lower ph in the paraná 7 6 0 3 vs 8 1 in the ur among the paraná branches lu was characterized by the highest conductivity 201 µs cm 1 and lowest ph values 7 2 and higher chl a concentration 3 1 µg l 1 whereas the other branches pp and pg showed intermediate conductivities 140 155 µs cm 1 higher ph 7 7 and lower chl a concentrations 1 5 1 8 µg l 1 table 1 the highest ph values in ur are related to enhanced eutrophication as denoted the higher chl a values 6 1 µg l 1 and fresher pigment signature effectively the phaeo ratio applied to evaluate the degradation of the pigment signal phaeo phaeopigment phaeopigment chlorophyll a lemaire et al 2002 was 2 3 5 times lower in the ur relative to the paraná phaeo 16 vs 34 59 respectively table 1 the analysis of spm also revealed significant differences between both rivers paraná river spm was dominated by silt fractions clay 41 7 silt 59 7 median 4 4 6 5 µm whereas uruguay river spm showed a finer distribution clay 52 silt 48 median 3 7 µm with a marked relative abundance of the 0 98 µm clay fraction 18 vs 9 4 in the paraná and lowest percentages of fine and very fine silts 7 8 15 6 µm 27 vs 29 1 3 9 7 8 µm 20 vs 24 2 respectively fig 3 insert and table 1 clay appeared to be inversely correlated with turbidity whereas silt insinuated a reciprocal direct although non significant relationship r2 0 76 p 0 127 the highest turbidity associated to a clear silt predominance 67 including coarser medium silts 15 6 31 µm was registered in the paraná guazú 145 ntu and 16 medium silts with lower values in the other paraná branches 107 140 ntu 54 57 silts and 2 3 medium silts and the uruguay river 64 ntu 48 and 1 respectively 3 2 cross sectional transects la plata inner harbour waters characterized by higher temperature 17 8 25 1 c conductivity 238 715 µs cm 1 chl a 1 0 5 9 µg l 1 and cdom 1 1 2 0 mg c 1 and lower turbidity 25 121 ntu and ph 7 5 7 8 showed a gradual transition along the main harbour channel which continues offshore along the cross sectional transects in a s n direction there was a general decreasing pattern of conductivity 541 275 to 186 115 µs cm 1 turbidity 59 82 to 48 66 ntu and cdom 1 3 0 6 mg c l 1 while temperature ph and chl a showed higher variability the southern end of the transects located 7 10 km away from la plata inner harbour presented higher conductivity cdom and chl a 160 541 µs cm 1 1 0 1 2 mg c l 1 2 1 4 7 µg l 1 turbidity was also relatively high in this sector 58 82 ntu whereas temperature and ph were more variable 17 6 24 7 c and 7 6 8 0 respectively in the middle section of the transects 18 25 km away from la plata conductivity turbidity and ph showed intermediate records 131 287 µs cm 1 55 70 ntu 7 9 8 0 respectively whereas 35 km away from the argentine shore rlp waters were characterized by lower conductivity and turbidity and more basic records of ph 112 201 µs cm 1 49 70 ntu and 7 9 8 1 respectively the spatial trends were further explored by correlation analysis of water quality parameters with distance from the south coast along each transect conductivity was negatively correlated to distance along the three transects r 0 99 p 0 001 while turbidity showed no significant trend along transect i but it was negatively correlated with distance in transects ii and iii r 0 77 to 0 87 p 0 05 fig s1 this s n shift was also reflected by decreasing cdom concentrations with distance from the south coast 1 2 to 0 6 mg c l 1 r2 0 95 p 0 001 transect iii which were also significantly p 0 001 correlated with conductivity 285 to 109 µs cm 1 r2 0 77 and turbidity 76 to 48 ntu r2 0 74 temperature readings reflected seasonality but showed no significant relationship with other parameters chlorophyll a distribution was highly variable with opposing trends in transects ii and iii fig 3 during 2017 transect ii chl a was slightly lower and less variable general mean 3 0 0 4 µg l 1 and increased northward 2 3 to 4 3 µg l 1 r 0 92 p 0 01 in contrast during 2018 transect iii chl a was more variable 3 3 0 8 µg l 1 and decreased northward 5 9 to 1 3 µg l 1 r 0 86 p 0 01 fig 3 with a consistent decreasing trend of the phaeo ratios 20 in station km 20 and 5 in station km 30 the s n shift was also observed in the grain size composition of spm which showed a progressive relative enrichment in finer materials to the north silt 64 52 and 38 clay 36 48 and 62 grain size median 5 7 4 2 and 3 0 µm for stations km 9 km 20 and km 30 respectively fig 3 insert and table 1 this pattern was emphasized for the finest 0 98 µm fraction which showed a five times increase to the north 4 16 and 20 respectively with a concomitant decrease of medium silts 7 8 15 6 µm 35 27 and 8 3 3 multivariate analysis of high resolution data given the large number of data obtained in each cross sectional transect a clustering method k means was used to sort data into groups which represent the different sectors after the cluster analysis readings were classified into four groups for transect i and iii and five groups in transect ii ensuring that the global variability was captured see 2 methods section to identify the main variables that control this unsupervised grouping principal component analysis pca was employed the first two principal components explained 85 91 of the total variability in the three transects i 91 ii 87 iii 85 in transects i and ii pc1 is defined by turbidity and ph pc1 opposed to temperature and conductivity pc1 in transect iii these contributing parameters are reversed and opposed to cdom and chl a pc1 pc2 is driven by temperature pc2 in the case of transect i and by a combined contribution of chlorophyll a pc2 opposed to turbidity and conductivity in transect ii pc2 fig 4 this general pattern is repeated in the transect iii with the addition of cdom to pc1 detailed pca results are reported in the supplementary material tables s2 and s3 along the south north transition different water corridors were identified with an approximate width of 3 6 km 11 19 km and 7 20 km for the south central and north corridors respectively fig 4 table s4 along transect ii an additional intermediate corridor was identified central north corridor identified by blue strip in fig 4 3 4 longitudinal transect the coastal corridor identified previously by k means and pca corresponds to impacted coastal waters extending along the argentinean side red strip in fig 4 this coastal corridor was characterized along the nw se longitudinal transect carried out 6 10 km offshore the south coast transect iv fig 1 the hydrochemical signature of this corridor flowing to the sea from la plata harbour area was characterized by higher records of conductivity chl a and cdom fig 5a and table 2 and was maintained 100 km seaward at the end of the transect the relationship between water quality parameters along the entire transect was evaluated by correlation analysis conductivity and cdom showed a positive relationship r 0 96 p 0 001 and both were negatively associated with turbidity r 0 93 and 0 87 p 0 001 respectively two separated peaks of conductivity and cdom associated to minimums of turbidity were observed in the middle of the transect in the first 30 km south from the beginning of the transect conductivity and cdom peaked 33 36 over the baseline 266 vs 200 µs cm 1 3 2 vs 2 4 mg c l 1 displaying a significant positive correlation r 0 92 p 0 001 with a parallel 43 decrease of turbidity 80 vs 140 ntu baseline which was thus negatively correlated with both conductivity and cdom r 0 90 and 0 91 p 0 001 encircled in fig 5 the second spike observed 60 km seaward from the beginning of the transect showed basically the same pattern positively correlated conductivity and cdom peaks 258 µs cm 1 and 3 2 mg c l 1 r 0 95 p 0 001 with an opposite trend of turbidity 77 ntu r 0 85 and 0 93 p 0 001 encircled in fig 5 4 discussion upper freshwater sources characterized at the estuary head show different hydrochemical signatures the paraná river form a rapidly growing sandy delta at the estuary head 44 m year 1 marcomini et al 2018 with several branches of contrasting water quality characteristics and anthropic impact in a s n direction lu is highly impacted by urban industrial discharges and commercial nautical activities castañé et al 2015 and show higher conductivity and chl a and lower ph while pp and pg fig 1 are both less impacted cataldo et al 2001 on the northside the ur single channel discharges to the rlp with clearly different water quality characteristics with lower conductivity and turbidity higher chl a and ph these hydrochemical signatures reflect the different characteristics of the tributaries sub basins including anthropogenic impact and are maintained along the upper rlp estuary as discrete water corridors the large contrast of turbidity between paraná and uruguay rivers is related to the massive contribution of clays and silts originating from the andean plains carried by the very turbid bermejo river 7 8 g l 1 depetris and pasquini 2007 1000 km north in the paraguay paraná river confluence fig 1 insert in contrast the uruguay river reflect the contribution of eutrophic and basic waters from the salto grande dam fig 1 insert located 300 km north chl a 3 215 µg l 1 ph 7 4 10 aubriot et al 2020 o farrell et al 2012 the different eutrophic status of both tributaries is corroborated by the phaeo ratio that shows a more detrital pigment signature in the paraná river compared with a fresher signal in the ur the grain size composition of spm also reflects contrasting signatures with a coarser composition dominated by silts in the paraná and finer spm specially the 0 98 µm fraction in the uruguay river overall the pigment and spm grain size data indicates a distinct nature of the material transported by both rivers with a detrital more aged pigment signal in the paraná compared to a fresher autochthonous signature in the uruguay river sixty km seaward these hydrochemical signatures are preserved showing also the influence of polluted coastal sources la plata inner harbour waters characterized by highest conductivity and lowest ph reflect local pollution from domestic sources port shipyard and a large petrochemical complex fig 3 colombo et al 1989 the lower turbidity of this low energy inner environment coupled to the discharge of urban effluents promote algae blooms resulting in highest chl a records temperature is also anomalously high in this area reflecting the reduced water movement and the contribution of cooling waters from industrial facilities this impacted lp harbour signature is progressively diluted along the port channel while turbidity increases offshore especially at the channel mouth due to local resuspension these results are consistent with previous reports which highlighted the severe anthropogenic impact produced by the discharge sewage outfalls and polluted streams like the riachuelo river along the argentine coast resulting in exponential offshore decreases of hydrocarbons pcbs and trace metals in bottom sediments colombo et al 2005a 2005b tatone et al 2009 this anthropogenic influence is reflected by higher conductivity records along the south shore and outside the port channel fig 1 in the middle section of the transects more typical conditions of the paraná river are observed with lower conductivity higher turbidity and ph similar to values reported for the delta puig et al 2015 in the northern extreme of the transects the influence of the uruguay river is detected by the decrease of conductivity and turbidity and increase of ph comparable to values measured 400 km upstream the uruguay river colombo et al 2015 these decreasing gradients of conductivity and turbidity coupled to the rapid drop of cdom are good tracers of the reduction of the impact of coastal discharges and the transition between paraná and uruguay river waters another useful tracer of this transition is the grain size composition of spm with coarser material along the south and middle sections of the rlp influenced by the paraná river and a finer distribution to the north specially of the finest 0 98 µm fraction predominant in the uruguay river fig 3 insert due to a higher variability chl a do not display such consistent spatial patterns in transect ii the northward increase of this parameter appear to reflect an increasing influence of the more eutrophic uruguay river however in transect iii the highest chl a records are observed on the south possibly reflecting the detection of discharge pulses from the eutrophic la plata harbour this reversed chl a pattern would be facilitated by the reduced influence of uruguay river which had lower flow rates at that time 2218 254 vs 5000 m3 s 1 average module cammesa 2020 in spite of the contradictory trends of chl a concentrations the transition from the detrital influence of the paraná to the fresher pigment signal of the uruguay river was captured by the phaeo ratios in transect iii effectively the south central sector shows a degraded pigment signal phaeo 17 comparable to values reported for the turbidity maximum zone of different world estuaries e g 15 18 in the ems and scheldt lemaire et al 2002 whereas in the northern sector the phaeo ratios show a 4 times drop multivariate analysis successfully grouped the continuous readings into discrete clusters based on their similarities and identified the parameters driving the south north transition in the principal component analysis ph conductivity and turbidity pc1 explained the transition from la plata inner harbour waters to the open rlp for transects i and ii temperature chl a and turbidity pc2 explained the cross sectional transition of the rlp the contribution of turbidity is particularly relevant since it reflects the higher spm content of paraná de las palmas waters flowing along the south shore relative to the less turbid uruguay river the addition of cdom to the analysis in transect iii supports the characterization of this transition from lp inner harbour waters to the rlp and also contributes to explain the south north transition between paraná uruguay river waters historic measurements of dissolved organic carbon performed by the wet digestion method in both rivers effectively indicated values twice as large for the paraná river 6 8 7 4 vs 3 4 mg l 1 in the ur mañosa and depetris 1993 cataldo et al 2001 the k means analysis allowed to identify different water corridors south central and north fig 4 with variable width according to the influence of tributaries discharge and river conditions i e tides winds in transect iii a transitional corridor having intermediate water characteristics between the central and north corridors is identified an analogous transitional corridor was previously inferred by computational modelling for normal low paraná river discharge and high uruguay river flow simionato et al 2009 overall in situ high resolution multiparameter data identified the corridors of flow in the rlp which are globally consistent with numerical modelling results jaime and menéndez 2002 piedra cueva and fossati 2007 simionato et al 2009 fig 4 and table s5 conductivity cdom turbidity and suspended sediment grain size composition are the best indicators to characterize the cross sectional variability of upper rlp waters an additional contribution of the high resolution multivariate data is the consistent tracing of a previously unidentified coastal corridor integrating the impact of metropolitan buenos aires and la plata city the distinctive cdom conductivity signature of this corridor is traced 100 km downstream with additional point source contributions from la plata magdalena sewage outfalls fig 5 at magdalena the buñirigo stream affected by tanneries and meat processing activities rodrigues capítulo et al 2001 stars in fig 1 also contributes to these point sources the direct covariation of cdom and conductivity with synchronic peaks coinciding with a parallel decrease of turbidity is a clear signature of local polluted discharges as is also observed in la plata inner harbour waters the consistent delimitation of this southern coastal corridor suggests a reduced cross mixing of rlp waters probably reinforced by the strong ebb tide and low ne winds during the cruise future studies are needed to evaluate the transport and eventual mixing of this corridor along the river marine transition until its final discharge to the sea 5 conclusions the combined approach of high resolution water quality monitoring combined with multivariate analysis techniques allowed a detailed characterization of the corridors of flow and the anthropogenic impact in the upper río de la plata estuary marked changes of water characteristics were registered in major tributaries with coarser suspended sediment and a detrital pigment signature in the paraná river compared to a finer and fresher signal in the uruguay river these hydrochemical signatures were tracked 60 km downstream across the river the south north decreasing trends of conductivity turbidity coloured dissolved organic matter suspended particulate matter grain size composition and pigment degradation reflected the transition from paraná to uruguay river waters multivariate techniques also allowed the identification of a polluted coastal corridor along the south shore integrating the urban industrial discharges from buenos aires la plata metropolitan area the signature of this coastal corridor was tracked 100 km seaward to a protected ramsar site i e the samborombón bay this work represents the first attempt to comprehensively characterize the corridors of flow including previously
