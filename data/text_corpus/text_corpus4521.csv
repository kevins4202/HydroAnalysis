22605,in the current study experimental tests are conducted to evaluate the hydrodynamic characteristics and the bottom wetted surfaces of the planing hulls equipped by one transverse step for this purpose total resistance dynamic trim angle dynamic sinkage reattachment lengths of the separated flow and forebody and aftbody wetted areas are quantitatively measured at different geometrical parameters of the step and hull velocities moreover the bottom wetted surfaces are qualitatively investigated by analyzing the underwater photographs our experimental results are also compared by archival data with good accordance based on our experimental observations dynamic trim angle and dynamic sinkage are enhanced by increasing in the height of the step and decreasing the longitudinal position of step from transom however lower total resistance is achieved for greater height of the step in addition total wetted area is enhanced by decreasing the step height and hull velocity however larger total wetted area is detected by an increase in the longitudinal distance of the step from transom finally we formulated the wetted areas of one step planing hull according to the reattached flow patterns keywords experimental study planing hull transverse step wetted surface 1 introduction hydrodynamics lift force of the high speed craft is a determinative parameter to attain high speeds by overcoming their weight doctors 1985 by increasing the speed of the high speed craft their drag to lift ratio will be increased one of the effective strategic solutions to improve the drag to lift ratio of high speed craft is using transverse step in their hulls stepped planing craft using step on the bottom of planing hulls will cause the flow separation at the step region re attach at aftbody location and it will accomplish a decrease in the wetted area this happen may lead to decrease in drag to lift ratio of high speed craft moreover transverse steps bring about more uniform pressure distribution on the bottom of planing hull which may provide more longitudinally stability savitsky and morabito 2010 hydrodynamics performance of stepped planing craft is dependent on the wetted bottom pattern and area which may be related to the height and longitudinal position of the step froude number and etc therefore study of the wetted surfaces of stepped planing hulls is a precondition for achieving an efficient stepped planing craft several experimental and numerical studies are done on hydrodynamic behavior of planing craft pioneering investigation on drag and flow pattern around the high speed planing hull is related to blount and clement experimental study blount and clement 1963 then savitsky 1964 conducted a reference experimental work on wedge like hulls he proposed semi empirical formulation to predict of drag and lift forces for without step planing craft brizzolara and serra brizzolara and serra 2007 studied the drag and lift forces of planing surface by cfd analysis their numerical results were in good accordance with experimental data of savitsky 1964 and shuford 1958 effect of whisker spray on total drag of planing craft was studied experimentally and analytically by savitsky et al 2007 in 2010 savitsky and morabito 2010 experimentally investigated the aftbody surface wake profiles of simple prismatic planing hull they suggested empirical formulation to predict the centerline and ¼ beam wake profiles they also presented some details about the bottom wetted surface for one step planing craft recently seo et al 2016 investigated total resistance and sea keeping of a planing hull using wave piercing and spray rails experimentally hydrodynamics characteristic of trimaran planing craft under different froude number were studied experimentally and numerically by jiang et al 2016 de marco et al de marco et al 2017 studied the flow pattern and hydrodynamic behavior of one step planing craft both experimentally and numerically cucinotta et al 2017 experimentally indicated the positive effects of artificial air cavity on drag reduction of planing craft for more detail some archival works related to study on geometrical parameters of the step in stepped planing hull are presented in table 1 according to the cited works the lack of study on detail of bottom wetted surfaces of the stepped planing hulls is evident in addition the effect of different geometrical parameters of the step on the bottom wetted pattern is not well known so far therefore the main purpose of the current paper is to study the effects of different height of the step and longitudinal distance of the step from transom and hull velocity on the detail of the wetted surface of stepped planing hulls to this accomplishment bottom wetted surface of stepped fridsma planing hull models is experimentally studied by analyzing the reattachment length of the separated flow and forebody and aftbody wetted areas the remainder of present paper is organized as follows in section 2 experimental setup and physical model are presented experimental results are discussed in section 3 section 4 is also provided for conclusions 2 experimental setup in the current study according to ittc guidelines ittc 2002 committee 2002 all experimental tests are done in the towing tank of national iranian marine laboratory nimala tehran iran specification of nimala towing tank is shown in table 2 based on our previous studies najafi et al 2018a 2018b nowruzi and najafi 2019 calm water condition with no wave is used for water fluid where water temperature density and kinematic viscosity have fixed value of 293 15 k 1002 kg m3 and 1 19e 6 m2 s respectively according to dynamic and geometrical similarities criteria fridsma planing hull model is chosen in order to determine the dimensions of hull model the remarks of maximum froude number and blockage factor are considered to assessment of the blockage factor we evaluated the maximal cross sectional area of the hull model ax per the sectional area of the towing tank a geometrical scale factor is λ 8 as follows 1 m a x a 0 156 24 0 0065 0 1 as may be seen in eq 1 where the blockage factor is remarkably lower than the 0 1 the effects of towing tank walls on the model is negligible table 3 is presented for the main geometrical dimensions of full scale and hull model without any transverse step i e which has been used as the basic model for embedding the transverse step on it and considered test cases for one step planing craft as may be seen in table 3 we designed experimental tests in such a way that different investigation on the geometrical parameters of the step can be provided with minimum number of lab tests fig 1 shows the schematic of intended fridsma model i e prototype of without transverse step model and fabricated one step planing craft conducted towing tests are tabulated in table 3 hull model is fabricated by three separate parts of forebody module aftbody module and connecting block fore body module as integrated structure is fabricated by fiberglass composite material connecting block is fabricated by high strength teflon and it is used to connect the forebody module to aftbody module see fig 2 aftbody module has multi movable blocks in order to change the longitudinal position and height of the step one of these blocks is cg block with six polyvinyl chloride pvc sections to adjust the center of gravity see fig 3 a another block as transom block is also embedded at the end of the aftbody module for placement of ballast weights see fig 3 b other blocks of aftbody module have middle section made of pvc and outer section made of teflon a block of aftbody after the assembly is presented in fig 4 all parts of the hull model are made based on the ittc tolerances proceduresittc recommended 2011 and then displacement weight of the constructed model is adjusted maximum of measured geometrical fabrication error of the hull model for deadrise 20 and 30 are equal to 1 19 mm and 0 92 mm three different location of the step is also depicted in fig 5 continued the experimental results of the reattached length of the separated flow and the bottom wetted surfaces areas are presented and discussed 3 results and discussion 3 1 resistance dynamic trim and sinkage first experimental results of dynamic trim angle total trim angle non dimensional forms of total resistance rt and dynamic sinkage zv are presented in table 4 as may be seen in table 4 dynamic trim angle total trim angle and dynamic sinkage are decreased by an enhancement in hull velocity however total resistance is enhanced by an increase in hull velocity moreover dynamic trim angle total trim angle and dynamic sinkage are increased by an enhancement in the height of the step while lower total resistance is achieved for greater height of the step in addition dynamic trim angle total trim angle and dynamic sinkage are decreased and total resistance is increased by increasing the longitudinal position of step from transom according to our obtained experimental results please see table 4 increase of the hs and decrease of the ls is one of the strategies to reduce the total resistance however the interval of appropriate changes on these geometrical parameters should be determined in proportion to any particular type of stepped planing craft 3 2 reattachment length and wetted areas schematic of the bottom wetted surfaces of the one step planing hull and the main geometrical parameters of the reattachment length of the separated flow are shown in fig 6 as may be seen in fig 6 the ls is the longitudinal location of the step from transom and lk1 and lk2 are forebody and aftbody wetted keel lengths respectively moreover l c is the wetted chine length and x c l is the distance of reattached length of the separated flow from the step on centerline and x 1 4 is the distance of reattached length of separated flow from the step on the line of ¼ hull beam the parameters of s w f o r e and s w a f t are representative of forebody and aftbody wetted area respectively as may be seen in fig 6 two main wetted regions are recognizable at the bottom of stepped planing hulls with one transverse step the first triangular shape region is located before the step that initiates from the stagnation points of water surface with bottom of the planing hull and two stagnation lines of this region will be ended to the fore body spray line another wetted region is located after the step and it is started from reattachment point of the separated flow on the step the pattern of this region corresponds to the step location step height hull velocity deadrise angle and etc in the present study the reattachment length and wetted area are precisely calculated by measuring our recorded experimental underwater images via solidworks package it is also notable that the used camera has 720 1280 resolution with frame rate of 30 fps pictograph of some experimental underwater images measured and analyzed by solidworks is also presented in fig 7 reattachment length pattern of wetted surfaces and wetted areas are illustrated in fig 7 as may be seen in fig 7 a the stagnation lines of forebody wetted surface are crossed from chine sides and smaller aftbody wetted area is achieved at higher hull velocity fig 7 b shows remarkable effects of ls on the pattern of aftbody wetted surface so that as the ls increases local region of aftbody wetted surface is distributed across the hull beam and it is intersected the side chine pattern of forebody and aftbody wetted area under different height of the step is also depicted in fig 7 c forebody angles of projected stagnation line α s l f o r e and spray edge α w s f o r e and aftbody angles of projected stagnation line α s l aft and spray edge α w s aft are measured as defined in begovic and bertorello 2012 for more details please see figs 6 and 7 in ref begovic and bertorello 2012 experimental results of forebody and aftbody angles of projected stagnation line and spray edge are presented in table 5 as may be seen in table 5 α s l f o r e and α w s f o r e are increased by an enhancement in hs and ls values of α s l aft and α w s aft are also decreased by increasing the hs and decreasing the ls experimental results of non dimensional form i e based on displacement volume of reattachment length forebody wetted area aftbody wetted area and total wetted areas for conducted test cases are tabulated in table 6 in addition our experimental results of reattachment length and aftbody wetted area are compared by results extracted from savitsky and morabito 2010 empirical formulation and we obtained the differences as may be seen in table 7 the maximum difference on reattachment length x c l and aftbody wetted area s w a f t are obtained 10 544 and 24 887 respectively for more detail experimental results of reattachment length x c l at different hull velocities longitudinal locations of the step from transom ls and heights of the step hs is presented in fig 8 as may be seen in fig 8 for all the tested cases x c l is enhanced by an increase in the hull velocity and heights of step however there isn t any regular trend on the growth of x c l by increasing the ls indeed fig 8 b shows the different effects of ls on the reattachment length of separated flow on step under various heights of the step fig 9 shows the effects of different hull velocities longitudinal locations of the step from transom ls and heights of step hs on the parameter of forebody wetted area s w f o r e based on fig 9 as hull velocity increases s w f o r e is decreased indeed the planing hull more exit from the water by increasing the hull velocity and it will be resulted to decrease of forebody wetted area an enhancement in ls also brings about the forebody wetted area decrement while an irregular trend on the value of s w f o r e is detected by an increase in the hs as may be seen in fig 10 s w a f t is decreased by increasing the hull velocity that is related to higher reattachment length of the separated flow at upper hull velocity based on fig 10 b as the ls increase s w a f t is remarkably increased and fig 10 c shows a decrease in s w a f t by increasing the height of step from 10 mm to 20 mm while s w a f t is enhanced by increasing the height of step from 20 mm to 30 mm fig 11 shows that the total wetted area s w t o t a l is increased by an enhancement in the ls moreover s w t o t a l is decreased by increasing the hull velocity and hs indeed as the hull velocity and hs are decreased and the ls is increased an increase in the s w t o t a l as representative of stepped planing hull resistance is achieved it is notable that in all tested cases trim angle is obtained lower than 4 5 3 3 morphology classification and formulation of wetted surfaces fig 12 shows some underwater images of formed wetted surfaces on the bottom of stepped planing hull using one transverse step as illustrated in fig 12 two main wetted regions are formed on the bottom of stepped planing craft using one transverse step lateral spray sheets separated from side chine is also detectable for both forebody and aftbody wetted surfaces typical top view of aftbody wetted area in case of β 30 ls 800 mm hs 20 mm 8 7 m s is also presented in fig 13 however necessity of comprehensive experimental tests on different planing hull forms is evident for determination of these specified intervals as stated before the wetted area is significantly depended on the hull and step dimensions wetted length of the keel trim angle hull velocity and etc variation of the wetted surfaces is remarkably effective on the lift force and stability of planing craft total wetted areas after planing of one step planing craft is the summation of aftbody and forebody wetted areas as follows 2 s w t o t a l s w a f t s w f o r e where we have two scenarios for s w f o r e as follows if flow spray line stagnation line crossing from the corners of the step the forebody wetted area is 3 s w f o r e 0 5 b l k if flow spray line stagnation line crossing from side chine before the step the forebody wetted area is 4 s w f o r e b 2 l c l k here l c is the wetted chine length on the other hands there are four scenarios for s w a f t according to x 1 4 in table 8 in case of one step planing craft possible scenarios of formation of aftbody wetted surfaces are categorized in addition aftbody wetted areas are formulated according to the distance of reattached length of the separated flow from th e step on the line of ¼ i e x 1 4 4 conclusion stepped planing craft are considered as interesting planing hull in maritime industries proper knowledge on the bottom wetted surface of these craft has remarkable role to advance their design in this study hydrodynamic characteristics and wetted surfaces of stepped planing craft are evaluated via experimental towing tests for this purpose total resistance dynamic trim angle dynamic sinkage quantitative parameters of reattachment length of the separated flow and wetted area are measured and qualitative criteria of wetted surface pattern is investigated via underwater photographs under three step heights three distance of the step from transom three hull velocities and two deadrise angles according to our experimental results dynamic trim angle total trim angle and dynamic sinkage are increased by an enhancement in the height of the step hs and by decreasing the longitudinal distance of step from transom ls however lower total resistance is obtained for greater hs and smaller ls moreover for all tested cases total wetted areas are reduced by decreasing the ls in addition increase of the hs and hull velocity is resulted to reduce of total wetted areas appropriately accordance is also achieved between our experimental results of reattachment length and aftbody wetted area against the extracted results from savitsky and morabito 2010 empirical formulation finally we categorized and formulated the bottom wetted areas of planing hulls with one transverse step according to different reattached patterns of the separated flow the present paper merits future works study on the wetted surfaces of two steps planing craft at different geometrical parameters of the steps can be regarded as future investigation in addition implementation of comprehensive experimental tests on different geometrical properties of transverse step for presentation a formulation to correlate the measure wetted surfaces with the properties of the step can be considered in future works conflicts of interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interests

weights see fig 3 b other blocks of aftbody module have middle section made of pvc and outer section made of teflon a block of aftbody after the assembly is presented in fig 4 all parts of the hull model are made based on the ittc tolerances proceduresittc recommended 2011 and then displacement weight of the constructed model is adjusted maximum of measured geometrical fabrication error of the hull model for deadrise 20 and 30 are equal to 1 19 mm and 0 92 mm three different location of the step is also depicted in fig 5 continued the experimental results of the reattached length of the separated flow and the bottom wetted surfaces areas are presented and discussed 3 results and discussion 3 1 resistance dynamic trim and sinkage first experimental results of dynamic trim angle total trim angle non dimensional forms of total resistance rt and dynamic sinkage zv are presented in table 4 as may be seen in table 4 dynamic trim angle total trim angle and dynamic sinkage are decreased by an enhancement in hull velocity however total resistance is enhanced by an increase in hull velocity moreover dynamic trim angle total trim angle and dynamic sinkage are increased by an enhancement in the height of the step while lower total resistance is achieved for greater height of the step in addition dynamic trim angle total trim angle and dynamic sinkage are decreased and total resistance is increased by increasing the longitudinal position of step from transom according to our obtained experimental results please see table 4 increase of the hs and decrease of the ls is one of the strategies to reduce the total resistance however the interval of appropriate changes on these geometrical parameters should be determined in proportion to any particular type of stepped planing craft 3 2 reattachment length and wetted areas schematic of the bottom wetted surfaces of the one step planing hull and the main geometrical parameters of the reattachment length of the separated flow are shown in fig 6 as may be seen in fig 6 the ls is the longitudinal location of the step from transom and lk1 and lk2 are forebody and aftbody wetted keel lengths respectively moreover l c is the wetted chine length and x c l is the distance of reattached length of the separated flow from the step on centerline and x 1 4 is the distance of reattached length of separated flow from the step on the line of ¼ hull beam the parameters of s w f o r e and s w a f t are representative of forebody and aftbody wetted area respectively as may be seen in fig 6 two main wetted regions are recognizable at the bottom of stepped planing hulls with one transverse step the first triangular shape region is located before the step that initiates from the stagnation points of water surface with bottom of the planing hull and two stagnation lines of this region will be ended to the fore body spray line another wetted region is located after the step and it is started from reattachment point of the separated flow on the step the pattern of this region corresponds to the step location step height hull velocity deadrise angle and etc in the present study the reattachment length and wetted area are precisely calculated by measuring our recorded experimental underwater images via solidworks package it is also notable that the used camera has 720 1280 resolution with frame rate of 30 fps pictograph of some experimental underwater images measured and analyzed by solidworks is also presented in fig 7 reattachment length pattern of wetted surfaces and wetted areas are illustrated in fig 7 as may be seen in fig 7 a the stagnation lines of forebody wetted surface are crossed from chine sides and smaller aftbody wetted area is achieved at higher hull velocity fig 7 b shows remarkable effects of ls on the pattern of aftbody wetted surface so that as the ls increases local region of aftbody wetted surface is distributed across the hull beam and it is intersected the side chine pattern of forebody and aftbody wetted area under different height of the step is also depicted in fig 7 c forebody angles of projected stagnation line α s l f o r e and spray edge α w s f o r e and aftbody angles of projected stagnation line α s l aft and spray edge α w s aft are measured as defined in begovic and bertorello 2012 for more details please see figs 6 and 7 in ref begovic and bertorello 2012 experimental results of forebody and aftbody angles of projected stagnation line and spray edge are presented in table 5 as may be seen in table 5 α s l f o r e and α w s f o r e are increased by an enhancement in hs and ls values of α s l aft and α w s aft are also decreased by increasing the hs and decreasing the ls experimental results of non dimensional form i e based on displacement volume of reattachment length forebody wetted area aftbody wetted area and total wetted areas for conducted test cases are tabulated in table 6 in addition our experimental results of reattachment length and aftbody wetted area are compared by results extracted from savitsky and morabito 2010 empirical formulation and we obtained the differences as may be seen in table 7 the maximum difference on reattachment length x c l and aftbody wetted area s w a f t are obtained 10 544 and 24 887 respectively for more detail experimental results of reattachment length x c l at different hull velocities longitudinal locations of the step from transom ls and heights of the step hs is presented in fig 8 as may be seen in fig 8 for all the tested cases x c l is enhanced by an increase in the hull velocity and heights of step however there isn t any regular trend on the growth of x c l by increasing the ls indeed fig 8 b shows the different effects of ls on the reattachment length of separated flow on step under various heights of the step fig 9 shows the effects of different hull velocities longitudinal locations of the step from transom ls and heights of step hs on the parameter of forebody wetted area s w f o r e based on fig 9 as hull velocity increases s w f o r e is decreased indeed the planing hull more exit from the water by increasing the hull velocity and it will be resulted to decrease of forebody wetted area an enhancement in ls also brings about the forebody wetted area decrement while an irregular trend on the value of s w f o r e is detected by an increase in the hs as may be seen in fig 10 s w a f t is decreased by increasing the hull velocity that is related to higher reattachment length of the separated flow at upper hull velocity based on fig 10 b as the ls increase s w a f t is remarkably increased and fig 10 c shows a decrease in s w a f t by increasing the height of step from 10 mm to 20 mm while s w a f t is enhanced by increasing the height of step from 20 mm to 30 mm fig 11 shows that the total wetted area s w t o t a l is increased by an enhancement in the ls moreover s w t o t a l is decreased by increasing the hull velocity and hs indeed as the hull velocity and hs are decreased and the ls is increased an increase in the s w t o t a l as representative of stepped planing hull resistance is achieved it is notable that in all tested cases trim angle is obtained lower than 4 5 3 3 morphology classification and formulation of wetted surfaces fig 12 shows some underwater images of formed wetted surfaces on the bottom of stepped planing hull using one transverse step as illustrated in fig 12 two main wetted regions are formed on the bottom of stepped planing craft using one transverse step lateral spray sheets separated from side chine is also detectable for both forebody and aftbody wetted surfaces typical top view of aftbody wetted area in case of β 30 ls 800 mm hs 20 mm 8 7 m s is also presented in fig 13 however necessity of comprehensive experimental tests on different planing hull forms is evident for determination of these specified intervals as stated before the wetted area is significantly depended on the hull and step dimensions wetted length of the keel trim angle hull velocity and etc variation of the wetted surfaces is remarkably effective on the lift force and stability of planing craft total wetted areas after planing of one step planing craft is the summation of aftbody and forebody wetted areas as follows 2 s w t o t a l s w a f t s w f o r e where we have two scenarios for s w f o r e as follows if flow spray line stagnation line crossing from the corners of the step the forebody wetted area is 3 s w f o r e 0 5 b l k if flow spray line stagnation line crossing from side chine before the step the forebody wetted area is 4 s w f o r e b 2 l c l k here l c is the wetted chine length on the other hands there are four scenarios for s w a f t according to x 1 4 in table 8 in case of one step planing craft possible scenarios of formation of aftbody wetted surfaces are categorized in addition aftbody wetted areas are formulated according to the distance of reattached length of the separated flow from th e step on the line of ¼ i e x 1 4 4 conclusion stepped planing craft are considered as interesting planing hull in maritime industries proper knowledge on the bottom wetted surface of these craft has remarkable role to advance their design in this study hydrodynamic characteristics and wetted surfaces of stepped planing craft are evaluated via experimental towing tests for this purpose total resistance dynamic trim angle dynamic sinkage quantitative parameters of reattachment length of the separated flow and wetted area are measured and qualitative criteria of wetted surface pattern is investigated via underwater photographs under three step heights three distance of the step from transom three hull velocities and two deadrise angles according to our experimental results dynamic trim angle total trim angle and dynamic sinkage are increased by an enhancement in the height of the step hs and by decreasing the longitudinal distance of step from transom ls however lower total resistance is obtained for greater hs and smaller ls moreover for all tested cases total wetted areas are reduced by decreasing the ls in addition increase of the hs and hull velocity is resulted to reduce of total wetted areas appropriately accordance is also achieved between our experimental results of reattachment length and aftbody wetted area against the extracted results from savitsky and morabito 2010 empirical formulation finally we categorized and formulated the bottom wetted areas of planing hulls with one transverse step according to different reattached patterns of the separated flow the present paper merits future works study on the wetted surfaces of two steps planing craft at different geometrical parameters of the steps can be regarded as future investigation in addition implementation of comprehensive experimental tests on different geometrical properties of transverse step for presentation a formulation to correlate the measure wetted surfaces with the properties of the step can be considered in future works conflicts of interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interests

22606,procedures for carrying out the manoeuvring tests presented in international maritime organisation imo resolution msc 137 76 are based on the capabilities of ships with conventional steering propulsion systems therefore they do not correspond to ships with other steering propulsion devices like pod drives imo is aware of this shortcoming and for ships with non conventional steering and propulsion system may permit the use of comparative steering angles to the rudder angles specified by the resolution to elaborate these comparative angles for pod driven gas carrier experiments with free sailing manned model have been carried out for comparison two sister ships have been taken into consideration i e twin pod and twin propeller twin rudder configurations for both ship versions manoeuvres according to standard imo procedures have been carried out for twin pod configuration additionally manoeuvres with various pod propulsor settings have been performed to find the comparative i e rudder equivalent pod propulsor angles results show an obvious fact that for twin pod ship version similar results of standard manoeuvre parameters as for twin propeller twin rudder version are obtained for other than imo recommended 35 steering angle it is shown that for turning circle parameters a single comparative or rudder equivalent angle does not exist various turning circle parameters are obtained for different pod propulsor angles keywords ship manoeuvring pod propulsion imo standard manoeuvring tests free running model tests manned model 1 introduction majority of ships have to satisfy manoeuvring standards issued by the international maritime organisation elaboration of these standards was initiated in 1960 s and published as a final resolution with explanatory notes in 2002 international maritime organization 2002 testing procedures presented in these documents are based on analysis of manoeuvring abilities of ships especially with insufficient turning and course keeping abilities however to prepare the rules and requirements regarding standard manoeuvring tests only ships with conventional propeller rudder systems were taken into consideration therefore as shipbuilding industry is rather conservative designers and researchers applied the imo manoeuvring standards to pod driven ships with some suspicions reichel 2017 in case of pod driven ships the practice of applying the same steering angles as for ships with conventional steering propulsion system during manoeuvring tests might be for different reasons questioned experiments with similar ships equipped with either conventional unit or pod propulsion unit have been conducted to compare manoeuvring abilities of those ships toxopeus and loeff 2002 it was concluded that turning ability of the specific ship with pod propulsors which was investigated is better than the one with conventional propeller rudder arrangement on the other hand it was shown that imo standards could be satisfied already for much smaller pod steering angles similar research about differences of manoeuvring abilities of ships with conventional rudders and pod drives is presented in the case of fast ro pax ship woodward et al 2002 first of all results of turning circle tests present an evident fact that the podded ship shows some improvements over the classical arrangement furthermore to reach the same turning circle parameters helm angles are definitely smaller for pod propulsors than for classic rudders however no quantitative analysis of those angles is provided comparable qualitative results of model tests of a generic frigate with twin tractor pods is presented by ball 2004 one of the conclusion was that for certain froude number both the tactical diameter and speed loss in steady turn for integrate hull pod frigate with 25 pod azimuth angle were similar to that for conventional frigate with a 35 rudder angle as a consequence smaller pod propulsor deflection angles will minimise the risk of high loads on the pod housings especially during first phase of turning circle the forces on pod propulsors might be even as much as twice larger than during the steady phase woodward et al 2009 and therefore result in failures and damages other reason for questioning the imo standard steering angles especially for fast and slender ships could be minimising the risk of large heel angles during turning circles heel angles during turning especially in the first phase of turn might reach large betancourt 2003 or extremely large values of up to 30 toxopeus and loeff 2002 the reason of such phenomena might be the differences in hull shape between conventional and pod driven sister ships much higher steering rates for pods than for rudders or simply different metacentric height these factors are inseparable from the pod driven ship design and as such cannot be redesigned the main reason for huge difference in maximum heel angle for certain type of ships is much larger steering force initiated by the pods than by rudders a brief comparison of forces generated by pod propulsors and comparable rudders is presented by toxopeus and loeff 2002 the analysis was done for bollard pull conditions but it clearly shows the differences in longitudinal and lateral forces generated by both steering devices as the transverse force generated by pod propulsors in open water conditions is almost independent of the advance coefficient grygorowicz and szantyr 2004 reichel 2007 it may be concluded that the same applies to the behind hull conditions it should be underlined that the applicability of the imo criteria as such is not questioned in this paper the imo criteria can be applied directly as they provide equivalent information about the manoeuvring response of pod driven ships as for conventionally propelled ships woodward et al 2009 the main objective of the paper was to show that although the angles on pod propulsors are smaller than those required by imo for turning circle the manoeuvring criteria are met and therefore the requirement of 35 of steering device for pod driven ships is not necessary second objective was to show for which pod propulsor angles the pod driven ship response might be similar to the response of sister ship with conventional steering propulsion system theses so called equivalent angles i e pod propulsor angles for which these responses are identical in terms of different manoeuvring characteristics are found and discussed some preliminary results of this investigation have already been presented in reichel 2018 2 model tests a model of an lng carrier built for ship handling training purposes was used for described research the model has been built to a scale 1 24 in three sister ship versions with replaceable stern parts the available versions are single propeller single rudder twin propeller twin rudder and twin pod with pulling propellers during the presented research those versions with two propellers have been used for experiments during the tests manned model fully equipped for ship handling training was used it was equipped with classic engine telegraph and wheel for twin propeller twin rudder version and angle thrust joysticks for twin pod version model tests have been divided into three stages first when both ship versions have been checked according to imo standard procedure second when proposed manoeuvres with twin pod version have been carried out for various different than imo recommended steering device angles third when manoeuvring tests have been carried out for pod propulsor deflections equal to equivalent angles determined after second stage of tests 2 1 imo standard manoeuvres procedure the standards for ship manoeuvrability have been adopted by international maritime organization 2002 and are the governing regulations for ships of all rudder and propulsion types of 100 m in length and over and chemical tankers and gas carriers regardless of the length regarding the test parameters that relate to steering device settings the standards say turning circle manoeuvre is the manoeuvre to be performed to both starboard and port with 35 rudder angle or the maximum rudder angle permissible at the test speed following a steady approach with zero yaw rate the 10 10 zig zag test is performed by turning the rudder alternately by 10 to either side following a heading deviation of 10 from the original heading in accordance with the following procedure 1 after a steady approach with zero yaw rate the rudder is put over to 10 to starboard or port first execute 2 when the heading has changed to 10 off the original heading the rudder is reversed to 10 to port or starboard second execute and 3 after the rudder has been turned to port starboard the ship will continue turning in the original direction with decreasing turning rate in response to the rudder the ship should then turn to port starboard when the ship has reached a heading of 10 to port starboard of the original course the rudder is again reversed to 10 to starboard port third execute the 20 20 zig zag test is performed using the procedure given above using 20 rudder angles and 20 change of heading instead of 10 rudder angles and 10 change of heading respectively it has to be noted that these procedures have been developed for and on the basis of ships with conventional steering and propulsion systems the value of 35 steering angle opposite to the conventional rudders does not therefore mean much in the case of pod propulsors it is also not possible to define the maximum angle for non conventional steering propulsion devices as they can produce the steering force in any of 360 directions therefore the presented paper focuses on the turning circle standard test as in this case i e for larger steering angles much more might be said about differences between hydrodynamics of pods and rudders 2 2 specifics on model tests all tests for both propulsion arrangement configurations have been carried out for approach speed of around 1 26 m s which corresponds to 12 knots in full scale the tests have been carried out in april june and september 2018 at an open air station at ship handling research and training centre near ilawa in poland the lake is 59 ha large and provides unique opportunity to check manoeuvring abilities of ships both on deep and shallow water programme of model tests is shown in table 1 first stage of experiments covered tests carried out according to standard imo procedure including spiral pull out turning and zig zag tests while the second stage additional turning and zig zag tests with various pod drive angles the tested models were equipped with gps system with rtk reference station owned by ship handling research and training centre what gives nominal position monitoring accuracy of 10 mm the heading was measured with the use of gyrocompass with 0 1 accuracy it should be noted that both the approach speed the course of the model and the course changes were set manually i e by a experienced helmsman 2 3 investigated ship the investigated lng carrier is in full scale about 270 m long and has the capacity of 160 000 cubic metres principal dimensions of the model versions are shown in table 2 in figs 1 and 2 shape of stern part of tested models is presented it has to be noted that both versions have been designed according to the best knowledge to achieve the compromise between propulsion and manoeuvring abilities as a consequence the stern part of both ship versions differ slightly between each other almost all of the differences are above the water e g for accommodation of steering gears however some minor odds might be seen on the underwater transom part including the length of rudder head boxes this may influence for instance roll response during manoeuvring but should not change the overall conclusions on the equivalent manoeuvres it should be mentioned that in case of twin propeller twin rudder configuration the aft perpendicular is on the rudder stock and in case of twin pod configuration on the propulsors vertical axis 3 model test results first of all in case of both ship versions the spiral curve has been carried out to identify the first iteration of equivalent angles later on pull out manoeuvre was carried out as additional test to check the twin pod version course instability at the end of the first and during the second stage of tests a set of turning circle and zig zag tests presented in table 1 has been carried out results of both stages are however combined to show the overall tendency and to clearly show the described hydrodynamic phenomena 3 1 spiral curve in fig 3 the spiral curves for both ship versions are presented difference in course stability for both tested ship versions is visible the reversed spiral curve for the twin pod version has not been carried out but based on previous experience an instability loop width of around 6 might be predicted it is noted that for twin propeller twin rudder version the spiral curve is very steep in the range 5 5 from the angle of around 5 the difference in rate of turns between tested ship versions increases and for 35 steering angle the rate of turn for twin pod version is 50 higher than for twin propeller twin rudder version from fig 3 it might be stated that the values of rate of turn for twin propeller twin rudder ship for rudder angles larger than 35 have been extrapolated according to the third order polynomial based on the spiral curve this extrapolation does not take any hydrodynamic principles into account and is simply hypothetical to show how much the rudder angle should increase to match the equivalent pod angles furthermore it cannot be expected that all the analysed manoeuvring characteristics defined by imo like turning diameter advance in turning circle and overshoot angles will have the same or even similar correlation 3 2 pull out test as the spiral test results show that the twin pod version is course unstable the pull out test have been carried out to confirm this phenomenon fig 4 shows the results of pull out test done with twin pod version it is clearly seen that indeed this ship version has some degree of inherent instability 3 3 turning circle in figs 5 and 6 the turning circle test results are shown for starboard sb and portside ps respectively in standard non dimensional form these figures present both the turning circles done according to imo standard 35 of rudder pod deflections and for other steering angles used to determine the equivalent pod propulsor angles in both figures the trajectory of twin propeller twin rudder ship centre of gravity is marked as dashed line and trajectory of twin pod ship centre of gravity as solid lines 3 4 zig zag manoeuvre in figs 7 10 the results of standard zig zag tests carried out with both tested ship versions have been presented similar to trajectories from figs 5 and 6 in case of zig zags the rudder angle and corresponding heading angle have been marked as dashed line while pod angles and corresponding heading angle as solid lines it might be seen that the differences in overshoot angles between twin propeller twin rudder and twin pod versions are small both for 10 10 and 20 20 zig zag tests however the time of response in the tests with twin propeller twin rudder version is longer than in case of twin pod version in figs 11 and 12 together with standard zig zag tests 10 10 and 20 20 for twin pod version the results of an additional zig zag 15 15 have been presented results of this test have been taken into consideration when identifying the equivalent angles for initial turning ability and overshoot angle from 20 20 test 4 results on rudder equivalent pod propulsor angles test the second stage of the experiments have been done with the twin pod model version only several turning circle tests and zig zag manoeuvres have been carried out to find the equivalent angles the tests were started with steering angles equal to recommended by imo and later on continued with different values until similar manoeuvring characteristics as in the first stage for twin propeller twin rudder version have been achieved figs 13 18 show the equivalent angles in terms of turning ability i e rate of turn tactical diameter advance transfer and speed loss determined after the turning circle tests figs 19 22 present the equivalent angles elaborated after zig zag tests i e the figures describe initial turning ability and yaw checking ability it has to be noted that due to influence of environmental conditions and some asymmetries in the propellers rudders and pod propulsors the results might be different for starboard and port rudder pod deflections the curves presented in above mentioned figures are interpolated on the turning circles data shown in figs 5 and 6 and zig zag tests data from figs 7 12 some extrapolation to lower pod propulsors angles has been done to show the overall tendency in all figures values of respective parameters for twin propeller twin rudder version are marked and compared to the pod deflection angle with the same parameter value values of rudder equivalent pod propulsors angles are presented in numbers in all figures fig 13 shows the equivalent pod propulsors angle for which the rate of turn in turning circle is equal for twin pod and twin propeller twin rudder version it might be seen that the difference in rudder and rudder equivalent pod propulsors angle is large and equal to 19 and 18 for starboard and port turns respectively giving values of rudder equivalent pod angles of 16 and 17 one of the analysed imo criterial parameters from turning circle test i e tactical diameter is shown in fig 15 in this case rudder equivalent pod propulsors angles differ also quite much reaching values of 21 and 24 for starboard and port turns respectively the difference is mainly caused by the difference in tactical diameter for twin propeller twin rudder ship for starboard and port turns the other imo criterial parameter i e advance is presented in fig 15 surprisingly for twin pod version and for twin propeller twin rudder version the same advance in turning circle test was reached for pod propulsors deflection angle of 35 and 34 for starboard and port turns respectively so almost identical values of pod propulsors and rudders gave the same advance value taking the trajectory of centre of gravity from figs 5 and 6 into account it might be concluded that the ship with pod propulsors reacts in the first phase of turning circle with more or less identical rotational velocity for the same 35 helm angle afterwards in the second phase of turning circle the rotational velocity of pod propulsor version is much higher than of rudder version transfer and speed loss in turning circles shown in figs 16 and 17 are the most influenced by direction of turn to starboard and port the difference for twin propeller twin rudder version in transfer is 20 and in speed loss 17 due to this the equivalent angles also differ significantly these angles were estimated for transfer to have the values of 21 and 29 for starboard and port turn respectively in case of speed loss the equivalent angles due to the curve steepness do not differ significantly and have the values of 18 and 21 for starboard and port fig 18 shows that the steady turning diameter for twin propeller twin rudder version does not depend so strong on the direction of turn like transfer and speed loss as it might be seen similar value of steady turning diameter as for 35 of rudders is reached for around 22 pods deflections for both starboard and port turns initial turning ability for twin propeller twin rudder and twin pod versions are shown in fig 19 as it was expected the difference in rudder angles and equivalent pod propulsor angles are not so large as for turning circles for starboard turn the equivalent angle is 6 and for port turn 8 as seen in fig 20 due to the excellent yaw checking ability of twin propeller twin rudder version and due to the inherent instability of twin pod version it was barely possible in case of port turn 3 and not possible in case of starboard turn to determine the equivalent angles for the first overshoot angle in 10 10 zig zag test in case of the second overshoot angle in 10 10 zig zag test in fig 21 the equivalent pod propulsor angles were equal to 7 and 9 for starboard and port first turns respectively the reason for such small difference between rudder and equivalent pod propulsor angles might be again the course instability of pod propulsors ship version and her sensitivity on the environment conditions the 20 20 zig zag test shown in fig 22 proves that for larger rudder and pod deflections the differences between the rudder and equivalent pod propulsor angles are more significant similar first overshoot angles in 20 20 zig zag test have been reached for equivalent pod propulsor angles of 8 and 11 for starboard and port first turns respectively in tables 3 and 4 the equivalent angles for twin pod version are summarized for starboard and port turning circle tests respectively tables 5 and 6 show the rudder equivalent pod propulsors angles from zig zag tests both the imo criteria parameters and in case of turning circle some additional parameters have been collected and are presented figs 23 and 24 show all the gathered results combined and divided to starboard and port turn direction or first rudder execution in case of zig zag tests both turning test and zig zag tests are presented in the same figures to show overall tendency of determined equivalent angles it can be observed besides advance in turning circle all the rest of equivalent pod deflections are smaller than corresponding rudder angles it has to be noted that in case of 10 10 zig zag test with first pod execute to starboard it was not possible to determine the equivalent pod propulsor angle for the same test with first pod execute to port the equivalent angle was determined to be very small and close to 3 this was due to the inherent course instability of the twin pod ship version where the instability loop width is estimated to be around 3 5 equivalent manoeuvres test results figs 25 28 show the results of turning circle model tests carried out with the pod driven ship version with pods deflected by previously determined equivalent angles for comparison in every figure the trajectory of the centre of gravity is shown for both tested ship versions in case of advance fig 25 tactical diameter fig 26 and transfer fig 27 also the points where the analysed parameter has been found is presented it might be seen that the rudder equivalent pod propulsor angles vary for different analysed manoeuvring parameters to get the same advance in turning circle as for 35 rudder deflection pod propulsors have to be deflected by 35 to get the same tactical diameter as for 35 rudder deflection the equivalent pod propulsor angle is close to 25 while for the same transfer 30 of pod propulsor angle is necessary whereas steady turning diameter as for 35 rudder deflection was identical for 21 pod propulsors angle as shown in fig 28 as it was expected the speed loss on turning circle for 35 pod propulsors deflection was significant and finally dropped down to 0 25 of approach speed this is of course due to the larger drift angle of twin pod version comparing to the twin propeller twin rudder version it was anticipated that the equal speed loss as for 35 of rudder deflection for twin propeller twin rudder version will be found for much smaller pod propulsor angles and rather close to the same steady turning diameter fig 29 shows the equal speed loss on a turning circle carried out with 35 of rudder deflection and determined corresponding equivalent pod propulsors angle of 21 finally fig 30 shows values of particular manoeuvring parameters of turning circle that have been achieved from the tests with 35 rudder deflection for twin screw twin rudder version and with corresponding equivalent angles for twin pod version the equivalent angles for which the presented parameters have been achieved are presented in the figure next to the parameter name the grey solid line shows identity of analysed parameters get from tests with rudder and pod ship versions it might be seen that parameter values from tests with rudder equivalent pod propulsor angles match very well values from tests with 35 rudder deflection 6 concluding remarks in the paper the idea of equivalent pod propulsor angles has been presented the equivalent angles mean angles of pod propulsors that in consequence give the same ship response in terms of various imo manoeuvring parameters as the sister ship for corresponding conventional rudder deflection angles the equivalent angles have been determined for different parameters on the basis of experiments with free running manned model in two steering propulsion arrangement configurations a series of imo manoeuvring tests have been carried out at open air station at ship handling research and training centre near iława in poland for the twin propeller twin rudder configuration only tests with imo recommended steering angles have been carried out and for the twin pod configuration additionally with various pod propulsor deflection angles besides an obvious conclusion about differences in manoeuvring abilities of ships with azimuth thrusters i e their possible inherent course instability and better turning abilities the present study has generally confirmed the well known findings indicating that the issue of manoeuvring abilities of ships equipped with azimuth thrusters still needs rather extensive and thorough studies although forces have not been measured on pod propulsors and on rudders one of the most important conclusion is that in case of sister ships for small deflection pod rudder angles the manoeuvring response of ship with pod propulsors is comparable to the response of her rudder sister ship version for larger pod propulsor deflections the differences between analysed ships responses are much more significant and the equivalent angles might be found with sufficient accuracy furthermore it has been shown that for different analysed turning circle parameters different values of equivalent angles are reached getting values lower by up to more than 50 see rate of turn and speed loss of course the overall aim of standard tests is to prove that the ship manoeuvring abilities are in compliance with imo regulations nevertheless the introduction of equivalent angles idea will increase the reliability of model test results for ships with non conventional steering propulsion devices and may also increase ship designers and testing facilities confidence and trust in rules and regulations on manoeuvring safety of pod driven ships as they will be based on solid scientific fundamentals on the other hand such equivalent pod propulsor angles should be defined case by case for every ship what might be time consuming and inefficient in terms of cost and human resources so the final conclusion is that especially in case of ships for which large heel angles in turning circle are expected and a risk of high loads on pod propulsors for large deflections is anticipated some changes in required suggested pod steering angles in imo standard manoeuvres should be taken into consideration acknowledgments

22606,procedures for carrying out the manoeuvring tests presented in international maritime organisation imo resolution msc 137 76 are based on the capabilities of ships with conventional steering propulsion systems therefore they do not correspond to ships with other steering propulsion devices like pod drives imo is aware of this shortcoming and for ships with non conventional steering and propulsion system may permit the use of comparative steering angles to the rudder angles specified by the resolution to elaborate these comparative angles for pod driven gas carrier experiments with free sailing manned model have been carried out for comparison two sister ships have been taken into consideration i e twin pod and twin propeller twin rudder configurations for both ship versions manoeuvres according to standard imo procedures have been carried out for twin pod configuration additionally manoeuvres with various pod propulsor settings have been performed to find the comparative i e rudder equivalent pod propulsor angles results show an obvious fact that for twin pod ship version similar results of standard manoeuvre parameters as for twin propeller twin rudder version are obtained for other than imo recommended 35 steering angle it is shown that for turning circle parameters a single comparative or rudder equivalent angle does not exist various turning circle parameters are obtained for different pod propulsor angles keywords ship manoeuvring pod propulsion imo standard manoeuvring tests free running model tests manned model 1 introduction majority of ships have to satisfy manoeuvring standards issued by the international maritime organisation elaboration of these standards was initiated in 1960 s and published as a final resolution with explanatory notes in 2002 international maritime organization 2002 testing procedures presented in these documents are based on analysis of manoeuvring abilities of ships especially with insufficient turning and course keeping abilities however to prepare the rules and requirements regarding standard manoeuvring tests only ships with conventional propeller rudder systems were taken into consideration therefore as shipbuilding industry is rather conservative designers and researchers applied the imo manoeuvring standards to pod driven ships with some suspicions reichel 2017 in case of pod driven ships the practice of applying the same steering angles as for ships with conventional steering propulsion system during manoeuvring tests might be for different reasons questioned experiments with similar ships equipped with either conventional unit or pod propulsion unit have been conducted to compare manoeuvring abilities of those ships toxopeus and loeff 2002 it was concluded that turning ability of the specific ship with pod propulsors which was investigated is better than the one with conventional propeller rudder arrangement on the other hand it was shown that imo standards could be satisfied already for much smaller pod steering angles similar research about differences of manoeuvring abilities of ships with conventional rudders and pod drives is presented in the case of fast ro pax ship woodward et al 2002 first of all results of turning circle tests present an evident fact that the podded ship shows some improvements over the classical arrangement furthermore to reach the same turning circle parameters helm angles are definitely smaller for pod propulsors than for classic rudders however no quantitative analysis of those angles is provided comparable qualitative results of model tests of a generic frigate with twin tractor pods is presented by ball 2004 one of the conclusion was that for certain froude number both the tactical diameter and speed loss in steady turn for integrate hull pod frigate with 25 pod azimuth angle were similar to that for conventional frigate with a 35 rudder angle as a consequence smaller pod propulsor deflection angles will minimise the risk of high loads on the pod housings especially during first phase of turning circle the forces on pod propulsors might be even as much as twice larger than during the steady phase woodward et al 2009 and therefore result in failures and damages other reason for questioning the imo standard steering angles especially for fast and slender ships could be minimising the risk of large heel angles during turning circles heel angles during turning especially in the first phase of turn might reach large betancourt 2003 or extremely large values of up to 30 toxopeus and loeff 2002 the reason of such phenomena might be the differences in hull shape between conventional and pod driven sister ships much higher steering rates for pods than for rudders or simply different metacentric height these factors are inseparable from the pod driven ship design and as such cannot be redesigned the main reason for huge difference in maximum heel angle for certain type of ships is much larger steering force initiated by the pods than by rudders a brief comparison of forces generated by pod propulsors and comparable rudders is presented by toxopeus and loeff 2002 the analysis was done for bollard pull conditions but it clearly shows the differences in longitudinal and lateral forces generated by both steering devices as the transverse force generated by pod propulsors in open water conditions is almost independent of the advance coefficient grygorowicz and szantyr 2004 reichel 2007 it may be concluded that the same applies to the behind hull conditions it should be underlined that the applicability of the imo criteria as such is not questioned in this paper the imo criteria can be applied directly as they provide equivalent information about the manoeuvring response of pod driven ships as for conventionally propelled ships woodward et al 2009 the main objective of the paper was to show that although the angles on pod propulsors are smaller than those required by imo for turning circle the manoeuvring criteria are met and therefore the requirement of 35 of steering device for pod driven ships is not necessary second objective was to show for which pod propulsor angles the pod driven ship response might be similar to the response of sister ship with conventional steering propulsion system theses so called equivalent angles i e pod propulsor angles for which these responses are identical in terms of different manoeuvring characteristics are found and discussed some preliminary results of this investigation have already been presented in reichel 2018 2 model tests a model of an lng carrier built for ship handling training purposes was used for described research the model has been built to a scale 1 24 in three sister ship versions with replaceable stern parts the available versions are single propeller single rudder twin propeller twin rudder and twin pod with pulling propellers during the presented research those versions with two propellers have been used for experiments during the tests manned model fully equipped for ship handling training was used it was equipped with classic engine telegraph and wheel for twin propeller twin rudder version and angle thrust joysticks for twin pod version model tests have been divided into three stages first when both ship versions have been checked according to imo standard procedure second when proposed manoeuvres with twin pod version have been carried out for various different than imo recommended steering device angles third when manoeuvring tests have been carried out for pod propulsor deflections equal to equivalent angles determined after second stage of tests 2 1 imo standard manoeuvres procedure the standards for ship manoeuvrability have been adopted by international maritime organization 2002 and are the governing regulations for ships of all rudder and propulsion types of 100 m in length and over and chemical tankers and gas carriers regardless of the length regarding the test parameters that relate to steering device settings the standards say turning circle manoeuvre is the manoeuvre to be performed to both starboard and port with 35 rudder angle or the maximum rudder angle permissible at the test speed following a steady approach with zero yaw rate the 10 10 zig zag test is performed by turning the rudder alternately by 10 to either side following a heading deviation of 10 from the original heading in accordance with the following procedure 1 after a steady approach with zero yaw rate the rudder is put over to 10 to starboard or port first execute 2 when the heading has changed to 10 off the original heading the rudder is reversed to 10 to port or starboard second execute and 3 after the rudder has been turned to port starboard the ship will continue turning in the original direction with decreasing turning rate in response to the rudder the ship should then turn to port starboard when the ship has reached a heading of 10 to port starboard of the original course the rudder is again reversed to 10 to starboard port third execute the 20 20 zig zag test is performed using the procedure given above using 20 rudder angles and 20 change of heading instead of 10 rudder angles and 10 change of heading respectively it has to be noted that these procedures have been developed for and on the basis of ships with conventional steering and propulsion systems the value of 35 steering angle opposite to the conventional rudders does not therefore mean much in the case of pod propulsors it is also not possible to define the maximum angle for non conventional steering propulsion devices as they can produce the steering force in any of 360 directions therefore the presented paper focuses on the turning circle standard test as in this case i e for larger steering angles much more might be said about differences between hydrodynamics of pods and rudders 2 2 specifics on model tests all tests for both propulsion arrangement configurations have been carried out for approach speed of around 1 26 m s which corresponds to 12 knots in full scale the tests have been carried out in april june and september 2018 at an open air station at ship handling research and training centre near ilawa in poland the lake is 59 ha large and provides unique opportunity to check manoeuvring abilities of ships both on deep and shallow water programme of model tests is shown in table 1 first stage of experiments covered tests carried out according to standard imo procedure including spiral pull out turning and zig zag tests while the second stage additional turning and zig zag tests with various pod drive angles the tested models were equipped with gps system with rtk reference station owned by ship handling research and training centre what gives nominal position monitoring accuracy of 10 mm the heading was measured with the use of gyrocompass with 0 1 accuracy it should be noted that both the approach speed the course of the model and the course changes were set manually i e by a experienced helmsman 2 3 investigated ship the investigated lng carrier is in full scale about 270 m long and has the capacity of 160 000 cubic metres principal dimensions of the model versions are shown in table 2 in figs 1 and 2 shape of stern part of tested models is presented it has to be noted that both versions have been designed according to the best knowledge to achieve the compromise between propulsion and manoeuvring abilities as a consequence the stern part of both ship versions differ slightly between each other almost all of the differences are above the water e g for accommodation of steering gears however some minor odds might be seen on the underwater transom part including the length of rudder head boxes this may influence for instance roll response during manoeuvring but should not change the overall conclusions on the equivalent manoeuvres it should be mentioned that in case of twin propeller twin rudder configuration the aft perpendicular is on the rudder stock and in case of twin pod configuration on the propulsors vertical axis 3 model test results first of all in case of both ship versions the spiral curve has been carried out to identify the first iteration of equivalent angles later on pull out manoeuvre was carried out as additional test to check the twin pod version course instability at the end of the first and during the second stage of tests a set of turning circle and zig zag tests presented in table 1 has been carried out results of both stages are however combined to show the overall tendency and to clearly show the described hydrodynamic phenomena 3 1 spiral curve in fig 3 the spiral curves for both ship versions are presented difference in course stability for both tested ship versions is visible the reversed spiral curve for the twin pod version has not been carried out but based on previous experience an instability loop width of around 6 might be predicted it is noted that for twin propeller twin rudder version the spiral curve is very steep in the range 5 5 from the angle of around 5 the difference in rate of turns between tested ship versions increases and for 35 steering angle the rate of turn for twin pod version is 50 higher than for twin propeller twin rudder version from fig 3 it might be stated that the values of rate of turn for twin propeller twin rudder ship for rudder angles larger than 35 have been extrapolated according to the third order polynomial based on the spiral curve this extrapolation does not take any hydrodynamic principles into account and is simply hypothetical to show how much the rudder angle should increase to match the equivalent pod angles furthermore it cannot be expected that all the analysed manoeuvring characteristics defined by imo like turning diameter advance in turning circle and overshoot angles will have the same or even similar correlation 3 2 pull out test as the spiral test results show that the twin pod version is course unstable the pull out test have been carried out to confirm this phenomenon fig 4 shows the results of pull out test done with twin pod version it is clearly seen that indeed this ship version has some degree of inherent instability 3 3 turning circle in figs 5 and 6 the turning circle test results are shown for starboard sb and portside ps respectively in standard non dimensional form these figures present both the turning circles done according to imo standard 35 of rudder pod deflections and for other steering angles used to determine the equivalent pod propulsor angles in both figures the trajectory of twin propeller twin rudder ship centre of gravity is marked as dashed line and trajectory of twin pod ship centre of gravity as solid lines 3 4 zig zag manoeuvre in figs 7 10 the results of standard zig zag tests carried out with both tested ship versions have been presented similar to trajectories from figs 5 and 6 in case of zig zags the rudder angle and corresponding heading angle have been marked as dashed line while pod angles and corresponding heading angle as solid lines it might be seen that the differences in overshoot angles between twin propeller twin rudder and twin pod versions are small both for 10 10 and 20 20 zig zag tests however the time of response in the tests with twin propeller twin rudder version is longer than in case of twin pod version in figs 11 and 12 together with standard zig zag tests 10 10 and 20 20 for twin pod version the results of an additional zig zag 15 15 have been presented results of this test have been taken into consideration when identifying the equivalent angles for initial turning ability and overshoot angle from 20 20 test 4 results on rudder equivalent pod propulsor angles test the second stage of the experiments have been done with the twin pod model version only several turning circle tests and zig zag manoeuvres have been carried out to find the equivalent angles the tests were started with steering angles equal to recommended by imo and later on continued with different values until similar manoeuvring characteristics as in the first stage for twin propeller twin rudder version have been achieved figs 13 18 show the equivalent angles in terms of turning ability i e rate of turn tactical diameter advance transfer and speed loss determined after the turning circle tests figs 19 22 present the equivalent angles elaborated after zig zag tests i e the figures describe initial turning ability and yaw checking ability it has to be noted that due to influence of environmental conditions and some asymmetries in the propellers rudders and pod propulsors the results might be different for starboard and port rudder pod deflections the curves presented in above mentioned figures are interpolated on the turning circles data shown in figs 5 and 6 and zig zag tests data from figs 7 12 some extrapolation to lower pod propulsors angles has been done to show the overall tendency in all figures values of respective parameters for twin propeller twin rudder version are marked and compared to the pod deflection angle with the same parameter value values of rudder equivalent pod propulsors angles are presented in numbers in all figures fig 13 shows the equivalent pod propulsors angle for which the rate of turn in turning circle is equal for twin pod and twin propeller twin rudder version it might be seen that the difference in rudder and rudder equivalent pod propulsors angle is large and equal to 19 and 18 for starboard and port turns respectively giving values of rudder equivalent pod angles of 16 and 17 one of the analysed imo criterial parameters from turning circle test i e tactical diameter is shown in fig 15 in this case rudder equivalent pod propulsors angles differ also quite much reaching values of 21 and 24 for starboard and port turns respectively the difference is mainly caused by the difference in tactical diameter for twin propeller twin rudder ship for starboard and port turns the other imo criterial parameter i e advance is presented in fig 15 surprisingly for twin pod version and for twin propeller twin rudder version the same advance in turning circle test was reached for pod propulsors deflection angle of 35 and 34 for starboard and port turns respectively so almost identical values of pod propulsors and rudders gave the same advance value taking the trajectory of centre of gravity from figs 5 and 6 into account it might be concluded that the ship with pod propulsors reacts in the first phase of turning circle with more or less identical rotational velocity for the same 35 helm angle afterwards in the second phase of turning circle the rotational velocity of pod propulsor version is much higher than of rudder version transfer and speed loss in turning circles shown in figs 16 and 17 are the most influenced by direction of turn to starboard and port the difference for twin propeller twin rudder version in transfer is 20 and in speed loss 17 due to this the equivalent angles also differ significantly these angles were estimated for transfer to have the values of 21 and 29 for starboard and port turn respectively in case of speed loss the equivalent angles due to the curve steepness do not differ significantly and have the values of 18 and 21 for starboard and port fig 18 shows that the steady turning diameter for twin propeller twin rudder version does not depend so strong on the direction of turn like transfer and speed loss as it might be seen similar value of steady turning diameter as for 35 of rudders is reached for around 22 pods deflections for both starboard and port turns initial turning ability for twin propeller twin rudder and twin pod versions are shown in fig 19 as it was expected the difference in rudder angles and equivalent pod propulsor angles are not so large as for turning circles for starboard turn the equivalent angle is 6 and for port turn 8 as seen in fig 20 due to the excellent yaw checking ability of twin propeller twin rudder version and due to the inherent instability of twin pod version it was barely possible in case of port turn 3 and not possible in case of starboard turn to determine the equivalent angles for the first overshoot angle in 10 10 zig zag test in case of the second overshoot angle in 10 10 zig zag test in fig 21 the equivalent pod propulsor angles were equal to 7 and 9 for starboard and port first turns respectively the reason for such small difference between rudder and equivalent pod propulsor angles might be again the course instability of pod propulsors ship version and her sensitivity on the environment conditions the 20 20 zig zag test shown in fig 22 proves that for larger rudder and pod deflections the differences between the rudder and equivalent pod propulsor angles are more significant similar first overshoot angles in 20 20 zig zag test have been reached for equivalent pod propulsor angles of 8 and 11 for starboard and port first turns respectively in tables 3 and 4 the equivalent angles for twin pod version are summarized for starboard and port turning circle tests respectively tables 5 and 6 show the rudder equivalent pod propulsors angles from zig zag tests both the imo criteria parameters and in case of turning circle some additional parameters have been collected and are presented figs 23 and 24 show all the gathered results combined and divided to starboard and port turn direction or first rudder execution in case of zig zag tests both turning test and zig zag tests are presented in the same figures to show overall tendency of determined equivalent angles it can be observed besides advance in turning circle all the rest of equivalent pod deflections are smaller than corresponding rudder angles it has to be noted that in case of 10 10 zig zag test with first pod execute to starboard it was not possible to determine the equivalent pod propulsor angle for the same test with first pod execute to port the equivalent angle was determined to be very small and close to 3 this was due to the inherent course instability of the twin pod ship version where the instability loop width is estimated to be around 3 5 equivalent manoeuvres test results figs 25 28 show the results of turning circle model tests carried out with the pod driven ship version with pods deflected by previously determined equivalent angles for comparison in every figure the trajectory of the centre of gravity is shown for both tested ship versions in case of advance fig 25 tactical diameter fig 26 and transfer fig 27 also the points where the analysed parameter has been found is presented it might be seen that the rudder equivalent pod propulsor angles vary for different analysed manoeuvring parameters to get the same advance in turning circle as for 35 rudder deflection pod propulsors have to be deflected by 35 to get the same tactical diameter as for 35 rudder deflection the equivalent pod propulsor angle is close to 25 while for the same transfer 30 of pod propulsor angle is necessary whereas steady turning diameter as for 35 rudder deflection was identical for 21 pod propulsors angle as shown in fig 28 as it was expected the speed loss on turning circle for 35 pod propulsors deflection was significant and finally dropped down to 0 25 of approach speed this is of course due to the larger drift angle of twin pod version comparing to the twin propeller twin rudder version it was anticipated that the equal speed loss as for 35 of rudder deflection for twin propeller twin rudder version will be found for much smaller pod propulsor angles and rather close to the same steady turning diameter fig 29 shows the equal speed loss on a turning circle carried out with 35 of rudder deflection and determined corresponding equivalent pod propulsors angle of 21 finally fig 30 shows values of particular manoeuvring parameters of turning circle that have been achieved from the tests with 35 rudder deflection for twin screw twin rudder version and with corresponding equivalent angles for twin pod version the equivalent angles for which the presented parameters have been achieved are presented in the figure next to the parameter name the grey solid line shows identity of analysed parameters get from tests with rudder and pod ship versions it might be seen that parameter values from tests with rudder equivalent pod propulsor angles match very well values from tests with 35 rudder deflection 6 concluding remarks in the paper the idea of equivalent pod propulsor angles has been presented the equivalent angles mean angles of pod propulsors that in consequence give the same ship response in terms of various imo manoeuvring parameters as the sister ship for corresponding conventional rudder deflection angles the equivalent angles have been determined for different parameters on the basis of experiments with free running manned model in two steering propulsion arrangement configurations a series of imo manoeuvring tests have been carried out at open air station at ship handling

sister ships for small deflection pod rudder angles the manoeuvring response of ship with pod propulsors is comparable to the response of her rudder sister ship version for larger pod propulsor deflections the differences between analysed ships responses are much more significant and the equivalent angles might be found with sufficient accuracy furthermore it has been shown that for different analysed turning circle parameters different values of equivalent angles are reached getting values lower by up to more than 50 see rate of turn and speed loss of course the overall aim of standard tests is to prove that the ship manoeuvring abilities are in compliance with imo regulations nevertheless the introduction of equivalent angles idea will increase the reliability of model test results for ships with non conventional steering propulsion devices and may also increase ship designers and testing facilities confidence and trust in rules and regulations on manoeuvring safety

respect to non destructive test methodologies in these structures however although many studies have been carried out the correlations between probable corrosion risk and concrete electrical resistivity require revisions since there is a lack of information about the environmental conditions and materials properties of the structures thus this paper presents a new proposal of relations between the probable corrosion risk and the concrete electrical resistivity based on real structures present in different marine aggressive zones under natural degradation for more than 40 years in addition carbonation tests paconometry mercury intrusion porosimetry compressive strength and concrete reconstitution were performed the results showed that the electrical resistivity values presented in literature recommendations are close to the values proposed in this study however a new class of analysis and a new range of values were added besides properties related to concrete porosity and cement content showed an important role on the electrical resistivity demonstrating that it is necessary the knowledge of physical and dosage concrete parameters for a concise durability analysis through field measurements of electrical resistivity keywords electrical resistivity reinforcement corrosion concrete marine environment 1 introduction reinforcement corrosion is the main cause of degradation in reinforced concrete structures affecting the load carrying capacity of the structure as well as involving significant financial amounts for their rehabilitation at this point several researches on reinforcement corrosion field are conducted worldwide from different perspectives since researches related to the decrease in mechanical properties of corroded reinforcements as well as proposals for new models that aim to estimate the service life of structures present in aggressive environments as the marine environment melchers and chaves 2018 aguirre guerrero and gutiérrez 2018 andrade and d andreia 2010 apostolopoulos et al 2013 rehman and al hadhrami 2013 medeiros junior et al 2018 han et al 2014 balestra et al 2016 mazer et al 2018 according to melchers and chaves 2018 durability studies require long term observations due to the difficulty in the reliable reproduction in laboratory tests of the natural conditions of degradation of the concrete analyzing the dynamic of the reinforcement corrosion process it should first be noted that the alkaline solution present in the concrete pores ph close to 12 5 promotes a suitable environment to the formation of a passivating film that covers and protect reinforcements against the corrosion process however the action of external agents such as chlorides present in a marine environment ends up destroying this passivating film triggering the corrosive process of the bars and leading to the formation of expansive corrosion products as these corrosion products settle at the periphery of the reinforcements radial stresses along the bars axis are produced leading to cracking formation due to the limited plastic strain presented by the concrete concomitantly to this the spalling of the concrete cover occurs potentiating the ingress of aggressive agents from the external environment and accelerating the degradation process melchers and chaves 2018 aguirre guerrero and gutiérrez 2018 andrade and d andreia 2010 balestra et al 2016 mazer et al 2018 khan et al 2014 in addition to the concrete cover cracking and spalling the reinforcement corrosion leads to structural problems that aggravate as the corrosive process intensifies due to a progressive reduction of the reinforcement cross section as well as the loss of the monolithism between the concrete and the bars at this point corrosion induced by chlorides present in the marine environment is characterized by the formation of well defined corrosion points pits on bars surface that deepens as the corrosive process progress in this case the geometric damages observed can generate small mass variations in the bars but can produce significant bars axis eccentricities between corroded and non corroded sections reducing the mechanical properties of the reinforcement when subjected to tensile stresses besides it is possible that corroded bars may have little or no plastic strain when under tensile test as a consequence brittle and sudden fractures can occur leading to immediate collapses in reinforced concrete structures degraded by chloride induced corrosion han et al 2014 balestra et al 2016 mazer et al 2018 khan et al 2014 zhu and françois 2014 françois et al 2013 as a result of the exposed problem one of the research lines regarding the analysis of real concrete structures is related to the application of non destructive tests ndt at this point the electrical resistivity of the concrete has been studied with the objective of providing parameters that support durability analysis for reinforced concrete structures once this technique is recognized as a method for continuous monitoring of real structures from a simple fast methodology with reliable results nguyen et al 2017 2018 yu et al 2017 tang et al 2015 it is worth noting that since the reinforcement corrosion is an electrochemical process the electrical resistivity has been used as a parameter providing information about this process being used to the development of service life models andrade and d andreia 2010 nguyen et al 2018 chen et al 2014 electrical resistivity is a material property that describes its ability to lead with charge flow being determined by the gradient between the apparent voltage and the resulting current both multiplied by a constant related to the material the technique based on wenner s fourth electrodes fig 1 is one of the most fields applied methodologies in real reinforced concrete structures where a current is applied by the external electrodes and the voltage is measured by the internal ones yu et al 2017 nguyen et al 2018 chen et al 2014 medeiros junior and lima 2016 sengul 2014 in concrete structures the electrical resistivity and its relation with durability studies has been the object of an extensive range of researches horbostel et al hornbostel et al 2013 presented a literature review on the relationship between electrical resistivity and corrosion risk while sengul 2014 describes resistivity as an indicator of durability in concrete structures through its correlation with chlorides diffusion coefficient for different concretes bem et al 2018 discussed some factors that influence electrical resistivity on concrete such as water cement ratio chemical admixtures and mineral additions about concrete materials medeiros junior and lima 2016 in a research carried out for 730 days pointed out the influence of brazilian cement type on the electrical resistivity of concrete the authors concluded that not only the electrical resistivity of concrete increases over time but also that the presence of supplementary cementitious materials scm contributes to increasing the electrical resistivity with a significant gradient change after 500 days due to the refinement of the concrete porous in agreement with other studies presented in the literature wang et al 2013 liu et al 2014 wei et al 2012 in this respect two points should be stressed first as the cement hydration increase leading to the refinement of the porous network both concrete mechanical properties and concrete electrical resistivity increase indicating a progressive reduction in the water movement into concrete pores during the cement hydration process wei et al 2012 lübeck et al 2012 shao et al 2015 secondly it is consensual that the presence of scm contributes to a refinement of the concrete microstructure pores and consequently an increase in electrical resistivity is observed tang et al 2015 sengul 2014 hornbostel et al 2013 regarding concrete porosity researches carried out emphasized aspects about the saturation degree of the concrete pores who presented an inversely proportional relationship with the concrete electrical resistivity in this sense an increase in the pore saturation degree refers to an easier fluid movement through concrete pore network favoring the corrosion process consequently the electrical resistivity values presented by the concrete decrease as the pore saturation degree increase chen et al 2014 sengul 2014 hornbostel et al 2013 ramezanianpour et al 2011 also under this perspective of concrete materials hou et al 2017 recently presented a study about coarse aggregates effects on the concrete electrical resistivity through tomography the authors concluded that there is a current preference to pass through the coarse aggregates rather than through the interface transition zone itz around the aggregates in agreement with other studies that emphasize that itz has no significant effects on concrete resistivity ramezanianpour et al 2011 shane et al 2000 sabbag and uyanik 2018 analyzed the relationship between concrete strength and electrical resistivity the authors observed that for concretes cured in water concrete strength and electrical resistivity increase presenting a proportional relationship whereas for concretes submitted to air cured concrete strength and electrical resistivity present an inversely proportional relation mendes et al 2018 also analyzed the relation between concrete strength and electrical resistivity proposing dosage diagrams for the use of different cement types besides the authors observed that replacing portland cement for 10 of silica fume expressively increase the electrical resistivity of concretes for a same water to binder ratio regarding the presence of bars or fibers to reinforce concrete structures garzon et al 2014 deal with the problem related to the presence of reinforcements since the current applied will be conducted through the reinforcement instead of the concrete volume affecting the resistivity values in this way empirical equations were obtained through finite element analysis to take into account the reinforcement effects chu and chen 2016 presented recently the effects of carbon fibers used for structural purposes in concrete on the concrete electrical resistivity the authors observed a drastic decrease in the electrical resistivity values with dosages from 0 9 carbon fibers fares et al 2018 used electrical resistivity tomography ert device in order to analyze chloride profiles the authors compared chloride profiles obtained by potentiometric titration with chloride profiles obtained by ert technique it was noted that ert methodology is capable to represent chlorides concentrations in profiles sirieix et al 2007 analyzed statically 55 pipe segments performing electrical resistivity and infrared thermography tests observing that rejecting the null hypothesis the relation between the parameters are highly significant lin et al 2018 used electrical resistivity and thermography to evaluating concrete decks the authors concluded that electrical resistivity is not an adequate parameter due to the insulation of overlay materials while thermography can identify overlay debonding although several research lines are conducted about electrical resistivity and its relationship with the reinforcement corrosion some key points should be observed first many researches are conducted under controlled conditions at a laboratory that differ from the real conditions to which concrete structures are exposed especially structures in service for more than three decades moradian et al 2012 and sanchez et al 2017 are examples of resistivity analyzes from real concrete structures reference pacheco torgal et al 2018 shows some very interesting reported cases of real reinforced concrete structures subject to corrosion but overall the number of publications in this subject for real concrete structures is still low secondly recommendations for correlating the probable corrosion risk and electrical resistivity are presented in the literature but there is still no normative protocol hornbostel et al 2013 in addition a broad range of values for each classification of aggressiveness is observed in the recommendations as exemplified at table 1 with no mention about the environment where the structure is inserted age or even concrete properties such as porosity which although it is recognized as an important property is not taken into account thus this article aims to contribute in the durability and service life field of concrete structures present in a marine environment bringing an analysis about the electrical resistivity of real concrete structures present in the marine environment for more than 40 years by this way a new class of analysis and a new range of values correlating the probable corrosion risk and concrete electrical resistivity were proposed based on naturally degraded structures with the objective to refine the range values and classes presented in current standards 2 experimental procedure 74 points of electrical resistivity distributed in real concrete structures present in different marine aggressive zones located at arvoredo s island guarujá city são paulo brazil were analyzed and compared with the literature values according to reference rilem recommendation tc154 emc 2000 that present a relationship between the probable corrosion risk and the electrical resistivity values in this way new limit values and a new class were proposed contributing to refine the literature values or yet present values for a specific case concrete structures present for more than 40 years in a marine environment it should be stressed that these are naturally degraded structures under the action of marine environment present in different marine aggressive zones for decades without laboratory constraints in addition carbonation paconometry mercury intrusion porosimetry compressive strength and concrete reconstitution were performed the development of this study is part of research activity balestra et al 2018 2019a 2019b balestra 2017 aimed to assess and analyses the chloride concentration profiles of real reinforced degraded concrete structures present in different marine aggressive zones the arvoredo s island is a rocky formation with approximately 37 000 m2 approximately 44 000 yr2 distant approximately 1600 m approximately 1 mile from pernambuco beach in the city of guaruja south coast of the são paulo state brazil the location coordinates of the island are 23 967106 south latitude and 46 167061 west longitude and according to köppen classification peel et al 2007 the local climate is classified as cfa subtropical climate the history of the concrete structures on the island dates back to the 1950 s when it was granted by the brazilian navy for scientific purposes to engineer fernando lee thus several structures were built in different marine aggressive zones using reinforced concrete until the end of 1970 s to subsidiary the researches developed at the island where should be emphasized researches in the biological field with marine animals and tropical plants caldas 2000 an overview of the island and its reinforced concrete structures is shown in fig 2 as the structures were built more than 40 years ago they present natural degradation due to the environment where they are inserted mainly due to the reinforcement corrosion induced by chlorides action present in the marine environment fig 3 shows an example of the corrosion state of a reinforced concrete stair on arvoredo s island a total of 74 points distributed in structures present in different marine aggressive zones were analyzed by electrical resistivity using the wenner s method fourth points through portable equipment the space between the electrodes was 50 mm the analysis points were identified by numbers as presented in figs 4 16 according to their respective structures it should be emphasized that care was taken regarding the choice of electrical resistivity analysis points so carbonation and paconometry assays were performed before the electrical resistivity first carbonation assays were carried out by spraying a phenolphthalein solution in holes with a diameter of 12 7 mm 0 5 in and 200 mm 7 87 in depth done by a drill in all the structures under analysis as prescribed by rilem cpc 18 rilem recommendation cpc 18 1988 paconometry assays were also performed in the same structures in order to determine the presence diameter and position of reinforcements as well as the concrete cover thickness in this way a paconometer with detector capacity up to 150 mm was used in order to determine the concrete cover thickness and the reinforcement positions after reinforcement positions were marked directly on the concrete structure surface also recording the concrete cover thickness and rebars diameter in a general way the concrete cover thickness was between 27 and 32 mm for the reinforced concrete structures while rebars diameter varied between 3 8 and 1 2 spaced 20 cm in this respect for the execution of electrical resistivity tests points with reinforcements were avoided since they could influence the results as presented by garzon et al 2014 and sanchez et al 2017 once reinforcements can act as a preferential way for charge flow in this way knowing the position of the bars in the reinforced structures the electrodes were positioned between and parallel the alignment of the bar in addition painted concrete surfaces had the paint layer removed in order to improve the contact between the equipment electrodes and the concrete surface only after removing the paint layer water was sprayed and the electrodes were positioned to perform the electrical resistivity assays concrete surfaces were previously moistened spraying water in order to improve the contact between the equipment electrodes and the concrete surface and for saturating concrete porous at the surface afterward the electrodes were placed on the concrete surface at the 74 determined points and the resistivity values were recorded besides two important points should be presented first the platform structure has points present in marine atmosphere zone with distinct levels of degradation secondly the analysis of the lighthouse fig 11 was done in the internal concrete faces of this structure therefore these aspects were taken into account in the analysis concrete cores with a diameter of 75 mm 3 in and length of 300 mm 11 81 in were extracted using a core drill machine from some concrete structures present in a different marine aggressive zone next to the same points where the electrical resistivity was performed the objective of this step was to collect material to determine the properties and characteristics of the concrete that constituted the structures in order to correlate them with the obtained resistivity values thus concrete cores were taken from structures concrete stair 1 next to analysis point number 52 fig 12 the structure is predominantly present in a marine atmosphere zone platform next to analysis point number 16 fig 6 the structure is predominantly present in the splash zone pool next to the analysis point number 73 fig 16 the structure is predominantly present in the tidal zone mercury intrusion porosimetry compressive strength and concrete reconstitution were performed at the laboratory in the first assay a cubic concrete sample with edges of 1 cm was taken for analysis the objective of the test was to determine the critical pore diameter d crit the total porosity and the percentage of the interconnected pores regarding the compressive strength test 15 cm 5 91 in in length of the central part of the concrete cores was cut being submitted to compression tests according to brazilian standard nbr 5739 nbr 5739 2016 and astm c39 c39m astm c39 c39m 2018 according nbr 5739 2016 and astm c39 c39m 2018 the relation length diameter of the concrete should be equal to 2 for compressive tests the remaining parts of the concrete cores were used to perform concrete reconstitution in order to estimate the cement content used in the concrete of each structure according to astm c1084 astm c1084 2010 in a general way concrete is dried crushed and attacked by hydrochloric acid 1 1 where by sample gravimetric variation it s possible to determine sample cement content 3 results and discussion 3 1 carbonation depth no carbonation depths were found in any of the structures analyzed according to the pink color observed immediately after spray the phenolphthalein solution in holes drilled in the structures fig 17 regarding this result it is possible to conclude that reinforcement corrosion was performed by chlorides action present in the marine environment in this way some important factors should be stressed first guaruja is a tourist city with few pollutant industries that could emit significant co2 at atmosphere secondly the island is relatively far from the downtown 1 mile from the coastal and there are a lot of trees around the concrete structures as can be seen in fig 2 that contribute to consume the co2 in the island atmosphere finally many structures have their surfaces protected by layers of paint figs 5 15 that restrict co2 penetration through concrete pores all these factors contribute to low co2 concentration levels at structures concrete corroborating with the pink color observed in all the carbonation assays and reinforcing the statement that the corrosion was performed by chlorides action 3 2 porosimetry compressive strength and cement content table 2 shows the results of porosimetry by mercury intrusion compressive strength and cement content by concrete reconstitution as well as the predominant marine aggressive zone analyzed and the values of electrical resistivity of the respective points the classification of the predominant marine aggressive zone was done by observations of the tidal level as described by the balestra et al 2018 2019a 2019b balestra 2017 according to table 2 the electrical resistivity values indicate that structures are present in an environment susceptible to moderate to high attacks risk by the reinforcement corrosion according to reference rilem recommendation tc154 emc 2000 in table 1 at this point it is clear that structures present in tidal zone showed the lowest value of electrical resistivity in relation to other zones since concrete pores of these structures remain saturated with greater frequency contributing to the occurrence of low values of electrical resistivity in agreement with reference medeiros junior et al 2015 in the case of the structure present in a splash zone 14 10 kω cm approximately 5 5 kω in table 2 value was recorded characterizing a moderate risk of reinforcement corrosion by the criterion already defined by reference rilem recommendation tc154 emc 2000 this is related to the drying periods that contribute to decreasing the moisture present in the concrete pores raising the values of electrical resistivity in relation to the structures present in the tidal zone however during wetting periods these values can be reduced since there will be an increase in the moisture degree present in the concrete pores due to the water concrete absorption and consequently raising the probable corrosion risk such statements corroborate with the value observed in the structure present in the marine atmosphere zone since the lower presence of moisture in the concrete pores as a function of its altimetric distance to the seawater increases the electrical resistivity 30 20 kω cm in table 2 however observing electrical resistivity in table 1 it is possible to interpret that splash and marine atmosphere zones present the same aggressiveness level once they present resistivity values between 10 and 50 kω cm this fact is the first indication that a review of resistivity values and its probable corrosion risk is necessary furthermore the concrete characteristics of this structure present in marine atmosphere zone presented low cement content lower value of d crit and the higher percentage of interconnected pores showing that this is a structure that can suffer serious damages due to reinforcement corrosion since the porous microstructure present an easy path for chlorides mobility these observations point out that not only the marine aggressive zone generates influence on the values of electrical resistivity but also the concrete quality plays an important role in relation to its properties relative to the ionic flow in its interior in this way the control of cement content water cement ratio and cement hydration degree are directly related not only with the concrete porosity but mainly with the interconnected concrete pores whose are the path how chlorides ingress and achieve reinforcements region this final observation demonstrated why is so difficult to establish a correlation between the probable corrosion risk and the electrical resistivity values for different marine aggressive zones with respect to the physical concrete properties it is important to emphasize that the critical pore diameter d crit is the smallest diameter above which the pores begin to connect and allow the water movement in the concrete thus cement content has an important role since an increase in the cement content reflect an increase in the d crit value consequently the percentage of interconnected pores is lower this behavior can be observed in table 2 which shows an increase in the percentage of interconnected pores as cement content decreases fig 18 shows this trend among the data obtained these concrete properties corroborate with previous affirmations regarding the structures present in marine atmosphere zone even structures present more distant of the contact with the sea water severe damages due to the reinforced corrosion can be observed since the pore network in concrete can allow easy ionic flow moreover it is possible to note comparing cement content and porosimetry parameters of structures present in tidal and splash zones in table 2 that while increasing the cement content reflects an increase in d crit value the reduction on the percentage of interconnected pores is not drastic this means that in this case structures with a cement content of 300 kg m³ can present the same difficult for chlorides mobility in the concrete pores as structures with cement content above 400 kg m³ in the case of point number 73 table 2 the structure presented a high cement content leading to a network of pores with fewer pores interconnections however due to its proximity to seawater and wetting drying cycles concrete pores remain saturated for a long time contributing to lower the values of electrical resistivity indicating that the aggressiveness level of this zone is high even presenting a high cement content in summary it is possible to conclude that concrete properties with respect to both the cement content and the porosity data mainly in relation to the value of d crit and their percentage of interconnected pores play a key role in order to complement the analyzes performed regarding the aggressiveness to which a structure is subjected in a given marine aggressive zone explaining the different levels of aggressiveness to which the structures are subject thus not only the interpretation of the marine aggressive zone and the value of electrical resistivity are sufficient to characterize the actual aggressiveness level to which a structure is subjected but also parameters related to concrete porosity are indispensable for the accomplishment of a concise analysis 3 3 electrical resistivity analysis and proposal of new limit values for probable corrosion risk table 3 presents the electrical resistivity values obtained in the 74 points according to their respective structures and predominant marine aggressive zones table 4 presents the mean values and standard deviation according to the respective predominant marine aggressive zone in which the structures are present it s worth to say that using statistical analysis the outlying points were excluded from original data resulting in mean values of resistivity equal to 36 03 kω cm 12 31 kω cm and 3 23 kω cm to marine atmosphere zone splash zone and tidal zone respectively table 4 according to table 3 most of the structures in marine atmosphere zone presented resistivity values between 10 kω cm and 50 kω cm which correspond to a moderate probable corrosion risk according to the criterion adopted by reference rilem recommendation tc154 emc 2000 this observation agrees with the degradation state of the structures at arvoredo s island as shown in fig 3 in addition according to table 4 tidal zone showed the lowest mean value of electrical resistivity less than 5 kω cm which agrees with the previous statements that these values are conditioned to the saturation degree of the pore network due to the proximity of these structures to sea water the same considerations can be extended to the splash zone where the mean value found was less than 10 kω cm indicating a high corrosion risk according to the criteria established by reference rilem recommendation tc154 emc 2000 in this case the structures presented in these zones tidal and splash often present a high saturation degree in their pores due to the wetting drying cycles increasing the fluid movement inside the concrete porous system and consequently contributing to lower the concrete electrical resistivity indicating that these structures could be severely attacked due to reinforcement corrosion observing the electrical resistivity of the structures present in a marine atmosphere zone table 4 it is possible to notice a great difference in relation to the mean values ound for the structures present in the other zones however the values obtained shown that there is a significant probable corrosion risk for structures present in this zone according to the reference rilem recommendation tc154 emc 2000 agreeing with previous statements regarding the concrete quality and the degradation state of the structures present at arvoredo s island exemplified at figs 3 7 and 8 at this point based on the degradation state of concrete structures and electrical resistivity values obtained it is possible to carry out an analysis looking for propose new limit values of concrete electrical resistivity which correlate with the probable corrosion risk of the reinforcements in order to refine the existing ones or yet for a specific application in concrete structures present for more than 40 years in the marine environment observing points 1 2 3 and 4 belonging to concrete stair 2 present in splash zone it is possible to note that the structure presented electrical resistivity values between 2 30 kω cm and 15 40 kω cm being a severely compromised structurally by the reinforcement corrosion with partial collapses of its steps these low values are justified once water can penetrate concrete pores in a multidirectional way in other words water can penetrate through the upside of the stair steps raising the water content in the concrete porous and consequently reducing the concrete electrical resistivity points identified as 9 10 16 28 and 35 belonging to the pillars of the platform present predominantly in splash zone and eventually marine atmosphere zone of high aggressiveness due to marine aerosol presented resistivity values between 10 50 kω cm and 19 80 kω cm showing an advanced reinforcement corrosion degree of these structures and a porous concrete due to corrosion spots on concrete surface in this way these structures parts receive a significant splash from the breaking waves against the rock formations where this structure was built consequently low electrical resistivity values are justified points 56 and 57 belonging to concrete stair 1 present in marine atmosphere zone however with a low cement content presented electrical resistivity values equal to 13 60 kω cm and 6 70 kω cm respectively being observed reinforcement corrosion and spalling of the concrete cover as observed at fig 3 in this way the low cement concrete contributes to a high percentage of interconnected pores consequently water present in the pores network present high mobility facilitating the ionic charge flux and contributing to low resistivity values points 65 to 67 belonging to the atelier present in marine atmosphere zone of high aggressiveness due to marine aerosol and eventually splashes during strong sea turmoil presented resistivity values between 14 50 and 18 30 kω cm this structure presents an imminent risk of structural collapse due to reinforcement corrosion once due to breaking waves against the rock formation where this structure was built the pores frequently are saturated in this structure contributing to low electrical resistivity values and for the severe degradation state presented from these data it is possible to note that for structures present in the marine environment for more than 40 years values of electrical resistivity less than 20 kω cm represent a high reinforcement corrosion risk in addition structures whose electrical resistivity value was lower than 15 kω cm showed severe damage due to reinforcement corrosion including structures with imminent collapse danger in this respect a very high probable corrosion risk can be referenced to values lower than 15 kω cm in the case of structures with resistivity values between 20 kω cm and 55 kω cm corrosion was observed in some structures such as points 38 and 39 platform points 45 to 47 walkway of the residence points 59 and 60 concrete stair 1 and points 69 to 71 walkway of the atelier however corrosion was not observed in visual inspection from the concrete surface of the structures present predominantly in marine atmosphere zone of moderate and low aggressiveness by the marine aerosol moderate aggressiveness platform points 11 to 15 and 17 to 20 pillar 1 22 to 26 and 29 to 34 pillar 2 36 to 40 pillar 3 low aggressiveness stair 1 points 52 61 and 62 this behavior is justified in the platform structure once 11 to 15 17 to 20 22 to 26 29 to 34 and 36 to 40 are points that receive less water from the breaking waves against the rock formation where the platform was built these points are located in the platform pillars more distant to sea water than points 9 10 and 38 39 consequently they receive less water and chlorides on its surface the same thought can be applied to points 52 61 and 62 as they are present in a high altimetric position and there are a lot of natural obstacles in front of this structure less water and chlorides are deposited on the concrete surface consequently in a visual inspection no corrosion spots where observed in this way it is possible to conclude that for values of electrical resistivity between 20 kω cm to 55 kω cm there is a moderate reinforcement corrosion probability values between 55 kω cm and 80 kω cm were recorded only at points 44 60 and 63 the first one belonging to the residence walkway marine atmosphere zone protected by the presence of natural obstacles and the last two belonging to concrete stair 1 in this case corrosion was observed only at point 44 indicating a lower corrosion probability however structures that presented values of electrical resistivity higher than 80 kω cm did not present reinforcement corrosion as in points 55 and 58 belonging to concrete stair 1 marine atmosphere zone protected by a roof of a dog kennel next to the stair 1 and points 48 to 51 belonging to the structure of the island lighthouse marine atmosphere zone protected internal faces of the lighthouse indicating a negligible risk of reinforcement corrosion in summary from an analysis of the degradation state of concrete structures present in arvoredo s island it is possible to propose values that deal with the probable reinforcement corrosion risk for concrete structures present in a marine environment for more than 40 years according to electrical resistivity values thus based on the described context a new proposal of electrical resistivity limits is presented at table 5 according to the degradation state of the structures at arvoredo s island together with their respective values of electrical resistivity it should be stressed that surface concrete porous was saturated in order to determine electrical resistivity so these proposed values are based on this field condition from the values described at table 5 that compiles values of electrical resistivity and probable reinforcement corrosion risk in publications found in the literature it is possible to note that in a general way the values proposed in this work are close to the values presented in literature reference rilem recommendation tc154 emc 2000 being inserted another category of aggressiveness this fact demonstrates that the limits proposed in this study come to refine the current values or yet to propose limits for exclusive applications in real structures with more than 40 years present in the marine environment both considering concrete surface porous saturated it is worth mention that for analysis and modeling about concrete structures service life present in the marine environment the characterization of the concrete used is an important tool for a concise analysis 4 conclusions based on the results of this experimental investigation the following conclusions are drawn 1 the concrete properties especially with respect to cement content and parameters of interconnected pores and critical pore diameter obtained from the porosimetry test by mercury intrusion complement the electrical resistivity analyzes and the probable reinforcement corrosion risk for reinforced concrete structures present in a marine environment in this case even structures distant from the direct contact of seawater may present severe corrosion risks due to the characteristics and dosage of the materials used in the concrete 2 the structures present in tidal and splash zones presented the smaller electrical resistivity values in function of the frequent saturation degree of the concrete pores thus structures present in these zones tend to present low values of electrical resistivity and at the same time facilitate the charge flow inside the concrete in this way structures present in these zones can present a severe degradation level due to the reinforcement corrosion even in concretes that present high cement content 3 new limits values regarding the probable corrosion risk and electrical resistivity were proposed for applications in real structures present in the marine environment for more than 40 years the values obtained are close to the values recommended in the literature a new category was applied with new ranges of resistivity values thus it is possible to contribute not only to a specific application but also to refine the existing data allowing more precise qualitative analyzes regarding the service life of concrete structures acknowledgments the authors would like to thank fernando lee foundation for the support

22607,reinforcement corrosion is the main cause of degradation in reinforced concrete structures around the world and concrete electrical resistivity has been the object of durability studies with respect to non destructive test methodologies in these structures however although many studies have been carried out the correlations between probable corrosion risk and concrete electrical resistivity require revisions since there is a lack of information about the environmental conditions and materials properties of the structures thus this paper presents a new proposal of relations between the probable corrosion risk and the concrete electrical resistivity based on real structures present in different marine aggressive zones under natural degradation for more than 40 years in addition carbonation tests paconometry mercury intrusion porosimetry compressive strength and concrete reconstitution were performed the results showed that the electrical resistivity values presented in literature recommendations are close to the values proposed in this study however a new class of analysis and a new range of values were added besides properties related to concrete porosity and cement content showed an important role on the electrical resistivity demonstrating that it is necessary the knowledge of physical and dosage concrete parameters for a concise durability analysis

degradation in reinforced concrete structures affecting the load carrying capacity of the structure as well as involving significant financial amounts for their rehabilitation at this point several researches on reinforcement corrosion field are conducted worldwide from different perspectives since researches related to the decrease in mechanical properties of corroded reinforcements as well as proposals for new models that aim to estimate the service life of structures present in aggressive environments as the marine environment melchers and chaves 2018 aguirre guerrero and gutiérrez 2018 andrade and d andreia 2010 apostolopoulos et al 2013 rehman and al hadhrami 2013 medeiros junior et al 2018 han et al 2014 balestra et al 2016 mazer et al 2018 according to melchers and chaves 2018 durability studies require long term observations due to the difficulty in the reliable reproduction in laboratory tests of the natural conditions of degradation of the concrete analyzing the dynamic of the reinforcement corrosion process it should first be noted that the alkaline solution present in the concrete pores ph close to 12 5 promotes a suitable environment to the formation of a passivating film that covers and protect reinforcements against the corrosion process however the action of external agents such as chlorides present in a marine environment ends up destroying this passivating film triggering the corrosive process of the bars and leading to the formation of expansive corrosion products as these corrosion products settle at the periphery of the reinforcements radial stresses along the bars axis are produced leading to cracking formation due to the limited plastic strain presented by the concrete concomitantly to this the spalling of the concrete cover occurs potentiating the ingress of aggressive agents from the external environment and accelerating the degradation process melchers and chaves 2018 aguirre guerrero and gutiérrez 2018 andrade and d andreia 2010 balestra et al 2016 mazer et al 2018 khan et al 2014 in addition to the concrete cover cracking and spalling the reinforcement corrosion leads to structural problems that aggravate as the corrosive process intensifies due to a progressive reduction of the reinforcement cross section as well as the loss of the monolithism between the concrete and the bars at this point corrosion induced by chlorides present in the marine environment is characterized by the formation of well defined corrosion points pits on bars surface that deepens as the corrosive process progress in this case the geometric damages observed can generate small mass variations in the bars but can produce significant bars axis eccentricities between corroded and non corroded sections reducing the mechanical properties of the reinforcement when subjected to tensile stresses besides it is possible that corroded bars may have little or no plastic strain when under tensile test as a consequence brittle and sudden fractures can occur leading to immediate collapses in reinforced concrete structures degraded by chloride induced corrosion han et al 2014 balestra et al 2016 mazer et al 2018 khan et al 2014 zhu and françois 2014 françois et al 2013 as a result of the exposed problem one of the research lines regarding the analysis of real concrete structures is related to the application of non destructive tests ndt at this point the electrical resistivity of the concrete has been studied with the objective of providing parameters that support durability analysis for reinforced concrete structures once this technique is recognized as a method for continuous monitoring of real structures from a simple fast methodology with reliable results nguyen et al 2017 2018 yu et al 2017 tang et al 2015 it is worth noting that since the reinforcement corrosion is an electrochemical process the electrical resistivity has been used as a parameter providing information about this process being used to the development of service life models andrade and d andreia 2010 nguyen et al 2018 chen et al 2014 electrical resistivity is a material property that describes its ability to lead with charge flow being determined by the gradient between the apparent voltage and the resulting current both multiplied by a constant related to the material the technique based on wenner s fourth electrodes fig 1 is one of the most fields applied methodologies in real reinforced concrete structures where a current is applied by the external electrodes and the voltage is measured by the internal ones yu et al 2017 nguyen et al 2018 chen et al 2014 medeiros junior and lima 2016 sengul 2014 in concrete structures the electrical resistivity and its relation with durability studies has been the object of an extensive range of researches horbostel et al hornbostel et al 2013 presented a literature review on the relationship between electrical resistivity and corrosion risk while sengul 2014 describes resistivity as an indicator of durability in concrete structures through its correlation with chlorides diffusion coefficient for different concretes bem et al 2018 discussed some factors that influence electrical resistivity on concrete such as water cement ratio chemical admixtures and mineral additions about concrete materials medeiros junior and lima 2016 in a research carried out for 730 days pointed out the influence of brazilian cement type on the electrical resistivity of concrete the authors concluded that not only the electrical resistivity of concrete increases over time but also that the presence of supplementary cementitious materials scm contributes to increasing the electrical resistivity with a significant gradient change after 500 days due to the refinement of the concrete porous in agreement with other studies presented in the literature wang et al 2013 liu et al 2014 wei et al 2012 in this respect two points should be stressed first as the cement hydration increase leading to the refinement of the porous network both concrete mechanical properties and concrete electrical resistivity increase indicating a progressive reduction in the water movement into concrete pores during the cement hydration process wei et al 2012 lübeck et al 2012 shao et al 2015 secondly it is consensual that the presence of scm contributes to a refinement of the concrete microstructure pores and consequently an increase in electrical resistivity is observed tang et al 2015 sengul 2014 hornbostel et al 2013 regarding concrete porosity researches carried out emphasized aspects about the saturation degree of the concrete pores who presented an inversely proportional relationship with the concrete electrical resistivity in this sense an increase in the pore saturation degree refers to an easier fluid movement through concrete pore network favoring the corrosion process consequently the electrical resistivity values presented by the concrete decrease as the pore saturation degree increase chen et al 2014 sengul 2014 hornbostel et al 2013 ramezanianpour et al 2011 also under this perspective of concrete materials hou et al 2017 recently presented a study about coarse aggregates effects on the concrete electrical resistivity through tomography the authors concluded that there is a current preference to pass through the coarse aggregates rather than through the interface transition zone itz around the aggregates in agreement with other studies that emphasize that itz has no significant effects on concrete resistivity ramezanianpour et al 2011 shane et al 2000 sabbag and uyanik 2018 analyzed the relationship between concrete strength and electrical resistivity the authors observed that for concretes cured in water concrete strength and electrical resistivity increase presenting a proportional relationship whereas for concretes submitted to air cured concrete strength and electrical resistivity present an inversely proportional relation mendes et al 2018 also analyzed the relation between concrete strength and electrical resistivity proposing dosage diagrams for the use of different cement types besides the authors observed that replacing portland cement for 10 of silica fume expressively increase the electrical resistivity of concretes for a same water to binder ratio regarding the presence of bars or fibers to reinforce concrete structures garzon et al 2014 deal with the problem related to the presence of reinforcements since the current applied will be conducted through the reinforcement instead of the concrete volume affecting the resistivity values in this way empirical equations were obtained through finite element analysis to take into account the reinforcement effects chu and chen 2016 presented recently the effects of carbon fibers used for structural purposes in concrete on the concrete electrical resistivity the authors observed a drastic decrease in the electrical resistivity values with dosages from 0 9 carbon fibers fares et al 2018 used electrical resistivity tomography ert device in order to analyze chloride profiles the authors compared chloride profiles obtained by potentiometric titration with chloride profiles obtained by ert technique it was noted that ert methodology is capable to represent chlorides concentrations in profiles sirieix et al 2007 analyzed statically 55 pipe segments performing electrical resistivity and infrared thermography tests observing that rejecting the null hypothesis the relation between the parameters are highly significant lin et al 2018 used electrical resistivity and thermography to evaluating concrete decks the authors concluded that electrical resistivity is not an adequate parameter due to the insulation of overlay materials while thermography can identify overlay debonding although several research lines are conducted about electrical resistivity and its relationship with the reinforcement corrosion some key points should be observed first many researches are conducted under controlled conditions at a laboratory that differ from the real conditions to which concrete structures are exposed especially structures in service for more than three decades moradian et al 2012 and sanchez et al 2017 are examples of resistivity analyzes from real concrete structures reference pacheco torgal et al 2018 shows some very interesting reported cases of real reinforced concrete structures subject to corrosion but overall the number of publications in this subject for real concrete structures is still low secondly recommendations for correlating the probable corrosion risk and electrical resistivity are presented in the literature but there is still no normative protocol hornbostel et al 2013 in addition a broad range of values for each classification of aggressiveness is observed in the recommendations as exemplified at table 1 with no mention about the environment where the structure is inserted age or even concrete properties such as porosity which although it is recognized as an important property is not taken into account thus this article aims to contribute in the durability and service life field of concrete structures present in a marine environment bringing an analysis about the electrical resistivity of real concrete structures present in the marine environment for more than 40 years by this way a new class of analysis and a new range of values correlating the probable corrosion risk and concrete electrical resistivity were proposed based on naturally degraded structures with the objective to refine the range values and classes presented in current standards 2 experimental procedure 74 points of electrical resistivity distributed in real concrete structures present in different marine aggressive zones located at arvoredo s island guarujá city são paulo brazil were analyzed and compared with the literature values according to reference rilem recommendation tc154 emc 2000 that present a relationship between the probable corrosion risk and the electrical resistivity values in this way new limit values and a new class were proposed contributing to refine the literature values or yet present values for a specific case concrete structures present for more than 40 years in a marine environment it should be stressed that these are naturally degraded structures under the action of marine environment present in different marine aggressive zones for decades without laboratory constraints in addition carbonation paconometry mercury intrusion porosimetry compressive strength and concrete reconstitution were performed the development of this study is part of research activity balestra et al 2018 2019a 2019b balestra 2017 aimed to assess and analyses the chloride concentration profiles of real reinforced degraded concrete structures present in different marine aggressive zones the arvoredo s island is a rocky formation with approximately 37 000 m2 approximately 44 000 yr2 distant approximately 1600 m approximately 1 mile from pernambuco beach in the city of guaruja south coast of the são paulo state brazil the location coordinates of the island are 23 967106 south latitude and 46 167061 west longitude and according to köppen classification peel et al 2007 the local climate is classified as cfa subtropical climate the history of the concrete structures on the island dates back to the 1950 s when it was granted by the brazilian navy for scientific purposes to engineer fernando lee thus several structures were built in different marine aggressive zones using reinforced concrete until the end of 1970 s to subsidiary the researches developed at the island where should be emphasized researches in the biological field with marine animals and tropical plants caldas 2000 an overview of the island and its reinforced concrete structures is shown in fig 2 as the structures were built more than 40 years ago they present natural degradation due to the environment where they are inserted mainly due to the reinforcement corrosion induced by chlorides action present in the marine environment fig 3 shows an example of the corrosion state of a reinforced concrete stair on arvoredo s island a total of 74 points distributed in structures present in different marine aggressive zones were analyzed by electrical resistivity using the wenner s method fourth points through portable equipment the space between the electrodes was 50 mm the analysis points were identified by numbers as presented in figs 4 16 according to their respective structures it should be emphasized that care was taken regarding the choice of electrical resistivity analysis points so carbonation and paconometry assays were performed before the electrical resistivity first carbonation assays were carried out by spraying a phenolphthalein solution in holes with a diameter of 12 7 mm 0 5 in and 200 mm 7 87 in depth done by a drill in all the structures under analysis as prescribed by rilem cpc 18 rilem recommendation cpc 18 1988 paconometry assays were also performed in the same structures in order to determine the presence diameter and position of reinforcements as well as the concrete cover thickness in this way a paconometer with detector capacity up to 150 mm was used in order to determine the concrete cover thickness and the reinforcement positions after reinforcement positions were marked directly on the concrete structure surface also recording the concrete cover thickness and rebars diameter in a general way the concrete cover thickness was between 27 and 32 mm for the reinforced concrete structures while rebars diameter varied between 3 8 and 1 2 spaced 20 cm in this respect for the execution of electrical resistivity tests points with reinforcements were avoided since they could influence the results as presented by garzon et al 2014 and sanchez et al 2017 once reinforcements can act as a preferential way for charge flow in this way knowing the position of the bars in the reinforced structures the electrodes were positioned between and parallel the alignment of the bar in addition painted concrete surfaces had the paint layer removed in order to improve the contact between the equipment electrodes and the concrete surface only after removing the paint layer water was sprayed and the electrodes were positioned to perform the electrical resistivity assays concrete surfaces were previously moistened spraying water in order to improve the contact between the equipment electrodes and the concrete surface and for saturating concrete porous at the surface afterward the electrodes were placed on the concrete surface at the 74 determined points and the resistivity values were recorded besides two important points should be presented first the platform structure has points present in marine atmosphere zone with distinct levels of degradation secondly the analysis of the lighthouse fig 11 was done in the internal concrete faces of this structure therefore these aspects were taken into account in the analysis concrete cores with a diameter of 75 mm 3 in and length of 300 mm 11 81 in were extracted using a core drill machine from some concrete structures present in a different marine aggressive zone next to the same points where the electrical resistivity was performed the objective of this step was to collect material to determine the properties and characteristics of the concrete that constituted the structures in order to correlate them with the obtained resistivity values thus concrete cores were taken from structures concrete stair 1 next to analysis point number 52 fig 12 the structure is predominantly present in a marine atmosphere zone platform next to analysis point number 16 fig 6 the structure is predominantly present in the splash zone pool next to the analysis point number 73 fig 16 the structure is predominantly present in the tidal zone mercury intrusion porosimetry compressive strength and concrete reconstitution were performed at the laboratory in the first assay a cubic concrete sample with edges of 1 cm was taken for analysis the objective of the test was to determine the critical pore diameter d crit the total porosity and the percentage of the interconnected pores regarding the compressive strength test 15 cm 5 91 in in length of the central part of the concrete cores was cut being submitted to compression tests according to brazilian standard nbr 5739 nbr 5739 2016 and astm c39 c39m astm c39 c39m 2018 according nbr 5739 2016 and astm c39 c39m 2018 the relation length diameter of the concrete should be equal to 2 for compressive tests the remaining parts of the concrete cores were used to perform concrete reconstitution in order to estimate the cement content used in the concrete of each structure according to astm c1084 astm c1084 2010 in a general way concrete is dried crushed and attacked by hydrochloric acid 1 1 where by sample gravimetric variation it s possible to determine sample cement content 3 results and discussion 3 1 carbonation depth no carbonation depths were found in any of the structures analyzed according to the pink color observed immediately after spray the phenolphthalein solution in holes drilled in the structures fig 17 regarding this result it is possible to conclude that reinforcement corrosion was performed by chlorides action present in the marine environment in this way some important factors should be stressed first guaruja is a tourist city with few pollutant industries that could emit significant co2 at atmosphere secondly the island is relatively far from the downtown 1 mile from the coastal and there are a lot of trees around the concrete structures as can be seen in fig 2 that contribute to consume the co2 in the island atmosphere finally many structures have their surfaces protected by layers of paint figs 5 15 that restrict co2 penetration through concrete pores all these factors contribute to low co2 concentration levels at structures concrete corroborating with the pink color observed in all the carbonation assays and reinforcing the statement that the corrosion was performed by chlorides action 3 2 porosimetry compressive strength and cement content table 2 shows the results of porosimetry by mercury intrusion compressive strength and cement content by concrete reconstitution as well as the predominant marine aggressive zone analyzed and the values of electrical resistivity of the respective points the classification of the predominant marine aggressive zone was done by observations of the tidal level as described by the balestra et al 2018 2019a 2019b balestra 2017 according to table 2 the electrical resistivity values indicate that structures are present in an environment susceptible to moderate to high attacks risk by the reinforcement corrosion according to reference rilem recommendation tc154 emc 2000 in table 1 at this point it is clear that structures present in tidal zone showed the lowest value of electrical resistivity in relation to other zones since concrete pores of these structures remain saturated with greater frequency contributing to the occurrence of low values of electrical resistivity in agreement with reference medeiros junior et al 2015 in the case of the structure present in a splash zone 14 10 kω cm approximately 5 5 kω in table 2 value was recorded characterizing a moderate risk of reinforcement corrosion by the criterion already defined by reference rilem recommendation tc154 emc 2000 this is related to the drying periods that contribute to decreasing the moisture present in the concrete pores raising the values of electrical resistivity in relation to the structures present in the tidal zone however during wetting periods these values can be reduced since there will be an increase in the moisture degree present in the concrete pores due to the water concrete absorption and consequently raising the probable corrosion risk such statements corroborate with the value observed in the structure present in the marine atmosphere zone since the lower presence of moisture in the concrete pores as a function of its altimetric distance to the seawater increases the electrical resistivity 30 20 kω cm in table 2 however observing electrical resistivity in table 1 it is possible to interpret that splash and marine atmosphere zones present the same aggressiveness level once they present resistivity values between 10 and 50 kω cm this fact is the first indication that a review of resistivity values and its probable corrosion risk is necessary furthermore the concrete characteristics of this structure present in marine atmosphere zone presented low cement content lower value of d crit and the higher percentage of interconnected pores showing that this is a structure that can suffer serious damages due to reinforcement corrosion since the porous microstructure present an easy path for chlorides mobility these observations point out that not only the marine aggressive zone generates influence on the values of electrical resistivity but also the concrete quality plays an important role in relation to its properties relative to the ionic flow in its interior in this way the control of cement content water cement ratio and cement hydration degree are directly related not only with the concrete porosity but mainly with the interconnected concrete pores whose are the path how chlorides ingress and achieve reinforcements region this final observation demonstrated why is so difficult to establish a correlation between the probable corrosion risk and the electrical resistivity values for different marine aggressive zones with respect to the physical concrete properties it is important to emphasize that the critical pore diameter d crit is the smallest diameter above which the pores begin to connect and allow the water movement in the concrete thus cement content has an important role since an increase in the cement content reflect an increase in the d crit value consequently the percentage of interconnected pores is lower this behavior can be observed in table 2 which shows an increase in the percentage of interconnected pores as cement content decreases fig 18 shows this trend among the data obtained these concrete properties corroborate with previous affirmations regarding the structures present in marine atmosphere zone even structures present more distant of the contact with the sea water severe damages due to the reinforced corrosion can be observed since the pore network in concrete can allow easy ionic flow moreover it is possible to note comparing cement content and porosimetry parameters of structures present in tidal and splash zones in table 2 that while increasing the cement content reflects an increase in d crit value the reduction on the percentage of interconnected pores is not drastic this means that in this case structures with a cement content of 300 kg m³ can present the same difficult for chlorides mobility in the concrete pores as structures with cement content above 400 kg m³ in the case of point number 73 table 2 the structure presented a high cement content leading to a network of pores with fewer pores interconnections however due to its proximity to seawater and wetting drying cycles concrete pores remain saturated for a long time contributing to lower the values of electrical resistivity indicating that the aggressiveness level of this zone is high even presenting a high cement content in summary it is possible to conclude that concrete properties with respect to both the cement content and the porosity data mainly in relation to the value of d crit and their percentage of interconnected pores play a key role in order to complement the analyzes performed regarding the aggressiveness to which a structure is subjected in a given marine aggressive zone explaining the different levels of aggressiveness to which the structures are subject thus not only the interpretation of the marine aggressive zone and the value of electrical resistivity are sufficient to characterize the actual aggressiveness level to which a structure is subjected but also parameters related to concrete porosity are indispensable for the accomplishment of a concise analysis 3 3 electrical resistivity analysis and proposal of new limit values for probable corrosion risk table 3 presents the electrical resistivity values obtained in the 74 points according to their respective structures and predominant marine aggressive zones table 4 presents the mean values and standard deviation according to the respective predominant marine aggressive zone in which the structures are present it s worth to say that using statistical analysis the outlying points were excluded from original data resulting in mean values of resistivity equal to 36 03 kω cm 12 31 kω cm and 3 23 kω cm to marine atmosphere zone splash zone and tidal zone respectively table 4 according to table 3 most of the structures in marine atmosphere zone presented resistivity values between 10 kω cm and 50 kω cm which correspond to a moderate probable corrosion risk according to the criterion adopted by reference rilem recommendation tc154 emc 2000 this observation agrees with the degradation state of the structures at arvoredo s island as shown in fig 3 in addition according to table 4 tidal zone showed the lowest mean value of electrical resistivity less than 5 kω cm which agrees with the previous statements that these values are conditioned to the saturation degree of the pore network due to the proximity of these structures to sea water the same considerations can be extended to the splash zone where the mean value found was less than 10 kω cm indicating a high corrosion risk according to the criteria established by reference rilem recommendation tc154 emc 2000 in this case the structures presented in these zones tidal and splash often present a high saturation degree in their pores due to the wetting drying cycles increasing the fluid movement inside the concrete porous system and consequently contributing to lower the concrete electrical resistivity indicating that these structures could be severely attacked due to reinforcement corrosion observing the electrical resistivity of the structures present in a marine atmosphere zone table 4 it is possible to notice a great difference in relation to the mean values ound for the structures present in the other zones however the values obtained shown that there is a significant probable corrosion risk for structures present in this zone according to the reference rilem recommendation tc154 emc 2000 agreeing with previous statements regarding the concrete quality and the degradation state of the structures present at arvoredo s island exemplified at figs 3 7 and 8 at this point based on the degradation state of concrete structures and electrical resistivity values obtained it is possible to carry out an analysis looking for propose new limit values of concrete electrical resistivity which correlate with the probable corrosion risk of the reinforcements in order to refine the existing ones or yet for a specific application in concrete structures present for more than 40 years in the marine environment observing points 1 2 3 and 4 belonging to concrete stair 2 present in splash zone it is possible to note that the structure presented electrical resistivity values between 2 30 kω cm and 15 40 kω cm being a severely compromised structurally by the reinforcement corrosion with partial collapses of its steps these low values are justified once water can penetrate concrete pores in a multidirectional way in other words water can penetrate through the upside of the stair steps raising the water content in the concrete porous and consequently reducing the concrete electrical resistivity points identified as 9 10 16 28 and 35 belonging to the pillars of the platform present predominantly in splash zone and eventually marine atmosphere zone of high aggressiveness due to marine aerosol presented resistivity values between 10 50 kω cm and 19 80 kω cm showing an advanced reinforcement corrosion degree of these structures and a porous concrete due to corrosion spots on concrete surface in this way these structures parts receive a significant splash from the breaking waves against the rock formations where this structure was built consequently low electrical resistivity values are justified points 56 and 57 belonging to concrete stair 1 present in marine atmosphere zone however with a low cement content presented electrical resistivity values equal to 13 60 kω cm and 6 70 kω cm respectively being observed reinforcement corrosion and spalling of the concrete cover as observed at fig 3 in this way the low cement concrete contributes to a high percentage of interconnected pores consequently water present in the pores network present high mobility facilitating the ionic charge flux and contributing to low resistivity values points 65 to 67 belonging to the atelier present in marine atmosphere zone of high aggressiveness due to marine aerosol and eventually splashes during strong sea turmoil presented resistivity values between 14 50 and 18 30 kω cm this structure presents an imminent risk of structural collapse due to reinforcement corrosion once due to breaking waves against the rock formation where this structure was built the pores frequently are saturated in this structure contributing to low electrical resistivity values and for the severe degradation state presented from these data it is possible to note that for structures present in the marine environment for more than 40 years values of electrical resistivity less than 20 kω cm represent a high reinforcement corrosion risk in addition structures whose electrical resistivity value was lower than 15 kω cm showed severe damage due to reinforcement corrosion including structures with imminent collapse danger in this respect a very high probable corrosion risk can be referenced to values lower than 15 kω cm in the case of structures with resistivity values between 20 kω cm and 55 kω cm corrosion was observed in some structures such as points 38 and 39 platform points 45 to 47 walkway of the residence points 59 and 60 concrete stair 1 and points 69 to 71 walkway of the atelier however corrosion was not observed in visual inspection from the concrete surface of the structures present predominantly in marine atmosphere zone of moderate and low aggressiveness by the marine aerosol moderate aggressiveness platform points 11 to 15 and 17 to 20 pillar 1 22 to 26 and 29 to 34 pillar 2 36 to 40 pillar 3 low aggressiveness stair 1 points 52 61 and 62 this behavior is justified in the platform structure once 11 to 15 17 to 20 22 to 26 29 to 34 and 36 to 40 are points that receive less water from the breaking waves against the rock formation where the platform was built these points are located in the platform pillars more distant to sea water than points 9 10 and 38 39 consequently they receive less water and chlorides on its surface the same thought can be applied to points 52 61 and 62 as they are present in a high altimetric position and there are a lot of natural obstacles in front of this structure less water and chlorides are deposited on the concrete surface consequently in a visual inspection no corrosion spots where observed in this way it is possible to conclude that for values of electrical resistivity between 20 kω cm to 55 kω cm there is a moderate reinforcement corrosion probability values between 55 kω cm and 80 kω cm were recorded only at points 44 60 and 63 the first one belonging to the residence walkway marine atmosphere zone protected by the presence of natural obstacles and the last two belonging to concrete stair 1 in this case corrosion was observed only at point 44 indicating a lower corrosion probability however structures that presented values of electrical resistivity higher than 80 kω cm did not present reinforcement corrosion as in points 55 and 58 belonging to concrete stair 1 marine atmosphere zone protected by a roof of a dog kennel next to the stair 1 and points 48 to 51 belonging to the structure of the island lighthouse marine atmosphere zone protected internal faces of the lighthouse indicating a negligible risk of reinforcement corrosion in summary from an analysis of the degradation state of concrete structures present in arvoredo s island it is possible to propose values that deal with the probable reinforcement corrosion risk for concrete structures present in a marine environment for more than 40 years according to electrical resistivity values thus based on the described context a new proposal of electrical resistivity limits is presented at table 5 according to the degradation state of the structures at arvoredo s island together with their respective values of electrical resistivity it should be stressed that surface concrete porous was saturated in order to determine electrical resistivity so these proposed values are based on this field condition from the values described at table 5 that compiles values of electrical resistivity and probable reinforcement corrosion risk in publications found in the literature it is possible to note that in a general way the values proposed in this work are close to the values presented in literature reference rilem recommendation tc154 emc 2000 being inserted another category of aggressiveness this fact demonstrates that the limits proposed in this study come to refine the current values or yet to propose limits for exclusive applications in real structures with more than 40 years present in the marine environment both considering concrete surface porous saturated it is worth mention that for analysis and modeling about concrete structures service life present in the marine environment the characterization of the concrete used is an important tool for a concise analysis 4 conclusions based on the results of this experimental investigation the following conclusions are drawn 1 the concrete properties especially with respect to cement content and parameters of interconnected pores and critical pore diameter obtained from the porosimetry test by mercury intrusion complement the electrical resistivity analyzes and the probable reinforcement corrosion risk for reinforced concrete structures present in a marine environment in this case even structures distant from the direct contact of seawater may present severe corrosion risks due to the characteristics and dosage of the materials used in the concrete 2 the structures present in tidal and splash zones presented the smaller electrical resistivity values in function of the frequent saturation degree of the concrete pores thus structures present in these zones tend to present low values of electrical resistivity and at the same time facilitate the charge flow inside the concrete in this way structures present in these zones can present a severe degradation level due to the reinforcement corrosion even in concretes that present high cement content 3 new limits values regarding the probable corrosion risk and electrical resistivity were proposed for applications in real structures present in the marine environment for more than 40 years the values obtained are close to the values recommended in the literature a new category was applied with new ranges of resistivity values thus it is possible to contribute not only to a specific application but also to refine the existing data allowing more precise qualitative analyzes regarding the service life of concrete structures acknowledgments the authors would like to thank fernando lee foundation for the support

22608,the computational fluid dynamics cfd method based on solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations was used to simulate the flow field of the body wave interaction a dynamic mesh strategy which combines the sliding interface technique and the dynamic layering technique was adopted to handle the mesh update due to the body motion in the simulation this mesh strategy was capable of treating the arbitrary translational and rotational motions of the body to validate its performance the mesh strategy was implemented with the cfd solver ansys fluent and was applied to solve the 2 d problem of a freely floating box shaped structure subjected to the focused wave the present numerical results were compared with the published experimental data and numerical results for the case of wave generation the present dynamic mesh strategy incurred 4 loss in accuracy and 6 loss in efficiency compared to the static mesh strategy for the case of body wave interaction the accuracies of the present dynamic mesh strategy and the dynamic overset mesh technique were at the same level in addition an application of the present dynamic mesh strategy to the 3 d simulation of a damaged ship capsizing in regular beam wave was demonstrated keywords floating body body wave interaction sliding interface technique dynamic layering technique cfd 1 introduction in the design of ships and other floating structures the estimation of wave induced load and motion responses of structures are critical issues for assessing structure strength and hydrodynamic performance the computational fluid dynamics cfd method is widely used to estimate structure wave interactive dynamics the numerical models developed were mainly based on the potential flow theory with the boundary element method gao and zou 2008 guerber et al 2012 dombre et al 2015 christensen et al 2018 the viscous flow theory with the body conformal mesh method carrica et al 2007 guo et al 2012 chen et al 2016a b bharath et al

hybrid approach coupling the potential flow and viscous flow theories ferrant et al 2002 sueyoshi et al 2007 nam et al 2011 gao and vassalos 2015 with the development of high performance computers the body conformal mesh method based on solving the navier stokes ns equations is getting more applications in practical design of marine structures one of the key issues for solving the ns equations utilizing the body conformal mesh method is how to deal with the body motion in the computation because the body surface is a part of the boundary of the fluid domain it is necessary to update the computation mesh according to the geometry change in the fluid domain resulting from the body motion the mesh deforming method batina 1990 is commonly used to handle the mesh update guo et al 2012 chen et al 2016a but the mesh might be distorted severely or even become invalid when the body undergoes translation and rotation with large amplitudes the method of adaptive mesh refinement mavriplis 1997 is suitable for arbitrary motions of a body liang et al 2007 zhu et al 2009 wackers et al 2012 its main drawbacks are time consumption and possible failure to generate a mesh with desirable qualities a sophisticated method for addressing the large amplitude motion of a body is the dynamic overset mesh technique benek et al 1983 this method has been applied to practical hydrodynamic problems involving structure wave interactions carrica et al 2007 chen and yu 2009 zhao et al 2015 bharath et al 2018 with the overset mesh technique the mesh quality can be maintained in the simulation but the computational cost at least doubles due to the complexity of mesh processing such as hole cutting and cell interpolation since the mesh quality and computational efficiency are two important factors for consideration it is desirable to update the mesh without deforming remeshing and hole cutting both the sliding interface technique blades and marcum 2007 and the dynamic layering technique ansys fluent inc 2008 have such desirable features the former has the unique advantage of handling the body rotation motion mcnaughton et al 2014 zhang and liang 2015 gu et al 2016 the latter is designed to allow arbitrary translation motion of a body han et al 2015 chen et al 2016b gao et al 2018 a concept of combining these two techniques was adopted by zhan et al 2017 to update the mesh following the motion of floating breakwater their study demonstrated great potential for the combination concept to deal with the body rotational and translational motions however like other dynamic mesh techniques the techniques of sliding interface and dynamic layering could inevitably reduce the original accuracy of the numerical solution for a simulation sensitive to the computation mesh such as wave propagation the adverse effect due to the mesh motion may be large but there are few reports on this effect in the literature in this study the dynamic mesh strategy which combines the techniques of sliding interface and dynamic layering was employed to deal with floating body motion in waves the study aim was to validate the performance of this mesh strategy for the simulation of structure wave interaction that involves large amplitude motion of a body to this end the benchmarking study of a 2 d floating box subjected to the focused wave was carried out including the time and grid dependence study the dynamic mesh strategy against the static mesh strategy and the computation against the experiment the computation accuracy and efficiency were discussed the error in wave simulations stemming from the sliding interface and dynamic layering techniques was clarified and quantified moreover an application of the above mesh strategy to the 3 d ship wave interaction problem was presented 2 methodology 2 1 governing equations of fluid motion the present method considers incompressible flow involving water and air the fluid motion is governed by the continuity and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations the interfaces between different fluids are captured using the volume of fluid method the governing equations described in the global coordinate system gs which is a space fixed cartesian coordinate system are as follows 1 x i ρ u i u m i 0 2 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j u m j x j μ μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j k p x i ρ g i 3 α t x j α u j u m j 0 where t is the time x i i 1 2 3 is the coordinate component u i is the fluid velocity component in the x i direction u m i is the mesh velocity component in the x i direction ρ αρ 1 1 α ρ 2 is the effective density ρ 1 and ρ 2 are the densities of water and air respectively μ αμ 1 1 α μ 2 is the effective viscosity μ 1 and μ 2 are the viscosities of water and air respectively α is the fluid volume fraction which is set to 1 in the water region 0 in the air region and between 0 and 1 for the interface p is the pressure g i is the component of gravitational acceleration in the x i direction δ ij is the kronecker delta k is the turbulence kinetic energy and μ t is the turbulent viscosity the shear stress transport k ω model menter 1994 is utilized for turbulence modelling 2 2 governing equations of floating body motion the floating body is assumed to be a rigid body its translational motion is determined by solving the following linear momentum equations described in the gs 4 m u c f where m denotes the mass of the body c denotes the centre of m u c is the velocity vector of c and f is the resultant vector of forces acting on the body the rotational motion of the rigid body is governed by the following angular momentum equations described in the body fixed cartesian coordinate system bs 5 j c ω ω j c ω m c where j c is the tensor of inertia moments of the body with respect to c and remains constant with respect to the bs ω is the angular velocity vector of the body and m c is the resultant vector of moments acting on the body with respect to c 2 3 numerical method the commercial cfd solver fluent 12 0 ansys fluent inc 2008 is employed to solve the governing equations of the fluid motion they are discretised by the finite volume method on a collocated grid the euler implicit scheme is used for the temporal discretisation of flow variables except for the fluid volume fraction which is discretised in an explicit manner the convective terms in eqs 1 and 2 are discretised by the second order upwind scheme eq 3 is solved using the compressive interface capturing scheme for arbitrary meshes proposed by ubbink 1997 the flow behaviour in the near wall region is modelled using a wall treatment which switches automatically from the viscous sublayer formulation to the wall function depending on the grid size the simple algorithm is employed for pressure velocity coupling once the flow properties are solved by the above numerical method the resultant forces and moments acting on the body can be evaluated then the velocity of the body is obtained by integrating eqs 4 and 5 over time with an explicit method gao et al 2011 and the body displacement is determined in the same way the corresponding algorithm is implemented in fluent utilizing the user define function udf 2 4 dynamic mesh strategy a combined dynamic mesh strategy is used to handle the mesh update according to the 6 dof body motion to explicitly present this mesh strategy the 3 dof body motion in a 2 d problem is considered the body is free to translate in the surge and heave motions and to rotate in the pitch motions the computational domain around the body is divided into six regions as shown in fig 1 region 1 translates and rotates in the same manner as the body motion region 2 undergoes the same translational motion as the body it makes region 1 rotate and slide relative to region 2 along interface 1 utilizing the sliding interface technique ansys fluent inc 2008 the alignment of cell nodes for the two regions along the interface is not required so that the meshes in regions 1 and 2 move without geometrical and topological change during the computation regions 3 and 4 translate in the same manner as the heave motion of the body this means that region 2 performs the surge motion relative to regions 3 and 4 where adding or removing the layers of the cells adjacent to interfaces 2 and 3 is needed the dynamic layering technique ansys fluent inc 2008 is employed to deal with such mesh operations regions 5 and 6 are kept static in the computation but their boundaries adjacent to regions 2 3 and 4 move in the same manner as the body heave motion again the dynamic layering technique is employed to add or remove the layers of the cells adjacent to interfaces 4 and 5 the sliding interface technique is adopted to allow region 2 to slide relative to 5 and 6 along the interfaces the meshes in regions 3 4 5 and 6 remain static except those adjacent to the interfaces that needed to be updated the present dynamic mesh strategy ensures optimum mesh quality in the whole fluid domain throughout the computation and low computational cost in the mesh update procedure based on the aforementioned concept of domain subdivision and motion decomposition the sliding interface technique and the dynamic layering technique can be combined to deal with the 6 dof body motion with arbitrary amplitude the algorithm for controlling the motion of each part of the fluid domain is developed using the udf and incorporated with fluent 3 validation study 3 1 description of studied cases xing kaeding 2006 reported the model tests of the body wave interaction in the wave tank the setup of the model test is illustrated in fig 2 the wave tank was 12 0 m in length 0 3 m in width and 0 4 m in water depth a flap type wave maker was equipped at the end of the tank the flap origin was located at the bottom of the tank the focused wave was generated by a concentrating wave package defining the flapping motion as shown in fig 3 the generated waves concentrated and reached a large amplitude at a position 2 11 m away from the wave maker the wave elevations were measured using two water height probes p1 and p2 which were placed at distances of 1 16 m and 2 66 m respectively away from the wave maker a rectangular box made of aluminium plates was initially placed at a distance 2 11 m away from the wave maker the box dimensions were 0 1 m in length 0 29 m in width and 0 05 m in height and its density was 680 kg m3 the motion of the box was measured by a digital camera system two model tests were performed i e the wave generation without the box disturbance and the wave box interaction these two tests can be simplified to the 2 d cases in the numerical simulation they were selected to validate the present dynamic mesh strategy described in section 2 4 all computations were performed on a workstation equipped with a 20 core processor intel xeon 2 4 ghz 3 2 focused wave generation a 2 d numerical wave tank is created based on the cfd method and applied to generate the above mentioned focused wave without the body disturbance fig 4 shows the sketch of the tank the size of which is 12 0 m in length and 1 4 m in height the water height is 0 4 m the left boundary of the tank is composed of two parts i e the lower part and the upper part the no slip moving boundary condition is imposed on the lower part which represents the wave flap following the rotational motion described in fig 3 the height of the flap is 0 6 m on the top boundary and the upper part of the left boundary the pressure is set to be atmospheric pressure the no slip boundary condition is imposed on the bottom boundary and the right boundary when the flap moves during the calculation the upper part of the left boundary of the tank will deform accordingly it is necessary to update the mesh dynamically due to the geometry change of the fluid domain the spring analogy method ansys fluent inc 2008 is employed to deform the mesh without a topological change as illustrated in fig 5 to dissipate the outgoing wave energy an artificial damping is arranged in the downstream zone of the tank the dissipation zone starts at a position 4 0 m away from the right boundary this means that the length of the working zone for the wave generation and propagation is 8 0 m the damping is implemented by adding a source term to the right hand side of eq 2 as follows park et al 1999 6 ε i 0 0 0 0 1 2 x 1 x 1 s x 1 e x 1 s 2 x 3 b x 3 x 3 b x 3 f s ρ u 3 for x 1 s x 1 x 1 e and x 3 b x 3 x 3 f s where ε i is the source term component in the x i direction the subscripts s and e denote the start and end points of the wave dissipation zone in the x 1 direction i e x direction respectively and the subscripts b and fs denote the positions of bottom and free surface of the dissipation zone in the x 3 direction i e z direction respectively eq 6 is incorporated with fluent utilizing the udf the time and grid dependence study is first conducted without the use of the dynamic mesh strategy described in section 2 4 aiming to investigate the formal accuracy of the adopted method in the context of wave generation three structured meshes namely g1 g2 and g3 described in table 1 are generated for the grid dependence study fig 6 shows the sketch of mesh g1 in the working zone the element size δx is uniform in the x direction in the wave dissipation zone δx becomes larger towards the downstream with an expansion factor of 1 05 to provide additional numerical damping for wave dissipation in the free surface area the element size δz is uniform in the z direction as the distance from the free surface area increases δz becomes larger towards the tank bottom and top boundaries with expansion factors of 1 1 and 1 2 respectively the mesh arrangements for meshes g1 g2 and g3 are similar compared to mesh g1 the meshes for g2 and g3 are refined in sequence in the free surface area with a refinement ratio of 2 the total numbers of elements for the meshes g1 g2 and g3 are approximately 21 000 60 000 and 180 000 respectively it takes approximately 12 16 and 23 cpu hours to complete a 10 s simulation for meshes g1 g2 and g3 respectively a constant time step of 0 0005 s is used in these simulations it should be pointed out that all time steps used in the present study can keep the cell courant number within the limit of 0 5 to ensure computational stability figs 7 and 8 show the comparisons of the wave elevations computed with different meshes the results of p1 show that the period and amplitude of the wave vary with time the wave components travelling with different speeds combine to form a very steep wave as recorded at p2 the wave elevations obtained on mesh g1 are under predicted in comparison with those obtained on meshes g2 and g3 while the results obtained on the two finer meshes are in good agreement the wave elevation of the crest and trough at p2 in the time period from 6 0 s to 10 0 s is used to evaluate the errors of the computed results the maximum and average errors between the results computed with meshes g1 and g3 are 108 3 and 33 8 respectively while those between the results computed with meshes g2 and g3 are 3 2 and 1 5 respectively fig 9 compares the computed wave profiles at the region where the floating box is located in the body wave interaction test presented in section 3 4 it is shown that the computed wave surface becomes sharper as the grid resolution increases in the free surface area the wave surface obtained on mesh g1 is moderately smeared its profile changes significantly compared to that obtained on mesh g3 the wave profiles obtained on meshes g2 and g3 are similar considering the computation accuracy and cost the use of mesh g2 suffices for the focused wave generation in the present study besides the grid size the time step is required to be small enough to reduce the numerical dissipation in the simulation to investigate the influence of the time step on the numerical accuracy three time steps set as 0 001 s 0 0005 s and 0 00025 s namely t1 t2 and t3 are tested in this study mesh g2 listed in table 1 is employed in the time dependence study it takes 9 16 and 29 cpu hours to complete a 10 s simulation for the time steps t1 t2 and t3 respectively the computed wave elevations at p1 and p2 are shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively before the wave components concentrate the results computed with the three time steps are in good agreement after the focused waves are formed the maximum wave elevation at p2 obtained with time step t1 differs largely from those obtained with smaller time steps for this peak the numerical error between time steps t1 and t3 is 8 3 while that between time steps t2 and t3 is 2 1 the above comparisons demonstrate that time step t2 can ensure acceptable numerical accuracy with relatively lower computational cost the results computed with time step t2 and mesh g2 are verified by the model test data figs 12 and 13 show the comparisons of the numerical and experimental results for the wave elevation at p1 the wave amplitude and phase obtained by the computation are generally in good agreement with the experimental ones for the wave elevation at p2 the differences between the numerical and experimental results become large the target wave amplitude is over predicted in the numerical simulation with error of 8 4 the phase difference between the maximum peaks of wave elevation obtained by the two methods is approximately 0 1 s the average errors between the numerical and experimental results at p1 and p2 are 11 6 and 28 1 respectively combined with the time and grid dependence study the benchmarking results reflect the performance of the present mathematical model in the application of focused wave generation 3 3 effect of dynamic mesh on wave generation the dynamic mesh strategy depicted in section 2 4 utilizes the sliding interface technique and the dynamic layering technique to perform the flow communications between two adjacent regions that move relative to each other these two techniques should have effects on the computation accuracy to investigate this effect the dynamic mesh strategy is now included in the case of focused wave generation a mesh denoted as g4 is generated for the current investigation test the mesh arrangement of g4 refers to mesh g2 except for the domain illustrated in fig 14 the exceptional domain involves the body wave interaction to be discussed in section 3 4 this domain is divided into five regions the unstructured mesh is arranged in regions 1 and 2 where the element size is approximately 0 005 m in regions 3 and 4 the structured mesh with element sizes δx and δz of 0 01 m and 0 005 m is arranged away from the above regions the mesh arrangement of g4 gradually becomes the same as the arrangement of mesh g2 the total numbers of elements for mesh g4 is approximately 65 000 to emulate the mesh movement resulting from the body motion except for region 5 which remains static the other four regions move following the surge heave and pitch motions defined as follows 7 u x u 0 cos 2 π t t 0 8 u z u 0 cos 2 π t t 0 9 ω ω 0 cos 2 π t t 0 where u x and u z denote the linear velocities in the x and z directions respectively ω denotes the angular velocity about the geometry centre of region 1 u 0 and ω 0 denote the amplitudes of the linear and angular velocities respectively and t 0 denotes the motion period the motion parameters are selected as u 0 0 3 m s ω 0 180 s and t 0 1 0 s the corresponding amplitudes of the surge heave and pitch motions are 0 048 m 0 048 m and 28 7 respectively such motion amplitudes are relatively large with regard to the focused wave amplitude of approximately 0 05 m reported in section 3 2 region 1 translates and rotates simultaneously according to eqs 7 9 region 2 surges and heaves simultaneously according to eqs 7 and 8 regions 3 and 4 heave according to eq 8 two simulations of wave generation with and without the action of region motion are performed on mesh g4 the time step used in the simulations is 0 0005 s the obtained results are coded as g4s and g4d g4s denotes that the present dynamic mesh strategy is inactive and the mesh in the regions 1 to 5 remains static during the computation while g4d denotes that the dynamic mesh strategy is active fig 15 shows the comparison of the wave profiles obtained on static mesh g2 and dynamic mesh g4 near the moving domain in general the wave profiles obtained on the two meshes are similar however it is found that the wave surface obtained on mesh g4 is discontinuous on both sides of the interface between the two regions an example of such discontinuity is illustrated in fig 16 the discontinuity on the dynamic mesh g4d is much clearer than that on the static mesh g4s the discontinuity of g4s results from the nonalignment of the mesh node on both sides of the interface so called non conformal mesh which requires additional mathematical operation to calculate fluxes from one region to another additional numerical error due to such operation is produced when the region moves during the computation e g g4d more mathematical operations based on the sliding interface and dynamic layering techniques are performed as a result the numerical error resulting from the non conformal mesh becomes large to quantify the numerical error stemming from the dynamic mesh strategy figs 17 and 18 compare the wave elevations obtained on the static and dynamic meshes at p1 and p2 respectively on the one hand good agreement between the results at p1 indicates that the dynamic mesh strategy has little influence on the accuracy of flow field simulation in front of the moving domain on the other hand the three computed wave elevations at p2 are nearly identical except for the two peaks appearing at approximately 7 75 s and 8 53 s for these two peak values the results of g2 and g4s are very close while the results of g4d are under predicted with errors of 3 5 and 6 1 compared to the results of g2 the comparison indicates that the influence of the non conformal mesh on the computation accuracy is negligible for the case of static mesh for the case of dynamic mesh the numerical error due to the non conformal mesh is moderate and slightly affects further wave propagation after the moving domain considering the error between the results of g2 and the experiment see fig 13 the computation error attributed to the present dynamic mesh strategy is acceptable in addition the dynamic mesh g4 takes approximately 17 cpu hours to complete a 10 s simulation its computation cost is approximately 6 more than that of the static mesh g2 it demonstrates that the present dynamic mesh strategy is highly efficient 3 4 body wave interaction the present numerical method is applied to simulate the case of body wave interaction the freely floating box described in section 3 1 is included in the focused wave generation the mesh generated for the current simulation is identical to mesh g4 except for region 1 which is partly subtracted by the floating box fig 19 illustrates the mesh arrangement in the vicinity of the box the simulation confirms that the value of y plus which measures the distance from the box surface to the centroid of the first element is less than 80 the number of mesh elements for the whole computational domain is approximately 65 000 during the computation region 1 translates and rotates following the box s surge heave and pitch motions region 2 translates following the box surge and heave motions regions 3 and 4 translate following the box heave motion region 5 is kept static the computational time step is 0 0005 s it takes nearly 20 cpu hours to complete a 10 s simulation fig 20 shows the snapshots of the motions of the wave and box at different time points in the present simulation it is observed that the wave amplitude and length are relatively large compared to the box dimensions the wave behaviours occurring in the body wave interactions such as climbing overtopping transmission and reflection are captured correspondingly the responses of the box surge heave and pitch motions are large the results demonstrate that the present dynamic mesh strategy can effectively deal with the motion of the freely floating body regardless of the motion amplitude figs 21 23 compare the present results of box 3 dof motions with the results published by xing kaeding 2006 the published results were obtained by the model test and the rans method based on the dynamic overset mesh technique before 7 2 s the box motions obtained by the present computation are satisfactory when compared with the experimental data after that the differences between the two results e g the motion amplitude period and phase become large the error between the numerical and experimental results of the box motion is mainly attributed to the error in wave generation by the present numerical method see fig 13 in the time period from 7 2 s to 8 2 s the computed wave elevation at p2 has an approximately 0 1 s phase lag relative to the experimental result the computed wave amplitude is larger than the experimental one thus the box movement in the present computation is slower than that in the experiment for the surge heave and pitch amplitudes the average errors between the present computation and the experiment are 10 8 14 0 and 3 2 respectively note that the box inertia moment j cyy used in the present computation is 1 593 10 3 kg m2 this value is probably not equal to the original value which was not stated in the literature xing kaeding 2006 the different values of j cyy adopted in the computation and experiment could also result in error between the computed and measured pitch motions especially for the motion period compared to the results computed with the dynamic overset mesh method the box motions at the initial stage t 7 2 s are better predicted by the present numerical method at the later stage the results obtained by the two numerical methods are at the same level of accuracy fig 24 shows the comparison of wave profiles and box attitudes obtained by the present method and experiment the time instant for the snapshot of the numerical result is 0 1 s later than the experimental result due to the phase difference between the two results as discussed previously it is observed that the box floating attitudes obtained by the computation and experiment are in good agreement the difference in wave profiles in the computation and experiment is large at the time instant around 7 2 s while it becomes small at the later time instant it is apparent that the wave can pass the lateral gap between the box and tank in the experiment this phenomenon does not occur in our 2 d wave tank thus the error between the numerical and experimental results may also stem from the 2 d assumption in the present computation 4 application to 3 d problem to demonstrate its performance in the 3 d practical use the present dynamic mesh strategy is applied to simulate the capsizing behaviour of damaged ship in regular beam wave the selected ship is the frigate dtmb 5415 with two damaged compartments which are located at the left side of the midship to account for the asymmetry flooding of water the damaged frigate is shown in fig 25 its main particulars are summarized in table 2 the length of incoming wave is 3 058 m the corresponding wave period is 1 4 s which is close to the frigate s natural roll period the wave height is 0 122 m the water depth is 2 m only the sway heave and roll motions of the ship are considered the computational domain is depicted in fig 26 its size is 20 348 m in length 8 769 m in breadth and 3 53 m in height at the inlet boundary the fluid velocity and water surface elevation that are determined by the second order stokes theory are imposed to generate the incident wave at the outlet boundary the water height and pressure are set equal to the still water level and hydrostatic pressure respectively the no slip wall condition is imposed on the other boundaries the computational domain is divided into six regions region 1 translates and rotates following the ship s sway heave and roll motions region 2 translates following the ship s sway and heave motions regions 3 and 4 translate following the ship s sway motion regions 5 and 6 are kept static the hexahedral mesh elements are generated for the whole computational domain as shown in fig 27 in region 1 the element sizes of the hull surface in the x and z directions are approximately 0 02 m and 0 01 m respectively the size of element adjacent to the hull surface in the y direction is 0 003 m which makes the y plus value to be less than 100 the element sizes inside the compartments are approximately 0 01 m in regions 2 3 and 4 the element sizes gradually expand away from the hull and from free surface in regions 5 and 6 the element sizes near the free surface in the y and z directions are 0 076 m and 0 031 m respectively they gradually expand towards the outer boundaries except for the inlet boundary the number of mesh elements in the computational domain is about 1 7 million the numerical simulation ran for up to 15 s and used 73 cpu hours in this computation the adopted time step was 0 002 s at the beginning of simulation the two floodable compartments were empty the frigate remained intact till its motion became stable at the time of 12 442 s the ship rolled to a maximum angle at the starboard side simultaneously the damaged openings were completely opened after that the water started to flood into the compartments figs 28 and 29 show the heave and roll motions of the frigate before and after the flooding occurred for the frigate in intact condition the amplitudes of heave and roll motions are approximately 0 057 m and 32 respectively after the frigate is damaged it sinks more than 0 2 m in a short time the frigate starts to capsize after a half period of roll motion and is finally upside down fig 30 illustrates the capsizing process of the damaged frigate in wave as a preliminary demonstration the above simulation showcases the feasibility of applying the present dynamic mesh strategy to complex ship wave interaction problems 5 conclusion a dynamic mesh strategy which combines the sliding interface technique and the dynamic layering technique is implemented in the rans solver to accommodate the large amplitude motion of a freely floating body on a wave two tests cases i e the focused wave generation and the floating box motion on a focused wave are selected to validate the present dynamic mesh strategy in the wave generation test a series of simulations are performed using different time steps mesh resolutions and mesh strategies static and dynamic to investigate the factors affecting the computation accuracy and efficiency it is found that the time histories of the wave elevation obtained by the computation and experiment are generally in good agreement the error of the target wave amplitudes obtained by the experiment and by the computation with the static mesh is 8 when the dynamic mesh strategy is activated an error of 4 is introduced compared to the static mesh result correspondingly the computation cost is increased by 6 the investigation indicates that the effects of the adopted dynamic mesh strategy on the computation accuracy and efficiency are small in the box wave interaction test the amplitudes of the box motion obtained by the present method are satisfactory in comparison with the experimental results the phases and periods of the box motion obtained by the computation and experiment are different mainly due to the error in wave generation in the numerical simulation additionally the present numerical results are compared with the results computed with the dynamic overset mesh method this demonstrates that the accuracies of the two dynamic mesh methods are similar the validation study has comprehensively examined the ability of the present dynamic mesh strategy to deal with large amplitude motions of the body in the simple application finally a preliminary demonstration of applying the mesh strategy to the case of damaged ship capsizing in wave is presented the rigorous validation study of the present method in the realistic ship wave interaction problems will be carried out in the future work acknowledgments this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51609186 51609187 51609188 51509119

22608,the computational fluid dynamics cfd method based on solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations was used to simulate the flow field of the body wave interaction a dynamic mesh strategy which combines the sliding interface technique and the dynamic layering technique was adopted to handle the mesh update due to the body motion in the simulation this mesh strategy was capable of treating the arbitrary translational and rotational motions of the body to validate its performance the mesh strategy was implemented with the cfd solver ansys fluent and was applied to solve the 2 d problem of a freely floating box shaped structure subjected to the focused wave the present numerical results were compared with the published experimental data and numerical results for the case of wave generation the present dynamic mesh strategy incurred 4 loss in accuracy and 6 loss in efficiency compared to the static mesh strategy for the case of body wave interaction the accuracies of the present dynamic mesh strategy and the dynamic overset mesh technique were at the same level in addition an application of the present dynamic mesh strategy to the 3 d simulation of a damaged ship capsizing in regular beam wave was demonstrated keywords floating body body wave interaction sliding interface technique dynamic layering technique cfd 1 introduction in the design of ships and other floating structures the estimation of wave induced load and motion responses of structures are critical issues for assessing structure strength and hydrodynamic performance the computational fluid dynamics cfd method is widely used to estimate structure wave interactive dynamics the numerical models developed were mainly based on the potential flow theory with the boundary element method gao and zou 2008 guerber et al 2012 dombre et al 2015 christensen et al 2018 the viscous flow theory with the body conformal mesh method carrica et al 2007 guo et al 2012 chen et al 2016a b bharath et al 2018 the cartesian mesh method hu and kashiwagi 2008 peng et al 2013 bergmann et al 2015 ghasemi et al 2017 the meshless method bouscasse et al 2013 ren et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 gunn 2017 and the hybrid approach coupling the potential flow and viscous flow theories ferrant et al 2002 sueyoshi et al 2007 nam et al 2011 gao and vassalos 2015 with the development of high performance computers the body conformal mesh method based on solving the navier stokes ns equations is getting more applications in practical design of marine structures one of the key issues for solving the ns equations utilizing the body conformal mesh method is how to deal with the body motion in the computation because the body surface is a part of the boundary of the fluid domain it is necessary to update the computation mesh according to the geometry change in the fluid domain resulting from the body motion the mesh deforming method batina 1990 is commonly used to handle the mesh update guo et al 2012 chen et al 2016a but the mesh might be distorted severely or even become invalid when the body undergoes translation and rotation with large amplitudes the method of adaptive mesh refinement mavriplis 1997 is suitable for arbitrary motions of a body liang et al 2007 zhu et al 2009 wackers et al 2012 its main drawbacks are time consumption and possible failure to generate a mesh with desirable qualities a sophisticated method for addressing the large amplitude motion of a body is the dynamic overset mesh technique benek et al 1983 this method has been applied to practical hydrodynamic problems involving structure wave interactions carrica et al 2007 chen and yu 2009 zhao et al 2015 bharath et al 2018 with the overset mesh technique the mesh quality can be maintained in the simulation but the computational cost at least doubles due to the complexity of mesh processing such as hole cutting and cell interpolation since the mesh quality and computational efficiency are two important factors for consideration it is desirable to update the mesh without deforming remeshing and hole cutting both the sliding interface technique blades and marcum 2007 and the dynamic layering technique ansys fluent inc 2008 have such desirable features the former has the unique advantage of handling the body rotation motion mcnaughton et al 2014 zhang and liang 2015 gu et al 2016 the latter is designed to allow arbitrary translation motion of a body han et al 2015 chen et al 2016b gao et al 2018 a concept of combining these two techniques was adopted by zhan et al 2017 to update the mesh following the motion of floating breakwater their study demonstrated great potential for the combination concept to deal with the body rotational and translational motions however like other dynamic mesh techniques the techniques of sliding interface and dynamic layering could inevitably reduce the original accuracy of the numerical solution for a simulation sensitive to the computation mesh such as wave propagation the adverse effect due to the mesh motion may be large but there are few reports on this effect in the literature in this study the dynamic mesh strategy which combines the techniques of sliding interface and dynamic layering was employed to deal with floating body motion in waves the study aim was to validate the performance of this mesh strategy for the simulation of structure wave interaction that involves large amplitude motion of a body to this end the benchmarking study of a 2 d floating box subjected to the focused wave was carried out including the time and grid dependence study the dynamic mesh strategy against the static mesh strategy and the computation against the experiment the computation accuracy and efficiency were discussed the error in wave simulations stemming from the sliding interface and dynamic layering techniques was clarified and quantified moreover an application of the above mesh strategy to the 3 d ship wave interaction problem was presented 2 methodology 2 1 governing equations of fluid motion the present method considers incompressible flow involving water and air the fluid motion is governed by the continuity and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations the interfaces between different fluids are captured using the volume of fluid method the governing equations described in the global coordinate system gs which is a space fixed cartesian coordinate system are as follows 1 x i ρ u i u m i 0 2 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j u m j x j μ μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j k p x i ρ g i 3 α t x j α u j u m j 0 where t is the time x i i 1 2 3 is the coordinate component u i is the fluid velocity component in the x i direction u m i is the mesh velocity component in the x i direction ρ αρ 1 1 α ρ 2 is the effective density ρ 1 and ρ 2 are the densities of water and air respectively μ αμ 1 1 α μ 2 is the effective viscosity μ 1 and μ 2 are the viscosities of water and air respectively α is the fluid volume fraction which is set to 1 in the water region 0 in the air region and between 0 and 1 for the interface p is the pressure g i is the component of gravitational acceleration in the x i direction δ ij is the kronecker delta k is the turbulence kinetic energy and μ t is the turbulent viscosity the shear stress transport k ω model menter 1994 is utilized for turbulence modelling 2 2 governing equations of floating body motion the floating body is assumed to be a rigid body its translational motion is determined by solving the following linear momentum equations described in the gs 4 m u c f where m denotes the mass of the body c denotes the centre of m u c is the velocity vector of c and f is the resultant vector of forces acting on the body the rotational motion of the rigid body is governed by the following angular momentum equations described in the body fixed cartesian coordinate system bs 5 j c ω ω j c ω m c where j c is the tensor of inertia moments of the body with respect to c and remains constant with respect to the bs ω is the angular velocity vector of the body and m c is the resultant vector of moments acting on the body with respect to c 2 3 numerical method the commercial cfd solver fluent 12 0 ansys fluent inc 2008 is employed to solve the governing equations of the fluid motion they are discretised by the finite volume method on a collocated grid the euler implicit scheme is used for the temporal discretisation of flow variables except for the fluid volume fraction which is discretised in an explicit manner the convective terms in eqs 1 and 2 are discretised by the second order upwind scheme eq 3 is solved using the compressive interface capturing scheme for arbitrary meshes proposed by ubbink 1997 the flow behaviour in the near wall region is modelled using a wall treatment which switches automatically from the viscous sublayer formulation to the wall function depending on the grid size the simple algorithm is employed for pressure velocity coupling once the flow properties are solved by the above numerical method the resultant forces and moments acting on the body can be evaluated then the velocity of the body is obtained by integrating eqs 4 and 5 over time with an explicit method gao et al 2011 and the body displacement is determined in the same way the corresponding algorithm is implemented in fluent utilizing the user define function udf 2 4 dynamic mesh strategy a combined dynamic mesh strategy is used to handle the mesh update according to the 6 dof body motion to explicitly present this mesh strategy the 3 dof body motion in a 2 d problem is considered the body is free to translate in the surge and heave motions and to rotate in the pitch motions the computational domain around the body is divided into six regions as shown in fig 1 region 1 translates and rotates in the same manner as the body motion region 2 undergoes the same translational motion as the body it makes region 1 rotate and slide relative to region 2 along interface 1 utilizing the sliding interface technique ansys fluent inc 2008 the alignment of cell nodes for the two regions along the interface is not required so that the meshes in regions 1 and 2 move without geometrical and topological change during the computation regions 3 and 4 translate in the same manner as the heave motion of the body this means that region 2 performs the surge motion relative to regions 3 and 4 where adding or removing the layers of the cells adjacent to interfaces 2 and 3 is needed the dynamic layering technique ansys fluent inc 2008 is employed to deal with such mesh operations regions 5 and 6 are kept static in the computation but their boundaries adjacent to regions 2 3 and 4 move in the same manner as the body heave motion again the dynamic layering technique is employed to add or remove the layers of the cells adjacent to interfaces 4 and 5 the sliding interface technique is adopted to allow region 2 to slide relative to 5 and 6 along the interfaces the meshes in regions 3 4 5 and 6 remain static except those adjacent to the interfaces that needed to be updated the present dynamic mesh strategy ensures optimum mesh quality in the whole fluid domain throughout the computation and low computational cost in the mesh update procedure based on the aforementioned concept of domain subdivision and motion decomposition the sliding interface technique and the dynamic layering technique can be combined to deal with the 6 dof body motion with arbitrary amplitude the algorithm for controlling the motion of each part of the fluid domain is developed using the udf and incorporated with fluent 3 validation study 3 1 description of studied cases xing kaeding 2006 reported the model tests of the body wave interaction in the wave tank the setup of the model test is illustrated in fig 2 the wave tank was 12 0 m in length 0 3 m in width and 0 4 m in water depth a flap type wave maker was equipped at the end of the tank the flap origin was located at the bottom of the tank the focused wave was generated by a concentrating wave package defining the flapping motion as shown in fig 3 the generated waves concentrated and reached a large amplitude at a position 2 11 m away from the wave maker the wave elevations were measured using two water height probes p1 and p2 which were placed at distances of 1 16 m and 2 66 m respectively away from the wave maker a rectangular box made of aluminium plates was initially placed at a distance 2 11 m away from the wave maker the box dimensions were 0 1 m in length 0 29 m in width and 0 05 m in height and its density was 680 kg m3 the motion of the box was measured by a digital camera system two model tests were performed i e the wave generation without the box disturbance and the wave box interaction these two tests can be simplified to the 2 d cases in the numerical simulation they were selected to validate the present dynamic mesh strategy described in section 2 4 all computations were performed on a workstation equipped with a 20 core processor intel xeon 2 4 ghz 3 2 focused wave generation a 2 d numerical wave tank is created based on the cfd method and applied to generate the above mentioned focused wave without the body disturbance fig 4 shows the sketch of the tank the size of which is 12 0 m in length and 1 4 m in height the water height is 0 4 m the left boundary of the tank is composed of two parts i e the lower part and the upper part the no slip moving boundary condition is imposed on the lower part which represents the wave flap following the rotational motion described in fig 3 the height of the flap is 0 6 m on the top boundary and the upper part of the left boundary the pressure is set to be atmospheric pressure the no slip boundary condition is imposed on the bottom boundary and the right boundary when the flap moves during the calculation the upper part of the left boundary of the tank will deform accordingly it is necessary to update the mesh dynamically due to the geometry change of the fluid domain the spring analogy method ansys fluent inc 2008 is employed to deform the mesh without a topological change as illustrated in fig 5 to dissipate the outgoing wave energy an artificial damping is arranged in the downstream zone of the tank the dissipation zone starts at a position 4 0 m away from the right boundary this means that the length of the working zone for the wave generation and propagation is 8 0 m the damping is implemented by adding a source term to the right hand side of eq 2 as follows park et al 1999 6 ε i 0 0 0 0 1 2 x 1 x 1 s x 1 e x 1 s 2 x 3 b x 3 x 3 b x 3 f s ρ u 3 for x 1 s x 1 x 1 e and x 3 b x 3 x 3 f s where ε i is the source term component in the x i direction the subscripts s and e denote the start and end points of the wave dissipation zone in the x 1 direction i e x direction respectively and the subscripts b and fs denote the positions of bottom and free surface of the dissipation zone in the x 3 direction i e z direction respectively eq 6 is incorporated with fluent utilizing the udf the time and grid dependence study is first conducted without the use of the dynamic mesh strategy described in section 2 4 aiming to investigate the formal accuracy of the adopted method in the context of wave generation three structured meshes namely g1 g2 and g3 described in table 1 are generated for the grid dependence study fig 6 shows the sketch of mesh g1 in the working zone the element size δx is uniform in the x direction in the wave dissipation zone δx becomes larger towards the downstream with an expansion factor of 1 05 to provide additional numerical damping for wave dissipation in the free surface area the element size δz is uniform in the z direction as the distance from the free surface area increases δz becomes larger towards the tank bottom and top boundaries with expansion factors of 1 1 and 1 2 respectively the mesh arrangements for meshes g1 g2 and g3 are similar compared to mesh g1 the meshes for g2 and g3 are refined in sequence in the free surface area with a refinement ratio of 2 the total numbers of elements for the meshes g1 g2 and g3 are approximately 21 000 60 000 and 180 000 respectively it takes approximately 12 16 and 23 cpu hours to complete a 10 s simulation for meshes g1 g2 and g3 respectively a constant time step of 0 0005 s is used in these simulations it should be pointed out that all time steps used in the present study can keep the cell courant number within the limit of 0 5 to ensure computational stability figs 7 and 8 show the comparisons of the wave elevations computed with different meshes the results of p1 show that the period and amplitude of the wave vary with time the wave components travelling with different speeds combine to form a very steep wave as recorded at p2 the wave elevations obtained on mesh g1 are under predicted in comparison with those obtained on meshes g2 and g3 while the results obtained on the two finer meshes are in good agreement the wave elevation of the crest and trough at p2 in the time period from 6 0 s to 10 0 s is used to evaluate the errors of the computed results the maximum and average errors between the results computed with meshes g1 and g3 are 108 3 and 33 8 respectively while those between the results computed with meshes g2 and g3 are 3 2 and 1 5 respectively fig 9 compares the computed wave profiles at the region where the floating box is located in the body wave interaction test presented in section 3 4 it is shown that the computed wave surface becomes sharper as the grid resolution increases in the free surface area the wave surface obtained on mesh g1 is moderately smeared its profile changes significantly compared to that obtained on mesh g3 the wave profiles obtained on meshes g2 and g3 are similar considering the computation accuracy and cost the use of mesh g2 suffices for the focused wave generation in the present study besides the grid size the time step is required to be small enough to reduce the numerical dissipation in the simulation to investigate the influence of the time step on the numerical accuracy three time steps set as 0 001 s 0 0005 s and 0 00025 s namely t1 t2 and t3 are tested in this study mesh g2 listed in table 1 is employed in the time dependence study it takes 9 16 and 29 cpu hours to complete a 10 s simulation for the time steps t1 t2 and t3 respectively the computed wave elevations at p1 and p2 are shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively before the wave components concentrate the results computed with the three time steps are in good agreement after the focused waves are formed the maximum wave elevation at p2 obtained with time step t1 differs largely from those obtained with smaller time steps for this peak the numerical error between time steps t1 and t3 is 8 3 while that between time steps t2 and t3 is 2 1 the above comparisons demonstrate that time step t2 can ensure acceptable numerical accuracy with relatively lower computational cost the results computed with time step t2 and mesh g2 are verified by the model test data figs 12 and 13 show the comparisons of the numerical and experimental results for the wave elevation at p1 the wave amplitude and phase obtained by the computation are generally in good agreement with the experimental ones for the wave elevation at p2 the differences between the numerical and experimental results become large the target wave amplitude is over predicted in the numerical simulation with error of 8 4 the phase difference between the maximum peaks of wave elevation obtained by the two methods is approximately 0 1 s the average errors between the numerical and experimental results at p1 and p2 are 11 6 and 28 1 respectively combined with the time and grid dependence study the benchmarking results reflect the performance of the present mathematical model in the application of focused wave generation 3 3 effect of dynamic mesh on wave generation the dynamic mesh strategy depicted in section 2 4 utilizes the sliding interface technique and the dynamic layering technique to perform the flow communications between two adjacent regions that move relative to each other these two techniques should have effects on the computation accuracy to investigate this effect the dynamic mesh strategy is now included in the case of focused wave generation a mesh denoted as g4 is generated for the current investigation test the mesh arrangement of g4 refers to mesh g2 except for the domain illustrated in fig 14 the exceptional domain involves the body wave interaction to be discussed in section 3 4 this domain is divided into five regions the unstructured mesh is arranged in regions 1 and 2 where the element size is approximately 0 005 m in regions 3 and 4 the structured mesh with element sizes δx and δz of 0 01 m and 0 005 m is arranged away from the above regions the mesh arrangement of g4 gradually becomes the same as the arrangement of mesh g2 the total numbers of elements for mesh g4 is approximately 65 000 to emulate the mesh movement resulting from the body motion except for region 5 which remains static the other four regions move following the surge heave and pitch motions defined as follows 7 u x u 0 cos 2 π t t 0 8 u z u 0 cos 2 π t t 0 9 ω ω 0 cos 2 π t t 0 where u x and u z denote the linear velocities in the x and z directions respectively ω denotes the angular velocity about the geometry centre of region 1 u 0 and ω 0 denote the amplitudes of the linear and angular velocities respectively and t 0 denotes the motion period the motion parameters are selected as u 0 0 3 m s ω 0 180 s and t 0 1 0 s the corresponding amplitudes of the surge heave and pitch motions are 0 048 m 0 048 m and 28 7 respectively such motion amplitudes are relatively large with regard to the focused wave amplitude of approximately 0 05 m reported in section 3 2 region 1 translates and rotates simultaneously according to eqs 7 9 region 2 surges and heaves simultaneously according to eqs 7 and 8 regions 3 and 4 heave according to eq 8 two simulations of wave generation with and without the action of region motion are performed on mesh g4 the time step used in the simulations is 0 0005 s the obtained results are coded as g4s and g4d g4s denotes that the present dynamic mesh strategy is inactive and the mesh in the regions 1 to 5 remains static during the computation while g4d denotes that the dynamic mesh strategy is active fig 15 shows the comparison of the wave profiles obtained on static mesh g2 and dynamic mesh g4 near the moving domain in general the wave profiles obtained on the two meshes are similar however it is found that the wave surface obtained on mesh g4 is discontinuous on both sides of the interface between the two regions an example of such discontinuity is illustrated in fig 16 the discontinuity on the dynamic mesh g4d is much clearer than that on the static mesh g4s the discontinuity of g4s results from the nonalignment of the mesh node on both sides of the interface so called non conformal mesh which requires additional mathematical operation to calculate fluxes from one region to another additional numerical error due to such operation is produced when the region moves during the computation e g g4d more mathematical operations based on the sliding interface and dynamic layering techniques are performed as a result the numerical error resulting from the non conformal mesh becomes large to quantify the numerical error stemming from the dynamic mesh strategy figs 17 and 18 compare the wave elevations obtained on the static and dynamic meshes at p1 and p2 respectively on the one hand good agreement between the results at p1 indicates that the dynamic mesh strategy has little influence on the accuracy of flow field simulation in front of the moving domain on the other hand the three computed wave elevations at p2 are nearly identical except for the two peaks appearing at approximately 7 75 s and 8 53 s for these two peak values the results of g2 and g4s are very close while the results of g4d are under predicted with errors of 3 5 and 6 1 compared to the results of g2 the comparison indicates that the influence of the non conformal mesh on the computation accuracy is negligible for the case of static mesh for the case of dynamic mesh the numerical error due to the non conformal mesh is moderate and slightly affects further wave propagation after the moving domain considering the error between the results of g2 and the experiment see fig 13 the computation error attributed to the present dynamic mesh strategy is acceptable in addition the dynamic mesh g4 takes approximately 17 cpu hours to complete a 10 s simulation its computation cost is approximately 6 more than that of the static mesh g2 it demonstrates that the present dynamic mesh strategy is highly efficient 3 4 body wave interaction the present numerical method is applied to simulate the case of body wave interaction the freely floating box described in section 3 1 is included in the focused wave generation the mesh generated for the current simulation is identical to mesh g4 except for region 1 which is partly subtracted by the floating box fig 19 illustrates the mesh arrangement in the vicinity of the box the simulation confirms that the value of y plus which measures the distance from the box surface to the centroid of the first element is less than 80 the number of mesh elements for the whole computational domain is approximately 65 000 during the computation region 1 translates and rotates following the box s surge heave and pitch motions region 2 translates following the box surge and heave motions regions 3 and 4 translate following the box heave motion region 5 is kept static the computational time step is 0 0005 s it takes nearly 20 cpu hours to complete a 10 s simulation fig 20 shows the snapshots of the motions of the wave and box at different time points in the present simulation it is observed that the wave amplitude and length are relatively large compared to the box dimensions the wave behaviours occurring in the body wave interactions such as climbing overtopping transmission and reflection are captured correspondingly the responses of the box surge heave and pitch motions are large the results demonstrate that the present dynamic mesh strategy can effectively deal with the motion of the freely floating body regardless of the motion amplitude figs 21 23 compare the present results of box 3 dof motions with the results published by xing kaeding 2006 the published results were obtained by the model test and the rans method based on the dynamic overset mesh technique before 7 2 s the box motions obtained by the present computation are satisfactory when compared with the experimental data after that the differences between the two results e g the motion amplitude period and phase become large the error between the numerical and experimental results of the box motion is mainly attributed to the error in wave generation by the present numerical method see fig 13 in the time period from 7 2 s to 8 2 s the computed wave elevation at p2 has an approximately 0 1 s phase lag relative to the experimental result the computed wave amplitude is larger than the experimental one thus the box movement in the present computation is slower than that in the experiment for the surge heave and pitch amplitudes the average errors between the present computation and the experiment are 10 8 14 0 and 3 2 respectively note that the box inertia moment j cyy used in the present computation is 1 593 10 3 kg m2 this value is probably not equal to the original value which was not stated in the literature xing kaeding 2006 the different values of j cyy adopted in the computation and experiment could also result in error between the computed and measured pitch motions especially for the motion period compared to the results computed with the dynamic overset mesh method the box motions at the initial stage t 7 2 s are better predicted by the present numerical method at the later stage the results obtained by the two numerical methods are at the same level of accuracy fig 24 shows the comparison of wave profiles and box attitudes obtained by the present method and experiment the time instant for the snapshot of the numerical result is 0 1 s later than the experimental result due to the phase difference between the two results as discussed previously it is observed that the box floating attitudes obtained by the computation and experiment are in good agreement the difference in wave profiles in the computation and experiment is large at the time instant around 7 2 s while it becomes small at the later time instant it is apparent that the wave can pass the lateral gap between the box and tank in the experiment this phenomenon does not occur in our 2 d wave tank thus the error between the numerical and experimental results may also stem from the 2 d assumption in the present computation 4 application to 3 d problem to demonstrate its performance in the 3 d practical use the present dynamic mesh strategy is applied to simulate the capsizing behaviour of damaged ship in regular beam wave the selected ship is the frigate dtmb 5415 with two damaged compartments which are located at the left side of the midship to account for the asymmetry flooding of water the damaged frigate is shown in fig 25 its main particulars are summarized in table 2 the length of incoming wave is 3 058 m the corresponding wave period is 1 4 s which is close to the frigate s natural roll period the wave height is 0 122 m the water depth is 2 m only the sway heave and roll motions of the ship are considered the computational domain is depicted in fig 26 its size is 20 348 m in length 8 769 m in breadth and 3 53 m in height at the inlet boundary the fluid velocity and water surface elevation that are determined by the second order stokes theory are imposed to generate the incident wave at the outlet boundary the water height and pressure are set equal to the still water level and hydrostatic pressure respectively the no slip wall condition is imposed on the other boundaries the computational domain is divided into six regions region 1 translates and rotates following the ship s sway heave and roll motions region 2 translates following the ship s sway and heave motions regions 3 and 4 translate following the ship s sway motion regions 5 and 6 are kept static the hexahedral mesh elements are generated for the whole computational domain as shown in fig 27 in region 1 the element sizes of the hull surface in the x and z directions are approximately 0 02 m and 0 01 m respectively the size of element adjacent to the hull surface in the y direction is 0 003 m which makes the y plus value to be less than 100 the element sizes inside the compartments are approximately 0 01 m in regions 2 3 and 4 the element sizes gradually expand away from the hull and from free surface in regions 5 and 6 the element sizes near the free surface in the y and z directions are 0 076 m and 0 031 m respectively they gradually expand towards the outer boundaries except for the inlet boundary the number of mesh elements in the computational domain is about 1 7 million the numerical simulation ran for up to 15 s and used 73 cpu hours in this computation the adopted time step was 0 002 s at the beginning of simulation the two floodable compartments were empty the frigate remained intact till its motion became stable at the time of 12 442 s the ship rolled to a maximum angle at the starboard side simultaneously the damaged openings were completely opened after that the water started to flood into the compartments figs 28 and 29 show the heave and roll motions of the frigate before and after the flooding occurred for the frigate in intact condition the amplitudes of heave and roll motions are approximately 0 057 m and 32 respectively after the frigate is damaged it sinks more than 0 2 m in a short time the frigate starts to capsize after a half period of roll motion and is finally upside down fig 30 illustrates the capsizing process of the damaged frigate in wave as a preliminary demonstration the above simulation showcases the feasibility of applying the present dynamic mesh strategy to complex ship wave interaction problems 5 conclusion a dynamic mesh strategy which combines the sliding interface technique and the dynamic layering technique is implemented in the rans solver to accommodate the large amplitude motion of a freely floating body on a wave two tests cases i e the focused wave generation and the floating box motion on a focused wave are selected to validate the present dynamic mesh strategy in the wave generation test a series of simulations are performed using different time steps mesh resolutions and mesh strategies static and dynamic to investigate the factors affecting the computation accuracy and efficiency it is found that the time histories of the wave elevation obtained by the computation and experiment are generally in good agreement the error of the target wave amplitudes obtained by the experiment and by the computation with the static mesh is 8 when the dynamic mesh strategy is activated an error of 4 is introduced compared to the static mesh result correspondingly the computation cost is increased by 6 the investigation indicates that the effects of the adopted dynamic mesh strategy on the computation accuracy and efficiency are small in the box wave interaction test the amplitudes of the box motion obtained by the present method are satisfactory in comparison with the experimental results the phases and periods of the box motion obtained by the computation and experiment are different mainly due to the error in wave generation in the numerical simulation additionally the present numerical results are compared with the results computed with the dynamic overset mesh method this demonstrates that the accuracies of the two dynamic mesh methods are similar the validation study has comprehensively examined the ability of the present dynamic mesh strategy to deal with large amplitude motions of the body in the simple application finally a preliminary demonstration of applying the mesh strategy to the case of damaged ship capsizing in wave is presented the rigorous validation study of the present method in the realistic ship wave interaction problems will be carried out in the future work acknowledgments this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51609186 51609187 51609188 51509119

22609,the marstruct benchmark study on a small scale double hull structure penetrated by a hemispherical punch was revisited by employing a combined localized necking and stress state dependent ductile fracture model by using the limited information provided to the participants of the benchmark study the plasticity and fracture model parameters were identified to model the material behavior beyond moderate plasticity a combination of the swift and voce strain hardening laws was used the damage indicator framework using the hosford coulomb fracture model combined with the domain of shell to solid equivalence dsse concept was adopted to predict the initiation and propagation of ductile fracture using the adopted approach the predicted instant and force levels corresponding to the fracture initiation in the upper and lower plates were found to be in good agreement with the test results the deformation of the structural elements was also accurately captured the benefits of adopting the damage indicator framework and distinguishing different failure modes were investigated keywords ductile fracture ship collision shell element hosford coulomb model localized necking 1 introduction recently the marstruct virtual institute published a benchmark study on the non linear finite element simulation of a small scale double hull penetration test ringsberg et al 2018 in particular the benchmark study provided the marine structures community with an opportunity to compare their abilities and predict the ductile fracture using their preferred methodology the benchmark study participants were asked to perform a blind simulation of the quasi static penetration test using only the limited information provided which included the test structure dimensions and the strain hardening data of a steel grade that was similar to the material of the test structures the penetration test which was originally reported by karlsson et al 2009 featured the rupture of the outer and inner plates these two events dominated the overall force displacement response obtained in the test particularly the interaction between the deforming structural elements and the final rupture of the outer plate makes the numerical prediction very challenging most of the benchmark study participants used the built in options in commercial software packages such as abaqus and ls dyna wherein the fracture initiation and propagation was simulated with element removal a constant value of equivalent plastic strain was preferred as a criterion for element removal which ignores the stress state dependency of ductile fracture behavior additionally this criterion does not distinguish the failure caused by different mechanisms such as localized necking prior to fracture and through thickness fracture or surface cracking nor does it consider complex deformation paths although most of the participants captured the overall trends in the force displacement and energy displacement responses with this approach there exists a large scattering between the instants of the experimentally observed deformation and failure modes and the instants predicted numerically the relative success of the fracture prediction using a constant equivalent plastic strain criterion was not discussed in detail by ringsberg et al 2018 with regard to the stress states and loading paths experienced by the deforming and failed structural members the challenge of predicting the ductile fracture initiation with shell finite elements is not only relevant to the impact problems encountered in marine structures a wider view can be achieved particularly with regard to concepts borrowed from the sheet metal forming and automotive industries a comprehensive review of state of the art approaches in these fields has been presented by cao 2017 ductile fracture initiation in solids can be conveniently predicted with phenomenological or macroscopic models which consider a non porous solid by excluding the void nucleation and growth processes in constitutive modeling fracture initiation is assumed to occur when a scalar variable which is termed as the damage indicator and represents the loss of ductility reaches a critical value the key concept is that the damage indicator accumulates with the equivalent plastic strain increase which is typically weighted using a stress state dependent function called fracture locus based on a comprehensive experimental study covering a wide range of stress states bao and wierzbicki 2004 proposed a fracture locus that is dependent on the stress triaxiality the normalized first invariant of the stress tensor as the weighting function a similar fracture locus called rice and tracey cockcroft and latham rtcl criterion has been proposed by törnqvist 2003 with an emphasis on maritime crash applications xue 2007 demonstrated that the ductile fracture of materials depends not only on the stress triaxiality but also on the lode angle parameter which is the normalized third invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor since then advanced ductile fracture models have been developed based on the transformation of the mohr coulomb type stress based fracture criteria into the space of stress triaxiality lode angle parameter and equivalent plastic strain such as the modified mohr coulomb mmc model by bai and wierzbicki 2010 the hosford coulomb hc model by mohr and marcadet 2015 and the model by lou et al 2017 these models are associated with very fine solid mesh applications to capture the local three dimensional stress state and localizations limiting our attention to the direct application of such models with shell elements wherein the plane stress conditions are valid an issue arises if the localized necking precedes the initiation of ductile fracture localized necking occurs under the biaxial stretching of plates within the region bounded by two extreme cases uniaxial tension and equi biaxial tension and is the main source of the mesh size sensitivity of ductile fracture prediction with shell elements as has been demonstrated in detail by pack and mohr 2017 a mesh scaling framework is typically adopted to deal with the mesh size sensitivity where the equivalent plastic strain to fracture is regularized with the element size instead of scaling the fracture locus simply as a function of the element size walters 2014 and kõrgesaar et al 2014 kõrgesaar and romanoff 2014 demonstrated that stress state dependent mesh scaling is more reasonable on the other hand as discussed in detail by alsos et al 2009 and storheim et al 2015a the strain localizations caused by the structural geometry geometric mesh size sensitivity should be distinguished from the material mesh size sensitivity which the element size dependent fracture criteria attempt to address another alternative to overcome the mesh size sensitivity issue is to consider the onset of localized necking as a state of failure a forming limit curve flc is a convenient way of describing the onset of localized necking in thin plates subjected to biaxial stretching flcs are used in the sheet metal forming industry but have various limitations in particular the flcs expressed in the space of principal strains are valid only for proportional loading paths the path dependency is somehow less if the flc is established in the principal stress space i e a stress based flc stoughton and zhu 2004 an example of the stress based flc is the bressan and williams hill bwh criterion proposed by alsos et al 2008 which is well known in the marine structures community another limitation of the flc based fracture prediction is that the flcs are valid under conditions of membrane biaxial stretching and do not include bending effects in the numerical implementation of the flcs or localized necking based fracture models in general for use with shell finite elements an element is removed if the mid layer through thickness integration satisfies the localized necking criterion this causes somehow early failure prediction under stretch bending deformation such as the case of stiffened panel penetration see alsos et al 2009 storheim et al 2015a b the early failure prediction issue may be addressed by employing a damage induced softening law which ensures that the stiffness of the element gradually decreases when the failure condition is satisfied among others hogström and ringsberg 2012 applied the softening approach in conjunction with the bwh criterion while abubakar and dow 2013 adopted the hill stören and rice criterion as a localized necking criterion in both cases the built in functions of the commercial software package abaqus were used storheim et al 2015a developed a similar approach and incorporated it with a user defined subroutine in ls dyna however the effect of bending deformation was not considered directly in any of those studies li et al 2010 reported that the through thickness integration points are subjected to different stress states and that the loading paths are not necessarily proportional during punching which is a common sheet metal forming process moreover it has been demonstrated that the through thickness fracture caused by arbitrary combinations of membrane and bending deformations can be captured provided that the element is deleted when all of the through thickness integration points satisfy the failure criterion stoughton and yoon 2011 underlined this important observation and identified the failure modes based on the through thickness stress distribution which are localized necking preceding ductile fracture and surface cracking owing to excessive bending without through thickness necking furthermore stoughton and yoon 2011 combined a stress based forming limit curve i e a localized necking criterion with the maximum shear stress criterion to consider failure in the range of stress states not covered by an flc recently pack and mohr 2017 adopted the same concept by combining the hc model with a localized necking envelope termed as the domain of shell to solid equivalence dsse the predictive capabilities of the dsse hc model have been demonstrated by pack et al 2018 who conducted simulations of formability and deep drawing tests and highlighted the shortcomings of the ductile fracture prediction with shell elements using flc or other approaches reported in the literature a very recent paper by kõrgesaar 2019 is indicative of the flourishing interest of the marine structures community in advances in the field of ductile fracture by comparatively analyzing several fracture models applied to the simulation of tests with large thin walled structures kõrgesaar 2019 concluded that the loading paths in a typical crash analysis are highly non proportional and that the stiffening members may fail at low stress triaxialities however the combined membrane bending loading was not discussed in detail on this background the objective of this study is to revisit the marstruct benchmark study by using a ductile fracture model capable of considering complex loading histories non proportional loading paths and all possible failure modes by distinguishing the membrane and bending loadings and including the low stress triaxiality regime this is achieved by employing the dsse hc model in conjunction with a damage indicator framework the identification of the plasticity and fracture model for the material used in the reference test model is presented the reference test simulations are described in detail the predicted deformation and failure modes stress states and loading paths observed for different structural components are also discussed additionally reference is made to the results of the benchmark study with emphasis given on explaining the relative success of assuming a constant value of equivalent plastic strain as the fracture criterion 2 material and plasticity 2 1 material according to karlsson et al 2009 the steel grade used in the reference test was k240 z stainless steel which is a mild steel with a minimum guaranteed yield strength of 235 mpa and an ultimate tensile strength of 340 mpa in the construction of the test model 3 4 and 5 mm thick plates were used karlsson et al 2009 performed standard uniaxial tension tests using flat dog bone type specimens with a thickness of 5 mm that were cut from the rolling direction of the steel sheets the engineering stress strain curve and mechanical properties that were obtained from this test were reported the average yield strength ultimate tensile strength and percentage elongation to fracture were 227 mpa 346 mpa and 31 respectively the value of the yield strength was less than the minimum required value and the mean yield strength of other mild steel grades which is approximately 280 mpa here we note the uncertainty in the yield strength of the material which has also been emphasized by hogström et al 2011 hogström et al 2009 conducted extensive experimental investigations on nva grade shipbuilding steel whose hardening characteristics are similar to those of k240 z the participants of the benchmark study received the true stress strain data of the nva steel grade the power law fit to the data provided to the participants is expressed as follows 1 σ t r u e k ε t r u e n where the hardening coefficient k 616 mpa and the hardening exponent n 0 21 note that the above equation is applicable only for large strains because at zero strain it yields zero stress and an infinite slope for the true stress strain curve the actual initial yield stress σ y which is given as 290 mpa is not indicated by this power law moreover the yield plateau is not included 2 2 plasticity modeling and calibration of hardening curve to model the plasticity of the reference test model material first we referred to the hardening data reported by karlsson et al 2009 the plastic behavior of k240 z grade steel was modeled using the standard plasticity theory with an isotropic von mises yield function associated flow rule and isotropic hardening rule the anisotropy effects were not considered the von mises yield function expressed as eq 2 is a function of the von mises equivalent stress σ and the deformation resistance hardening rule k which controls the size of the yield surface i e the elastic domain 2 f σ k σ k 0 3 σ 3 j 2 where σ is the cauchy stress tensor and j 2 is the second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor s additionally an associated flow rule was assumed 4 d ε p d ε p σ σ where d ε p denotes the increase of the plastic strain vector and d ε p denotes the equivalent plastic strain increase which is defined as the work conjugate of the von mises equivalent stress 5 σ d ε p σ d ε p the hardening curve k is a function of the equivalent plastic strain and is expressed as follows 6 k f ε p in this study we adopted a linear combination of the isotropic swift and voce hardening models proposed by sung et al 2010 as follows 7 k f ε p α k s ε p 1 α k v ε p where α 0 1 is the weighting factor between the exponential swift and saturated voce hardening functions the swift hardening law is expressed as follows 8 k s ε p a ε 0 ε p n the voce law is given as follows 9 k v ε p k 0 q 1 exp β ε p the uniaxial tension test results reported by karlsson et al 2009 were used to obtain the true stress equivalent plastic strain data before the onset of diffuse necking the following equations were used to transform the engineering stress strain curves to true strain equivalent plastic strain curves 10 σ t r u e s 1 e 11 ε p ln 1 e σ t r u e e where s and e are engineering stress and strain respectively to determine the swift law parameters a ε 0 n and voce law parameters k 0 q β separate fits were applied to the true stress equivalent plastic strain data before the onset of diffuse necking for the post necking range where the strain distribution becomes non uniform an iterative process was implemented wherein the weighting factor α was varied until the numerical force displacement curve of the tension test specimen coincided with the test data the simulations were performed using the finite element analysis fea software abaqus a very fine solid mesh was employed in the gage section of the tension specimen to capture the strain localization and three dimensional stress state after the onset of localized necking one eighth of the dog bone tension test specimen was modeled by exploiting the geometrical symmetry eight node 3d solid elements with reduced integration c3d8r in the abaqus element library were used the mesh consisted of eight elements through the half thickness of the specimen this mesh size yielded a reasonable post necking shape and strain resolution at the center of the specimen fig 1 shows the comparison of the simulation and test results and fig 2 shows the corresponding hardening curves table 1 lists the final hardening parameters for comparison the hardening curve for the nva steel provided to the participants of the benchmark study is also included in fig 2 the plasticity model was implemented in abaqus explicit using a vumat user defined material subroutine the return mapping algorithm elastic predictor and plastic corrector scheme was used to obtain the state variables at each strain increment 3 ductile fracture modeling 3 1 characterization of stress state before describing the employed ductile fracture model it is necessary to define the stress state parameters and explain their physical meaning and relevance to the phenomenological fracture model the stress state of an isotropic ductile solid can be described fully by the stress triaxiality η and lode angle parameter θ these two non dimensional parameters can be expressed in terms of stress tensor invariants as follows 12 i 1 tr σ 13 j 2 1 2 s s 14 j 3 det s where i 1 is the first invariant of the cauchy stress tensor σ j 2 and j 3 are the second and third invariants of the deviatoric part of the cauchy stress tensor s 15 s σ 1 3 i 1 i σ σ m i here i is the identity matrix and σ m is the hydrostatic stress the stress triaxiality η and lode angle parameter 1 θ 1 are expressed as follows 16 η i 1 3 3 j 2 σ m σ 17 θ 1 2 π arccos 3 3 2 j 3 j 2 3 2 1 2 π arccos 27 2 j 3 σ 3 the stress triaxiality represents the hydrostatic part of the stress tensor and from a micro mechanical viewpoint it controls the growth of voids whereas the lode angle parameter represents the deviatoric part of the stress tensor and controls the shape change of the voids any stress vector can be expressed in the cartesian coordinate system in terms of principal stresses σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 or in the cylindrical coordinate system in terms of equivalent stress stress triaxiality and lode angle σ η θ the direction of the stress vector in the cylindrical coordinate system can be defined by the stress state parameters η θ if the stress state parameters remain constant up to the onset of fracture initiation as the equivalent plastic strain increases the loading path is considered to be proportional under plane stress conditions one of the principal stresses is zero therefore the stress state can be characterized by the ratio of two principal stresses thus there exists a functional relationship between the lode angle parameter and the stress triaxiality as follows 18 θ 1 2 π arccos 27 2 η η 2 1 3 when using plane stress elements the stress state is described solely by using the stress triaxiality in the range of 2 3 η 2 3 table 2 lists various important stress states and their corresponding stress triaxiality values note that the biaxial tension regime is bounded between the uniaxial tension η 1 3 and the equi biaxial tension η 2 3 3 2 damage indicator framework in the phenomenological ductile fracture models the onset of fracture initiation is predicted to occur when a scalar variable denoted as d reaches a critical value typically unity this scalar variable is called the damage indicator however it does not have an effect on the materials elasto plastic behavior nor does it describe the micro mechanical process of fracture i e void nucleation growth and the coalescence process instead it should be understood as the percentage of used ductility the accumulation of damage indicator is expressed by the following differential equation 19 d d d ε p ε f p r η θ here ε f p r η θ is a weighting function which accounts for the stress state at a particular strain increment hence the damage indicator is defined as an integration of the weighting function along the loading path as follows 20 d 0 ε f d ε p ε f p r η θ 1 where ε f is the equivalent plastic strain at the fracture initiation if the loading path is proportional ε f p r η θ coincides with the fracture strain in other words ε f p r η θ is the fracture locus for proportional loading it is evident that the damage indicator framework is a simple approach toward describing the loss of ductility for materials under non proportional loading paths the similarity of this approach with miner s rule which is used for fatigue failure prediction under variable amplitude loading is also noteworthy 3 3 hosford coulomb fracture model for the task of the weighting function in the damage indicator we employed the hosford coulomb hc fracture model the hc model was developed by mohr and marcadet 2015 based on micro mechanical observations and has the following form 21 ε h c p r η θ b 1 c 1 n f g η θ with 22 g η θ 1 2 f 1 f 2 a f 1 f 3 a f 2 f 3 a 1 a c 2 η f 1 f 3 1 n f the lode angle parameter dependent functions can be expressed as follows 23 f 1 θ 2 3 cos π 6 1 θ 24 f 2 θ 2 3 cos π 6 3 θ 25 f 3 θ 2 3 cos π 6 1 θ the transformation coefficient n f is always set to 0 1 mohr and marcadet 2015 therefore the hc model has three parameters that need to be identified a b and c parameter a controls the lode angle sensitivity effect of deviatoric stress while the stress triaxiality sensitivity effect of hydrostatic stress is primarily controlled by parameter c parameter b controls the overall magnitude of the strains to fracture for proportional loading and is equal to the fracture strain for the uniaxial tension or equi biaxial tension under proportional loading for non proportional loading paths the hc model is implemented within the damage indicator framework as follows 26 d d h c d ε p ε h c p r η θ 3 4 localized necking criterion as has been discussed in detail by pack and mohr 2017 the shell element solutions obtained with the hc model lose their meaning if localized necking precedes the fracture initiation therefore the domain of shell to solid equivalence dsse was proposed to overcome this issue after performing a marciniak kuczynski type of analysis with a unit cell model pack and mohr 2017 defined the dsse which is valid in the biaxial tension domain 1 3 η 2 3 under proportional membrane loading and has a parametric form similar to that of the hc model 27 ε d s s e p r η b 1 2 g 1 g 2 d g 1 d g 2 d 1 d 1 p f the stress triaxiality dependent functions g 1 and g 2 can be expressed as follows 28 g 1 η 3 2 η 1 3 3 4 η 2 29 g 2 η 3 2 η 1 3 3 4 η 2 where the recommended value of the exponent p f is 0 01 note that unlike the conventional flcs this localized necking criterion is expressed in the equivalent plastic strain stress triaxiality space the only parameter that must be identified in the dsse model is d identifying this parameter by using the hardening function is straightforward first the equivalent plastic strain corresponding to the localized necking ε d s s e p s t is determined using the considère criterion for the plane strain tension condition 30 k ε d s s e p s t 2 3 d k ε d s s e p s t d ε p then parameter d can be obtained by substituting η 1 3 and ε d s s e p s t into eq 27 and solving the following implicit equation 31 1 2 d 1 1 d 3 ε d s s e p s t b p f to deal with non proportional loading the forming severity concept proposed by bai and wierzbicki 2008 was adopted the accumulation of the necking indicator is defined as follows 32 d d d s s e d ε p ε d s s e p r η localized necking occurs if d d s s e reaches unity however to distinguish the membrane and bending loading it is postulated that localized necking can occur if all integration points through the thickness in the z direction fulfill the necking criterion i e d d s s e z 1 z t 2 t 2 where t is the shell element thickness in the numerical implementation of dsse a shell element is deleted only if all through thickness integration points satisfy the localized necking condition note that with this formulation localized necking does not occur under pure bending the key assumption made by pack and mohr 2017 is that the displacement to fracture in large thin walled structures predicted with shell finite elements is taken as the displacement to the onset of localized necking the size of the localized necking is usually in the order plate thickness if the global displacement of the plated structure as reported in the force displacement curve is much larger than the plate thickness the difference between the displacement to the onset of the localized necking and the displacement to fracture initiation is very small alsos et al 2008 therefore the onset of localized necking may be assumed to be the failure state in summary the dsse hc model for the shell element assumes three types of failure fracture preceded by localized necking in the biaxial tension domain fracture not preceded by localized necking surface cracking and failure under shear dominated loadings in the low stress triaxiality domain the first one is predicted using a localized necking criterion which is extended for non proportional loading paths using the forming severity concept and distinguishes the membrane and bending loadings by considering the fulfillment of the necking condition in all of the through thickness integration points in this sense dsse is a non local failure criterion the second and third failure conditions can be conveniently predicted using the hc model where the stress at an individual integration point is set to zero when the fracture condition is satisfied hence hc is a local failure criterion for example surface cracking under pure bending loading can be predicted when the through thickness integration point at the extreme of the tension side satisfies the hc fracture criterion the dsse hc fracture model is included in the above mentioned vumat subroutine we used the vumatxtrarg subroutine together with the vumat subroutine such that essential information regarding the implementation of the dsse i e array of internal element numbers and section point numbers through thickness integration point number are accessible in the vumat subroutine in the vumat subroutine the damage indicator and failure condition are evaluated for through thickness integration points not for elements by using the vumatxtrarg subroutine the state variable associated with the failure condition due to localized necking of each through thickness integration point can be accessed and then evaluated for each element a failure state variable for the through thickness integration points is defined which is set to one if the localized necking condition is satisfied otherwise it is kept as zero for five through thickness integration points for an element the stress components of all through thickness integration points are set to zero i e full degradation of the element occurs if the sum of all failure state variables equals to five if this condition is not satisfied the stress components of individual through thickness integration points are not affected the default element removal condition in abaqus is that an element is deleted if the stress components of all through thickness integration points are zero by default abaqus checks the failure condition at each through thickness integration point separately and at failure sets its stress components to zero regardless of the other through thickness integration points in that particular shell element it is clear that the default procedure is useful for modeling bending induced surface cracking and through thickness crack propagation where the through thickness integration point on the outmost layer of the tension side will fail first and fully degraded followed by the other through thickness integration points above the plastic neutral axis for membrane stretching induced localized necking the procedure we implemented where the element is treated as a whole ensures that only membrane loading is considered 3 5 dsse hc model parameter identification the hc model has three parameters to be identified namely a b c these three parameters require at least three different tests such as tests with pure shear central hole and notched tension specimens kõrgesaar et al 2018 however for k240 z only a standard dog bone tension test result is available cerik et al 2019a identified a b c for s235jr grade general purpose structural steel using the test results reported by kõrgesaar et al 2018 the s235jr grade steel is a mild steel and its hardening characteristics are comparable to those of the k240 z grade steel therefore we decided to adopt the hc model parameters of the s235jr grade steel fig 3 shows the hc fracture locus under a plane stress condition using the parameters obtained for s235jr these parameters were then employed in the vumat subroutine to simulate the k240 z dog bone specimen with the element removal option activated fig 4 shows a comparison of experimental and numerically predicted engineering stress strain curves it is evident that the agreement between the test and the numerical results is satisfactory as described in the previous section the parameter d can be easily identified using the hardening function of the material all parameters identified for the implementation of the dsse hc model are listed in table 3 fig 5 shows the hc fracture locus under a plane stress condition along with the localized necking envelope defined by the dsse note that both are valid only for proportional loading paths the damage parameter is utilized to consider non proportional loading paths 4 simulation of penetration test 4 1 description of reference test the ship like structure test geometry designed by karlsson et al 2009 was used as the reference structure in ringsberg et al 2018 it resembles the typical double hull side shell structure of a ship subjected to a collision load where the bulbous bow of the striking ship penetrates the struck ship structure to fit the test object to the testing machine the object was scaled to one third of the size of a similar full scale ship structure the detailed description and analysis of the experiment have been presented by hogström and ringsberg 2012 karlsson et al 2009 and ringsberg et al 2018 fig 6 presents the schematic representation and a photograph of the experiment involving a double hull penetrated by a solid half sphere the test object consisted of one outer and one inner shell web stringer sheets web stringer beams and stiffeners in the form of l profiles the global dimensions l w h of the structure were 1500 mm 1090 mm 300 mm and the sheet thickness was between 3 mm for the thinnest elements and 5 mm for the thickest structural elements to establish well defined boundary conditions a reinforcing rigid frame was designed around the structure fig 7 shows the geometry and dimensions without the reinforcing frame the reinforcing frame was welded around the test object and along its edges to create clamped boundary conditions and to ensure well controlled failure modes of the structure the lower part of the frame was welded to a rigid fixture four displacement transducers were positioned in two directions on the supporting frame and fixture the transducers measured the frames deformations to ensure that the fixtures deformations during the tests were negligible fig 8 shows the experimental setup where two of the displacement transducers are shown at the front and to the left of the test object as mentioned earlier the test object was manufactured using k240 z shipbuilding mild steel the indenter was a solid rigid half sphere with a radius of 135 mm and made of ss2541 grade steel friction tests without lubrication have been carried out by karlsson et al 2009 who demonstrated that the kinematic friction coefficient is 0 23 0 01 under the contact conditions considered in this study additionally the test object was mounted onto a press machine with a load capacity of 20 mn to relax the residual stresses caused by welding the test objects sheets to the support frames the indenter was pushed perpendicularly to the load and unloaded the structure at low speed for ten times in this loading sequence the magnitude of the load was within the elastic region of the material the indenter penetrated the structure with a constant displacement rate of 4 mm s the collision point was located at the center of the double hull see fig 8 and the loading direction was perpendicular to the upper sheets surface the experiment was interrupted when the lower sheet was fully penetrated by the indenter throughout the experiment the resultant force in the load cell the position of the indenter and the displacement transducers in the rigid frames were monitored and recorded the total calculated measurement uncertainty for the maximum force was less than 1 the reported uncertainty corresponded to a confidence interval of approximately 95 around the measured value for more details see karlsson et al 2009 4 2 finite element modeling the finite element fe model used for the test object was developed using the geometry file used in ringsberg et al 2018 which defined the geometries of the test object the indenter and the reinforcing frame the welds were not considered in the fe model the indenter was modeled as a rigid body and was allowed to move only in the direction perpendicular to the upper sheet at a constant displacement rate fig 9 shows the fe model excluding the rigid indenter the stiffened panel penetration tests were simulated using the abaqus explicit software package and by employing the developed vumat subroutine the target structure was meshed with four node reduced integration shell elements s4r in the abaqus element library five through thickness integration points section points and default hour glassing were chosen convergence analyses were carried out to determine the optimal mesh size of the fe model the primary element size of the elements in the parts of the structure that underwent failure and fracture in the numerical simulation was 15 mm it should be noted that the selected mesh size is not too large to resolve strains adequately if an element size larger than 15 mm is used the simulations do not follow the deformation buckling and fracture behavior observed in the tests particularly after the rupture of the upper plate in addition the use of localized necking condition as a failure criterion for shell elements requires that the elements are much larger than the width of neck which is usually in the order of plate thickness the adopted mesh size which is 3 t satisfies this condition the target structures material were assumed to have a young s modulus e and poisson s ratio ν of 206 gpa and 0 3 respectively the material density ρ was taken as 7 85 t m 3 the lower part of the reinforcing frame which was welded to a rigid fixture was assumed to be fully clamped the punch was modeled with rigid elements r3d4 in the abaqus element library and positioned such that it hit the center of the upper plate the contact between the punch and the stiffened panel was modeled with the general contact algorithm in abaqus explicit this contact algorithm enforces the contact constraints using a penalty contact method which searches for node into face and edge into edge penetrations the tangential contact behavior was modeled using a friction coefficient of 0 23 and penalty type formulation the normal contact behavior was modeled with a hard contact pressure overclosure to save computation time the indenter speed was higher in the fe analysis in comparison with the physical experiment although it did not exhibit any dynamic effects the punch was forced to penetrate through the stiffened panel at a constant rate of 5 m s the simulation was run until the indenter penetrated the lower plate fully this corresponded to a displacement of 500 mm moreover the strain rate effect on hardening was not included 4 3 comparison with test results the accuracy of the adopted ductile fracture model was evaluated using the force displacement curves with emphasis placed on predicting the displacements to fracture at the upper and lower plates t beam and associated force levels with these events fig 10 shows the comparison of the numerically predicted force displacement curve with the test result and indicates the important events observed in the numerical simulation note that the first and second peaks correspond to the penetration of the upper and lower plates respectively as can be seen the overall trends observed in the test results were predicted fairly well in particular the instant and peak lower plate penetration forces were captured accurately it is noteworthy to mention that the latter were mostly overestimated by the participants of the benchmark study ringsberg et al 2018 in this study the stiffness of the structure was slightly underestimated before the upper plate ruptured this was obvious after the tripping of the t beam attached to the upper plate of the target structure because of this divergence from the test results the onset of upper plate rupture and the sequential events were not predicted well in the numerical results the force decreased suddenly after the upper plate ruptured and the t beam fractured on the other hand in the test these events were followed by a smoother decrease in force moreover the force levels that were predicted numerically after the rupture of the upper plate were larger in comparison with the test results lastly the agreement between the numerical predictions and the test results was completely lost after the indenter displacement was approximately 450 mm identifying the cause of this discrepancy was not straightforward because the numerical simulation did not indicate any major event that could cause the force to remain constant and eventually drop to an indenter displacement of approximately 487 mm 4 4 remodeling of hardening and new results to improve the accuracy of the numerical prediction and also to address the effect of uncertainty in the yield strength of the material further simulations were performed with a different hardening curve the majority of the benchmark study participants adopted the given yield stress for the nva grade steel 290 mpa which resulted in better agreement between the numerical predictions and the test results prior to the rupture of the upper plate in comparison with the present study it is evident that the assumed yield stress of 227 mpa for the tested structural material caused the earlier tripping of the t beam in the numerical simulation hence the hardening curve was modified with an initial yield stress value of 290 mpa a yield plateau which was present in the provided stress strain curve was also included fig 11 shows the modified hardening curve the dsse model parameter was identified again by considering the modified hardening curve as d 1 67 with regard to the hc model parameters further calibration was not necessary because the modified hardening curve was much closer to that of s235jr kõrgesaar et al 2018 cerik et al 2019a fig 12 shows the force displacement predicted with the modified hardening curve as can be seen the agreement between the numerical predictions and the test results improved significantly with the exception of the force level associated with the rupture of the lower plate table 4 lists the indenter displacement values corresponding to the important events shown in fig 12 and compares them with the test and mean benchmark study results with this comparison the accuracy of the adopted numerical model was verified and the numerical simulation results obtained with the modified hardening curve will be discussed below 5 discussions from the force displacement curves it is obvious that the accurate prediction of the sequence of events involved in the deformation and failure process of the struck structure largely depended on properly modeling the fracture initiation both the displacement and force at the time of fracture initiation in the upper and lower plates subjected to biaxial stretching and partially on the failure of the girder t beam right below the impact location in addition the discrepancy in the tested material properties reported by karlsson et al 2009 is evident as the reported tensile test results for the 5 mm plate yields somehow incorrect behavior for the web of the t girder our argument is that at least the web of t beam has a higher yield strength than that of 5 mm plate likely to be in the order of the yield strength of nva grade steel the significant uncertainty in the material parameter input and as shown a simulation sensitivity to the assumed material behavior should be noted nevertheless we will first discuss the deformation and failure process of the structural components and describe how the adopted fracture model handles the non proportional loading paths and the effect of the through thickness strain gradients fig 13 shows the deformation and failure process of the upper plate where the contour plots denote the stress triaxiality η necking indicator d d s s e and damage indicator for the ductile fracture d h c in this figure the right column shows the upper surface of the plate while the left column shows the lower surface an inherent characteristic is that the stress state in the highly deformed area is close to but not exactly the equi biaxial tension in both plate surfaces the necking indicator accumulates much faster than the ductile fracture damage indicator the different damage and necking indicator values for the top and bottom surfaces clearly demonstrate that a certain degree of bending deformation is involved fig 14 shows the stress state and the necking and fracture damage indicators at the time of the first element removal at this stage the membrane deformation is dominant and the difference between the damage indicators at the two extreme surfaces disappear it is obvious that the failure was caused by localized necking to demonstrate the effect non proportional loading paths and bending deformation the variation of stress triaxiality and the damage indicators with increasing equivalent plastic strain were extracted from the numerical simulation results fig 15 shows the loading paths and damage accumulations for the through thickness integration points at the top and bottom surfaces of the first removed element it is evident that the failure process of the plates under punch loading involves non proportional loading paths and bending deformation particularly in the initial loading stages the two extreme layers of the plate are subjected to different stress states and different amounts of plastic straining therefore the equivalent plastic strain values at failure are also different the upper surface integration point satisfies the failure condition i e d d s s e 1 slightly earlier than the lower surface integration point the element is removed when all through thickness integration points satisfies the failure condition fig 16 shows the loading paths of the top and bottom integration points and the localized necking envelope in the same graph the stress states of the integration points throughout the loading and the non proportionality of the loading paths are shown here more clearly in this junction the relative success of the constant equivalent plastic strain criterion which was used by the majority of the benchmark study participants can be explained by examining fig 16 in the benchmark study the most commonly adopted constant values of the equivalent plastic strain ranged from 0 26 to 0 35 it is not surprising that these values are close to the final equivalent plastic strain values of the upper and lower surface integration points as shown in fig 16 hence if we ignore the non proportionality of loading paths and the bending deformation effects by adopting a constant equivalent plastic strain as the failure criterion the fracture initiation in biaxially stretched plates may be predicted with reasonable accuracy however a few questions arise how can we determine the critical equivalent plastic strain without referring to the localized necking limit which is closely associated with the hardening curve of the material does mesh size scaling have a rational basis for determining this constant value does the assumption of constant equivalent plastic strain as a failure criterion still yield a reasonable prediction of fracture initiation for structural members subjected to stress states other than biaxial stretching and experiencing highly non proportional loading paths to clarify these issues we conducted further analysis with a fracture initiation criterion using a constant equivalent plastic strain of 0 35 in abaqus this criterion can be applied by using the ductile damage option the damage initiation criterion is defined by setting the fracture strain as 0 35 for all possible stress triaxialities and strain rates the damage evolution option in abaqus which is activated after the damage initiation criterion is satisfied and causes softening by decreasing the element stiffness gradually was not used hence the displacement at failure which must be defined in the damage evolution option was set to zero with these options the ductile damage model in abaqus was implemented such that an element was removed if all of the through thickness integration points in a shell element reached the equivalent plastic strain value of 0 35 fig 17 shows the obtained force displacement curve as can be seen there was no significant discrepancy between the numerical predictions and the test results except for the instant when the lower plate ruptured the lower plate was subjected to impact on the side of the stiffeners where the stiffeners deformed not only because of contact with the indenter but also because of contact with the t beam after it was broken hence the deformation and failure of other structural members has to be evaluated in detail fig 18 shows the plots of the stress state and damage indicator for localized necking and fracture at the time of the first element removal for the t beam the web of the t beam buckles and folds as the denting progressed this causes significant stress state variations but the dented area is essentially in compression and the parts next to it are subjected to biaxial stretching eventually failure occurs in the latter part due to localized necking as can be seen in the necking and fracture damage indicator plots experimental evidence with regard to the failure mode is not reported by karlsson et al 2009 however in a relevant study noh et al 2018 demonstrated that the webs of t frames subjected to lateral impact exhibited localized necking at highly strained locations in the present simulation further indentation causes the flange to rupture the flange of the t beam deflects further in the lateral direction along with the indenter fig 19 shows the state after the t beam broke the failure process of the t beam as predicted with a constant equivalent plastic criterion is much different fig 20 shows the failure process of the t beam with an equivalent plastic strain contour plot the fracture initiates at the folded part and propagates in the direction of indentation when the t beam is completely broken most of the elements in the dented area are deleted contrary to what is shown in fig 19 the flange deflects sideways finally we investigated the failure of the lower plate fig 21 shows the stress state and damage indicators at the time of the first elements failure at the lower plate fig 22 shows the loading path and the damage accumulation of the necking indicator as extracted from the upper and lower surfaces of the first failed element the fracture initiates on the plate in the vicinity of the plate stiffener intersection the loading path of the upper surface is almost proportional but the lower surface exhibits significant non proportionality and satisfies the failure condition at a much later time as shown in fig 23 the fracture first propagates in the direction of the stiffener and a secondary crack path forms during the final stage in the direction perpendicular to the stiffeners the location of fracture initiation that was predicted by the constant equivalent plastic strain criterion is again at the plate stiffener intersection and on the upper side of the lower plate fig 24 shows the equivalent plastic strain plots on the lower plate at the time of the first element removal and at the final state as shown in figs 23 24 the failure of the lower plate in both cases may start similarly fracture near a stiffener but they do not appear to end similarly it can be argued that the sideways deflection of the t beam is the source of discrepancy in the predictions with the constant equivalent plastic strain criterion this causes less indentation to the lower plate stiffener hence the plate stiffener intersection is less strained lastly the mesh size effect on the predicted deformation patterns and instants of fracture instants were assessed fig 25 shows the force displacement curves obtained using different mesh sizes it is clear that a mesh size larger than 15 mm which is 3 t cannot capture the deformation and fracture of the t beam correctly there are slight differences between the predictions obtained using the mesh sizes less than 15 mm but overall trends are very much similar it should be noted that decreasing the mesh size to 10 mm does not alter the failure mechanism of the structural components i e localized necking preceded fracture is predicted in all members in this study it was demonstrated that the failure caused by the localized necking preceding the ductile fracture is more relevant in the large deformation and eventual rupture process of plated structures subjected to punch loading therefore accurate localized necking models and material characterization are necessary to conduct a reasonably accurate simulation of ship collision and grounding damage moreover we emphasized the non proportional loading paths and the through thickness strain gradient effects the adopted hc dsse fracture model is simple yet capable of addressing these important points to further challenge its predictive abilities future work should consider the fracture caused by different accidental loadings such as moving loads and plate tearing or cutting where shear failure may be observed 6 conclusions a detailed numerical study was performed with the target structure chosen as the side shell collision model used in the marstruct benchmark study we described a step by step procedure that includes the plasticity and ductile fracture model parameter identification and successful application of the calibrated fracture model with shell elements to a problem that is of particular interest to the ship collision and grounding research community the following conclusions were drawn the adopted hc dsse model provided accurate estimates of the displacement to fracture initiation in a complex steel plated structure penetrated with a rigid hemisphere it was noted that the failure caused by the localized necking preceding the ductile fracture was more relevant in this particular scenario this observation is not limited to plating subjected to punch indentation but also regards girders and other secondary stiffening members using the loading paths extracted from the numerical simulations with the hc dsse model it was demonstrated that stress state varied significantly throughout the deformation of the panel and stiffening members additionally the effect of bending deformation was evaluated by considering the loading paths of the through thickness integration points this effect was observed to be particularly important in the initial stages of the deformation of the stiffened panels the accuracy of the constant equivalent plastic strain criterion was interpreted by using the calibrated localized necking envelope for the test model material it was concluded that a constant equivalent plastic strain value between the strains applied to the localized necking under proportional plane strain and equi biaxial tension may yield an accurate prediction of fracture initiation in the biaxial stretching of the plates by a hemispherical punch however failure under complex loading paths which involve compression such as in the case of web buckling and folding requires more advanced fracture models to assess the accuracy of the fracture models rather than single plates or stiffened panels test models resembling actual ship structures are far more appropriate zhang et al 2018 kõrgesaar 2019 it is important to evaluate the performance of fracture models not only by considering failure caused by plate stretching but also by considering the complex interaction between the structural members after the rupture of the outer shell the benefits of adopting concepts from the field of sheet metal forming distinguishing failure modes damage indicator framework for localized necking and ductile fracture for example will be much more obvious in simulations using these test models future research should focus on material characterization that is the identification of localized necking and ductile fracture model

22609,the marstruct benchmark study on a small scale double hull structure penetrated by a hemispherical punch was revisited by employing a combined localized necking and stress state dependent ductile fracture model by using the limited information provided to the participants of the benchmark study the plasticity and fracture model parameters were identified to model the material behavior beyond moderate plasticity a combination of the swift and voce strain hardening laws was used the damage indicator framework using the hosford coulomb fracture model combined with the domain of shell to solid equivalence dsse concept was adopted to predict the initiation and propagation of ductile fracture using the adopted approach the predicted instant and force levels corresponding to the fracture initiation in the upper and lower plates were found to be in good agreement with the test results the deformation of the structural elements was also accurately captured the benefits of adopting the damage indicator framework and distinguishing different failure modes were investigated keywords ductile fracture ship collision shell element hosford coulomb model localized necking 1 introduction recently the marstruct virtual institute published a benchmark study on the non linear finite element simulation of a small scale double hull penetration test ringsberg et al 2018 in particular the benchmark study provided the marine structures community with an opportunity to compare their abilities and predict the ductile fracture using their preferred methodology the benchmark study participants were asked to perform a blind simulation of the quasi static penetration test using only the limited information provided which included the test structure dimensions and the strain hardening data of a steel grade that was similar to the material of the test structures the penetration test which was originally reported by karlsson et al 2009 featured the rupture of the outer and inner plates these two events dominated the overall force displacement response obtained in the test particularly the interaction between the deforming structural elements and the final rupture of the outer plate makes the numerical prediction very challenging most of the benchmark study participants used the built in options in commercial software packages such as abaqus and ls dyna wherein the fracture initiation and propagation was simulated with element removal a constant value of equivalent plastic strain was preferred as a criterion for element removal which ignores the stress state dependency of ductile fracture behavior additionally this criterion does not distinguish the failure caused by different mechanisms such as localized necking prior to fracture and through thickness fracture or surface cracking nor does it consider complex deformation paths although most of the participants captured the overall trends in the force displacement and energy displacement responses with this approach there exists a large scattering between the instants of the experimentally observed deformation and failure modes and the instants predicted numerically the relative success of the fracture prediction using a constant equivalent plastic strain criterion was not discussed in detail by ringsberg et al 2018 with regard to the stress states and loading paths experienced by the deforming and failed structural members the challenge of predicting the ductile fracture initiation with shell finite elements is not only relevant to the impact problems encountered in marine structures a wider view can be achieved particularly with regard to concepts borrowed from the sheet metal forming and automotive industries a comprehensive review of state of the art approaches in these fields has been presented by cao 2017 ductile fracture initiation in solids can be conveniently predicted with phenomenological or macroscopic models which consider a non porous solid by excluding the void nucleation and growth processes in constitutive modeling fracture initiation is assumed to occur when a scalar variable which is termed as the damage indicator and represents the loss of ductility reaches a critical value the key concept is that the damage indicator accumulates with the equivalent plastic strain increase which is typically weighted using a stress state dependent function called fracture locus based on a comprehensive experimental study covering a wide range of stress states bao and wierzbicki 2004 proposed a fracture locus that is dependent on the stress triaxiality the normalized first invariant of the stress tensor as the weighting function a similar fracture locus called rice and tracey cockcroft and latham rtcl criterion has been proposed by törnqvist 2003 with an emphasis on maritime crash applications xue 2007 demonstrated that the ductile fracture of materials depends not only on the stress triaxiality but also on the lode angle parameter which is the normalized third invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor since then advanced ductile fracture models have been developed based on the transformation of the mohr coulomb type stress based fracture criteria into the space of stress triaxiality lode angle parameter and equivalent plastic strain such as the modified mohr coulomb mmc model by bai and wierzbicki 2010 the hosford coulomb hc model by mohr and marcadet 2015 and the model by lou et al 2017 these models are associated with very fine solid mesh applications to capture the local three dimensional stress state and localizations limiting our attention to the direct application of such models with shell elements wherein the plane stress conditions are valid an issue arises if the localized necking precedes the initiation of ductile fracture localized necking occurs under the biaxial stretching of plates within the region bounded by two extreme cases uniaxial tension and equi biaxial tension and is the main source of the mesh size sensitivity of ductile fracture prediction with shell elements as has been demonstrated in detail by pack and mohr 2017 a mesh scaling framework is typically adopted to deal with the mesh size sensitivity where the equivalent plastic strain to fracture is regularized with the element size instead of scaling the fracture locus simply as a function of the element size walters 2014 and kõrgesaar et al 2014 kõrgesaar and romanoff 2014 demonstrated that stress state dependent mesh scaling is more reasonable on the other hand as discussed in detail by alsos et al 2009 and storheim et al 2015a the strain localizations caused by the structural geometry geometric mesh size sensitivity should be distinguished from the material mesh size sensitivity which the element size dependent fracture criteria attempt to address another alternative to overcome the mesh size sensitivity issue is to consider the onset of localized necking as a state of failure a forming limit curve flc is a convenient way of describing the onset of localized necking in thin plates subjected to biaxial stretching flcs are used in the sheet metal forming industry but have various limitations in particular the flcs expressed in the space of principal strains are valid only for proportional loading paths the path dependency is somehow less if the flc is established in the principal stress space i e a stress based flc stoughton and zhu 2004 an example of the stress based flc is the bressan and williams hill bwh criterion proposed by alsos et al 2008 which is well known in the marine structures community another limitation of the flc based fracture prediction is that the flcs are valid under conditions of membrane biaxial stretching and do not include bending effects in the numerical implementation of the flcs or localized necking based fracture models in general for use with shell finite elements an element is removed if the mid layer through thickness integration satisfies the localized necking criterion this causes somehow early failure prediction under stretch bending deformation such as the case of stiffened panel penetration see alsos et al 2009 storheim et al 2015a b the early failure prediction issue may be addressed by employing a damage induced softening law which ensures that the stiffness of the element gradually decreases when the failure condition is satisfied among others hogström and ringsberg 2012 applied the softening approach in conjunction with the bwh criterion while abubakar and dow 2013 adopted the hill stören and rice criterion as a localized necking criterion in both cases the built in functions of the commercial software package abaqus were used storheim et al 2015a developed a similar approach and incorporated it with a user defined subroutine in ls dyna however the effect of bending deformation was not considered directly in any of those studies li et al 2010 reported that the through thickness integration points are subjected to different stress states and that the loading paths are not necessarily proportional during punching which is a common sheet metal forming process moreover it has been demonstrated that the through thickness fracture caused by arbitrary combinations of membrane and bending deformations can be captured provided that the element is deleted when all of the through thickness integration points satisfy the failure criterion stoughton and yoon 2011 underlined this important observation and identified the failure modes based on the through thickness stress distribution which are localized necking preceding ductile fracture and surface cracking owing to excessive bending without through thickness necking furthermore stoughton and yoon 2011 combined a stress based forming limit curve i e a localized necking criterion with the maximum shear stress criterion to consider failure in the range of stress states not covered by an flc recently pack and mohr 2017 adopted the same concept by combining the hc model with a localized necking envelope termed as the domain of shell to solid equivalence dsse the predictive capabilities of the dsse hc model have been demonstrated by pack et al 2018 who conducted simulations of formability and deep drawing tests and highlighted the shortcomings of the ductile fracture prediction with shell elements using flc or other approaches reported in the literature a very recent paper by kõrgesaar 2019 is indicative of the flourishing interest of the marine structures community in advances in the field of ductile fracture by comparatively analyzing several fracture models applied to the simulation of tests with large thin walled structures kõrgesaar 2019 concluded that the loading paths in a typical crash analysis are highly non proportional and that the stiffening members may fail at low stress triaxialities however the combined membrane bending loading was not discussed in detail on this background the objective of this study is to revisit the marstruct benchmark study by using a ductile fracture model capable of considering complex loading histories non proportional loading paths and all possible failure modes by distinguishing the membrane and bending loadings and including the low stress triaxiality regime this is achieved by employing the dsse hc model in conjunction with a damage indicator framework the identification of the plasticity and fracture model for the material used in the reference test model is presented the reference test simulations are described in detail the predicted deformation and failure modes stress states and loading paths observed for different structural components are also discussed additionally reference is made to the results of the benchmark study with emphasis given on explaining the relative success of assuming a constant value of equivalent plastic strain as the fracture criterion 2 material and plasticity 2 1 material according to karlsson et al 2009 the steel grade used in the reference test was k240 z stainless steel which is a mild steel with a minimum guaranteed yield strength of 235 mpa and an ultimate tensile strength of 340 mpa in the construction of the test model 3 4 and 5 mm thick plates were used karlsson et al 2009 performed standard uniaxial tension tests using flat dog bone type specimens with a thickness of 5 mm that were cut from the rolling direction of the steel sheets the engineering stress strain curve and mechanical properties that were obtained from this test were reported the average yield strength ultimate tensile strength and percentage elongation to fracture were 227 mpa 346 mpa and 31 respectively the value of the yield strength was less than the minimum required value and the mean yield strength of other mild steel grades which is approximately 280 mpa here we note the uncertainty in the yield strength of the material which has also been emphasized by hogström et al 2011 hogström et al 2009 conducted extensive experimental investigations on nva grade shipbuilding steel whose hardening characteristics are similar to those of k240 z the participants of the benchmark study received the true stress strain data of the nva steel grade the power law fit to the data provided to the participants is expressed as follows 1 σ t r u e k ε t r u e n where the hardening coefficient k 616 mpa and the hardening exponent n 0 21 note that the above equation is applicable only for large strains because at zero strain it yields zero stress and an infinite slope for the true stress strain curve the actual initial yield stress σ y which is given as 290 mpa is not indicated by this power law moreover the yield plateau is not included 2 2 plasticity modeling and calibration of hardening curve to model the plasticity of the reference test model material first we referred to the hardening data reported by karlsson et al 2009 the plastic behavior of k240 z grade steel was modeled using the standard plasticity theory with an isotropic von mises yield function associated flow rule and isotropic hardening rule the anisotropy effects were not considered the von mises yield function expressed as eq 2 is a function of the von mises equivalent stress σ and the deformation resistance hardening rule k which controls the size of the yield surface i e the elastic domain 2 f σ k σ k 0 3 σ 3 j 2 where σ is the cauchy stress tensor and j 2 is the second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor s additionally an associated flow rule was assumed 4 d ε p d ε p σ σ where d ε p denotes the increase of the plastic strain vector and d ε p denotes the equivalent plastic strain increase which is defined as the work conjugate of the von mises equivalent stress 5 σ d ε p σ d ε p the hardening curve k is a function of the equivalent plastic strain and is expressed as follows 6 k f ε p in this study we adopted a linear combination of the isotropic swift and voce hardening models proposed by sung et al 2010 as follows 7 k f ε p α k s ε p 1 α k v ε p where α 0 1 is the weighting factor between the exponential swift and saturated voce hardening functions the swift hardening law is expressed as follows 8 k s ε p a ε 0 ε p n the voce law is given as follows 9 k v ε p k 0 q 1 exp β ε p the uniaxial tension test results reported by karlsson et al 2009 were used to obtain the true stress equivalent plastic strain data before the onset of diffuse necking the following equations were used to transform the engineering stress strain curves to true strain equivalent plastic strain curves 10 σ t r u e s 1 e 11 ε p ln 1 e σ t r u e e where s and e are engineering stress and strain respectively to determine the swift law parameters a ε 0 n and voce law parameters k 0 q β separate fits were applied to the true stress equivalent plastic strain data before the onset of diffuse necking for the post necking range where the strain distribution becomes non uniform an iterative process was implemented wherein the weighting factor α was varied until the numerical force displacement curve of the tension test specimen coincided with the test data the simulations were performed using the finite element analysis fea software abaqus a very fine solid mesh was employed in the gage section of the tension specimen to capture the strain localization and three dimensional stress state after the onset of localized necking one eighth of the dog bone tension test specimen was modeled by exploiting the geometrical symmetry eight node 3d solid elements with reduced integration c3d8r in the abaqus element library were used the mesh consisted of eight elements through the half thickness of the specimen this mesh size yielded a reasonable post necking shape and strain resolution at the center of the specimen fig 1 shows the comparison of the simulation and test results and fig 2 shows the corresponding hardening curves table 1 lists the final hardening parameters for comparison the hardening curve for the nva steel provided to the participants of the benchmark study is also included in fig 2 the plasticity model was implemented in abaqus explicit using a vumat user defined material subroutine the return mapping algorithm elastic predictor and plastic corrector scheme was used to obtain the state variables at each strain increment 3 ductile fracture modeling 3 1 characterization of stress state before describing the employed ductile fracture model it is necessary to define the stress state parameters and explain their physical meaning and relevance to the phenomenological fracture model the stress state of an isotropic ductile solid can be described fully by the stress triaxiality η and lode angle parameter θ these two non dimensional parameters can be expressed in terms of stress tensor invariants as follows 12 i 1 tr σ 13 j 2 1 2 s s 14 j 3 det s where i 1 is the first invariant of the cauchy stress tensor σ j 2 and j 3 are the second and third invariants of the deviatoric part of the cauchy stress tensor s 15 s σ 1 3 i 1 i σ σ m i here i is the identity matrix and σ m is the hydrostatic stress the stress triaxiality η and lode angle parameter 1 θ 1 are expressed as follows 16 η i 1 3 3 j 2 σ m σ 17 θ 1 2 π arccos 3 3 2 j 3 j 2 3 2 1 2 π arccos 27 2 j 3 σ 3 the stress triaxiality represents the hydrostatic part of the stress tensor and from a micro mechanical viewpoint it controls the growth of voids whereas the lode angle parameter represents the deviatoric part of the stress tensor and controls the shape change of the voids any stress vector can be expressed in the cartesian coordinate system in terms of principal stresses σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 or in the cylindrical coordinate system in terms of equivalent stress stress triaxiality and lode angle σ η θ the direction of the stress vector in the cylindrical coordinate system can be defined by the stress state parameters η θ if the stress state parameters remain constant up to the onset of fracture initiation as the equivalent plastic strain increases the loading path is considered to be proportional under plane stress conditions one of the principal stresses is zero therefore the stress state can be characterized by the ratio of two principal stresses thus there exists a functional relationship between the lode angle parameter and the stress triaxiality as follows 18 θ 1 2 π arccos 27 2 η η 2 1 3 when using plane stress elements the stress state is described solely by using the stress triaxiality in the range of 2 3 η 2 3 table 2 lists various important stress states and their corresponding stress triaxiality values note that the biaxial tension regime is bounded between the uniaxial tension η 1 3 and the equi biaxial tension η 2 3 3 2 damage indicator framework in the phenomenological ductile fracture models the onset of fracture initiation is predicted to occur when a scalar variable denoted as d reaches a critical value typically unity this scalar variable is called the damage indicator however it does not have an effect on the materials elasto plastic behavior nor does it describe the micro mechanical process of fracture i e void nucleation growth and the coalescence process instead it should be understood as the percentage of used ductility the accumulation of damage indicator is expressed by the following differential equation 19 d d d ε p ε f p r η θ here ε f p r η θ is a weighting function which accounts for the stress state at a particular strain increment hence the damage indicator is defined as an integration of the weighting function along the loading path as follows 20 d 0 ε f d ε p ε f p r η θ 1 where ε f is the equivalent plastic strain at the fracture initiation if the loading path is proportional ε f p r η θ coincides with the fracture strain in other words ε f p r η θ is the fracture locus for proportional loading it is evident that the damage indicator framework is a simple approach toward describing the loss of ductility for materials under non proportional loading paths the similarity of this approach with miner s rule which is used for fatigue failure prediction under variable amplitude loading is also noteworthy 3 3 hosford coulomb fracture model for the task of the weighting function in the damage indicator we employed the hosford coulomb hc fracture model the hc model was developed by mohr and marcadet 2015 based on micro mechanical observations and has the following form 21 ε h c p r η θ b 1 c 1 n f g η θ with 22 g η θ 1 2 f 1 f 2 a f 1 f 3 a f 2 f 3 a 1 a c 2 η f 1 f 3 1 n f the lode angle parameter dependent functions can be expressed as follows 23 f 1 θ 2 3 cos π 6 1 θ 24 f 2 θ 2 3 cos π 6 3 θ 25 f 3 θ 2 3 cos π 6 1 θ the transformation coefficient n f is always set to 0 1 mohr and marcadet 2015 therefore the hc model has three parameters that need to be identified a b and c parameter a controls the lode angle sensitivity effect of deviatoric stress while the stress triaxiality sensitivity effect of hydrostatic stress is primarily controlled by parameter c parameter b controls the overall magnitude of the strains to fracture for proportional loading and is equal to the fracture strain for the uniaxial tension or equi biaxial tension under proportional loading for non proportional loading paths the hc model is implemented within the damage indicator framework as follows 26 d d h c d ε p ε h c p r η θ 3 4 localized necking criterion as has been discussed in detail by pack and mohr 2017 the shell element solutions obtained with the hc model lose their meaning if localized necking precedes the fracture initiation therefore the domain of shell to solid equivalence dsse was proposed to overcome this issue after performing a marciniak kuczynski type of analysis with a unit cell model pack and mohr 2017 defined the dsse which is valid in the biaxial tension domain 1 3 η 2 3 under proportional membrane loading and has a parametric form similar to that of the hc model 27 ε d s s e p r η b 1 2 g 1 g 2 d g 1 d g 2 d 1 d 1 p f the stress triaxiality dependent functions g 1 and g 2 can be expressed as follows 28 g 1 η 3 2 η 1 3 3 4 η 2 29 g 2 η 3 2 η 1 3 3 4 η 2 where the recommended value of the exponent p f is 0 01 note that unlike the conventional flcs this localized necking criterion is expressed in the equivalent plastic strain stress triaxiality space the only parameter that must be identified in the dsse model is d identifying this parameter by using the hardening function is straightforward first the equivalent plastic strain corresponding to the localized necking ε d s s e p s t is determined using the considère criterion for the plane strain tension condition 30 k ε d s s e p s t 2 3 d k ε d s s e p s t d ε p then parameter d can be obtained by substituting η 1 3 and ε d s s e p s t into eq 27 and solving the following implicit equation 31 1 2 d 1 1 d 3 ε d s s e p s t b p f to deal with non proportional loading the forming severity concept proposed by bai and wierzbicki 2008 was adopted the accumulation of the necking indicator is defined as follows 32 d d d s s e d ε p ε d s s e p r η localized necking occurs if d d s s e reaches unity however to distinguish the membrane and bending loading it is postulated that localized necking can occur if all integration points through the thickness in the z direction fulfill the necking criterion i e d d s s e z 1 z t 2 t 2 where t is the shell element thickness in the numerical implementation of dsse a shell element is deleted only if all through thickness integration points satisfy the localized necking condition note that with this formulation localized necking does not occur under pure bending the key assumption made by pack and mohr 2017 is that the displacement to fracture in large thin walled structures predicted with shell finite elements is taken as the displacement to the onset of localized necking the size of the localized necking is usually in the order plate thickness if the global displacement of the plated structure as reported in the force displacement curve is much larger than the plate thickness the difference between the displacement to the onset of the localized necking and the displacement to fracture initiation is very small alsos et al 2008 therefore the onset of localized necking may be assumed to be the failure state in summary the dsse hc model for the shell element assumes three types of failure fracture preceded by localized necking in the biaxial tension domain fracture not preceded by localized necking surface cracking and failure under shear dominated loadings in the low stress triaxiality domain the first one is predicted using a localized necking criterion which is extended for non proportional loading paths using the forming severity concept and distinguishes the membrane and bending loadings by considering the fulfillment of the necking condition in all of the through thickness integration points in this sense dsse is a non local failure criterion the second and third failure conditions can be conveniently predicted using the hc model where the stress at an individual integration point is set to zero when the fracture condition is satisfied hence hc is a local failure criterion for example surface cracking under pure bending loading can be predicted when the through thickness integration point at the extreme of the tension side satisfies the hc fracture criterion the dsse hc fracture model is included in the above mentioned vumat subroutine we used the vumatxtrarg subroutine together with the vumat subroutine such that essential information regarding the implementation of the dsse i e array of internal element numbers and section point numbers through thickness integration point number are accessible in the vumat subroutine in the vumat subroutine the damage indicator and failure condition are evaluated for through thickness integration points not for elements by using the vumatxtrarg subroutine the state variable associated with the failure condition due to localized necking of each through thickness integration point can be accessed and then evaluated for each element a failure state variable for the through thickness integration points is defined which is set to one if the localized necking condition is satisfied otherwise it is kept as zero for five through thickness integration points for an element the stress components of all through thickness integration points are set to zero i e full degradation of the element occurs if the sum of all failure state variables equals to five if this condition is not satisfied the stress components of individual through thickness integration points are not affected the default element removal condition in abaqus is that an element is deleted if the stress components of all through thickness integration points are zero by default abaqus checks the failure condition at each through thickness integration point separately and at failure sets its stress components to zero regardless of the other through thickness integration points in that particular shell element it is clear that the default procedure is useful for modeling bending induced surface cracking and through thickness crack propagation where the through thickness integration point on the outmost layer of the tension side will fail first and fully degraded followed by the other through thickness integration points above the plastic neutral axis for membrane stretching induced localized necking the procedure we implemented where the element is treated as a whole ensures that only membrane loading is considered 3 5 dsse hc model parameter identification the hc model has three parameters to be identified namely a b c these three parameters require at least three different tests such as tests with pure shear central hole and notched tension specimens kõrgesaar et al 2018 however for k240 z only a standard dog bone tension test result is available cerik et al 2019a identified a b c for s235jr grade general purpose structural steel using the test results reported by kõrgesaar et al 2018 the s235jr grade steel is a mild steel and its hardening characteristics are comparable to those of the k240 z grade steel therefore we decided to adopt the hc model parameters of the s235jr grade steel fig 3 shows the hc fracture locus under a plane stress condition using the parameters obtained for s235jr these parameters were then employed in the vumat subroutine to simulate the k240 z dog bone specimen with the element removal option activated fig 4 shows a comparison of experimental and numerically predicted engineering stress strain curves it is evident that the agreement between the test and the numerical results is satisfactory as described in the previous section the parameter d can be easily identified using the hardening function of the material all parameters identified for the implementation of the dsse hc model are listed in table 3 fig 5 shows the hc fracture locus under a plane stress condition along with the localized necking envelope defined by the dsse note that both are valid only for proportional loading paths the damage parameter is utilized to consider non proportional loading paths 4 simulation of penetration test 4 1 description of reference test the ship like structure test geometry designed by karlsson et al 2009 was used as the reference structure in ringsberg et al 2018 it resembles the typical double hull side shell structure of a ship subjected to a collision load where the bulbous bow of the striking ship penetrates the struck ship structure to fit the test object to the testing machine the object was scaled to one third of the size of a similar full scale ship structure the detailed description and analysis of the experiment have been presented by hogström and ringsberg 2012 karlsson et al 2009 and ringsberg et al 2018 fig 6 presents the schematic representation and a photograph of the experiment involving a double hull penetrated by a solid half sphere the test object consisted of one outer and one inner shell web stringer sheets web stringer beams and stiffeners in the form of l profiles the global dimensions l w h of the structure were 1500 mm 1090 mm 300 mm and the sheet thickness was between 3 mm for the thinnest elements and 5 mm for the thickest structural elements to establish well defined boundary conditions a reinforcing rigid frame was designed around the structure fig 7 shows the geometry and dimensions without the reinforcing frame the reinforcing frame was welded around the test object and along its edges to create clamped boundary conditions and to ensure well controlled failure modes of the structure the lower part of the frame was welded to a rigid fixture four displacement transducers were positioned in two directions on the supporting frame and fixture the transducers measured the frames deformations to ensure that the fixtures deformations during the tests were negligible fig 8 shows the experimental setup where two of the displacement transducers are shown at the front and to the left of the test object as mentioned earlier the test object was manufactured using k240 z shipbuilding mild steel the indenter was a solid rigid half sphere with a radius of 135 mm and made of ss2541 grade steel friction tests without lubrication have been carried out by karlsson et al 2009 who demonstrated that the kinematic friction coefficient is 0 23 0 01 under the contact conditions considered in this study additionally the test object was mounted onto a press machine with a load capacity of 20 mn to relax the residual stresses caused by welding the test objects sheets to the support frames the indenter was pushed perpendicularly to the load and unloaded the structure at low speed for ten times in this loading sequence the magnitude of the load was within the elastic region of the material the indenter penetrated the structure with a constant displacement rate of 4 mm s the collision point was located at the center of the double hull see fig 8 and the loading direction was perpendicular to the upper sheets surface the experiment was interrupted when the lower sheet was fully penetrated by the indenter throughout the experiment the resultant force in the load cell the position of the indenter and the displacement transducers in the rigid frames were monitored and recorded the total calculated measurement uncertainty for the maximum force was less than 1 the reported uncertainty corresponded to a confidence interval of approximately 95 around the measured value for more details see karlsson et al 2009 4 2 finite element modeling the finite element fe model used for the test object was developed using the geometry file used in ringsberg et al 2018 which defined the geometries of the test object the indenter and the reinforcing frame the welds were not considered in the fe model the indenter was modeled as a rigid body and was allowed to move only in the direction perpendicular to the upper sheet at a constant displacement rate fig 9 shows the fe model excluding the rigid indenter the stiffened panel penetration tests were simulated using the abaqus explicit software package and by employing the developed vumat subroutine the target structure was meshed with four node reduced integration shell elements s4r in the abaqus element library five through thickness integration points section points and default hour glassing were chosen convergence analyses were carried out to determine the optimal mesh size of the fe model the primary element size of the elements in the parts of the structure that underwent failure and fracture in the numerical simulation was 15 mm it should be noted that the selected mesh size is not too large to resolve strains adequately if an element size larger than 15 mm is used the simulations do not follow the deformation buckling and fracture behavior observed in the tests particularly after the rupture of the upper plate in addition the use of localized necking condition as a failure criterion for shell elements requires that the elements are much larger than the width of neck which is usually in the order of plate thickness the adopted mesh size which is 3 t satisfies this condition the target structures material were assumed to have a young s modulus e and poisson s ratio ν of 206 gpa and 0 3 respectively the material density ρ was taken as 7 85 t m 3 the lower part of the reinforcing frame which was welded to a rigid fixture was assumed to be fully clamped the punch was modeled with rigid elements r3d4 in the abaqus element library and positioned such that it hit the center of the upper plate the contact between the punch and the stiffened panel was modeled with the general contact algorithm in abaqus explicit this contact algorithm enforces the contact constraints using a penalty contact method which searches for node into face and edge into edge penetrations the tangential contact behavior was modeled using a friction coefficient of 0 23 and penalty type formulation the normal contact behavior was modeled with a hard contact pressure overclosure to save computation time the indenter speed was higher in the fe analysis in comparison with the physical experiment although it did not exhibit any dynamic effects the punch was forced to penetrate through the stiffened panel at a constant rate of 5 m s the simulation was run until the indenter penetrated the lower plate fully this corresponded to a displacement of 500 mm moreover the strain rate effect on hardening was not included 4 3 comparison with test results the accuracy of the adopted ductile fracture model was evaluated using the force displacement curves with emphasis placed on predicting the displacements to fracture at the upper and lower plates t beam and associated force levels with these events fig 10 shows the comparison of the numerically predicted force displacement curve with the test result and indicates the important events observed in the numerical simulation note that the first and second peaks correspond to the penetration of the upper and lower plates respectively as can be seen the overall trends observed in the test results were predicted fairly well in particular the instant and peak lower plate penetration forces were captured accurately it is noteworthy to mention that the latter were mostly overestimated by the participants of the benchmark study ringsberg et al 2018 in this study the stiffness of the structure was slightly underestimated before the upper plate ruptured this was obvious after the tripping of the t beam attached to the upper plate of the target structure because of this divergence from the test results the onset of upper plate rupture and the sequential events were not predicted well in the numerical results the force decreased suddenly after the upper plate ruptured and the t beam fractured on the other hand in the test these events were followed by a smoother decrease in force moreover the force levels that were predicted numerically after the rupture of the upper plate were larger in comparison with the test results lastly the agreement between the numerical predictions and the test results was completely lost after the indenter displacement was approximately 450 mm identifying the cause of this discrepancy was not straightforward because the numerical simulation did not indicate any major event that could cause the force to remain constant and eventually drop to an indenter displacement of approximately 487 mm 4 4 remodeling of hardening and new results to improve the accuracy of the numerical prediction and also to address the effect of uncertainty in the yield strength of the material further simulations were performed with a different hardening curve the majority of the benchmark study participants adopted the given yield stress for the nva grade steel 290 mpa which resulted in better agreement between the numerical predictions and the test results prior to the rupture of the upper plate in comparison with the present study it is evident that the assumed yield stress of 227 mpa for the tested structural material caused the earlier tripping of the t beam in the numerical simulation hence the hardening curve was modified with an initial yield stress value of 290 mpa a yield plateau which was present in the provided stress strain curve was also included fig 11 shows the modified hardening curve the dsse model parameter was identified again by considering the modified hardening curve as d 1 67 with regard to the hc model parameters further calibration was not necessary because the modified hardening curve was much closer to that of s235jr kõrgesaar et al 2018 cerik et al 2019a fig 12 shows the force displacement predicted with the modified hardening curve as can be seen the agreement between the numerical predictions and the test results improved significantly with the exception of the force level associated with the rupture of the lower plate table 4 lists the indenter displacement values corresponding to the important events shown in fig 12 and compares them with the test and mean benchmark study results with this comparison the accuracy of the adopted numerical model was verified and the numerical simulation results obtained with the modified hardening curve will be discussed below 5 discussions from the force displacement curves it is obvious that the accurate prediction of the sequence of events involved in the deformation and failure process of the struck structure largely depended on properly modeling the fracture initiation both the displacement and force at the time of fracture initiation in the upper and lower plates subjected to biaxial stretching and partially on the failure of the girder t beam right below the impact location in addition the discrepancy in the tested material properties reported by karlsson et al 2009 is evident as the reported tensile test results for the 5 mm plate yields somehow incorrect behavior for the web of the t girder our argument is that at least the web of t beam has a higher yield strength than that of 5 mm plate likely to be in the order of the yield strength of nva grade steel the significant uncertainty in the material parameter input and as shown a simulation sensitivity to the assumed material behavior should be noted nevertheless we will first discuss the deformation and failure process of the structural components and describe how the adopted fracture model handles the non proportional loading paths and the effect of the through thickness strain gradients fig 13 shows the deformation and failure process of the upper plate where the contour plots denote the stress triaxiality η necking indicator d d s s e and damage indicator for the ductile fracture d h c in this figure the right column shows the upper surface of the plate while the left column shows the lower surface an inherent characteristic is that the stress state in the highly deformed area is close to but not exactly the equi biaxial tension in both plate surfaces the necking indicator accumulates much faster than the ductile fracture damage indicator the different damage and necking indicator values for the top and bottom surfaces clearly demonstrate that a certain degree of bending deformation is involved fig 14 shows the stress state and the necking and fracture damage indicators at the time of the first element removal at this stage the membrane deformation is dominant and the difference between the damage indicators at the two extreme surfaces disappear it is obvious that the failure was caused by localized necking to demonstrate the effect non proportional loading paths and bending deformation the variation of stress triaxiality and the damage indicators with increasing equivalent plastic strain were extracted from the numerical simulation results fig 15 shows the loading paths and damage accumulations for the through thickness integration points at the top and bottom surfaces of the first removed element it is evident that the failure process of the plates under punch loading involves non proportional loading paths and bending deformation particularly in the initial loading stages the two extreme layers of the plate are subjected to different stress states and different amounts of plastic straining therefore the equivalent plastic strain values at failure are also different the upper surface integration point satisfies the failure condition i e d d s s e 1 slightly earlier than the lower surface integration point the element is removed when all through thickness integration points satisfies the failure condition fig 16 shows the loading paths of the top and bottom integration points and the localized necking envelope in the same graph the stress states of the integration points throughout the loading and the non proportionality of the loading paths are shown here more clearly in this junction the relative success of the constant equivalent plastic strain criterion which was used by the majority of the benchmark study participants can be explained by examining fig 16 in the benchmark study the most commonly adopted constant values of the equivalent plastic strain ranged from 0 26 to 0 35 it is not surprising that these values are close to the final equivalent plastic strain values of the upper and lower surface integration points as shown in fig 16 hence if we ignore the non proportionality of loading paths and the bending deformation effects by adopting a constant equivalent plastic strain as the failure criterion the fracture initiation in biaxially stretched plates may be predicted with reasonable accuracy however a few questions arise how can we determine the critical equivalent plastic strain without referring to the localized necking limit which is closely associated with the hardening curve of the material does mesh size scaling have a rational basis for determining this constant value does the assumption of constant equivalent plastic strain as a failure criterion still yield a reasonable prediction of fracture initiation for structural members subjected to stress states other than biaxial stretching and experiencing highly non proportional loading paths to clarify these issues we conducted further analysis with a fracture initiation criterion using a constant equivalent plastic strain of 0 35 in abaqus this criterion can be applied by using the ductile damage option the damage initiation criterion is defined by setting the fracture strain as 0 35 for all possible stress triaxialities and strain rates the damage evolution option in abaqus which is activated after the damage initiation criterion is satisfied and causes softening by decreasing the element stiffness gradually was not used hence the displacement at failure which must be defined in the damage evolution option was set to zero with these options the ductile damage model in abaqus was implemented such that an element was removed if all of the through thickness integration points in a shell element reached the equivalent plastic strain value of 0 35 fig 17 shows the obtained force displacement curve as can be seen there was no significant discrepancy between the numerical predictions and the test results except for the instant when the lower plate ruptured the lower plate was subjected to impact on the side of the stiffeners where the stiffeners deformed not only because of contact with the indenter but also because of contact with the t beam after it was broken hence the deformation and failure of other structural members has to be evaluated in detail fig 18 shows the plots of the stress state and damage indicator for localized necking and fracture at the time of the first element removal for the t beam the web of the t beam buckles and folds as the denting progressed this causes significant stress state variations but the dented area is essentially in compression and the parts next to it are subjected to biaxial stretching eventually failure occurs in the latter part due to localized necking as can be seen in the necking and fracture damage indicator plots experimental evidence with regard to the failure mode is not reported by karlsson et al 2009 however in a relevant study noh et al 2018 demonstrated that the webs of t frames subjected to lateral impact exhibited localized necking at highly strained locations in the present simulation further indentation causes the flange to rupture the flange of the t beam deflects further in the lateral direction along with the indenter fig 19 shows the state after the t beam broke the failure process of the t beam as predicted with a constant equivalent plastic criterion is much different fig 20 shows the failure process of the t beam with an equivalent plastic strain contour plot the fracture initiates at the folded part and propagates in the direction of indentation when the t beam is completely broken most of the elements in the dented area are deleted contrary to what is shown in fig 19 the flange deflects sideways finally we investigated the failure of the lower plate fig 21 shows the stress state and damage indicators at the time of the first elements failure at the lower plate fig 22 shows the loading path and the damage accumulation of the necking indicator as extracted from the upper and lower surfaces of the first failed element the fracture initiates on the plate in the vicinity of the plate stiffener intersection the loading path of the upper surface is almost proportional but the lower surface exhibits significant non proportionality and satisfies the failure condition at a much later time as shown in fig 23 the fracture first propagates in the direction of the stiffener and a secondary crack path forms during the final stage in the direction perpendicular to the stiffeners the location of fracture initiation that was predicted by the constant equivalent plastic strain criterion is again at the plate stiffener intersection and on the upper side of the lower plate fig 24 shows the equivalent plastic strain plots on the lower plate at the time of the first element removal and at the final state as shown in figs 23 24 the failure of the lower plate in both cases may start similarly fracture near a stiffener but they do not appear to end similarly it can be argued that the sideways deflection of the t beam is the source of discrepancy in the predictions with the constant equivalent plastic strain criterion this causes less indentation to the lower plate stiffener hence the plate stiffener intersection is less strained lastly the mesh size effect on the predicted deformation patterns and instants of fracture instants were assessed fig 25 shows the force displacement curves obtained using different mesh sizes it is clear that a mesh size larger than 15 mm which is 3 t cannot capture the deformation and fracture of the t beam correctly there are slight differences between the predictions obtained using the mesh sizes less than 15 mm but overall trends are very much similar it should be noted that decreasing the mesh size to 10 mm does not alter the failure mechanism of the structural components i e localized necking preceded fracture is predicted in all members in this study it was demonstrated that the failure caused by the localized necking preceding the ductile fracture is more relevant in the large deformation and eventual rupture process of plated structures subjected to punch loading therefore accurate localized necking models and material characterization are necessary to conduct a reasonably accurate simulation of ship collision and grounding damage moreover we emphasized the non proportional loading paths and the through thickness strain gradient effects the adopted hc dsse fracture model is simple yet capable of addressing these important points to further challenge its predictive abilities future work should consider the fracture caused by different accidental loadings such as moving loads and plate tearing or cutting where shear failure may be observed 6 conclusions a detailed numerical study was performed with the target structure chosen as the side shell collision model used in the marstruct benchmark study we described a step by step procedure that includes the plasticity and ductile fracture model parameter identification and successful application of the calibrated fracture model with shell elements to a problem that is of particular interest to the ship collision and grounding research community the following conclusions were drawn the adopted hc dsse model provided accurate estimates of the displacement to fracture initiation in a complex steel plated structure penetrated with a rigid hemisphere it was noted that the failure caused by the localized necking preceding the ductile fracture was more relevant in this particular scenario this observation is not limited to plating subjected to punch indentation but also regards girders and other secondary stiffening members using the loading paths extracted from the numerical simulations with the hc dsse model it was demonstrated that stress state varied significantly throughout the deformation of the panel and stiffening members additionally the effect of bending deformation was evaluated by considering the loading paths of the through thickness integration points this effect was observed to be particularly important in the initial stages of the deformation of the stiffened panels the accuracy of the constant equivalent plastic strain criterion was interpreted by using the calibrated localized necking envelope for the test model material it was concluded that a constant equivalent plastic strain value between the strains applied to the localized necking under proportional plane strain and equi biaxial tension may yield an accurate prediction of fracture initiation in the biaxial stretching of the plates by a hemispherical punch however failure under complex loading paths which involve compression such as in the case of web buckling and folding requires more advanced fracture models to assess the accuracy of the fracture models rather than single plates or stiffened panels test models resembling actual ship structures are far more appropriate zhang et al 2018 kõrgesaar 2019 it is important to evaluate the performance of fracture models not only by considering failure caused by plate stretching but also by considering the complex interaction between the structural members after the rupture of the outer shell the benefits of adopting concepts from the field of sheet metal forming distinguishing failure modes damage indicator framework for localized necking and ductile fracture for example will be much more obvious in simulations using these test models future research should focus on material characterization that is the identification of localized necking and ductile fracture model parameters for commonly used shipbuilding steels these include particularly high tensile strength steel grades ah32 dh32 ah36 dh36 and eh36 cerik et al 2018 cerik 2018 cerik et al 2019b park et al 2019 which are more widespread in large modern ships as compared to mild steel grades a d and marine grade aluminum allots cerik 2017b a the predictive capabilities of the combined localized necking and ductile fracture models should be explored under different loading conditions such as plate tearing and moving loads quinton et al 2017 experimental tests with sharp indenters and novel structural
